Each sub-folder within this folder contains a document collection from a different source (4 different sources in total, which constitute the Search Dataset of Assignment two):

1. Financial Times Limited (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994): ft ;
2. Federal Register (1994): fr94 ;
3. Foreign Broadcast Information Service (1996): fbis ;
4. Los Angeles Times (1989, 1990): latimes.

Under each of the above four sub-folders, there are two "readme" files: readchg.txt and readmefb.txt, which introduces the organization and formating information of the correponding collection. 

The sub-folder dtds contains files to decribe the SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) that used to formating the documents in each collection.
