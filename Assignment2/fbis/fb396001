POLITICIANS,  PARTY PREFERENCES 

   Summary:  Newspapers in the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
   Macedonia have published the results of opinion polls, 
   indicating the relative popularity of politicians, 
   political parties, and attitudes toward the political system. 

   The 22-23 January edition of the Skopje newspaper VECER in 
Macedonian published on pages 6-7 the results of an opinion poll 
conducted by the "BriMa" agency in November 1993. According to 
VECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but 
the paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of 
error.  For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results 
of an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval/disapproval 
ratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were: 

                                           November 1993    May 1993 

Kiro Gligorov, President of the Republic      76/15           78/13 

Vasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian          50/36           43/37 
   official in Federal Yugoslavia 

Ljubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister         50/42           42/43 

Stojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman          48/41           48/39 

Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister            46/41           44/38 

Vlado Popovski, Defense Minister              41/41           36/37 

Stevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister           40/43   No Data Given 

Petar Gosev, Democratic Party leader          34/53           40/42 

Todor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian     32/53   No Data Given 

Nikola Popovski, Social Democratic            29/46           32/42 
   Party parliamentarian 

   VECER noted that President Gligorov's very high approval rating 
of 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70 
percent among respondents between 18 and 24.  Residents of Skopje 
ranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the 
ranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski, 
Andov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola 
Popovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski. 

   The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency 
for Public Opinion Research and published "exclusively" by the 
Skopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov's substantial lead 
in popularity among political figures.  According to the 31 December 
1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by 
means of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of 
Macedonia during 20-24 December. PULS also provided data from 
surveys made in March, June, and September for comparison.  Some of 
the following percentages are approximate values that were derived 
from the graph published by the paper: 

                         March       June      September    December 

Kiro Gligorov             87          82.33      89.33           89

   On pages 6 and 7 of its 15-16 January issue, VECER also published 
the results of a November 1993 survey on party preferences. 
"BriMa," working with the Gallup organization, interviewed 1,036 
people. 

   Question: "If elections were held today, for which party would 
you vote?" (all numbers are percentages) 

SDSM (Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia)  22.8 
VMRO-DPMNE                                      11.2 
Democratic Party (DP, led by Petar Gosev)        6.3 
Socialist Party                                  3.3 
Liberal Party (LP)                               3.2 
Workers Party                                    2.9 
PCERM (Party for the Full Emancipation of 
    Romanies in Macedonia)                       1.8 
Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonia           0.8 
MAAK                                             0.3 
Another party                                    4.0 
Undecided                                       18.6 
Would not vote                                   6.6 

   VECER noted that some parties fared better in certain cities than 
their overall scores indicate.  For example, the DP was about twice 
as popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the 
capital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7 
percent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the 
Bregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially 
higher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall. 

   Question: "Do you have confidence in the following parties?" (all 
numbers are percentages) 

              Yes           No       Do Not Know 

SDSM           28           51          21 
VMRO-DPMNE     15           72          14 
LP             19           59          22 
PDP-NDP*       20           73           7 

*Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party 

   The poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little 
confidence in any of the parties currently active in the country. 
Respondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country 
to have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20 
percent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were 
correlated with party preferences, producing the following results: 
Of those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections 
soon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80 
percent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79 
percent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80 
percent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14 
percent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very 
important which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it 
was somewhat significant.

INTRODUCTION 

       This guide is intended to help users of Foreign Broadcast 
Information Service (FBIS) translations assess the value and 
reliability of media sources in the countries or regions of the 
former Yugoslavia.  It provides key information about the media 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, Slovenia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(incorporating Serbia and Montenegro).  Wherever possible, an 
at tempt has been made to identify affiliations or reliably 
reported connections between media sources and governmental or 
communal leadership groups. 

   All media identified in this guide are monitored by FBIS, but 
in some cases, due to wartime conditions, receipts have been 
irregular and the information provided in the guide may be 
incomplete.  Characterizations, where provided, are based on FBIS 
analysis of editorial content.  Entries are grouped by region, 
and, within regions, by category: publications, radio, 
television, and news agencies.  The "sourcelines" cited at the 
beginning of each entry are the descriptors used by FBIS to 
identify media sources of FBIS translations.  Sourcelines are 
composed of three elements--the place of origin of the medium, 
its name, and the language it uses.

maintained an independent editorial policy and was frequently 
sharply critical of the authorities.  It has become less critical

government-controlled institutions bought a controlling interest

of its management.

<TEXT>
SUMMARY 

                                 Pyongyang's response to the latest South Korean proposal for 
resumption of inter-Korean talks seems to reflect an effort by 
the North Korean regime to score polemical points against the 
South and its ongoing preference for negotiating with Washington 
over Seoul on the nuclear issue. 

                            END SUMMARY 

   Apparently violating a recent DPRK-U.S. agreement, Pyongyang 
countered Seoul's proposal for a 1 March working-level contact 
with a later date, a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at 
gaining some perceived polemical advantage over Seoul.  According 
to Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief 
delegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone 
message to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 
March.  Pyongyang's attempt to delay the North-South meeting for 
two days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached 
with Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks.  The 
25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 
February, specified 1 March as the date the following will take 
place "simultaneously": 

   + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year's 
running of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent 
to Seoul's decision. 

   + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear 
inspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. 

   + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss 
exchanging of special presidential envoys. 

   + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level 
bilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. 

   Pyongyang's Motives In proposing a later date for North-South 
contacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about 
appearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear 
inspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but 
Washington on the nuclear issue.  In the latest attempt to 
portray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper 
Nodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President 
Kim Yong-sam for allegedly acting "as if he receives U.S. reports 
on DPRK-U.S. talks" and "as if he controls the talks" (Pyongyang 
radio, 28 February).  Kim creates this impression, the commentary 
added, even though "he is not even qualified to join the talks." 

   Pyongyang's reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance 
was also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North 
Korea expressed in commenting on Kim's 25 February press 
conference commemorating the first year of his presidency. 
Departing from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal 
attacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean 
dialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped 
abuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a "traitor," a 
"puppet," and a "political mountebank," accusing him of "arch 
crimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression," and 
promoting national "division and confrontation," and  of plain 
"stupidity."  KCNA went on to claim that Kim's remarks about the 
probable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal 
for an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that 
his "criminal" policy "against the North" had been wrong.  The 
party paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed 
Kim's "preposterously absurd remarks" (Pyongyang radio). 

   DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet 
with Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming 
talks with Washington.  Although monitored Pyongyang media have 
not commented on the news of the upcoming high-level bilateral 
talks, Ambassador Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission 
to the United Nations, was depicted in South Korean media as 
being optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations. 
In an interview with the Seoul daily Hangyore Sinmun (28 
February), Ho termed it "fortunate" that Washington, "although 
belatedly," withdrew "unjustified preconditions" to resumption of 
the high-level talks, thus paving way for "a package solution" of 
"not only the nuclear issue, but also other issues now standing 
in the way of diplomatic normalization. 

   Implications Pyongyang's contrasting media treatment of 
Washington and Seoul indicates that the North Korean leadership 
continues to prefer the United States as partner for nuclear 
negotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the South to the 
minimum required to fulfill preconditions to resumption of high- 
level talks with Washington.

The     following summaries highlight information from articles that 
appeared in the Algiers French- and regional Arabic-language press 
in January and February. 

   Liamine Zeroual's Image Favorable 

   A report in the Arabic-language Doha (Qatar) daily AL-SHARQ of 3 
February states that the public views newly elected President 
Liamine Zeroual as a very shrewd and experienced military man who 
can return Algeria "to the days of Boumedienne."  According to the 
report,  Zeroual is seen as the man who can end the confrontation 
between the Islamists and the nationalists since he effectively 
pushed for dialogue and reconciliation when he was defense minister. 
Zeroual reportedly considers nationalism inseparable from Islam as 
part of his new national order:  "Zeroual goes back to the origins 
of the Algerian revolution when nationalism embraced Islam during 
the battle for independence.  In the sixties the two diverged. 
Nationalism embraced socialism and Islam was marginalized.  When 
socialism failed, Islam came back forcefully."  Zeroual has 
reportedly created a positive image through his efforts as defense 
minister to deal in a positive manner with both the (Islamic 
Salvation Front) FIS and the regime.  As a result, FIS leader Rabah 
Kebir says his party anticipates that Zeroual will change policy, 
but not necessarily replace government officials.  According to the 
report, Kebir's statement indicates that the FIS is becoming more 
flexible and wants to undertake serious dialogue with authorities, 
particularly in light of the communications that took place before 
and after the National Dialogue in January. 

   Influx of Refugees in the South Provokes Concern 

   French-language Algiers daily EL WATAN of 10 and 23 January has 
reported that Algerian Tuareg frustration and anger is growing in 
Tamanrasset because of the high number of illegal foreigners (mainly 
from Niger, Mali, and Ghana) who reportedly outnumber Algerians in 
the region.  The Tuaregs hold these foreigners responsible for 
increasing crime rates, attacks against tourists, and drug 
trafficking which weakens the economy and creates a security problem 
in the region.  Hadj Moussa Akhmokh, a prominent Tuareg authority, 
says a 1992 plan to improve regional security was unsuccessful and 
that "the situation has become worse."  In December, for example, 
the two national firms National Company for Mining Research 
(SONAREM) and Center for Energy Research (CREM) were looted and 
several vehicles were stolen. In addition, customs officials from 
Tamanrasset were kidnapped by a group of individuals armed with 
Kalashnikovs, robbed, and taken to Niger where they were manhandled 
before being released. According to Hadj Akhamokh, the more recent 
kidnapping of 18 Tuaregs (10 Algerians and eight Malians) set a 
"serious" precedent and was the 
"last straw." Citizens planned a peaceful march to demonstrate their 
anger and to attract the attention of authorities until Hadj 
Akhamokh convinced them to postpone the march.  Hadj Akhmokh stated 
the Tuaregs have responded to his appeal, but that they are 
"impatient," and are waiting for the government to take control of 
the situation. 

   According to Hadj Akhamokh, smuggling is also a serious problem. 
He faults local police for participating in the corruption and 
allowing it to continue.  Food shipments intended for the local 
population are being purchased and resold for twice the price across 
the border, including milk which has been unavailable in the markets 
for "months."  According to Hadj Akhmokh, "smuggling has grown to 
proportions that the Tuaregs can no longer tolerate. To starve the 
people is to push us to revolt." (See FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE FB PN 
93-151 "Regional Census Prompted by Security, Economic Concerns," 8 
April 1993, and NEAR EAST SOUTH ASIA REPORT 93AFO622B "Illegal 
Immigrants in South; Census Unreported," 12 May 1993 p 11 for 
additional reporting on this subject.) 

   'Terrorists' Exert Pressure; Press, Lifestyle Threatened 

   EL WATAN of 16 January reported that "terrorist threats" have 
promoted a climate of fear in the town of Meftah, "imposing a life 
style that has nothing to do with Algerian society."  According to 
the report, Meftah and Medea have become towns which immerse 
themselves more and more in Islamic, even "fundamentalist," 
tendencies.  For example, the article stated that tracts posted 
throughout Meftah threaten that women who do not wear the hijab and 
who wear Western style clothes will "have to deal with us."  In 
addition threats have been made against beauty salons, Moorish 
baths, and cassette vendors.  "Fundamentalists" have also attacked 
the press, declaring it "unsuitable reading."  EL WATAN reported in 
three articles from 16 to 18 January that newspaper vendors and 
bookstores in Blida, Medea, ChIef, and El Khemis were no longer 
selling newspapers.  According to EL WATAN of 16 January, national 
publications, particularly those of the independent press, have 
suddenly disappeared from the shelves due to "terrorist threats." 
One citizen reported, "Don't use my name, but I am afraid to tell 
you that tobacco shops and bookstores are scared to death. They are 
convinced that if they continue to sell newspapers there could be 
serious reprisals."  EL WATAN of 17 and 18 January reported that 
vendors have denied the threats, blaming distributors for failing to 
deliver the newspapers.  Nonetheless, security services have ordered 
merchants to sell newspapers or be shut down. 

   Citizens Reportedly Buying Visas 

   An article in the French-language daily ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 19 
January recounted the frustrations of dozens of Algerians trying to 
obtain French visas.  Given the evening curfew, many spend the night 
in nearby hotels or in the elevators or hallways of neighboring 
buildings.  According to the report, lines can begin as early as 4 
a.m., causing citizens to resort to purchasing a place in line for 
500-1000 dirhams, depending on the position in line and the time it 
is purchased.  In the words of one citizen, "It is a real stock 
exchange."  The French consulate reportedly closed for two days and 
suspended issuing visas in an effort to set up a new system whereby 
visa requests would be handled through the mail.

SUMMARY 

                                Russian officials have tried to minimize the impact on U.S.- 
Russian relations of the arrest of Aldrich Ames and his wife on 
charges of spying for the USSR and Russia against the United 
States.  Joined by Russian media commentators, they have 
criticized the involvement of high-level U.S. officials in 
publicizing the case, saying that the case involves normal 
espionage activity that all countries pursue.  In addition, 
Russian media across the political spectrum have viewed U.S. 
handling of the incident as evidence of a U.S. desire to 
marginalize Russia's international role. 

                            END SUMMARY 

   In their initial public statements on the Ames case, Russian 
officials have consistently tried to minimize the incident's 
impact on U.S.-Russian relations.  They have decried the 
publicity given to the case by high-level U.S. officials, saying 
that incidents such as the Ames case should be handled by 
intelligence agencies without involving officials at higher 
levels: 

   -- According to ITAR-TASS on 24 February, Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said that it would be better to let the intelligence 
services handle the case and "not to politicize or ideologize the 
situation."  He emphasized that it is important for the United 
States and Russia to continue to "cooperate and not to attach 
undue, hypertrophied significance to this case."  After the 
Russians expelled a U.S. Embassy officer in retaliation for the 
U.S. expulsion of a Russian Embassy official in Washington, 
Kozyrev reiterated these views and claimed Moscow "had to resort" 
to a reciprocal expulsion but this process of "reciprocity" 
should be eliminated, "the sooner the better" (ITAR-TASS, 28 
February). 

   -- A 25 February Foreign Ministry press statement sniped at U.S. 
handling of the case, criticizing "attempts by the special 
services to drag the political leadership into their mutual 
relations," and noted that there are "appropriate channels" that 
can be "brought fully" into use to deal with such cases.  The 
statement said that if, as reported, the investigation of Ames 
had begun ten months ago, "this was sufficient time for us to be 
contacted directly" and for U.S. officials to "share their 
anxieties with us before making them public" (ITAR-TASS, 25 
February). 

   -- Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) officials refused 
to comment directly on Ames, but expressed surprise that the 
United States made such an outcry over actions FIS officials 
described as common practice for all intelligence services.  FIS 
director Yevgeniy Primakov had "no comment" on the case (ITAR- 
TASS, 23 February).  FIS press spokesman Yuriy Kobaladze noted 
that declining to comment on such allegations is the general 
practice among intelligence services and stressed "there is 
nothing new or sensational here in the fact that countries engage 
in intelligence activities" (Moscow radio, Russian TV, 23 
February).  He went on to claim that neither the United States 
nor Russia had "ever pledged to curtail intelligence activity" 
and that Washington has "been very active" in intelligence 
activity in Russia and the other newly independent states. 

   Breaking ranks, at least temporarily, with other officials, 
Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, 
acknowledged Ames' links to Russia but later retracted this 
admission.  A 26 February ITAR-TASS report quoted Kolesnikov as 
saying "Ames worked in the UnitedStates for Russia" but 
nonetheless claiming that he had "inflicted no direct damage" on 
the United States.  On 28 February, however, Kolesnikov stated 
that the General Staff and its intelligence service "have no 
information on any links" between Ames and Soviet or Russian 
intelligence agencies.  According to ITAR-TASS, Kolesnikov went 
on to claim that "U.S. media misinterpreted" his 26 February 
statement (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). 

   Russian Media 

   Russian media across the political spectrum indignantly 
criticized U.S. handling of the case and speculated, sometimes on 
the basis of comments by unnamed officials, that the United 
States had ulterior motives in timing the public exposure of 
Ames.  Some commentators said that U.S. officials had exposed the 
case now because they wanted to create a pretext to reevaluate 
U.S.-Russian relations in the wake of the recent slowdown of 
reform in Russia, while others alleged that the United States 
wanted to take the gloss off Russia's diplomatic success in 
brokering a compromise over Sarajevo.  Media commentary, even in 
publications like Izvestiya, a strong supporter of Russian 
efforts to integrate with the West, supported the Russian 
government position and criticized the United States: 

   -- A 24 February article in Izvestiya remarked on what it saw as 
the "hypocrisy" of U.S. reaction to the Ames case, since, it 
claimed, Russia "has no less right to secret operations in the 
United States than America has to espionage in Russia."  A 25 
February article on the case headlined the question "Why Is 
Washington Making a Fuss?" and cited "competent sources" as 
speculating that the Ames' arrest was an attempt to put Moscow in 
its "place" after Russian diplomacy in Bosnia for the first time 
in recent years "cast the United States in a secondary role." 

   -- A 25 February article in the government newspaper Rossiyskaya 
Gazeta worried that the Ames case is being given "political 
overtones" reminiscent of the 1960 U-2 incident, which triggered 
a sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations.  The article claimed 
that "certain forces" in the United States were trying to 
"exaggerate this affair" because they are unhappy with the new 
Chernomyrdin government and with Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, 
which had "thwarted the hawks' attempt to resolve the Serbian 
question through air strikes" and had "suddenly and very sharply" 
increased Russia's "political weight in the international arena." 
The article concluded, however, that both the U.S. and Russian 
presidents were demonstrating a "well-balanced approach" and 
expressed hope that political relations between the two countries 
would not be aggravated. 

   -- A 25 February article in the Defense Ministry's newspaper 
Krasnaya Zvezda cited several theories advanced by unnamed 
"experts" to explain the U.S. "ballyhoo" over the case.  The 
article claimed U.S. intelligence agencies wished to get even 
after the exposure of more than 2O foreign intelligence agents, 
including U.S. spies, in the last year.  An article on 26 
February charged that the "fuss" over the "routine event" of a 
double agent's exposure is taking on an "increasingly hysterical 
character" in the United States, claiming with obvious sarcasm 
that "Langley believes that only [its agents] have the right to 
carry out intelligence activity."  Prominent Krasnaya Zvezda 
observer Aleksandr Golts, in a commentary published on 1 March, 
implicitly took issue with this analysis, however, claiming 
instead that it is Russia's newly demonstrated foreign policy 
independence that has "driven Washington berserk."  Golts 
contended that the United States is publicizing the Ames case 
because Russia's efforts to "implement an active foreign policy 
course" with its "successful initiative in the Balkans" had put 
the United States "on the sidelines" after it had become 
accustomed to "feeling that it is the only world leader, the only 
superpower."  He concluded by advocating the "vital necessity" of 
a "partnership" with the "rules of conduct. .. the same for 
everyone. 

   -- The independent pro-reform newspaper Segodnya, in a 24 
February article, warned that the Ames case would revive the "old 
outcry" that the "Russians cannot be trusted."  The article 
linked the case to Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, particularly his 
proposal for a summit on the issue.  Claiming that Yeltsin's 
summit proposal would be "inconvenient" for Western leaders, the 
article implied that the Ames "scandal" had been whipped up to 
"remove the Russian initiative from the agenda."  A 1 March 
article cited unnamed sources as saying that Russian security 
services "are not interested in arousing passions," but that 
"influential U.S. forces" are hoping to "impose a time-out" for 
the United States to reexamine its policy toward Russia. 

   -- In an interview published in the 26 February edition of the 
labor-oriented newspaper Trud, retired KGB Major General Boris 
Solomatin, citing examples of other spy cases where there was no 
official outcry, bitterly ascribed what he called Washington's 
"inappropriate reaction" to the Ames affair to U.S. "imperial 
thinking" about Russia.  Lamenting that Russia had been 
"transformed" from an equal power whose intelligence services 
could work against those of the United States to one which now 
"has to ask permission to do so," Solomatin complained that the 
U.S. attitude is "we can, you cannot" because "we have the money" 
and "you have an outstretched hand."  Contending that the United 
States had not given much thought to the possible consequences 
when it "embarked on this scandal," Solomatin claimed that now, 
when Russians see that the "big bucks" spent on intelligence are 
"working," they will recognize the importance of intelligence and 
begin to "organize it properly." 

   Implications 

   The pains taken by Russian officials to play down the Ames affair 
and to minimize its effect on U.S.-Russian relations clearly 
indicate Moscow's desire to keep the relationship on a firm 
footing.  However, the indignant reaction on the part of both 
officials and the media to the U.S. handling of the case, as well 
as the sensitivity displayed toward perceived attempts to 
relegate Russia to a marginal role in diplomacy or intelligence 
activities, indicates that Moscow will continue to assert itself 
when it feels that the United States is trying to take unfair 
advantage.

SUMMARY 

                        Using his decree power to reorganize the media bureaucracy, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has consolidated his control over 
the broadcast media and attenuated the influence of the other 
branches of government and the cabinet.  At the same time he has 
taken the first step in what is likely to be a far reaching, if 
reversible, reduction of the state's role in television by giving 
a private television company access to Russia's 4th television 
channel.  The reorganization appears to signal that longtime 
close Yeltsin adviser Mikhail Poltoranin, who once shaped 
Yeltsin's media policy, no longer enjoys the President's 
confidence in this area. 

                      END SUMMARY 

   In a series of edicts dating from 5 December, Yeltsin has 
effected a complete restructuring of state media structures and 
shuffled key media personnel consolidating his authority over 
state television, expanding private access to television 
broadcasting, and creating a potentially powerful new media 
arbitration court (see box 1). 

Begin Box 1 

Yeltsin Decrees Changes in Media Structures 

   In a series of edicts issued from 5 December to 4 January, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin reorganized state television, 
created a new media oversight body, and made major changes in key 
media posts: 

--A 5 December edict "On the Directors of VGTRK [the All-Russian 
State Television and Radio Company--RTV]" reappointed Oleg 
Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko as chairman and general director 
respectively of RTV (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva 
Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 27 December 1993). 
   --A 22 December edict "On Improving State Management in the Mass 
Information Sphere" abolished the Ministry of the Press and 
Information and the Federal Information Center (FIC), created the 
Russian Federation Committee for the Press and the Federal 
Service of Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and 
appointed Boris Mironov to head the former and Aleksandr Yakovlev 
the latter (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). 
   --A second 22 December edict "On Setting Up the 'Efir' Russian 
State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding Company and 
the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting Company" 
consolidated state control over the the national television 
broadcast infrastructure (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). 
   --A third 22 December edict "On Utilizing Moscow Television's 
Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination Network" granted 
an independent television production company, NTV, access to 
Russia's 4th channel (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). 
   --A 29 December edict "On the Court of Appeals for Information 
Disputes Under the President of the Russian Federation" which is 
linked explicitly to articles 29 and 80 of the new constitution 
granting citizens the right to "freedom of mass information" and 
making the president the guarantor of that freedom created a new 
arbitration body under the president to resolve disputes over 
television coverage and access (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January). 
   --A 4 January edict officially relieved Mikhail Poltoranin of his 
duties as head of the FIC (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). 

End Box 1 

   President's Role Strengthened 

   Several aspects of the reorganization strengthen the president's 
powers over the broadcast media.  The new television and radio 
service under Yakovlev will be subordinate to the president, 
while the edict appointing Poptsov to head RTV extends Yeltsin's 
appointment powers to an area once held by the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium.  The creation of 'Efir' consolidates state control 
over the television broadcast infrastructure under a presidential 
appointee, and the new information appeals court gives the 
president a potentially great advantage over the other branches 
of government in determining the political slant and content of 
television programming. 

   Profile Lowered 

   By giving the new press committee and broadcast service sub- 
cabinet rank and moving out Mikhail Poltoranin and Vladimir 
Shumeyko, two favorite targets of his opponents, Yeltsin appears 
to be attempting to move the media and media policy away from the 
front lines of the political struggle.  Poltoranin, as chief of 
the now defunct Federal Information Center (FIC), and Shumeyko, 
as head of the now abolished Ministry of the Press and 
Information both held ministerial rank but neither of the heads 
of the new bodies has ministerial rank or cabinet status. 

   New Bodies' Powers 

   The reorganization gives the new broadcasting service the 
preeminent role in regulating broadcast media, eliminating 
overlapping responsibilities that existed under the former 
structures.  From the FIC the broadcast service inherits the 
functions of "coordinating" state policy for television and 
radio, assisting in the provision of "objective" information to 
domestic and international audiences on Russian political and 
economic issues, and participating in the process of drafting 
legislation on the broadcast media.  From the Press and 
Information Ministry the service inherits responsibilities for 
implementing state television and radio broadcasting policy and 
for television and radio licensing and registration.  The service 
also has authority to administer government financing and 
subsidies for national and regional television (Rossiyskiye 
Vesti, 24 December 1993) but its authority has been severely 
circumscribed by the Ministry of Finance (see box 2).  The 22 
December edict names the Committee on the Press the legal 
successor to both the Ministry of Press and Information and the 
FIC but does not elaborate its functions in detail.  It 
presumably will assume the FIC and press ministry functions that 
relate specifically to the press.  The edict does explicitly 
establish that the committee will administer government financing 
and subsidies, formerly a prerogative of the press ministry. 

Begin Box 2 

   Finance Ministry Cuts Television Budget 

   On 1 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that acting Finance 
Minister Sergey Dubinin had recently "notified representatives of 
Ostankino and Russian Television . . . of a 50 percent cut in 
financing."   The decision, if not amended, could have a 
devastating impact on both the television companies and the 
Ministry of Communications which broadcasts the television 
signals and depends heavily on state television for its own 
revenues.  Russian Television General Director Anatoliy Lysenko 
predicted that the funding cuts could force transmitter shutdowns 
and lead to the "loss of the broadcasting network on a large 
territory of Russia" (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 29 January).  It is 
not clear if the ministry's decision to slash funding is a first 
step in a policy of reducing state ownership, as Yakovlev and 
others have advocated, or if state television simply served as a 
convenient target of opportunity in the finance ministry's 
struggle to control the money supply. 

End Box 2 

   Poltoranin Routed 

   Aspects of the reorganization strongly suggest that Poltoranin, 
once the most influential figure in the Yeltsin administration in 
shaping media policy has suffered a startling defeat at the hands 
of his rival for influence Shumeyko.  According to Yuriy Baturin, 
Yeltsin's security adviser and a co-drafter of the existing law 
on the mass media, Yeltsin, Shumeyko, and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin jointly agreed to the terms of the 22 December edict 
"On Improving State Management in the Mass Information Sphere" 
(Izvestiya, 29 December 1993).  That edict provided for separate 
commissions to liquidate the Press Ministry and the FIC but 
appointed Shumeyko to head both.  Poltoranin also appears to have 
lost a battle over the edict granting NTV access to channel 4, a 
move which he reportedly opposed.  Despite his removal as FIC 
head, Poltoranin will continue to be involved in media policy- 
-possibly even in opposition to Yeltsin--as head of the Committee 
on Information Policy and Communications in the State Duma (ITAR- 
TASS; Rossiyskiye Vesti, 19 January).  But, for the first time 
since before Yeltsin was elected president, (See Note 1) 
Poltoranin will not have the authority to directly influence the 
administration's media policy or to advise the president in an 
official capacity. 
(Note 1) With the exception of a brief hiatus from 25 November 
1992 when he stepped down as Minister of the Press and 
Information to 25 December 1992 when he was appointed head of the 
newly created Federal Information Center.  Poltoranin was 
appointed Minister of the Press and Information 10 July 1990 by 
the RSFSR Supreme Soviet. 

   Yakovlev's Vision for Television 

   Yeltsin's appointment of "the father of glasnost" and former 
close Gorbachev adviser Aleksandr Yakovlev to head the new 
broadcasting service sends ambiguous signals about his intentions 
regarding the broadcast media.  Yakovlev once served as the head 
of the CPSU Central Committee's propaganda department and yet has 
been credited as the architect of the glasnost strategy to 
liberalize the Soviet media.  Although he has a reputation as a 
reformer he does not appear to advocate westernization of Russia 
or unrestricted freedom for the media.  In an Izvestiya interview 
(24 December) following his appointment, Yakovlev stated that he 
would refrain from "influencing" subject matter but rather play a 
"strategic" role as Ostankino chairman.  At the same time, 
however, he expressed hope that the company will be able to 
fulfill its role in society "without succumbing to extremes" and 
on another occasion he spoke of increasing "the share of Russian 
programs" as a "counterweight" to foreign productions, and 
criticized excessive sex and violence--generally attributed to 
foreign influence--on television (RRIA, 2 February).  He has also 
apparently agreed recently to introduce a new weekly program on 
Ostankino in which Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey 
Filatov will "explain" presidential edicts (Mayak Radio, 31 
January). 
   Yakovlev's appointment may signal future reductions in the 
state's role in television.  He has asserted that there "must be 
one state television company" which would operate without paid 
advertising instead of the four companies (See Note 2) that exist 
now (RIA, 2 February).  This goal appears to go hand-in-hand with 
the recent decision of the finance ministry to cut funding (see 
box 2) and may indeed become the ultimate solution to the state's 
difficulty financing state television at current levels. 
Realization of Yakovlev's goal of having one non-commercial state 
television company could also provide a financial shot in the arm 
to non-state television since it would become the only vehicle 
for television advertising. 
(Note 2) The four are Ostankino, RTV, Channel 4, and the St. 
Petersburg Channel. 

   Yakovlev's Deputy 

   Valentin Lazutkin, a longtime television professional who appears 
to share Yakovlev's views on reducing the state's role in 
television has been appointed as Yakovlev's deputy.  With 
Yakovlev taking a "strategic" approach to his chairmanship, 
Lazutkin, who has spent nearly 30 years in television, and served 
as first deputy chairman at Ostankino until his recent promotion 
will presumably run day-to-day operations at Ostankino.  Asked in 
a recent interview published in Izvestiya, (21 January) about his 
opinion on the recent change in leadership, he expressed the 
"hope" that "we need not fear that Ostankino's airspace will be 
turned into the political property of a particular party, which 
happened under the former chairman."  He also noted that he was 
"untroubled" by the recent decision to grant the private 
production company NTV access to the fourth channel (discussed 
below), though he did criticize the fact that access to the 
channel was not granted on a "competitive" basis.  And finally, 
discussing his concept of the future of state-run television, 
Lazutkin said there "should be one powerful Russian company which 
is . . . part of the state structure" and he advocated 
transforming Ostankino into a company aimed at foreign audiences 
(including Russian-speaking viewers in the CIS). 

   NTV Gains Broadcast Access 

   In what may be the first step towards realizing Yakovlev's vision 
of decreasing the number of state television companies, Yeltsin 
granted television broadcasting rights on channel 4 to an 
independent company, NTV.  The 22 December edict "On Using Moscow 
Television's Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination 
Network" states that NTV will receive 58 hours of weekly 
broadcast time as an "experiment" aimed at "developing non-state 
television."  NTV has been broadcasting a nightly news program, 
Segodnya, and a weekly newsmagazine, RItogi, to viewers of the St. 
Petersburg channel, which has a potential audience of about 70 
million viewers, and will continue to do so.  The significance of 
the edict for NTV does not appear to be that it increases 
potential audience size since the two channels have significant 
audience overlap but that it secures a measure of independence 
from St. Petersburg Television. 
   Most importantly the NTV edict affirms Yeltsin's support for the 
idea of independent television following an apparent tug-of-war 
within the administration.  Yeltsin first issued the edict on 22 
November but suspended it the next day (ITAR-TASS, 22 November 
1993; 23 November 1993).  On 22 December Yeltsin reissued the 
edict in almost identical form except that the new version tasked 
the government with reviewing the issue of "state participation" 
in the ranks of the founders, making this text even more 
privatization-oriented than the original. 

   Control of TV Infrastructure 

   In the reorganization, Yeltsin reaffirmed that the state will 
retain its monopoly of the broadcast infrastructure, at least for 
the present.  The edict of 22 December "On Setting Up the 'Efir' 
Russian State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding 
Company and the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting 
Company" created the Efir holding company, whose assets include 
much of the state's broadcasting infrastructure.  Efir will be 
partially privatized, with employees receiving some shares, but 
the edict stipulates that the state will retain ownership of a 
controlling interest for three years.  The edict does not 
specify, however, what the state will do with its controlling 
interest after three years.  The edict appointed Lazutkin to 
serve as chairman of Efir's board of directors.  Baturin 
criticized the creation of Efir (and the reorganization in 
general) which he claims "increases the state's control over the 
mass media" and even "to a certain extent threatens freedom of 
the press" (RIzvestiya, 29 December 1993).  Noting that "all 
central television channels are broadcast" through Efir, Baturin 
asserted that independent television companies will "remain non- 
state only in formal terms." 

   Control over RTV 

   The reorganization also serves notice that the other major 
national television company, RTV, will remain under Yeltsin's and 
Yakovlev's control.  Control of the company had been a prolonged 
point of contention between the President and the former Supreme 
Soviet.  In a demonstration of his authority over RTV, Yeltsin 
re-appointed the current chairman and general director, Oleg 
Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko, by the edict of 5 December. 
Formerly, according to Russian Television's Statute, the right of 
appointment to these posts was held by the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium (Sobrianiye Aktov Pravitelsta RSFSR, No 6, 1991). 

   Poltoranin Admirer To Head Press Body 

   The 22 December edict reorganizing the media structures appointed 
Boris Mironov, former head of the Rossiya Publishing House and 
apparent close friend and admirer of Poltoranin as chairman of 
the new Committee on the Press.  According to a profile of 
Mironov from Obshchaya Gazeta, Mironov had previously worked for 
Komsomolskaya Pravda and with Poltoranin when the latter served 
at Pravda.  Mironov reportedly also served for "several days" as 
chief editor of Rossiyskaya Gazeta but was removed prior to or 
shortly after publication of the paper's inaugural issue in 
November 1990 (Obshchaya Gazeta, 14-20 January; Rossiyskaya 
Gazeta, 6 November 1993).  According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta's 
current chief editor, Natalya Polezhayeva, Mironov was removed 
"on the personal orders" of then Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman 
Ruslan Khasbulatov. 

   New Media Watchdog Created 

   Yeltsin's establishment of the Court of Appeals for Information 
Disputes under the president appears to be an attempt to preempt 
the new parliament from "interfering" in media policy as did its 
predecessor (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January).  The court is a 
successor to the Information Arbitration Court that was created 
during the recent parliamentary election campaign to ensure fair 
media coverage with largely the same membership, including 
chairman Anatoliy Vengerov.  During the campaign, Vengerov and 
the court demonstrated a degree of independence from Yeltsin by 
ruling that campaigning against the draft constitution was 
permissible, explicitly opposing Yeltsin's stated position that 
sought to prohibit such campaigning (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993; 
Izvestiya, 27 November 1993).  The court's powers include the 
authority to resolve disputes over the distribution of airtime 
among parliamentary factions.  It is also charged with ensuring 
"objectivity and authenticity" in news reporting and the 
"principle of pluralism" in radio and television programming, and 
may issue warnings regarding potential violations of the media 
law, a power it inherited from the defunct Ministry of the Press 
and Information.  Despite the court's record of independent 
action, the edict makes it dependent on the president stipulating 
that it "is not part of the system" of Russian Federation federal 
courts, and the new body's statute gives the president the power 
to appoint and fire its members (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February). 

   Prospects 

   Yeltsin has crafted a reorganization of Russian media structures 
that seems simultaneously to open the door to relinquishing 
direct control over increasing amounts of broadcast airtime while 
maintaining presidential control over the main facilities of 
state television and the process of media oversight.  The new 
parliament may challenge Yeltsin for control of at least some 
media--there is already talk among deputies of reasserting 
control over Rossiyskaya Gazeta which the dissolved Supreme 
Soviet controlled (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 5 January).  Yeltsin is 
likely to strongly resist such attempts and may invoke his 
enhanced constitutional authority to do so.  He may also 
calculate that more western-style media independence is the best 
way of ensuring that the media keeps supporting reform and stays 
out of his opponents' grasp.  At the same time economic reality 
as manifest by the recent one-day widespread broadcast blackout 
and the Finance Ministry's decision to cut television funding by 
50 percent will likely encourage him to move towards granting 
more and more air time to independent television companies as he 
has done with NTV and channel 4.

SUMMARY 

                           Syrian media reacted to the massacre in Hebron by intensifying 
criticism of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP) and 
the PLO itself and reviving more hostile anti-Israel rhetoric 
reminiscent of the years preceding the current peace 
negotiations.  At the same time, despite the Arab suspension of 
bilateral peace talks with Israel and the use of Syrian media to 
question the benefits of resuming them without further Israeli 
concessions, Damascus has taken pains to signal its commitment to 
the overall peace process. 

                        END SUMMARY 

   Syria's closely controlled media have portrayed the 25 February 
massacre as a direct product of the DOP, implying that the event 
serves to vindicate Syria's opposition to the agreement.  In this 
context, the media have stepped up criticism of the PLO 
leadership for signing both the DOP and a subsequent document on 
its implementation, which was concluded in Cairo on 9 February. 
A Damascus radio commentary declared that the "massacre must be 
directly or indirectly laid at the door of the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements and whatever other pact may follow."  It criticized 
"Palestinian negotiators" for having "forgotten Israel's crime- 
ridden track record" and being "too trustful and unsuspecting, 
thereby facilitating" the killings in Hebron (26 February).  As 
reported by Damascus radio the following day, an editorial in the 
daily Al-Ba'th called the massacre "the end result" of "the 
flawed and lame agreement" concluded between Israel and "the 
Palestinian negotiators." 
   Moreover, in a revival of the volume and virulence of media 
criticism of the PLO that followed the signing of the DOP in 
September, Syrian media have given substantial coverage in the 
wake of the massacre to anti-PLO statements by hardline Damascus- 
based Palestinian groups.  For example: 
   --The official news agency SANA quoted Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command leader Ahmad Jibril as 
implicitly threatening the lives of 'Arafat and other mainstream 
PLO leaders (See Note 1).  Calling the massacre a "fruit of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement," Jibril declared that "the determination 
of our Palestinian Arab people and Arab and Islamic nation will 
punish those who conceded our sanctities, territories, and 
history" (27 February). 
   (Note 1) Jibril's threatening statement echoed his declaration on 
30 September that "'Arafat's fate will be no better than that of 
French General Petain during World War II" (Damascus radio). 
   --Damascus radio, reporting on a "mammoth popular demonstration" 
in the Palestinian camp al-Yarmuk organized by the hardline 
factions, quoted Islamic Jihad Movement Secretary General Fathi 
al-Shaqaqi as calling the massacre "a continuation of the 
liquidation plot embodied in the Gaza-Jericho accord" (28 
February). 

   Anti-Israel Vitriol 

   Syrian media have also reverted to the kind of virulent anti- 
Israel rhetoric that was a staple of Syrian commentary in the 
past but had been used with less regularity at least since the 
start of the current peace process in October 1991.  Thus, 
commentaries in the wake of the massacre have very frequently 
favored the term "Zionists" and "Tel Aviv rulers" over "Israel" 
and "the Israeli government."  Claiming that the Hebron bloodbath 
was simply the most recent of a long series of Israeli massacres- 
-alleged to have included the 27 February church bombing in 
Lebanon (for example, Damascus radio, 27 February)--the 
commentaries have declared bluntly that the killings are 
consistent with the nature of Zionism and demonstrate the 
impossibility of Arab-Israeli "coexistence."  Several 
commentaries in the daily Tishrin, as reported in same-day 
broadcasts by Damascus radio, followed in this vein: 
   --On 26 February an editorial claimed that the Hebron massacre 
"proves the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and 
Israelis resulting from the fascist Zionist rancor against the 
Arabs." 
   --An editorial the following day declared that, through the 
recent massacre, "Zionism is addressing a message that it has not 
changed . . . its racist and aggressive colors." 
   --An editorial on the 28th claimed that "Zionism and racism . 
thrive on rivers of blood" and referred to Israel as "this racist 
Nazi Zionist ghoul." 

   Commitment to Peace Process, But ... 

   Nevertheless, Damascus has taken pains to emphasize commitment to 
the peace process, while using the media to question the utility 
of resuming the now-suspended talks in the absence of significant 
concessions by Israel--a tack it has taken during previous 
disruptions in the negotiations.  The Damascus radio announcement 
of the suspension of bilateral peace talks in Washington by 
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan was quick to cite a Syrian spokesman 
as having "confirmed statements by U.S. officials that this step 
does not mean an end to the whole peace process that began two 
years ago" (28 February). 
   Two subsequent media commentaries that referred to the suspension 
of talks also took pains to convey that the suspension is 
temporary and to stress that Syria remains committed to the peace 
process.  Damascus radio, affirming that "the Arabs are advocates 
of true peace," declared that "the suspension of talks will not 
harm the peace talks, especially since only a few days are left 
before the conclusion" of the current session (1 March).  And the 
daily Al-Ba'th on the same day followed up mention of the 
suspension of talks by adding that the Arabs are not "terminating 
the peace efforts" but are "in effect telling the sponsors of the 
peace process to wake up to their responsibilities" (Damascus 
radio). 
   At the same time, some editorial commentary has cast doubt on the 
usefulness of negotiations under current conditions and called on 
Washington to play a more vigorous role in pressing Israel for 
concessions (See Note 2).  For example, Damascus radio declared 
that "talking about peace in light of the serious Zionist 
escalation and Israel's continued refusal to withdraw from the 
occupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of 
time," adding that "it is, indeed, absurd."  The commentary 
concluded that "there is no purpose or meaning in holding any 
peace talks that are not based on a clear Israeli commitment to 
implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from 
the occupied Arab territories" (28 February).  As reported by the 
radio, a subsequent editorial in Al-Thawrah asserted that 
"salvaging the peace process and the stalled peace talks requires 
the application of all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it 
honor the relevant international legitimacy resolutions and 
conventions, respect human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm 
settlers, and return to the Arabs all their territories and 
rights" (2 March). 
   (Note 2) Such expressions of doubt, and even the conditioning of 
resuming the talks on Israeli concessions, have appeared 
periodically in Syrian media commentary since the beginning of 
the peace process.  For example, an editorial in Tishrin last 
November declared that "any resumption of the peace talks"--which 
had not then convened since before the signing of the DOP--must 
be preceded by a clear and public Israeli commitment to the peace 
process and its principles, especially full withdrawal from the 
Arab territories" (Damascus radio, 20 November 1993).  Several 
weeks later, however, Damascus announced its intention to return 
to the peace talks, without any public commitment from Israel on 
the issue of withdrawal (Damascus radio, 9 December 1993). 

   Implications 

   Although Damascus is probably hoping that the attack will scuttle 
the DOP, Syrian media's anti-PLO attacks and shrill, hostile 
rhetoric on Israel will likely subside, though not disappear, if 
peace negotiations are brought back on track.  Moreover, in 
raising claims that coexistence is impossible, Syrian media took 
care to rule out coexistence not between Israel and the Arab 
states but between "Israelis and Arabs" --presumably in the 
occupied territories.  By such behavior, Syria has ensured that 
the door remains open to the eventual resumption of the peace 
talks.

   $35 Million Tourism Publicity Campaign in the Works 

   The Tourism Ministry is planning to launch a $35 million 
advertising campaign this year to attract tourists and to "offset 
Egypt's declining tourism income."  Tourism Minister Dr. Mamduh al- 
Biltaji, who pointed out that last year's campaign was no more than 
$3.1 million, said that this year "the ministry's departments are 
devoted to drawing up two programs for stimulating Egyptian 
tourism."  The overseas program seeks to increase foreign demand 
and, as al-Biltaji said, restore Egypt's "place in new and 
traditional markets" by endeavoring to "allay fears caused by recent 
terrorist operations against tourists and by foreign media 
exaggerations of these acts."  He also said that the ministry has 
begun thorough inspections of its overseas tourism offices "in light 
of new developments."  Under the motto "Tourism is the engine of 
development driving Egypt's economy," the domestic program "aims at 
raising tourism awareness among Egyptians, making them realize that 
they have a direct stake in promoting tourist activity."  The 
ministry "intends to spend the earmarked funds for advertising on 
television networks and tourist magazines in Europe and the United 
States."  (London AL-HAYAH 19 Jan 94) 

   Minister Announces Plans to Expand Tourism Market 

   Dr. Mamduh al-Biltaji announced ministry goals to "open new 
tourism markets" in the Far East and South Africa following a 
meeting with the president of South Africa's Union of Tourism 
Companies.  He added that Cairo had agreed to hold a general 
assembly for the South African union this September.  The minister 
also confirmed plans to run "an additional flight between Seoul and 
Cairo effective this month to handle increasing tourism activity 
from Korea and the Far East to Egypt."  (Cairo AL-AHRAM AL-DUWALI 17 
Jan 94) 

   Governor Unveils 1994 Banking System Goals 

   Central Bank Governor Isma'il Hasan affirmed that "banks will 
play a larger role in the capital market in order to stimulate the 
stock market by promoting bond protection, establishing investment 
funds, and encouraging companies to explore the securities market 
for long-term financing."  He added that mid and long-term 
government securities will be issued to provide these firms with 
"new capital which will yield some success in terms of liquidity, 
security, and rising profitability."  All of this, he said, will be 
tied to equipping bank employees in Egypt and abroad with "the 
latest banking industry skills" through bank institute vocational 
programs conducted last year for 3,414 employees.  The governor 
mentioned these and other generally defined goals during his 
discussion of 1993 banking achievements.  (Cairo Al-AHRAM AL- 
IQTISADI 17 Jan 94) 

   "World's Second Largest Defense Electronics Firm" To Develop 
Communications System 

   French electronics firm Thomson-CSF has agreed to "design and 
install a state-of-the-art radio communications system in Egypt" at 
an approximate cost between 3O and 7O million francs.  The company's 
commercial director, Jean Madi Lafakiyuri, said that the project, 
"considered to be the first of its kind in Egypt," will comprise 
three stages: "the first covers the Greater Cairo area; the second, 
Alexandria and the northern Cairo district; and the third, southern 
Egypt."  Once completed, the system, Lafakiyuri said, "will be used 
in urban projects, as companies, banks, and police departments will 
be allowed to use it, and for air traffic control purposes."  He 
also said that "the increased cost of this project will be covered 
by the protocol signed by Egypt and France, as was done previously 
when Thomson-CSF installed the same system in Portugal, Switzerland, 
Turkey, and Morocco."  (London AL-HAYAH 19 Jan 94) 

   Meat Importers, EC Middlemen Flood Market with "Spoiled" Meat 

   Centrist opposition daily AL-WAFD criticized Egyptian meat 
importers and distributors, labeling them "the mafia", and EC meat 
distributors for deals that are resulting in the saturation of local 
markets with "sizeable quantities of overpriced frozen meat 
available from European storage facilities that has expired or is 
near its expiration date", thereby exposing Egyptian consumers to a 
range of health hazards.  The newspaper's two-part investigative 
report on this subject published on 23 and 24 January included 
comments from Egyptian health officials and meat industry 
representatives.  According to AL-WAFD, this "spoiled" meat is said 
to frequently exceed international standards fdr fat content and is 
available at extremely low cost to local importers, and, 
consequently "the meat is sold at from LE 7 to LE 10 whereas the 
import cost is only LE 1."  Due to the profit margin available from 
sales to Egypt, European distributors and Egyptian middlemen are 
reportedly mounting a campaign against the Egyptian Government "to 
pressure the Egyptian government into raising the fat content of 
imported meat from 2O percent to 35 percent; in other words, for 
every 1000 kgs of meat, the fat content is 350 kgs."  AL-WAFD 
continues, "This pressure by distributors extends even to EC 
officials, to the point that one official has threatened to halt 
meat shipments to Egypt."  In an effort to circumvent government 
controls, importers reportedly further conceal the fat content of 
foreign meat imports by selling the meat piecemeal, thereby 
invalidating import certificates. 

   Egyptian health experts interviewed by AL-WAFD expressed concern 
about the illnesses that can result from the consumption of such 
meats, ranging from heart disease to salmonella.  They said that the 
availability of this meat will have a direct impact on the public's 
health. Of particular concern is the plethora of factories producing 
inexpensive luncheon meats primarily from frozen imported meat. 
Health officials pointed not only to the spoilage of this meat but 
also to the carcinogenic additives used by local companies to retard 
it.  Further compounding this problem is the storage issue: "Egypt's 
biggest problem is an inadequate number of refrigeration units to 
store meat and retard bacterial growth in butcher shops and meat 
suppliers' facilities." 

   Industry experts also maintained that factories and shops must 
comply with existing standards and specifications; however, they 
acknowledged that "the first step is to guarantee the quality of 
imported meat."  While Egypt reportedly has procedures in place to 
guarantee the quality of imports upon arrival, elimination of the 
"meat mafia" requires "enforcement of (existing) food laT?s."  AL- 
                                                        ? 
WAFD has asked the ministers of health and industry to "confront the 
demands of the distributors" and wondered whether "the health and 
manufacturing agencies will carry out their role."  (Cairo AL-WAFD 
23, 24 Jan 94) 

   Suez Canal Bridge Planned 

   President of the Suez Canal Agency Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil 
announced that an agreement had been concluded with Minister of 
Transportation Sulayman Mitwalli to begin construction of a bridge 
over the Suez Canal to further development in the Sinai and ease the 
growing transit traffic in the area. At present the bridge will not 
include a railway bed due to technical difficulties.  The four-lane 
bridge will be at least 60 meters high.  Japanese officials have 
been contacted for some technical assistance on this project. 
(London AL-HAYAH 27 Nov 93) 

   Foreign Staffing Restrictions Lifted 

   According to an official from the Power and Employment Ministry, 
restrictions on foreign businesses that limit employment of foreign 
employees to 10 percent of the total office manpower are being 
lifted.  The new measures reportedly will also apply to small 
enterprises and to family businesses.  The stated purpose of the 
change is to encourage foreign investors to develop projects in 
Egypt and create more job opportunities overall   (Cairo MENA 8 Feb 
94) 

   Minister Comments on Privatization Program, Employment 

   Speaking before the People's Assembly Economic Affairs Committee, 
Dr. 'Atif 'Ubayd, minister of the public business sector and 
minister of state for administrative development and environmental 
affairs, commented on the privatization program and emphasized that 
"there will be no rush to sell public sector companies so that 
workers' rights may be protected."  Under the current program, 
"revenue from the sale will be used to reform the company's 
financial structures, settle bank loans, and reinvest the remaining 
funds."  Reportedly, the sale of public sector companies to 
foreigners will adhere to certain specifications, intended to 
stimulate the aquisition of new technology, increase exports, and 
develop employment opportunities.  Dr. 'Ubayd stated:  "We need 
700,000 job opportunities annually in order to eliminate 
unemployment in seven years.  This requires investments totalling 14 
billion pounds, which the government cannot provide except through 
privatization."  He further cited the example of the Pepsi Cola and 
Coca Cola companies where "the net worth of the companies was around 
27 million pounds, but they were sold for 500 million pounds." 

   Dr. 'Ubayd emphasized that the government would not "rush to 
sell" and that that "there will be no monopolies under the policy of 
privatization" and that "the government will not monopolize any 
industry of which it retains ownership."  Dr. 'Ubayd added that "the 
public sector's overall capital reached 8.4 billion pounds last year 
which represents the net worth of companies where the state is a 36 
percent shareholder."  According to this report, 314 of these 
companies are in the public sector, exclusive of insurance, banking, 
and military industry companies, whose overall debt is 53 billion 
pounds.  (Cairo MENA 9 Feb 94)

Beijing     Rejects Political Compromise, Plays Down Economic 
Threats 
                           SUMMARY 
   PRC authoritative media have reacted strongly to the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council (Legco)'s adoption of the first stage of 
Governor Christopher Patten's democratic reforms and to a Hong 
Kong government "White Paper" on the contents of the aborted 1993 
China-British talks, ruling out further negotiations with the 
British and reaffirming China's previous decision to dismantle 
any political institutions based on Patten's reforms after 1997. 
At the same time, in an apparent effort to reassure foreign 
investors and avoid actions that could jeopardize the European 
Community's support for Beijing's GATT application, PRC media 
have portrayed senior Chinese leaders as backing away from recent 
threats to retaliate against British firms. 
                          END SUMMARY 
   Beijing's rejection of further negotiations with Britain over 
Hong Kong's political future was authoritatively conveyed by a 
spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State 
Council on 24 February and reaffirmed by a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman the same day.  The Chinese were reacting to the passage 
by Legco on 24 February of the first stage of Patten's political 
reforms and Patten's announcement the same day that he would 
formally submit the remainder of his reforms to Legco on 9 March 
and would publish a White Paper on the contents of the 17 rounds 
of talks with the PRC in 1993 on Hong Kong's political future 
(Hong Kong Asia television, 24 February).  Asserting that Beijing 
would make good on its previous threats to terminate negotiations 
and dismantle political institutions established without Chinese 
consent if Legco adopted Patten's proposals, the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman declared that "the door of the negotiations has been 
closed by the British side" and "the framework of the 
political system" established by Legco "cannot last beyond June 
30, 1997."  Responsibility for "the disruption of cooperation 
between China and Britain" on this issue, he said, "rests 
entirely with the British" (Xinhua, 24 February). 
   Signaling Beijing's determination to accelerate plans to 
establish its own institutions to govern Hong Kong after the 
takeover, Premier Li Peng declared on 25 February during a 
session with members of the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC)--a 
group established last summer under the National People's 
Congress to prepare for the Hong Kong transition--that the "PWC's 
burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and 
greater" and called upon the members to "work harder and make 
even greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability 
and prosperity" (Xinhua).  Similarly, Lu Ping, director of the 
State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, warned that the 
British were "trying to mislead Hong Kong people" by "spreading 
the view" that the Hong Kong government based on Patten's reforms 
"will not be terminated after 1 July 1997" and called for 
"speeding up the working pace of the PWC" (Zhongguo Xinwen She, 
26 February) 
   Countering the White Paper 
   In an apparent effort to bolster its political support in Hong 
Kong, the PRC also mounted a media campaign to discredit the 
British White Paper's version of the 1993 talks, first attacking 
its credibility and Patten's motives, then issuing its own 
version of the talks on 28 February (Xinhua).  Zhang Junsheng, 
deputy director of Xinhua's Hong Kong branch, said in a 24 
February interview that Britain's "unilateral move" to publicize 
its version of the negotiations was intended to "deceive Hong 
Kong people and mislead public opinion" (Xinhua).  On 28 
February, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, commenting on a 
lengthy Foreign Ministry version of what he claimed were the 
"facts" concerning the talks, asserted that Patten's decision to 
publish the White Paper was "designed" to "shirk its 
responsibility for the rupture of the talks" (Xinhua, 28 
February).  In the text of the document, publicized by Xinhua 
that day, Beijing reiterated its position that the "core of the 
controversy" was not about "whether democracy should be promoted" 
as claimed by the British but "whether international commitments 
should be honored." 
   Economic Reprisals Played Down 
   Despite the current political deadlock between the Chinese and 
British over Hong Kong's political future, Beijing has, at least 
for now, backed away from its recent threats of economic 
reprisals against British firms and signaled its interest in 
longterm British investment.  For example, backing away from 
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu 
Yi's 28 January warning that the British Government's 
"uncooperative attitude" on Hong Kong "is likely to affect Sino- 
British trade ties" (Xinhua, 28 January), PRC Vice President 
Rong Yiren was depicted by Xinhua on 24 February as cautiously 
optimistic about the prospects for British investment 
opportunities in China.  In a meeting that day with the chairman 
of the prominent British multinational company John Swire and 
Sons, Rong reiterated Beijing's contention that Britain's 
"uncooperative approach" was to blame for the "current 
difficulties on the Hong Kong issue," but he went on to emphasize 
that both China and the British firm were "confident" about the 
economic prospects of Hong Kong and China and to observe that 
Swire "had been enlarging its business" in the region.  Xinhua 
portrayed the British chairman as "willing" for his company to 
engage in "long-term investment in Hong Kong and the Chinese 
mainland." 
   Further suggesting a return to a more conciliatory approach on 
economic relations, top Chinese officials have assured foreign 
investors and the Hong Kong business community that its 
uncompromising attitude on political reforms in Hong Kong will 
not adversely affect economic ties.  For example, Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji reaffirmed China's commitment to the territory's 
capitalist system after the takeover during a 25 February press 
conference in Tokyo when he "reiterated" that China "will not 
change the system in Hong Kong after 1997" (Xinhua, 25 February). 
He went on to reassure the business community that "the Chinese 
Government will continue to protect the interests of foreign- 
funded firms" in Hong Kong. 
   Beijing's efforts to play down prospects of retaliation against 
British firms may be linked in part to China's desire for 
continued European Community (EC) support for its membership in 
GATT.  PRC media used the recent visit to Beijing of EC Trade 
Commissioner Leon Brittan to provide an upbeat assessment of EC 
backing for China's application to GATT.  Xinhua of 28 February 
reported that Brittan, at a joint news conference with MOFTEC 
minister Wu Yi that day, announced that it would be "economically 
beneficial" for "China and the whole world" to have China in 
GATT.  Suggesting Beijing's efforts to avoid any overt threats of 
economic reprisals, PRC media were not observed to carry Western 
media accounts that EC Commissioner Brittan--in a response to Wu 
Yi's assertion during the press conference that the political row 
with Britain could affect economic ties--warned sharply that 
retaliation against British firms would be "completely 
unacceptable" to Europe (London Daily Telegraph, 1 March). 
   Implications 
   Beijing's refusal to compromise on Patten's political reforms and 
determination to proceed with the establishment of a shadow 
government in preparation for restructuring Hong Kong's 
legislative institutions after 1997 reflects both Beijing's drive 
to ensure total political control over Hong Kong after the 
takeover and the acute sensitivity of China's ageing leaders to 
perceived threats to China's "sovereignty," including political 
pressure on senior leader Deng Xiaoping who has staked his 
reputation on reclaiming Hong Kong from its colonial past.  At 
the same time, China's decision to return to a more conciliatory 
approach on economic relations likely reflects efforts to avoid 
jeopardizing EC support for its GATT membership, and may signal a 
leadership view that, given the failure of economic reprisals to 
deter Legco from passing democratic reforms and Patten from 
submitting his remaining proposals for a vote, Hong Kong's 
stability is best served by maintaining strong ties to the 
British business community.

Hanoi     Finds New Outlet for Surplus Labor 

   Judging by a 1 March VNA report, Hanoi has found new 
opportunities for employing its surplus labor in Libya. 
According to VNA, 100 Vietnamese workers left Hanoi on 28 
February to fill jobs in Libya under a "construction contract" 
signed by Vietnam's overseas construction company VINACONEX and 
South Korea's Dong Ah Consortium.  These 100 laborers, VNA said, 
are the "first batch" of a 2,000-person contingent of 
construction workers and overseers who will be sent to Libya in 
1994 to work on a man-made river project.  These workers will 
join the 1,500 Vietnamese workers already working in Libya under 
a contract between VINACONEX and Dong Ah Consortium.  Hanoi has 
routinely sent workers overseas in order to relieve its 
unemployment problem and to help pay for needed goods.

SUMMARY 

                                  Apparently responding to domestic pressures to demonstrate more 
balance in the country's foreign policy, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev used his late January visit to China to press 
Beijing to greatly expand and deepen the Sino-Russian 
relationship and forge a "constructive partnership" between the 
two countries.  For its part, Beijing, concerned about the 
unsettled Russian political situation, appeared reluctant to 
embrace Kozyrev's initiative, suggesting instead a more modest 
expansion of bilateral ties. 

                              END SUMMARY 

   Visiting China from 26 to 29 January, Kozyrev--the first high- 
ranking Russian visitor to Beijing since the mid-December 
elections in Russia--not only reaffirmed Moscow's intention to 
maintain its relationship with Beijing but also called for 
significantly expanding those ties and creating what he called a 
"constructive partnership" between the two countries. 
Introducing this initiative at a press conference on 26 January, 
Kozyrev said a "constructive partnership" between the two 
countries would mean a "qualitatively higher-level" of bilateral 
ties (ITAR-TASS, 26 January).  Expanding on this theme in a 
speech the following day to China's People's Institute of 
Diplomacy, the Russian foreign minister portrayed the new 
relationship as a multifaceted one (ITAR-TASS, 27 January). 
Beijing and Moscow, he indicated, should cooperate in solving the 
"new problems" in Asia, focusing on the "danger" from the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies, the 
question of access to the resources of the Pacific Ocean, and the 
problems caused by an "upswing of religious nationalism" in 
Afghanistan and Tajikistan.  Kozyrev went on to underscore the 
importance of cooperation in these areas, saying that the failure 
to make "joint efforts" to resolve these problems would result in 
a "very explosive" situation.  In addition to cooperation on 
regional problems, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive 
partnership would lead to greater Sino-Russian cooperation in the 
international arena, particularly in the UN Security Council on 
problems such as peacekeeping operations in Tajikistan and 
nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. 
   Economic Relations and High-Level Visits 

   Kozyrev also pressed his Chinese hosts to raise the level of 
economic relations between the two countries, saying, in a press 
conference on 28 January, that the constructive partnership 
"presupposes" a transition to a "higher level and more stable" 
forms of economic cooperation (ITAR-TASS, 28 January).  In 
particular, he pointed to the need to change the "form" of cross- 
border contacts from "petty commercial dealings to large joint 
projects."  Elaborating on the economic aspect of his 
constructive partnership, Kozyrev, in remarks aired by Moscow's 
Mayak radio on 31 January, said that Russia would "cOunt on" 
Chinese support in getting Russia "included" in plans for 
regional economic cooperation.  In addition, he noted that Russia 
was "very interested" in participating in modernizing those 
Chinese industrial enterprises which were originally set up by 
Moscow and was "ready" to participate in major economic 
development projects like the Three Gorges hydroelectric project. 

   Finally, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership 
proposal demands increasing the number of high-level contacts 
between Moscow and Beijing.  At his 28 January press conference, 
he claimed that this aspect of his initiative had already been 
accepted, saying that his visit had "mapped out a program" of 
exchanges which would be capped by a visit to Moscow by PRC 
President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin. 

   Moscow's Positive Assessment 

   Moscow was upbeat in assessing the results of Kozyrev's visit. 
Commenting on Kozyrev's 27 January meeting with PRC Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen, for example, Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's 
political adviser, claimed that the two ministers had agreed to 
continue a "progressive and constant exchange of views and visits 
at summit and high-levels" (ITAR-TASS, 27 January).  She noted 
that Jiang Zemin would visit Moscow in the "third quarter" and 
that his visit would be preceded by trips to Beijing by Russian 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and to Moscow by Foreign Minister 
Qian.  She noted that the two sides had indicated their 
"readiness" to continue negotiating their border problems and had 
"decided" to maintain the "status quo" on the border after it had 
been demarcated.  She also claimed that the two foreign ministers 
had expressed their "mutual interest" in further developing 
"constructive cooperation" in the military-technical sphere. 

   A 29 January ITAR-TASS report on the visit was even more positive 
in assessing the results of the Kozyrev-Qian talks.  It said that 
the foreign ministers had "confirmed their mutual desire" for the 
development of political, trade, economic, and military 
cooperation and pointed to the need to raise the level of Sino- 
Russian relations.  According to ITAR-TASS on the 31st, Kozyrev 
was also upbeat in assessing the results of the visit in remarks 
while made on route to Moscow.  He claimed that with the visit 
China and Russia had established "new relations characterized by 
normal cooperation" and that the relationship now contained 
"elements of geostrategic mutual understanding."  He also 
portrayed Beijing as receptive to his proposal for a constructive 
partnership, claiming that Chinese leaders had been "very 
balanced and positive in principle" in their response to his 
initiative. 

   Cautious Chinese Reaction 

   Reflecting China's longstanding wariness about dealings with 
Moscow as well as its concern about the unpredictable political 
situation in Russia, Beijing was considerably more circumspect in 
its treatment of Kozyrev's visit and his suggestion that the two 
countries rapidly expand their relationship.  Reflecting 
Beijing's desire for a slower pace of development of bilateral 
relations, Qian, according to a 27 January Xinhua account 
of his meeting with Kozyrev that day, underscored the importance 
of "maintaining and developing long-term, good neighborly, 
friendly, mutually beneficial, and cooperative relations" between 
the two countries, but did not repeat Kozyrev's optimistic 
predictions of a rapid expansion of ties.  While Qian, in 
response to Kozyrev's call for "summit" meeting between the 
leaders of the two countries "this year," said that China 
attaches "importance" to maintaining "dialogue and contacts" 
between the leaders of the two countries, he seemed to dismiss 
the idea, pointedly noting that documents signed during Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's 1992 visit to China as still being 
carried out "step by step." 

   Judging by Xinhua accounts of their 28 January meetings with 
Kozyrev, Li Peng and Jiang Zemin also counselled a more moderate 
approach to developing bilateral ties (28 January).  Li, for 
example, was reported by Xinhua as telling Kozyrev that the 
"correct" policies agreed to during Yeltsin's 1992 visit should 
be "adhered to for a long period."   Turning to economic matters, 
he suggested that the two sides need to "proceed from reality" 
and "explore new ways" of bilateral cooperation.  Jiang similarly 
seemed to advocate a more cautious approach, telling Kozyrev that 
bilateral relations are "developing steadily" and noting that 
China's "firm and unwavering" policy is to "maintain and develop 
long-term and steady good neighborly and friendly" relations with 
Russia. 

   Like Qian, Jiang also expressed reservations about Kozyrev's 
proposal for a summit meeting this year.  According to Xinhua, 
Jiang, in response to Yeltsin's invitation to visit Russia, 
merely "expressed the hope" that the visit "can be materialized 
at an appropriate time."  However, the Xinhua report on Li Peng's 
meeting with Kozyrev did indicate that Beijing would accept a 
visit to Beijing by Chernomyrdin, noting that Li "invited" the 
Russian premier to visit China. 

   Further underscoring Beijing's more circumspect approach to the 
relationship, Chinese media reporting on the visit gave short 
shrift to Kozyrev's proposal for a constructive partnership, 
failing to report his 27 January speech to the People's Institute 
of Diplomacy outlining the initiative.  In addition, Xinhua 
accounts of Kozyrev's meetings with Qian on 27 January and with 
Jiang Zemin the following day did not indicate that Kozyrev had 
presented his proposal to them during the talks (27, 28 January). 
While the 28 January Xinhua report on Kozyrev's meeting with Li 
said that the Russian foreign minister had stated that in today's 
"turbulent world" the "constructive partnership" between the two 
sides should be "enhanced and reach new heights," it did not 
indicate that Li made any response to Kozyrev's initiative. 

   Prospects 

   Despite Chinese concerns about the Russian political situation, 
Beijing and Moscow are likely to continue expanding their 
relationship.  However, Beijing, anxious to avoid any 
entanglements or fallout from the unsettled political situation 
in Russia, will remain cautious as it proceeds in developing 
those ties.  Beijing will continue respond positively to Moscow's 
desire for greater economic cooperation.  In addition, the 
inclusion of Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov as a 
member of Kozyrev's delegation suggests that military cooperation 
will remain a key part of the Sino-Russian relationship.

<TEXT>
A     26 February VNA report on a conference on the anti-malarial 
effort in Vietnam's northern provinces suggests that Hanoi has 
made considerable progress in overcoming what the media two years 
ago had indicated was a serious malaria problem.  According to 
VNA, all three targets of Vietnam's anti-malaria program for 1993 
were met as the death rate dropped by 30 percent, the number of 
malaria sufferers fell by nearly 20 percent, and the number of 
malaria epidemics decreased by 84 percent compared to 1992.  VNA 
reported particular progress in combatting malaria in Vietnam's 
central highlands--which the report said was "one of the worst 
affected areas " --noting that the death rate in that region had 
fallen by "50 percent." 

   Despite the progress, VNA noted that Hanoi is planning to 
intensify its efforts in combatting malaria in 1994.  According 
to VNA, the government will allot 60 billion dong for the 1994 
anti-malaria campaign--an increase of 10 billion dong over 1993- 
-in hopes of reducing the mortality rate by 30 percent and the 
number of malaria outbreaks by 20 percent in comparison to 1993.

<TEXT>
SUMMARY 

                               Pyongyang has made a point of reminding Washington that linking 
the resumption of bilateral high-level talks to the exchange of 
special envoys by North and South Korea could jeopardize ongoing 
international nuclear inspections.  The North continues to signal 
its reluctance to engage the South in any substantive dialogue 
beyond the bare minimum required for the convening of the DPRK- 
U.S. talks. 

                         END SUMMARY 

   To draw attention to Pyongyang's stance, Vice Foreign Minister 
Kang Sok-chu, head of the North Korean delegation to last 
summer's high-level talks with the United States, took the 
unusual step of issuing his own "press statement"(SEE NOTE) on 4 
March.  Kang's statement claimed that there were no preconditions 
stipulated in the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement for resumption 
of bilateral talks.  The statement, carried in full by KCNA and 
Pyongyang radio the same day, also complained that Washington is 
using the exchange of envoys and IAEA inspections as 
preconditions for suspension of Team Spirit and the convening of 
high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, set for 21 March in Geneva. 

   (NOTE: A press statement is typically issued in the name of a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman.  This is only the second time Kang 
has been observed to issue a press statement of his own.  Kang 
issued a press statement last November calling for a "package 
solution" to resolve the deadlocked nuclear issue (Trends of 17 
November 1993, pages 15-17)--a step that eventually led to the 25 
February agreement.) 

   Focusing on the special envoys issue, Kang claimed in his 4 March 
statement that the 25 February agreement only mentioned 
resumption of working-level contacts to discuss the topic and not 
realization of the exchanges.  His statement also implied that 
any U.S. insistence that the envoy exchange precede resumption of 
high-level talks could jeopardize IAEA inspections.  Reiterating 
Pyongyang's depiction of Seoul as irrelevant to discussions of 
the nuclear issue, Kang contended that the South has neither 
"political wherewithal" nor "authority" to discuss the nuclear 
issue.  Implying that the North will agree to exchange envoys on 
non-nuclear issues only, Kang claimed that "only when" the South 
stops the "unjustifiable act" of trying to push its way into the 
discussion of the nuclear issue and makes a "clear switch" toward 
seeking national unification can the exchange of special envoys 
take place.  Kang said that "reintroducing unjustifiable 
preconditions"--conditions that he claimed the United States had 
tried but failed to include in the 25 February agreement--can 
been seen only as "an element capable of destroying the full 
implementation" of the agreement. 

   In a 7 March followup commentary, the party paper Nodong Sinmun 
similarly cautioned Washington against creating "artificial 
difficulties" by setting preconditions.  The commentary urged a 
"strict observance" of unspecified "principles" set forth in last 
June's DPRK-U.S. joint statement (KCNA, 7 March). 

   Inter-Korean Dialogue     In line with Pyongyang's posture, North 
Korean media have characterized the "fourth" inter-Korean 
working-level meeting on the exchange of presidential envoys, 
held on 3 March, as having made no progress.  The North Korean 
chief delegate introduced two new demands (Pyongyang TV, 3 March) 
in addition to the previously raised issues of 1) stopping all 
"nuclear exercises" and 2) renouncing the "international 
cooperative system" (Pyongyang TV, 25 October 1993)--that is, 
seeking cooperation with the United States and Japan to apply 
pressure on Pyongyang on the nuclear issue, with attendant 
references to UN-imposed sanctions.  The two new conditions are 
that Seoul: 

   + Call off its effort to bring in Patriot missiles. 

   + Withdraw "remarks" that it will not "shake hands" with the 
North, an oblique reference to the remarks South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam made last June. 

   Also suggesting that the North Korean leadership is not quite 
ready to engage the South in serious discussions, Pyongyang media 
have continued their harsh personal attacks on ROK President Kim. 
The latest attack came in a 4 March KCNA dispatch criticizing the 
remarks made by Kim to Seoul radio, which, according to KCNA, 
showed that Kim is a "heinous traitor" and a "dyed-in-the-wool 
flunkeyist."  The only sign so far that Pyongyang does not want 
to totally foreclose the avenue of dialogue for now is the fact 
that the North Korean chief delegate at the 3 March meeting 
refrained from directly naming President Kim in his remarks at 
the talks, as reported by North Korean media. 

   Background     The idea of exchanging presidential special envoys 
was first advanced by the North last May to deal with "all 
issues" related to national unification, most likely as a fall 
back position on the eve of the first round DPRK-U.S. nuclear 
talks, then slated for 2 June.  Subsequently, after much 
wrangling, three preliminary meetings were held to discuss 
procedural matters and agenda.  However, on the eve of a fourth 
working-level contact, scheduled for 4 November, the North called 
off the meeting to protest remarks by the South Korean defense 
minister, who, Pyongyang claimed, had hinted at the possibility 
of a preemptive strike against North Korean nuclear facilities 
(Yonhap, 3 November 1993).  Moreover, even while reluctantly 
agreeing to the latest round of inter-Korean contacts, Pyongyang 
has still maintained that the nuclear issue must be resolved 
bilaterally between the DPRK and the United States. 

   Implications     Although couched in tough language, Kang's 
warning against "preconditions" did not rule out the possibility 
that envoys may be exchanged before 21 March.  In fact, 
Pyongyang's stance may be designed to test Washington's resolve 
to stand behind Seoul as the latter navigates the waters of 
inter-Korean dialogue.  Therefore, while Pyongyang's hardened 
stance at the North-South talks may represent posturing for 
bargaining, its continued personal attacks on ROK President Kim 
suggests that the North is still reluctant to reach any agreement 
of substance with the South at present and is proceeding with 
inter-Korean talks solely to meet requirements for the resumption 
of high-level DPRK-U.S. talks.

<TEXT>
SUMMARY 

                                 Russian President Boris Yeltsin is carrying out yet another 
reorganization of his presidential apparatus, this time clearly 
to help him expand presidential power vis-a-vis parliament and 
the cabinet.  The new constitution pushed through by Yeltsin 
after disbanding the Supreme Soviet gives the president more 
control over the cabinet and the rest of government, and the 
current reorganization is being justified by the need to expand 
his staff to exercise these expanded powers.  The strengthening 
of the president's apparatus and especially his analytical and 
policy making staff is important for the prospects for reform 
since with a unsympathetic parliament and a less reformist 
cabinet, reform policies more than ever depend on a strong 
president. 

                        END SUMMARY 

   Since December Yeltsin has been creating new agencies directly 
subordinate to the president, adding new assistants, expanding 
the Security Council structure, and now is preparing an edict to 
reorganize and strengthen his "Administration" (the presidential 
staff).  Although he has apparently not yet signed the edict, the 
reasons for the reorganization and its main features are being 
widely reported in the press.  Administration leaders have 
claimed that the main reason for the reorganization is that 
because of the president's increased powers under the new 
constitution, he requires a bigger staff to help him initiate 
policies and run more of the government.  Administration Leader 
Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 15 February that the additional 
presidential powers in the new constitution necessitate 
reorganization of the Administration and that a new economic 
analysis service, finance and budget directorate, and 
international department are being created to help the president 
stay "well informed" on the economy, budget, and tax policy. 
Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Administration's Directorate for 
Work with Territories and Presidential Representatives, also 
stated that the Administration was to be reorganized to bring it 
into line with the new constitution (Segodnya, 19 January). 

   Reports of an impending reorganization of the Administration 
began to appear in early January (Kuranty, 5 January; Georgiy 
Satarov to ITAR-TASS on 5 January; Segodnya, 6 January; Nikolay 
Medvedev to Segodnya, 19 January).  Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 21 
January that Yeltsin would probably sign a decree reorganizing 
the Administration the next week.  Over three weeks later, the 
decree had not appeared but he again told ITAR-TASS on 15 
February that Yeltsin would sign the decree in a few days.  On 19 
February he told Interfax that Yeltsin had the proposals for the 
reorganization on his desk. 

   Split Between Filatov and Ilyushin 

   The delay was apparently caused by disagreements over two rival 
plans presented by the two main groups in Yeltsin's personal 
staff--the Administration led by Filatov and Yeltsin's assistants 
and advisers led by First Assistant to the President Viktor 
Ilyushin.  Segodnya reported on 6 January that Filatov favored a 
plan worked out by his first deputy, Sergey Krasavchenko, which 
concentrated analysis in a single center in the Administration, 
while Ilyushin backed a plan worked out by members of the 
Presidential Council to expand the role of presidential 
assistants, giving them their own analytical staffs outside the 
Administration.  Moscow News (4-10 February) also reported that 
Filatov and Ilyushin were pushing rival plans and said that 
Yeltsin had not yet chosen which to accept.  Kommersant-Daily on 
10 February reported that a compromise plan had been worked out, 
making Ilyushin "for the first time officially equal in status" 
to Filatov and strengthening the group of personal assistants, 
but accepting most of Filatov's proposals regarding the 
Administration's structure (see box on "Reorganization of 
Administration").  News reports of the disagreements apparently 
prompted Filatov and Ilyushin to appear together on the 
television news program "Itogi" on 20 February to deny that there 
had been disagreements and to declare that they have "a joint, 
agreed on version" of the Administration reorganization, which 
divides functions between the Administration and assistants. 
This compromise arrangement would appear to heighten the 
potential for conflict between the already competing parallel 
structures of the Administration and staff of assistants by 
making them even more independent, rival power bases. 

   Other Recent Changes 

   Yeltsin's effort to strengthen presidential structures has been 
evident since December in the addition of more personal 
assistants to his staff, his assumption of control over more key 
government agencies, the creation of new organs under the 
president, and the strengthening of the Security Council's 
commission structure. 

   New Assistants 

   Yeltsin has added two new reform-minded assistants (pomoshchniki) 
to his present four, who were less involved in policy, at least 
publicly: 

   --He created a new post of national security assistant and named 
outspoken reformer Yuriy Baturin to it on 6 January (Ostankino 
TV, ITAR-TASS, 6 January).  Baturin explained to Interfax (7 
January) that he would coordinate the activities of the 
intelligence, counterintelligence, and other security services. 
He had joined Yeltsin's staff as an assistant on legal and 
political matters in June (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i 
Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 7 June 1993, page 2400) on 
condition that he could continue to speak out publicly (Novaya 
Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 7 July 1993). 

   --Sociologist Georgiy Satarov, who as a Presidential Council 
member has often voiced sharp opinions to newsmen, was named 
assistant to the president on 8 February (Russian TV, ITAR-TASS, 
8 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 9 February), and he explained in 
a 12 February Ostankino TV interview that he will handle 
presidential ties with the Federal Assembly and parties and 
public organizations and constitutional questions.  He has 
occasionally riled Yeltsin with his public remarks (See Note 1) 
and told Rossiyskiye Vesti (12 February) that he feels Yeltsin 
wants him to continue to speak out independently and offer 
differing opinions. 

   (Note 1)  In October, while Yeltsin was visiting Japan, Satarov 
suggested presidential elections be held simultaneous with 
parliamentary elections, undercutting Yeltsin's stand and 
prompting Yeltsin to publicly threaten to fire him (Obshchaya 
Gazeta, 15-21 October 1993). 

   Control Over Power Ministries 

   Yeltsin has assumed more control over some key cabinet ministries 
and other government agencies, clearly strengthening his power 
over the most sensitive security and communications agencies to 
protect himself against potential challenges.  His 10 January 
edict "On the Structure of Federal Organs of Executive Power" 
listed 10 agencies which henceforth will be "subordinate to the 
president of the Russian Federation on questions put under him by 
the Russian Federation Constitution or in accord with legislative 
acts of the Russian Federation":  the Ministries of Defense, 
Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs, the Main Directorate for 
Protection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency 
for Government Communications and Information, the Federal Border 
Service, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Federal 
Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and the State 
Archive Service (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January). 

   New Presidential Organs 

   In recent weeks Yeltsin has created a number of new organs 
directly under the president, expanding the already cumbersome 
structure run directly by the president.  In some cases it is not 
clear if they add to his political- power, but for some reason the 
president considered it necessary to put them under his direct 
control rather than under the cabinet or elsewhere in the 
government.  In addition to creating the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service and the Federal Border Service 
specifically under the president in mid and late December: 

   --On 31 December Yeltsin issued an edict creating a Judicial 
Chamber for Information Disputes (Sudebnaya Palata po 
Informatsionnym Sporam) under the president (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 
10 January), which apparently can be used to strengthen the 
president's control over the media.  According to ITAR-TASS, it 
will be able to decide matters such as allotment of radio and 
television coverage to the parliament and can warn media if they 
violate the Law on the Mass Media.  Chairman Anatoliy Vengerov 
said that the chamber will enforce constitutional provisions on 
information rights and assist the president in protecting freedom 
of the press (ITAR-TASS, 5 January).  The new constitution 
"guarantees the freedom of mass information" (article 29) and 
declares the president "the guarantor" of the constitution and 
the rights and freedoms of citizens (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 
December 1993). 

   --On 18 January Yeltsin created a new post for conducting his 
dealings with parliament--the president's plenipotentiary 
representative in the Federal Assembly (polnomochnyy predstavitel 
prezidenta v Federalnom Sobranii--Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 20 January) 
and named legal specialist Aleksandr M. Yakovlev to the post 
(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January). 

   --On 12 February Yeltsin created a "Directorate of the Federal 
State Service of the president" (Upravleniye Federalnoy 
Gosudarstvennoy Sluzhby Prezidenta) under his Cadre Policy 
Council (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 February).  It is to supervise 
the new civil service. 

   --On 16 February Yeltsin created a Public Chamber 
(Obshchestvennaya Palata) under the president.  Its statute calls 
it a "consultative organ" to provide feedback from the public to 
help in preparing presidential decisions and indicates it will be 
made up of representatives of parties, enterprises, religious 
denominations, trade unions, and other organizations.  It is to 
be "coordinated" by Yeltsin's personal assistant Lev Sukhanov 
(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 19 February).  It held its first meeting on 
19 February (ITAR-TASS, 19 February). 

   --On 17 February Yeltsin created a Committee for Information 
Technology Policy (Komitet po Politike Informatizatsii- 
-Roskominform) subordinate to the president and cabinet to 
oversee creation of federal computerization systems, along with 
the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information 
(ITAR-TASS, 19 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 23 February). 

   --On 25 February Yeltsin created an Expert Legal Council 
(Ekspertno-Pravovoy Sovet) under the president--another 
consultative, part-time body.  It will be chaired by State-Legal 
Directorate Chief Ruslan Orekhov and a Moscow lawyer, Igor 
Bezrukov (ITAR-TASS, 25 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 March). 

   Security Council Expansion 

   The president's Security Council, second only to the cabinet as a 
highlevel executive body, has become more active, with new 
commissions being formed under it and those created earlier being 
activated.  Although a 1 February Yeltsin edict (ITAR-TASS, 1 
February) dropped economic officials (the ministers of the 
economy and finance) in listing the new membership of the 
Security Council--appearing to remove economic questions from its 
purview--the expansion of the council's working commissions, 
including one on economic security, appears to broaden its 
activities, rather than reduce them.  A 3 March Kommersant-Daily 
article argued that the role of the Security Council may increase 
substantially since it is the best organ for Yeltsin to use to 
govern, given the independence of the cabinet under Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and the lack of a reformist majority in the 
Duma. 

   --An Interdepartmental Commission on Information Security was 
created by a Yeltsin decree on 18 December.  The new commission 
held its first meeting on 13 January and began working on its 
"main task"--working out state policy for information security 
(ITAR-TASS, 13 January). 

   --The council's Interdepartmental Commission for Defense Security 
held its first meeting on 29 December.  Its chairman is First 
Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and members include 
deputy ministers of the economy and internal affairs, deputy 
chief of staff, and the  border guards commander (ITAR-TASS, 29 
December). 

   --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission 
on Economic Security was held on 10 January, under Chairman 
Andrey Zverev, concurrently head of the economic department of 
the cabinet (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 January). 
   --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission 
for Public Security was held on 18 January, chaired by Deputy 
Internal Affairs Minister Aleksandr Kulikov (ITAR-TASS, 18 
January). 

   --Yeltsin on 31 January signed an edict outlining the duties of 
the Security Council's Scientific Council--defining priorities 
for scientific research in the security sphere--and naming Vice 
President of the Academy of Sciences V. Purimov chairman (Mayak 
Radio, 31 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February).  Yeltsin had 
created the council with a 1 November decree (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 
3 February). 

   Implications 

   With a hostile parliament and a cabinet led by an apparently 
loyal but less reformist Premier Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin appears to 
be building up presidential structures that, aided by stronger 
presidential powers in the new constitution, will enable him to 
press reform policies on his own.  His expanding group of 
specialists, analysts, and policy-oriented assistants may enable 
him to develop more effective policies and establish better 
control over the government, more effectively competing with an 
assertive Duma or cabinet.  He has, however, reorganized his 
presidential structures before, for example, bringing Filatov in 
to strengthen his Administration in early 1993, and his staff's 
effectiveness still appears to leave something to be desired. 
Moreover, by perpetuating parallel structures--the Administration 
led by Filatov and the staff of assistants under Ilyushin--the 
new reorganization preserves great potential for competition and 
conflict within the presidential apparatus. 

   Box 

                Reorganization of the Administration 

   Although Yeltsin has apparently not yet signed an edict 
reorganizing the whole Administration, the features of such a 
reorganization have been described in accounts and charts 
published in Segodnya on 9 February and Kommersant-Daily and 
Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta on 10 February, and several edicts 
reorganizing parts of the Administration have already appeared 
(abolishing the Directorate for Information Resources in early 
February, creating a Finance-Budget Directorate on 28 February, 
and creating a Directorate for Information Supply on 3 March). 
According to these accounts, the new structure of the 
Administration aims to: 

   --Improve analysis by combining the present three analytical 
centers and a newly created "Situation Room" (Situationnaya 
Komnata) into one "Analytical Service" (Analiticheskaya Sluzhba), 
which will probably employ on a fulltime basis many of the 
present part-time presidential analysts (Kommersant-Daily, 10 
February).  According to the 6 January Segodnya, the poor 
performance of the present analytical centers during the December 
election--in analyzing voters' attitudes, predicting the outcome, 
and analyzing the results--was one of the reasons for the Filatov 
and Ilyushin reorganization proposals. 

   --Improve economic and foreign policy expertise, probably to make 
the president less dependent on the cabinet for advice on these 
issues.  The reorganization adds a "Service of Economic Analysis" 
(Sluzhba Ekonomicheskogo Analiza), a "Finance-Budget Directorate" 
(Finansovo-Byudzhetnoye Upravleniye), and an "International 
Department" (Mezhdunarodnyy Otdel).

   1 Based on the 22 February 1993 presidential edict outlining the 
structure of the Administration after the early 1993 
reorganization.  (See the Trends of 24 March 1993, pages 6-15.) 

   2 Based on the 10 February Kommersant-Daily and Novaya 
Yezhednevnaya Gazeta accounts and charts. (This structure is 
provisional since it has not yet been confirmed by Yeltsin.) 

   3 On 10 February Andrey Voykov was appointed head of the State 
Duma's apparatus by the Duma's council (ITAR-TASS, 11 February). 
Yeltsin relieved him of his Administration post on 22 February 
(ITAR-TASS, 22 February). 

   4 A Finansovo-Byudzhetnoye Upravleniye was created by a 28 
February Yeltsin edict, with Igor Moskovskiy as head and with 30 
employees (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 March).  It is to supply the 
president with information, analysis, and recommendations on 
questions of finances, budget, insurance, prices, credits, and 
money (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). 

   5 The Upravleniye Informatsionnykh Resursov was abolished and its 
remnants transferred to the Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and Information under the president (Segodnya, 9 
February; Kommersant-Daily, 10 February; Radio Rossii, 21 
February).  Yeltsin fired Vasiliy Kupriyanovskiy as head of the 
directorate for "critical failure in performing his duties" 
(ITAR-TASS, 22 February).  A 24 February Izvestiya article on the 
abolition of the directorate suggests that the communications 
agency had pushed this move to eliminate a competing information 
center.  According to the article, the directorate disseminated 
information to localities using a modern computer system and now 
the agency will control this system. 

   6 Yeltsin signed a 3 March edict creating a Directorate for 
Supply of Information and named Petr Filippov (head of the 
present Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy) to head it 
(ITAR-TASS, 4 March).  With 40 employees, it is to work with the 
press and television and analyze information coming from regions, 
according to a 3 March Moskovskiy Komsomolets article. 

   7 The Kontrolno-Nablyudatelnyy Sovet that operated directly under 
Administration Leader Filatov is not included in the wiring 
diagrams in Kommersant-Daily and Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta and 
apparently will disappear. 

   8 Ilyushenko told Izvestiya (15 February) that the Kontrolnoye 
Upravleniye's work was to monitor activities of central and local 
officials and report wrongdoing to the president.  On 26 February 
Yeltsin removed Ilyushenko and nominated him for prosecutor 
general (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 1 March). 

   9 The president's representatives-in oblasts are dropped from the 
title of the Directorate for Work with Territories and 
Presidential Representatives and placed directly under the 
president along with presidential assistants, according to the 
Kommersant-Daily and Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta wiring diagrams. 

   10 Upravleniye Delami. 

   11 The Upravleniye Deloproizvodstva sends out presidential edicts 
and handles the mail, according to a 6 March 1993 Nezavisimaya 
Gazeta article.

SUMMARY 
                              After publicly protesting his exclusion from important 
deliberations on nationality affairs and threatening to resign 
his post as Minister of Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy, 
Sergey Shakhray appears to have halted and even reversed his 
political decline following the December elections.  After losing 
deputy premier status in the recent cabinet reorganization, 
Shakhray appears to have rebounded by means of a presidential 
decree giving him special status as a member of the Government 
Presidium.  Although the decree appears to mark at least 
Shakhray's partial return to President Boris Yeltsin's good 
graces, he continues to split with the president on major issues 
such as the recent amnesty for Yeltsin's opponents, suggesting 
the apparent reconciliation may be short-lived. 
                         END SUMMARY 
   A presidential decree dated 12 February elevated newly 
reappointed (See Note 1) Minister of Nationality Affairs and 
Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray above the status of rank-and-file 
Russian government ministers, announcing that he would be 
included in the Government Presidium (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 
February).  According to the Council of Ministers press service, 
Shakhray will be the only "regular" minister attending the weekly 
meetings of the Presidium--which also includes Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and his four deputies--as a "full member" 
(Kommersant-Daily, 15 February) (See Note 2).  Shakhray had made 
inclusion in the Presidium a condition of his acceptance of the 
ministerial port folio on 20 January.  After being offered the 
portfolio, Shakhray reportedly said that he would accept only if 
the Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy Ministry were made 
directly subordinate to the premier and he as minister were 
included in the Presidium (Interfax, 19 January). 
   (Note 1)  Shakhray was previously chairman of the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Nationality Affairs and Regional 
Policy, which was changed into a ministry in the post-election 
cabinet reshuffle.  See the Trends of 26 January 1994, pages 16- 
22, for a summary of changes to the cabinet. 
   (Note 2)  On 15 February ITAR-TASS reported that Economics 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin--also a leader of Shakhray's Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord (PRES)--is a member of the Presidium. 
   Shakhray had held the nationalities portfolio and the rank of 
deputy premier until Chernomyrdin reorganized the cabinet, 
reducing the number of deputy premiers and redistributing their 
responsibilities.  The reshuffle decreased the number of deputy 
premiers from six to four, and the remaining deputy premiers were 
given more responsibilities  (Mayak Radio, 31 January; ITAR-TASS, 
15 February).  Following the reorganization, Chernomyrdin signed 
a decision tasking First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets with the 
coordination of the activities of 15 ministries, state 
committees, and departments (ITAR-TASS, 15 February). 
Chernomyrdin's reshuffle also assigned each of the deputy 
premiers oversight over specific areas of social and economic 
policy but did not explicitly assign the nationalities portfolio 
to any of them, suggesting that Shakhray will have considerable 
latitude in this area. 
   End of Eclipse 
   Recent media commentary on Shakhray's situation interpreted the 
decree as a victory for him, ending a period in which his 
influence on nationality affairs was visibly declining. 
Following his demotion from deputy premier to minister in the 
cabinet reshuffle (ITAR-TASS, 20 January), an article in the 25 
January issue of Moskovskiy Komsomolets reported that nationality 
affairs were being handled by other officials, leaving Shakhray 
out of the loop on important developments: 
   --Deputy Premiers Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha had been 
given joint jurisdiction over nationality affairs, and Shakhray 
was now complaining that he was being used as a "front" instead 
of being "the man in charge" of regional policy. 
   --Chernomyrdin had met with Chechen Republic Deputy Premier 
Mairbek Mugadayev in disregard of "Shakhray's directive" not to 
treat representatives of the Chechen Government as leaders of an 
independent republic. 
   --Shakhray had complained tHhat government officials invited him 
"to study" Tatarstan's draft "Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of 
Authority and Terms of Reference" only after he expressed in an 
Interfax interview his bewilderment at not being included in the 
treaty negotiations. 
   Other media reports also noted that Shakhray appeared to be 
losing influence.  According to Interfax (21 January), "well- 
informed" sources within the government had said that Shakhray 
had been "virtually debarred" from handling regional issues. 
Kommersant-Daily reported that before he was elevated to the 
Presidium, Shakhray had been complaining to journalists that 
urgent problems such as Tatarstan and Chechnya were being handled 
without his involvement.  Shakhray was also apparently excluded 
from a 20 January telephone conference with the heads of 
administration of "a number of regions" discussing preparations 
for upcoming local elections.  According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta 
(21 January), Presidential Administration Leader Sergey Filatov 
led the conference and Yarov participated. 
   Background to Eclipse 
   Shakhray appeared to overcome what the Moskovskiy Komsomolets 
article called his "rather dubious status" by threatening to 
refuse to accept reappointment to the nationalities portfolio. 
Interfax (21 January) quoted Shakhray as saying that if "vital 
issues of regional and nationality policies" continue to be dealt 
with "without participation of the government member responsible 
for these issues . . . , I will not be able to work in the 
cabinet." 
   Shakhray's eclipse from nationality issues and his loss of the 
deputy premier post were probably retaliation by Yeltsin for 
Shakhray's limited support of the president and his reform team 
at crucial moments before and during the December election 
campaign.  Yeltsin disdained Shakhray's establishment of the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) for splitting his reform 
team and contributing to the reformers' December national 
election defeat by splitting the vote.  (Although Yeltsin avoided 
direct association with any party during the national election, 
he had been perceived as favoring Russia's Choice "in spirit" 
(Mayak Radio, 16 October 1993)--inasmuch as many of his close 
associates formed the party and actively promoted his reforms.) 
During the October 1993 crisis, Shakhray pushed for compromise 
and simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections rather 
than fully supporting Yeltsin's decisions.  Shakhray had also 
undermined Yeltsin's authority at a preparatory regional 
conference by openly disagreeing with Yeltsin's decision to urge 
the voluntary dissolution of local soviets (Interfax, 6 October 
1993). 
   Outlook 
   Shakhray's special status as a member of the Presidium puts him 
on a par, in effect, with the deputy premiers and probably allows 
him, as he had demanded, to report directly to Chernomyrdin on 
nationality affairs.  The arrangement may also facilitate the 
division of labor among the deputy premiers, allowing the cabinet 
to make fuller use of Shakhray's experience in nationality 
affairs and freeing the others to concentrate on priority 
economic issues.  With Shakhray apparently positioning himself as 
a future presidential candidate and staking out positions opposed 
to Yeltsin on key political issues--most recently on the issue of 
amnesty for Yeltsin opponents arrested in 0ctober (Interfax, 28 
February)--Shakhray's apparent return to influence in the cabinet 
may not last long.

<H3> <TI>      Bosnia-Herzegovina:  Bosnian Serbs Reject Federation </TI></H3>


</HEADER>


<TEXT>
Continuing     to call for the creation of a Greater Serbia, Bosnian 
Serb leaders have rejected joining the Bosnian Muslim-Croatian 
federation announced in Washington on 1 March.  In an interview 
published in Der Spiegel on 7 March, Bosnian Serb "President" 
Radovan Karadzic sharply denounced the Muslim-Croat federation 
and the confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic 
of Croatia.  Insisting that the Serbs could accept only "an 
independent Serbian state" or unification "with all other Serbs 
in one state," he asserted that only "political illiterates could 
expect" the Bosnian Serbs to live in a "Croatian-Muslim state." 
Suggesting that his remarks to Der Spiegel were a definitive 
statement of policy, both Belgrade television and the Yugoslav 
press agency Tanjug gave prominent treatment to quotations from 
the interview (Belgrade TV, 7 March; Tanjug, 8 March). 
   At the same time, while unanimously expressing their opposition 
to signing on to the Washington agreement, Bosnian Serb leaders 
have not opposed the idea of Muslim-Croatian union.   However, 
they insist that such a union must not threaten what they define 
as Serbian interests.  Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the 
Bosnian Serb assembly, described the idea of a federation or 
confederation with the Croats and Muslims in one Bosnian state as 
"out of the question."  While Krajisnik  evinced skepticism that 
a Muslim-Croatian federation could survive, he did not reject the 
idea out of hand (Tanjug, 5 March).  Bosnian Serb "Foreign 
Minister" Aleksa Buha said that the Serbs would never "return to 
any sovereign and integral Bosnia-Herzegovina."  While declaring 
that he would not oppose a Muslim-Croatian union as long as it 
did not constitute a threat "against" the Serbs, nevertheless he 
speculated that the federation was intended to "create a firm 
negotiating--and possibly military--bloc" opposed to Bosnian Serb 
interests (Tanjug, 6 March).    Nikola Koljevic, a vice president 
of the so-called Republic of Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who 
earlier suggested that the Serbs would continue to seek the union 
of "all Serbian lands" with "Mother Serbia" despite the 
Washington agreement (Vecernje Novosti, 3 March), more recently 
has praised the agreement as a "pragmatic move" in the "direction 
of peace."  He suggested, however, that the Serbs would enter 
into negotiations on the agreement only in the unlikely event 
that UN sanctions against Belgrade were lifted (Tanjug, 8 March).

<TEXT>
The     following is the fourth of a series of editorial reports on 
political Islam in Egypt.  These reports include summaries of all 
articles, reports, interviews, commentaries and other islamic 
affairs items that were published in the Cairo Arabic-language 
weeklies 'AQIDATI, AL-NUR, AL-SHA'B, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH. 

   This review covers the "January 1994" issue of AL-NUR, indicating 
that the paper is apparently now published monthly, rather than 
weekly, as only this and the Muslim Hegira date of 23 Rajab 1414 
appear on the front page.  Contents of this issue include the 
following:

   Certifying Islamic Interpreters 
   Death for Apostates Dictated by Islam

   Saudi Shura Council Opening Highlighted 

   AL-NUR Board of Directors Chairman al-Hamzah Di'bis wrote, in a 
lengthy factual two-page report, about the inauguration of the Shura 
Council in Saudi Arabia to which he was invited.  His report 
described the scene and covered the speeches delivered by the 
chairman of the Shura Council and the Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. 

   Anti-Islamic Claims Against Ministry Upheld 

   Reporters Muhammad Hilmi and Ahmad Mustafa underscored views of a 
number of ulema, supporting the "serious charges" leveled by 
People's Assembly member Jalal Gharib 25 December against the 
minister of culture that the ministry, through its publications and 
cultural functions, "encourages deviation and spreads anarchy and 
vice in Islamic society." 

   News in Brief 

   The General Assembly of the General Federation of Doctors "has 
strongly rejected, for the third time, invitations by the Israeli 
Health Ministry and Ben-Gurion University to conduct joint medical 
research."  (page 1) 

   "Three People's Assembly members have called for legislation to 
combat terrorism, which is threatening the country's security." 
(page 1) 

   News from the Islamic world.  (page 2) 

   Issues of Islamic jurisprudence, individual interpretation, and 
Islamic economy.  (page 4) 

   Cultural and literary issues.  (page 6) 

   Letters and other contributions by readers.  (page 7) 

   An announcement that "The Islamic Jawami' al-Khayr charitable 
association in the 'Ali Bin-Abi-Talib Center in al-Haram provides 
its services to the poor, particularly orphans, all over Egypt. 
The society provides them with clothing, daily meals, and allows 
them to stay in the center, which is supplied with modern 
equipment." (page 8) 

   Islamic Insurance Rules Discussed 

   Dr. 'Abd-al-Muttalib 'Abduh, head of the Statistics and Insurance 
Branch at the al-Azhar University's College of Commerce, was 
interviewed, discussing shari'ah rules on contemporary insurance 
systems, including commercial, cooperative, life, and social 
insurance.  He noted that several Islamic conferences on insurance 
were held and that they all ended with recommendations, but no 
decisions. 

   Certifying Islamic Interpreters 

   Dr. Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, professor of jurisprudence at al-Azhar 
University, was interviewed, explaining the qualifications needed 
for someone to interpret the teachings of Islam.  He pointed out 
that individual interpretation of Islam by qualified and highly 
educated people will remain open "as long as there is life to prove 
to the world that the Islamic shari'ah is suitable for all times and 
places and is consistent with the time in which we live." 

   Death for Apostates Dictated in Islam 

   Writer Hasan Mahmud Khalil, speaking on the issues of death 
sentences for apostates (hadd al-riddah) and religious freedom, 
argued with those who claim that there is nothing called a death 
sentence on apostates because there is no verse in the Koran that 
calls for punishing a Muslim apostate on earth and that this 
contradicts religious freedom.  He noted that while it is not 
mentioned in the Koran, it is mentioned in the Sunnah (prophetic 
sayings) and the Sunnah, he said, is the second source of 
legislation and Islam after the Koran.  He added that Sunnah 
contains various religious legal rulings.  There was a Sunnah that 
confirmed what is contained in the Koran and another that explained 
the Koran.  He further explained that "Islam protects rights and 
freedoms, and the first of these freedoms is the freedom of belief 
and expression.  No one is forced to abandon or change his religion. 
A person can choose which religion to believe and accept, but if he 
adopts Islam willingly, he accepts its rules and submits to its 
obligations.  He will be asked about every shortcoming."  Khalil 
also said that "the punishment for apostasy was legalized to 
safeguard religion, ensure its course, deter those who wish to enter 
Islam to achieve certain purposes and then return to their 
infidelity, and purge society of such hypocrites and exploiters of 
religion."  He concluded that apostates are more dangerous to Islam 
than non-Muslims because they distort religion and deceive many 
people who are not familiar with Islam." 

   Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman Defended 

   Writer Muntasir al-Zayyat argued, in an article entitled "Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman; The Other Side," that Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman is being 
held in the United States on political rather than legal grounds. 
He said that the indictment issued by the federal court in New York 
in the case of the World Trade Center explosion on 4 September did 
not include the name of Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, although much 
media clamor was raised at the time.  This, al-Zayyat said, "opens 
the way for his possible release soon." 

   Al-Zayyat then recalled that the U.S. Administration several 
months ago wanted Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman to leave the country, saying 
that his entry into the United States was improper.  Describing this 
as "ridiculous" and "surprising," he said that if Shaykh 'Umar's 
entry visa, which he received in Khartoum, was wrong, then why did 
no one find fault with his previous 1985 and 1987 entries to the 
United States?  He further argued that the U.S. Administration 
wanted to get Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman out and could not explicitly 
express that; therefore, it said that he violated immigration laws 
and began looking for a country to take him.  The problem became 
more complicated, al-Zayyat said, when the Egyptian Government asked 
for his extradition and the prime minister of Afghanistan agreed to 
receive him.  This was unacceptable to the U.S. Administration, he 
said, adding that the day when 'Abd-al-Rahman's lawyer officially 
requested that the shaykh be allowed to leave for Kabul, he was 
officially charged to prevent him from traveling there.  "Therefore, 
the problem is not governed by legal considerations, but political. 
If Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman was treated according to law, he would always 
emerge victorious." 

   The writer then tried to shed more light on the "critical and 
fabricated problem" of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman.  He said: "The man has 
always paid for his daring beliefs and views."  His freedom has been 
restricted since the death of former President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, 
when he called from the pulpit that no prayers should be made for 
President 'Abd-al-Nasir. 

   Al-Zayyat then reviewed Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's struggle for his 
beliefs in Egypt since that time, noting that he was subjected to 
ugly" torture during his imprisonment from 1981 to 1984 and was 
insulted and defamed by "all the media." The writer added that when 
he left prison, he was strong and continued to adhere to his beliefs 
and call for the application of the shari'ah.  He was threatened by 
former Interior Ministers Zaki Badr and 'Abd-al-Halim Musa and, as a 
result, left Egypt and has not since returned. 

   In further defense of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the writer said: "In 
the case of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the law worked in his favor. 
However, the law now is not respected in Egypt by those who make it. 
The problem is being tackled on a political basis, and the political 
situation today is hostile to Shaykh 'Umar and all those who follow 
in his footsteps." 

   Al-Zayyat continued:  "The proceedings for the trial of Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman are being resumed in al-Fayyum at a time when such 
measures were suspended in New York.  It is Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al- 
Rahman's fate to pay the price for his adherence to his beliefs and 
his Islamic call." 

   Islamic "Subversives" Beware 

   Dr. Sa'd al-Hilwani, history lecturer at the al-Azhar 
University's Arabic language college, warned of attempts by 
subversive elements to undermine the Muslim religion.  He also 
warned against moral and religious degeneration as a result of 
immoral literature, referring in this regard to the question 
submitted by Jalal Gharib, an independent deputy of the People's 
Assembly, to the minister of culture on the issue.

<H3> <TI>      POLAND: Walesa Fires TV, Radio Council Chairman </TI></H3>


</HEADER>


<TEXT>
In     an apparent effort to gain more influence over Polish TV and 
Radio, President Lech Walesa fired Marek Markiewicz, the chairman 
of the Polish Radio and TV Council whom he had selected a year 
ago, after Markiewicz disregarded Walesa's objections to the 
Council's candidate for exclusive national broadcasting rights. 
Despite Walesa's repeated assertions that Zygmunt Solorz, an 
emigre businessman and head of Polsat satellite television 
network, was not a "suitable" candidate for an exclusive license 
to broadcast nationally (26 February, Warsaw TV), the Council 
formalized its agreement with Solorz on 1 March.  In stating his 
objections, Walesa pointed to press reports raising questions 
about what Rzeczpospolita called a Solorz biography "full of 
mystery and insinuation" (Rzeczpospolita, 25 February). 
   Apparently referring to reports of Polsat employees' connections 
with the former communist government, Walesa responded to the 
Council's 27 January declaration that Polsat won the broadcasting 
license by accusing the Council of placing private television 
"into communist hands" (Gazeta Wyborcza, 29-30 January).  Gazeta 
Wyborcza also cited a London Financial Times report asserting 
that Polsat was heavily backed by British press mogul Rupert 
Murdoch, contradicting Solorz's claim that his bid was "purely 
Polish."  During a news conference following the signing of 
Solorz's license, Markiewicz said that his conversation with the 
president over the license had been "unpleasant" and that Walesa 
had accused the Council of "accepting a bribe" (PAP, 1 March). 
   Walesa has often expressed his dissatisfaction with Markiewicz 
and the the Council since the fall of 1993 and may be using the 
selection of Solorz as an opportunity to create a Council more 
disposed to accept his advice.  Walesa, who has the right by law 
to appoint three members to the nine-member council, selected 
Markiewicz, a leading member of the Solidarity trade union, last 
March when the president was attempting to improve his relations 
with the trade union (Rzeczpospolita, 10 March 1993).  However, 
as his relations with Solidarity grew increasingly sour 
(Rzeczpospolita, 28 June 1993) and after the Council had 
apparently ignored Walesa's advice, Walesa began to criticize 
Markiewicz and the Council.  For example, Walesa objected to 
Markiewicz's announcement in June that the Council would crack 
down on private stations that were broadcasting without the 
Council's authority (PAP, 18 June 1993).  He became even more 
critical of the Council in November, when the Council appointed a 
former director of Solorz's Polsat to replace Walesa stalwart and 
current presidential adviser Janusz Zaorski as head of public 
television.  Walesa called the appointment a "major mistake" 
(Rzeczpospolita, 16 November 1993) and, shortly thereafter, 
forced the Council out of its office in the Belweder 
(Rzeczpospolita, 16 December 1993), demanding that the three 
members whom he had selected resign their posts immediately (PAP, 
8 December 1993).  As yet, none of the three has complied.

<H3> <TI>      MITI Moving Away From Voluntary Export Restraints </TI></H3>


</HEADER>


<TEXT>
In     an apparent effort to demonstrate that Japan is advancing 
toward full compliance with GATT rules, Japan's Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) is reportedly moving away 
from bilateral voluntary export restraints on textiles and toward 
adoption of more fixed textile import restrictions based on the 
Multilateral Fiber Agreement.  According to the 17 February Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun, MITI is currently formulating the criteria it 
plans to use to justify restrictions on future textile imports 
from China, Pakistan, and Taiwan as early as May 1994.  MITI is 
also reportedly planning for the first time to apply dumping 
duties consistent with GATT rules to textile products and is, 
according to the 18 February Mainichi Shimbun, investigating the 
alleged dumping of Pakistani cotton yarn based on a complaint 
filed by the Japan Spinners' Association in December 1993. 

   MITI is also reportedly considering whether to move away from 
voluntary export restraints in other sectors, such as automobiles 
and forklifts, where Japan has agreed to limit its own exports. 
According to the 21 January Asahi Shimbun, MITI is officially 
maintaining that it has not decided whether the current voluntary 
restraints for car exports to the United States will be renewed. 
However, it reportedly wants to abolish such restraints, 
calculating that now, when Japanese car exports to the United 
States are down, would be a good time to abolish the voluntary 
export restraints for automobiles.

<H3> <TI>      North Depicts Moves to Avoid Deadlock in Talks </TI></H3>


</HEADER>


<TEXT>
Seeking     to project a conciliatory stance on North-South talks, 
Pyongyang used the 9 March inter-Korean talks to create the image 
that it is making constructive proposals to pave the way for the 
exchange of special envoys, a step that is related to the 
resumption of talks with Washington on the nuclear issue. 
According to Pyongyang television on 9 March, the North Korean 
side advanced a new proposal for the envoy exchange that it 
claimed incorporated South Korean views on the issue.  (The 
proposal, which prescribes the composition of the special envoy's 
entourage, travel arrangements, and other procedural matters, was 
characterized by the South Korean chief delegate as "a positive 
sign," according to Seoul's government-run KBS-1 radio.) 
Nevertheless, clinging to a position that could enable North 
Korea to control the pace of progress at the talks, Pyongyang 
television also depicted the North as still insisting on the four 
basic demands it previously advanced as conditions for exchanging 
envoys. 
   In a gesture that could facilitate an eventual compromise on its 
demands, Pyongyang has slightly tempered its personal attacks on 
ROK President Kim Yong-sam.  A 9 March KCNA report of a Nodong 
Sinmun commentary criticizing Kim's recent remarks on North-South 
relations referred to him as a "traitor" only once, while using 
more neutral terms such as "South Korean rulers" and the "Kim 
Yong-sam group" to refer to the ROK government.  Both sides are 
set to meet again on 12 March.

   JAPAN:  Auto Industry - FEATURE:  Auto Industry Firms Receiving 
Employment Subsidies -- SUMMARY:  Battered by Japan's prolonged 
economic slump, numerous firms in three auto industry sectors- 
-finished car makers, auto-body manufacturers, and auto parts 
makers--are temporarily shutting down operations and initiating 
"one-time layoffs," according to media reports.  An increasing 
number of large industry firms are joining smaller companies in 
receiving government "employment adjustment subsidies?? to offset 
labor costs associated with the layoffs. 

   According to the 6 January NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI), Japan's 
auto industry is ??reeling?? from the fall in domestic demand for 
new cars because of the prolonged recession.  On 5 January, the 
Japan Automobile Dealers Association announced that domestic auto 
sales in 1993 fell for the third straight year to a six-year low. 
Sales of cars (excluding minicars), trucks, and buses totaled 
4,887,179 vehicles, down 8.4 percent from 1992, and the lowest level 
since 1987.  The paper adds that sales have fallen nearly 18 percent 
from their peak in 1990. 

   Auto exports also have fallen sharply.  According to the Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association, in January 1994 auto exports 
fell by 26.5 percent compared to January 1993 to 390,418 vehicles, 
the tenth consecutive monthly decline, the 25 February NIKKEI 
reports.  This is the largest drop "since statistics have been 
collected" and the lowest number of vehicles exported in the month 
of January since 1979.  Further, the monthly value of both auto and 
auto parts exports fell 12.6 percent to just over $6.5 billion, the 
fifth consecutive monthly decline, the paper notes. 

   Companies Forced To Initiate Temporary Layoffs - According to the 
20 November 1993 ASAHI SHIMBUN, because of the prolonged slump, the 
auto industry is faced with "excess personnel and production 
capacity."  However, given Japan's lifetime employment system, 
companies are unable to simply fire workers and are looking for 
other means to lower labor costs.  One means companies have resorted 
to, according to ASAHI, is "one-time," or temporary layoffs.  Under 
this arrangement, to reduce production without actually firing 
excess personnel, firms require that designated workers take 
temporary layoffs, during which plant operations are halted.  Firms 
must pay an "operations shutdown allowance" equal to or more than 60 
percent of the employee's average salary, as required by the Labor 
Standards Law. 

   To help firms in selected industries during recessionary 
downturns, in 1975 the Japanese Government initiated an "employment 
adjustment subsidy system" through which the Ministry of Labor (MOL) 
pays companies a subsidy to offset labor costs "during temporary 
layoffs, retraining, and employee transfers," ASAHI notes.  To 
receive these subsidies, firms must first be "designated" as being 
in an industry sector experiencing difficulties by the MOL, after 
which the firm must specify the conditions of its temporary layoffs 
and petition the MOL for the subsidies.  This designation is 
effective for 1 year, after which the industry may be redesignated 
by the MOL for another year. 

   Large Number of Industry Firms Receiving Employment Subsidies - 
In the auto industry, the auto-body manufacturing sector received 
MOL certification for employment adjustment subsidies in late 
January 1993, according to the 6 February 1993 NIKKEI, following an 
appeal by the Japan Auto-Body Industries Association, which 
represents 218 firms.  The MOL eligibility designation was set to 
expire on 31 January 1994, but, according to the 15 February 1994 
NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN, the MOL "redesignated" the auto-body sector 
for another year.  On 1 May 1993 the finished auto assembly sector 
and the auto parts manufacturing sector were also added to MOL's 
list of industries eligible for employment adjustment subsidies, 
according to the 3 May 1993 NIKKEI WEEKLY. 

   Since the designations were made, the number of companies 
utilizing one-time layoffs has been increasing, reports the 15 
February 1994 NIKKEI SANGYO.  According to MOL statistics, the 
number of finished car makers (including some auto-body assembly 
firms) who petitioned for labor adjustment subsidies to pay for 
temporary shutdowns and layoffs mushroomed in late 1993, from five 
firms in November to 21 in December covering 26,785 employees.  As 
these firms halted production, in a ripple effect, an increasing 
number of auto-body and auto parts firms have had to initiate work 
stoppages, NIKKEI SANGYO reports.  The number of auto-body firms 
undertaking work stoppages in November expanded to 12 and then to 20 
firms, while the number of targeted personnel increased from 990 to 
1,515. 

   Auto Parts Firms Particularly Hard Hit - Auto parts manufacturing 
firms have been particularly hard hit by the downturn, according to 
the 27 January NIKKEI SANGYO.  The number of parts companies 
planning work stoppages more than doubled, from 136 firms in October 
to 280 in November, while the number of employees involved jumped 
from 30,382 in October to 79,201 in November.  Further, according to 
the 15 February NIKKEI SANGYO, the numbers increased again from 
November to December, from 280 to 361 firms.  NIKi?I SANGY0 adds 
                                                 ? 
that the finished car and auto parts industries do not expect the 
number of firms requesting subsidies to fall "any time soon." 
Press Reports on Companies Initiating Layoffs, Requesting 
Subsidies - Although a number of small auto industry firms applied 
for subsides soon after the MOL made its designations, until October 
1993 no major company had applied.  Subsequently, a number of larger 
auto-related firms plans to initiate temporary layoffs and apply for 
employment adjustment subsidies.  According to press reports, the 
following companies have initiated temporary layoffs and have 
received employment adjustment subsidies: 

   Nissan Motor Co.--According the 26 October MAINICHI SHIMBUN, 
Nissan announced plans to apply for subsidies after revealing that 
it would stop production for two days in November on one line at its 
Tochigi assembly plant, which employs 6,500 people, and institute 
temporary layoffs on those days to 2,100 production workers.  In 
November, Nissan announced it would expand the scope of temporary 
layoffs to include "virtually all" domestic production lines.  The 
18 November MAINICHI SHIMBUN reports that Nissan decided to target 
nearly 15,000 employees and five plants for two-day shutdowns in 
December, which would cut production by nearly 4,000 vehicles. 

   In December, Nissan announced it would continue to conduct 
temporary layoffs and production shutdowns in January and February, 
according to the 18 December YOMIURI SHIMBUN.  In January, Nissan 
had shutdowns for three days at its Murayama and Yokohama plants, 
two days at its Tochigi plant, and one day at its Kyushu plant.  In 
February the company planned layoffs for two days at its Tochigi and 
Kyushu plants and one day at the Murayama plant.  According to 
YOMIURI, the Murayama plant will have been closed six days during 
four consecutive months of temporary shutdowns. 

   Mazda Motor Corp.--According to the 26 October MAINICHI, Mazda 
decided to initiate temporary layoffs of two days in November for 
25,000 of its nearly 30,000 employees throughout the country. 
MAINICHI reports that Mazda also applied for employment adjustment 
subsidies.  The 25 December Y0MIURI SHIMBUN reports that Mazda, 
following its November layoffs, planned to have four days of layoffs 
in January at its Hofu plant.  Mazda, which is heavily dependent on 
exports, has seen its sales fall for fourteen consecutive months. 

   Nissan Diesel Motor--According to the 23 November 1993 NIKKEI, 
Nissan Diesel, a heavy-duty truck and bus manufacturer, announced it 
would initiate two days of temporary layoffs involving nearly 3,700 
employees at three different plants.  The company also stated it 
would apply for government employment adjustment subsidies, and also 
announced it had reached agreement with its labor unions to cut 
yearend bonuses. 

   Sumitomo Wiring Systems--The 26 January 1994 CHUBU SHIMBUN 
reports that Sumitomo Wiring Systems, the third largest manufacturer 
of auto wire harnesses, will initiate one-day shutdowns in February 
and March, affecting more than 4,700 employees.  The firm plans to 
apply for employment adjustment subsidies from the MOL.  The 
shutdowns will cover all of the company's offices and eight plants 
in Japan.  It has seen orders for wire harnesses, which account for 
over 90 percent of total sales, plummet nearly 20 percent since 
1990.  If orders do not recover soon, the firm may extend its 
planned shutdowns beyond March. 

   Tsuchiya Manufacturing Co.--According to the 24 January 1994 
NIKKEI SANGYO, Tsuchiya, an auto parts maker affiliated with Nissan, 
plans to stop production for two days a month at its main plant in 
Kawasaki City.  During this time, the salary of full-time employees 
will be covered by employment adjustment subsidies, but the salaries 
of temporary and part-time employees will be reduced on a prorated 
basis.  The Kawasaki plant, which among other things produces fuel, 
oil, and air filters, accounts for nearly one-third the firm's total 
sales.  The work stoppages will continue "until demand for auto 
parts has recovered," according to company officials.  Further, the 
company is considering work stoppages at other plants where 
productivity is low. 

   Other Suppliers Receiving Subsidies Under Different Designations 
- Other major suppliers to the auto industry have resorted to 
temporary layoffs and have accepted employment adjustment subsidies 
under other industry designations.  Two major examples, from the 
rubber and steel industry, are as follows: 

   Bridgestone Corp.--The 3 December 1993 NIKKEI reports that 
Bridgestone, the world's second largest tire manufacturer, announced 
that it would initiate three and four days of temporary layoffs at 
the end of December at nine of the its ten tire plants in Japan. 
The firm will also apply for subsidies.  Layoffs could cover 9,500 
employees, or nearly 60 percent of the firm's total payroll. 

   According to NIKKEI, the tire industry received its MOL 
designation at the end of November, and "this is the first time 
temporary layoffs have taken place in the tire industry."  Earlier, 
Bridges tone decreased the number of operating days from seven to 
five per week, but even this measure failed to compensate for the 
"severe" drop in demand for tires. 

   Daido Steel Co.--The world's largest maker of specialty steel and 
a major supplier to the auto industry, particularly to Nissan, Daido 
announced it would receive subsidies for temporary layoffs of nearly 
4,000 personnel at four plants at the end of December and in early 
January, according to the 11 December 1993 YOMIURI SHIMBUN (Chubu 
edition).  While the firm had undertaken temporary layoffs at its 
Kawasaki plant, this is its first "large-scale" employment 
adjustment.  Daido's sales have fallen for three consecutive years. 

   Economic Trends - FEATURE:  Keidanren Role Likely To Change Under 
New Chairman -- SUMMARY:  On 7 February the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) selected Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of 
Toyota Motor Corp., to succeed Gaishi Hiraiwa as Keidanren chairman, 
according to press reports.  While Toyoda chairs Japan's largest 
manufacturing firm, some industrial leaders express concern whether 
he can successfully lead Japanese industry because of his 
personality and Toyota's unusual corporate culture.  The press 
anticipates that under Toyoda's leadership, Keidanren will become an 
ordinary economic organization" representing the interests of 
private business, rather than acting as a coordinator between 
politicians, bureaucrats, and the business community. 

   On 7 February Keidanren chose Shoichiro Toyoda (68 years old), 
chairman of Toyota Motor Corp. and a Keidanren vice president, to 
succeed Gaishi Hiraiwa when he steps down as Keidanren chairman in 
May, according to the 8 February NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN.  (The 
company name is rendered "Toyota"; the legal family name is 
"Toyoda.")  While industrial leaders generally welcomed Toyoda's 
selection, they also expressed concern, based on his background as 
the owner and chairman of Toyota Motor, according to the 8 February 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN.  The 8 February NIKKEI SANGYO quotes an 
unidentified industrial leader as questioning Toyoda's ability to 
break free from "Toyota egoism" and lead Japanese industry from a 
"broader viewpoint."  Writing in the 10 February NIKKEI SANGYO, 
editorial staff writer Atsushi Suemura asks whether the head of 
Toyota, which is often said to have a "Mikawa (the old name for 
Aichi Prefecture) Monroe doctrine--we don't interfere with you, so 
don't you interfere with us"--is qualified to lead the entirety of 
Japanese industries. 

   The 8 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI) reports on the 
expectations--"which also reflect the concerns "--industrial leaders 
have concerning Toyoda.  Masaru Hayami, chairman of Japan's 
Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), states that he 
wants Toyoda to exhibit strong leadership "apart from the interests 
of the auto industry."  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry, says that the key lies in "how well Toyoda 
can balance" the interests of various industries and the interests 
of consumers and corporate shareholders, not as the manager of 
Toyota Motor, which has "always defended the interests of Toyota and 
the auto industry," but as a leader of all industries. 

   Concerning Japan-U.S. trade issues, Yoshinari Yamashiro, chairman 
of steel firm NKK Corp., notes that Japan-U.S. friction "is the 
Japan-U.S. automobile problem," according to the 8 February NIKKEI, 
implying that Toyota Motor should change its corporate philosophy 
and behavior to ease Japan-U.S. trade friction.  The article adds 
that Toyota Motor "symbolizes" Japan's large trade surplus. 

   Where Will Keidanren Go Under Toyoda's Leadership? - Writing in 
the 15 January ASAHI, economic reporter Yomei Tsuji speculates that 
Keidanren may become an "ordinary economic organization" under 
Toyoda's leadership.  Tsuji assumes that Keidanren will abandon its 
function of channelling corporate political contributions to the 
political parties.  Since Toyota Motor has devoted itself to 
manufacturing and selling cars from its Aichi Prefecture base and 
has avoided involvement in politics in Tokyo, Tsuji expects Toyoda 
to be effective in "changing Keidanren's relationship with 
politicians." 

   In addition, unlike previous Keidanren chairmen who came from the 
steel, heavy machinery, or electric power industries, industry 
sectors which were "sponsored" by the government, Toyoda is a 
representative of "true" private sector firms in Japan.  A change in 
Keidanren's chairmanship from a leader of state-sponsored industry 
to a private industry leader, Tsuji maintains, means that Japan's 
economy has been "taken from the government's hands."  He also notes 
that since Toyoda comes from the auto industry, which must sell to 
consumers directly, Keidanren under Toyoda is expected to pay more 
attention to consumer interests, unlike his predecessors, who spoke 
about "national interests" as leaders of "Japan Inc." 

   Writing in the 8 February NIKKEI, editorial staff writer Kazuo 
Mori notes that Toyoda's Keidanren will no longer play the role of 
coordinating interests between industry, the politicians, and 
bureaucrats.  Indeed, now it will be difficult for Keidanren to 
coordinate interests even within private industry.  Mori notes that 
Toyota is an "owner-managed firm, which tends to compete fiercely 
and to pursue only its own interests,'' even though it has become a 
giant."  He observes that the Keidanren's selection of Toyoda 
indicates that "competition based on market principles" will be 
emphasized by corporations more than ever.  Japanese practices that 
hinder competition, Mori notes, such as implementing policies 
through discussions among political, bureaucratic, and industrial 
circles, "will be avoided." 

   Press Urges Toyoda's Keidanren To Promote Deregulation - On 7 and 
8 February, NIKKEI, SANKEI SHIMBUN, ASAHI, MAINICHI, and YOMIURI 
carried editorials on Toyoda's selection.  All the editorials urge 
Keidanren under Toyoda's leadership to promote deregulation.  For 
example, ASAHI points out that Japan's auto industry has grown to 
the level of the U.S. auto industry because of "self-initiated 
technical innovations and rationalization efforts," not by support 
from the government, and urges Toyoda to "boldly promote 
deregulation."  MAINICHI, noting that Toyoda himself was a member of 
the Hiraiwa Study Group, urges him to take the initiative in 
pressing the government to implement the Hiraiwa Report and "further 
promote deregulation."  YOMIURI also asks Toyoda to promote 
deregulation to change Japan's economic structure, under which 
corporations compete for market share or conduct business in a 
collusive manner." 

   SANKEI's editorial notes that Keidanren also must change its role 
of being a coordinator between government and industry to being "a 
representative of private companies."  Through channelling corporate 
contributions to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) the past 40 
years, Keidanren has "directly and indirectly influenced government 
policy formulation," but it now has to "deal directly with 
government regulators."    The editorial urges the Keidanren under 
Toyoda "not be passive" toward the government concerning regulations 
and administrative guidance, but rather "assert its opinions and act 
as the leader of private firms in protecting private sector 
vitality." 

   Profiles Note Similarities Between Toyoda, Hosokawa - The 17 
January CHUNICHI SHIMBUN points out the many similarities between 
Toyoda and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, such as being from a 
well-known family, from a regional city, and "somewhat amateurs in 
their respective new fields," but also observing that "the era 
requires such leaders."  Toyoda is from a rich family--the eldest 
grandson of Toyota founder Sakichi Toyoda--and has reached his 
current position "without any political or financial support from 
the outside."  He is viewed as an honest and sincere person, the 
paper notes, "but not a tactician or a charismatic leader."  Since 
he has been far removed from Tokyo, Toyoda reputedly has not been 
involved in politics and "is not close to a political party or 
politicians."  He is also viewed as an "amateur" industrial leader, 
because he had not been involved in the activities of any economic 
organization before becoming a Keidanren vice chairman in 1990. 
Toyoda has a doctorate in mechanical engineering and is an 
accomplished engineer. 

   According to the 8 February CHUNICHI, Toyoda's stances on various 
issues are as follows: 

--Political contributions:  Toyoda thinks politicians should receive 
government support and individual contributions rather than 
contributions from business.  He realizes this will "disconnect" 
collusion within in the so-called "iron triangle" of politicians, 
bureaucrats and corporations. 

--Japan-U.S. trade:  Toyoda believes that Japan and the United 
States should build a trade relationship based on "harmony and 
competition."  He has opposed setting numerical targets for Japan's 
imports of automobiles and auto parts. 

--Economic structural reform:  He believes that corporations should 
promote self-help efforts to restructure themselves as their own 
responsibility, while the government should make the Japanese market 
more open and fair by deregulation. 

   FEATURE:  Welfare Payment Increases Will Offset Tax Cuts for 
Households -- SUMMARY:  Japan's proposed increases in welfare and 
national annuity premium rates will lessen the stimulative effects 
of the government's proposed income tax cuts on the consumption of 
working households, according to press reports.  The total increase 
in premium payments is estimated to be equivalent to one-fourth the 
total estimated gain in disposable income from the income tax cuts, 
thus largely offsetting tax cuts for average-income working 
households.  The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) claims, on the 
other hand, that retirees will receive annuity increases that 
slightly exceed the total amount of premium increases. 

   The MHW has drafted a bill to reform the welfare annuity program 
(for private sector wage earners) and the national annuity program 
(for the self-employed, students, and people without jobs) which 
includes premium rate increases in FY94, according to the 18 
February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI). The draft bill will be 
submitted to the Diet in mid-March for deliberation.  According to 
the MHW draft, the welfare annuity premium rate will increase from 
the current 14.5 percent (split equally between employer and 
employee) to 16.5 percent of monthly salaries effective in October 
1994, increasing to 17.35 percent effective October 1995, and a new 
payment of 1.0 percent (split between employer and employee) of each 
bonus payment effective in April 1995.  Regarding the national 
annuity premium, the current premium amount, which is a fixed 10,500 
yen ($100), will be raised to 11,100 yen ($106) per month effective 
April 1994. 

   The 26 February NIKKEI reports that total welfare and national 
annuity premium payments by working households will increase by 1.4 
trillion yen ($13.3 billion) a year, which is nearly equivalent to 
one-fourth the estimated 5.5 trillion yen ($52.4 billion) in income 
tax cuts specified in the 8 February economic stimulus package. 
According to MHW's calculations cited by NIKKEI, the total amount of 
welfare annuity premiums will increase by approximately 2.6 trillion 
yen ($24.8 billion) a year, assuming an average worker's monthly 
salary of 340,000 yen ($3,200) and 33 million wage earners.  Of this 
2.6 trillion yen ($24.8 billion), 1.3 trillion yen ($12.4 billion) 
will be paid by wage earners, since employers and employees equally 
split premium payments.  The MHW also anticipates that total 
national annuity premiums will increase by 100 billion yen ($952 
million) a year. 

   Premium Hikes Will Wipe Out Tax Cut Gains for Average-Income 
Families - According to the 15 February NIKKEI, working households 
with annual incomes below 6 million yen ($57,000) will realize 
little benefit from the income tax cuts due to increases in annuity 
premium payments and other public levies.  Moreover, while the 
income tax cuts are only for FY94, the premium increases "will be 
permanent."  In the case of a household with an annual income of 6 
million yen ($57,000) or below, an income tax cut of around 71,400 
yen ($680) or less "will be largely offset by the increased welfare 
annuity premium payments."  Although the MHW claims that welfare 
annuity recipients over 60 years of age will receive 5 percent more 
in benefits from FY94, and therefore the total household disposable 
income will increase by 3 trillion yen ($28.6 billion), NIKKEI 
argues that incomes will increase "at the cost of increased burdens 
for all working households." 

   More broadly, the NIKKEI article notes that FY94 may be a "losing 
year" for working class households with children in school, since 
postal rates have recently increased; a 9-percent increase in 
national university tuition has been proposed for 1995; and an 
increase in Tokyo expressway tolls has been proposed.  The paper 
concludes that even when workers want to have a bottle of beer after 
a hard day's work, a 8.9 yen ($.08) tax increase per bottle will 
"hurt their thin wallets." 

   FEATURE:  Economic Organizations Critical of MITI 'Interference' 
-- SUMMARY:  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
reportedly faxed a memorandum to four major private economic 
organizations summarizing the "important points" of the latest 
government economic stimulus package as well as "model comments" to 
be made by the heads of the four organizations before the Hosokawa 
Cabinet approved the package on 8 February, according to press 
reports.  A NIH0N KEIZAI SHIMBUN article on 15 February reported 
that the economic organizations were very critical of MITI's 
"interference" concerning comments by their leaders.  An editorial 
in that newspaper the same day sharply criticizes MITI for 
"excessive guidance" of the private sector, observing that it is 
"quite ironic" that under the Hosokawa administration, which 
advocates deregulation, the bureaucrats' control of the private 
sector "appears to have been strengthened." 

   Major economic organizations are very critical of MITI's 
"interference" concerning comments by their leaders on government 
economic policies, according to the 15 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
(NIKKEI).  MITI reportedly faxed a memorandum summarizing the 
"important points" of the latest government economic stimulus 
package and "model comments" to the offices of four leading private 
sector economic organizations--the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren); the Japanese Association of Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai); the Japan Federation of Employers' 
Association (Nikkeiren); and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry--on the afternoon of 8 February, a few hours before the 
Hosokawa Cabinet approved the stimulus package.  The fax reportedly 
emphasized the "importance" of "praising measures like the income 
tax cut" and "supporting the government's policy" of cutting direct 
taxes and increasing indirect taxes.  According to the NIKKEI 
article, the "model comments" for use by the heads of the four 
economic organizations included:  "We highly praise the courageous 
decisions of the government and coalition to include an income tax 
cut in the stimulus package." 

   Although MITI defended its action with the assertion that it 
never intended to force" the organizations to use MITI's comments, 
NIKKEI reports that the economic organizations are "annoyed" by the 
fax, which "sounded like an order" for them to use MITI's comments. 
The article notes that "this is the first instance" of MITI actually 
sending a document instructing the economic organizations what to 
say, although in the past MITI telephoned them to request that they 
make comments "favorable" to MITI. 

   According to a "source connected with an economic organization" 
cited by NIKKEI, "bureaucratic interference" concerning comments by 
leaders of the economic organizations "assumed prominence" in 
December 1993, when Jiro Saito, Ministry of Finance vice minister, 
and Hideaki Kumano, MITI vice minister, visited the four 
organizations to "explain" the government's policy of income tax 
cuts to be paid for by increases in the consumption tax. 

   Editorial Blasts Fax as Example of MITI's 'Excessive Guidance' - 
NIKKEI's 15 February editorial, which is headlined "Appalled by 
MITI's Excessive Guidance," is very critical of MITI, noting that 
its fax "reminds us of an 'education mama' teaching a two-year-old 
with simple words."  However, it observes, "the postwar period, in 
which Japanese industries were rebuilt under strong MITI guidance, 
has already ended."  "MITI's excessive guidance," the editorial 
continues, is an "extreme anachronism."  "MITI may think that it can 
freely control private economic organizations with its guidance, but 
such presumptuousness is no longer acceptable."  The editorial urges 
MITI to "realize that excessive guidance is now one of the causes 
hindering the vitality of Japanese industries." 

   The editorial also points out that MITI's fax "may be cited by 
the U.S. Government" to prove its assertion that "bureaucrats 
control the Japanese economy."  It notes that during the recent 
Japan-U.S. framework talks, the U.S. Government criticized Japanese 
bureaucrats for "controlling the Japanese economy and hindering 
deregulation." 

   The editorial concludes that it is "quite ironic" that under the 
Hosokawa administration, which advocates deregulation, bureaucrats 
"are gaining more power" and their control of the private sector 
"appears to have been strengthened."  The editorial demands that 
MITI "reflect gravely on its conduct." 

   Environmental Issues - Thirty Small Industrial Waste Companies 
Form Cooperative -- About 30 small-scale manufacturers of industrial 
waste treatment equipment and industrial waste disposal companies 
from the Tokyo Metropolitan Area and Nagano, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka 
Prefectures have joined together to form a cooperative association 
which will pursue contracts for building final industrial waste 
disposal facilities and conducting R and D activities.  The 
"Cooperative Association for Promoting Environment-Related 
Enterprises" will be established with an investment of 10 million 
yen ($96,000) and will be chaired by Yoshinori Ito, president of 
Kankyo Seibi Shinko, an environmental equipment firm. 

   The companies decided to form this "unique" cooperative because 
as independent firms, each has limited financial resources and thus 
can not qualify for special programs sponsored by public 
corporations, such as the Japan Environment Corporation, to finance 
work for improving disposal facilities to conform with stricter 
environmental regulations.  The cooperative plans to expand its 
membership to about 1,000 companies and establish a network of 
branch chapters throughout the country.  (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN

   Financial Issues - Nippon Credit Bank Expanding, Introducing U.S. 
Techniques -- Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), the newest and smallest of 
Japan's three long-term credit banks, has established a wholly-owned 
trust banking subsidiary that will begin operations in April 1994, 
according to the 1 March NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN.  It will be the 
seventh financial institution, after the "big four" securities 
companies and two banks, to enter the trust banking business through 
a financial subsidiary.  Capitalized at 5 billion yen ($48 million) 
and with 15 employees, the new subsidiary will begin buying real- 
estate trusts and bank loans for resale. 

   NCB also established a "financial development division" within 
its Planning Department in February to engage in real-estate project 
finance and asset securitization, according to the 18 February 
NIKKEI KINYU.  The new division will offer advice to customers on 
how to securitize their assets through trust banking or by setting 
up special-purpose companies, and will introduce the securitized 
products to its large bank bond purchasing customers.  For now the 
division will focus on assisting in the securitization of a 
customer's better assets, but in the future it will expand to 
nonperforming loans, as is done by U.S. investment banks. 

   Establishing the new division is NCB's first step in expanding 
commission-earning operations that fully exploit the financial 
engineering techniques used by U.S. investment banks.  The new 
division will work in concert with NCB's new trust bank subsidiary 
in promoting business.  By bringing its customers financial 
engineering techniques from the United States, "smooth fund-raising 
will become possible" for real estate  financing. 

   In addition, NCB is also building up its system of developing new 
derivative products, such as options, futures and swaps, by 
establishing a product-development team, according to the 25 
February NIKKEI KINYU.  The team's objective is to facilitate 
product development by addressing the need of institutional 
investors and average companies to hedge against interest rate and 
currency risks.  The team will be located at NCB's interest-rate 
swap trading desk, the first time a long-term credit bank has set up 
a product-development team at a trading desk.  Product development 
and marketing will be streamlined, with a single person in charge of 
both. This official will concentrate on developing products for the 
portfolio management of manufacturers, not Just securities and 
insurance companies. 

   Although many banks separate their dealing sites and development 
divisions, product development is easier at a trading desk because 
there dealers can collect the hedging know-how of major commercial 
and foreign banks.  NCB expects to be able to reduce the time it 
takes to develop a product, such as swap-related products, from 
design to completion in half the time this took previously.  NCB 
plans to sell these products not only to institutional investors but 
also to average companies. 

   Banks Considering Establishment of Offices in Hanoi - Several 
Japanese commercial banks are considering opening offices in Hanoi. 
The Bank of Tokyo, Sakura Bank, Fuji Bank, Tokai Bank, and Daiwa 
Bank, which have already opened representative offices in Ho Chi 
Minh City, have also begun looking into opening offices in Hanoi, 
Vietnam's financial administration center.  These banks are expected 
to set up operations in Hanoi "in the next two or three years" in 
response to the growing number of foreign banks opening offices in 
both cities.  Sanwa and Sumitomo banks, which are planning to open 
representative offices in Ho Chi Minh City in the spring of 1994, 
are expected to join the others in establishing Hanoi offices in the 
future. 

   The banks are considering several ways of establishing bases in 
Hanoi, including establishing representative offices, local offices, 
or liaison offices of their Ho Chi Minh City representative offices. 
Of the 30 or more non-Japanese foreign banks that have begun 
operations in Vietnam, roughly one-third have bases in both cities 
in the form of a branch offices, representative offices, or local 
offices.  (Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN 16 Feb 94 p 2) 

   Former MOF Officials May Become Next BOJ Governor, Stock Exchange 
Head - Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, president of the Export-Import Bank of 
Japan (Ex-Im Bank), who entered the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in 
1951 and rose to  become vice minister in 1984, is rumored to be the 
probable candidate to succeed Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasushi 
Mieno in December 1994 when Mieno's term ends.  In recent years the 
BOJ governorship has alternated between former MOF vice ministers 
and BOJ "careerists."  Since Mieno is a BOJ careerist, the next 
governor is likely to be a former MOF vice minister.  Although 
appointing the BOJ governor is the prerogative of the prime 
minister, the incumbent MOF vice minister customarily recommends a 
candidate to the prime minister, who "almost automatically 
approves." 

   Although Yamaguchi is rumored to be the probable candidate, the 
MOF, BOJ and banking industry officials "are not completely sure 
yet."  They question whether the Hosokawa administration will last 
until December, when Mieno steps down, and if Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's "advocacy of reforms" might lead to changes in 
the selection process.  There have been several instances in the 
past where the personal desires of prime ministers altered the 
selection process.  One example was Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira's 
selection of Haruo Maekawa, then vice president of the Ex-Im Bank, 
over MOF candidate Satoshi Sumita, president of the Ex-Im Bank at 
that time.  As a result, Sumita had to wait for five years before 
getting his chance. 

   BOJ officials have been resistant to the custom whereby every 
second BOJ governor is a former MOF vice minister.  A senior BOJ 
official is quoted as saying that the BOJ governor needs to have a 
"sustainable and medium-term viewpoint" of the economy and be strong 
enough to implement monetary policies from such a viewpoint, 
"regardless of what the public at large may say," implying that 
being a former MOF vice minister in itself is not a sufficient 
qualification to be BOJ governor.  Some banking industry officials 
are also concerned that former MOF bureaucrats tend to compromise 
too easily with politicians.  They are also concerned that former 
MOF officials tend to adhere to MOF--not BOJ--"priorities" and 
subject monetary policy to the MOF's fiscal objectives. 
Yoshino Rumored To Be Next TSE Board Chairman - Yoshihiko 
Yoshino, president of the Japan Development Bank, who entered the 
MOF in 1953 and became vice minister in 1986, most likely will 
succeed Minoru Nagaoka, chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) 
Board of Directors, when Nagaoka steps down in May.  The 
chairmanship has been filled by former MOP vice ministers since 
1965, when the TSE invited former MOF vice minister Teiichiro 
Morinaga to restore financial health to the securities industry 
following the so-called "securities recession" of the mid-1960's. 
Since likely candidates from within the securities industry have 
been tainted by the stock-loss compensation scandals of 1991, it is 
highly likely that a former MOF vice minister will become the next 
TSE chairman.  Nagaoka has been quoted as saying that since current 
MOF Vice Minister Jiro Saito "plans and decides personnel moves of 
all former MOF bureaucrats," Saito will select a candidate from 
among the available former MOF vice ministers.  Then, the candidate 
will be nominated by the TSE Board of Directors and officially 
elected by two-thirds of all TSE members. 

   Within the securities industry, however, there is strong 
resistance to the chairmanship becoming a "reserved seat" for former 
MOF vice ministers.  The president of a major securities house 
states that "the securities industry is now capable of voluntarily 
promoting fairness and transparency in the stock market," so that 
the industry "no longer needs influential MOF retirees."  Another 
reason for the strong resistance is that the securities industry was 
not happy with Nagaoka, who, in the industry's view, "adopted the 
MOF's position," rather than representing the securities industry, 
during the series of securities scandals that began in 1991.  This 
viewpoint was particularly evident concerning the issue of 
establishing a securities industry watchdog organization.  Nagaoka 
supported the MOF's idea of establishing the Securities Exchange 
Surveillance Commission within the MOF, instead of an independent 
organization similar to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which the industry sought.  (Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN 17 Feb 94 p 11) 

   MOF To Require Disclosure of 'Off-Balance Sheet' Transactions - 
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has decided to require financial 
institutions to disclose information on the status of their so- 
called "off-balance sheet" transactions.  The MOF has determined 
that the nontransparency of financial transactions not currently 
included in a financial institution's balance sheet--so-called "off- 
balance sheet" transactions," such as unlisted futures, swaps, and 
options--and the concomitant risk of such transactions can cause 
enormous instability to the Japanese financial system as a whole. 
Consequently the MOF will reconvene its special advisory panel in 
March to study the issue in detail. 

   "Off-balance sheet" transactions use cutting-edge financial 
engineering techniques to allow financial institutions to hedge 
against risk.  Compared to more traditional financial instruments 
such as loans, off-balance-sheet transactions are conducive to 
large-volume trading across national borders and have a 
destabilizing effect internationally when a contract default occurs. 
Overseas off-balance-sheet transactions of Japanese financial 
institutions are said to be ballooning, which is one reason why the 
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is calling for their 
thorough disclosure and methods of managing the concomitant risks. 

   Some of the issues the MOF advisory committee, "The Working 
Subcommittee on Financial Institution Disclosure," will consider 
are:  whether it can establish a means for market-value assessment 
of unlisted "off-balance-sheet" financial products; whether risk 
assessment of all counterparts to off-balance-sheet transactions and 
comprehensive risk assessment are possible; whether overseas 
transactions are to be disclosed as well; and whether there is a 
method to demonstrate risk management methods that financial 
institutions are already using.  (Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN 24 Feb

   Foreign Trade and Investment - CHINA:  Japanese Firms Forming 
Broad Range of Joint-Venture Companies -- Japanese economic 
newspapers in recent weeks have reported the formation of joint 
venture (JV) companies and other corporate tie-ups in China that 
involve a wide range of industrial sectors. 

   Manufacturing Sector - Nippon Alkyl Phenol, a Japan-based JV 
company organized by Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, the Swiss 
chemical company Ciba-Geigy, and Musashino-Geigy, will sign an 
agreement in the near future with Gaoqiao Petrochemical Company, a 
major Chinese petrochemical manufacturer, establishing a JV company 
in Shanghai to build a plant to manufacture a resin additive which 
uses alkyl phenol as a feedstock.  The investment ratio in the JV 
will be Nippon Alkyl Phenol 75 percent and Gaoqiao Petrochemical 25 
percent. 

   The new company will invest 10 billion yen ($95.2 million) to 
build a resin additive plant in South China with an annual capacity 
of 2,500 tons.  The alkyl phenol used in the production of the 
additive, which is an antioxidant and ultraviolet radiation 
absorbing agent used in resins such as acrylonitrile butadiene 
styrene, will be shipped from Nippon Alkyl Phenol's plant located in 
Mitsui Petrochemical's Chiba plant complex.  (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 7 Feb 94 p 1) 

   Shiko Technical Research--The world's largest manufacturer of 
cooling fans used in notebook computers, Shiko has begun full-scale 
operations at two JV plants in China.  The factories, located in 
Shanghai and Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, were completed in December 
1993 and employ about 100 workers each.  Shiko projects that sales 
in FY94 from the two plants will be 1-2 billion yen ($9.5-$19 
million), which would about double their FY93 sales of 1.4 billion 
yen ($13.3 million). 

   The Shanghai plant will produce cooling fans for personal 
computers and sell them to major electronics manufacturers in 
Taiwan.  Production will be contracted out to the Shanghai Video 
Recorder Equipment Factory until Shiko officially decides on a 
partner in May.  The Wenzhou JV plant, the "Wenzhou Golden Dragon 
Shiko Company," will make vibration motors for pagers which will be 
sold to Motorola and to Casio Computer's plant in Tianjin.  The JV 
partner will be an individual.  With the establishment of these 
foreign production bases, Shiko will implement a policy of "domestic 
production for domestic sales and foreign production for foreign 
sales."  (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 16 Feb 94 p 26) 

   Juken Sangyo, a second-tier manufacturer of processed wood 
products, together with the general trading company Nissho Iwai, 
will establish a wood products manufacturing and sales JV company in 
Shanghai in April.  The company, Juken Nissho China, will be 
capitalized at $5 million, with Juken investing 85 percent and 
Nissho Iwai 15 percent.  The JV has obtained a 50-year lease from 
the Chinese Government on a 5-hectare site in Shanghai's Baoshan 
District.  Total investment, including plant and equipment, will be 
about $10 million.  The JV plant, scheduled to begin operation in 
February 1995, will use imported wood from Southeast Asian countries 
such as Myanmar, will cut lumber, and will manufacture plywood for 
export to Japan and for sale in China.  (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN

   Engineering Design, Transport, and Printing Services - Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries (MHI) and Mitsubishi Corp. will establish a JV 
company on 1 April with the Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. to carry out 
the design work for Baoshan's No. 2 rolling mill.  The JV 
company, "Shanghai Bao-Mitsu Metallurgical Facilities Engineering 
Technology Co. Ltd.," will be capitalized at about 200 million yen 
($1.9 million), with the Japanese firms investing 50 percent and 
Baoshan 50 percent.  The rolling mill, scheduled to be completed by 
1996, is part of Baoshan's third-phase construction.  A consortium 
of seven Japanese companies, including MHI, Mitsubishi Corp., and 
Nippon Steel, won the third-phase contract in November 1993.  MHI is 
also establishing a JV company with Sumitomo Metal Industries in 
Chongqing, Szechuan, to design an electric continuous casting steel 
mill.  (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 10 Feb 94 p 10) 

   Nippon Konpo Unyu Soko, a Japanese transportation company, 
together with the China Foreign Transport Nanjing Company, in late 
February established a JV transport company, Nanjing Nikkon Storage 
and Transport Co. Ltd.  The JV will be will be capitalized at $3 
million, with Nippon Konpo investing 51 percent and the Chinese firm 
49 percent.  The JV agreement will be for 20 years.  Nippon Konpo 
hopes to capitalize on trade between Japan and the developing 
industrial belt along the Yangzi River.  In addition, Nippon Konpo 
plans to establish a transportation network in China by setting up 
representative offices in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou.

   Nippo Ltd., an Osaka-based trading company with strong ties to 
printing companies, will open a wholly owned subsidiary offset 
printing plant in Beijing.  The subsidiary, Beijing Nippo Printing 
Co. Ltd., will be capitalized at $2.3 million.  The plant, which 
will begin operations in late March, will import all materials from 
Japan and will print high-quality four-color artwork for Japanese 
companies operating in China.  (Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN 22 Feb 94 p 10) 

   Consulting Services - Cosmo Public Relation, a marketing 
consulting company, has established a JV marketing consulting 
company, Cosmo China Enterprise Ltd., to provide support to Japanese 
companies planning to enter the Hong Kong and PRC markets.  The JV 
will be capitalized at HK$200,000 ($26,000).  The Chinese partner 
will be a company owned by Yang Zhenhan, a former high-level Chinese 
Government official with experience in the machine and auto- 
manufacturing industries, and Tan Nushi, a former Shanghai official 
responsible for textiles.  The JV firm will use the "personal 
contacts" and market knowledge of Yang and Tan to provide 
introductions to government organizations and business partners, and 
to provide business-site selection and real estate contract 
mediation services.  The JV will have its head office in Hong Kong 
and a a branch office in Shanghai.  (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 8

   Ikeda Hiroyoshi Accountants, an accounting firm, and Inform, an 
Osaka-based consulting company specializing in investment in China, 
together with the Shanghai Yangzi International Economic Cooperation 
Center, will establish a consulting company in Shanghai to target 
small Japanese companies that are interested in setting up 
operations in China.  The new company, Shanghai Foreign Business 
Commercial Research Club, will advise small companies on the legal, 
accounting, and tax systems in China and sponsor regular seminars on 
business and personnel management, taxes, and legal issues in China. 
The club will not be based on capital investment but will "operate 
cooperatively," supported entirely by membership fees of 50,000 yen 
($476) and monthly dues of 20,000 yen ($190).  The club hopes to 
recruit 50 companies.  (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 Feb 94 p 15) 
PHILIPPINES:  Shipping Firm Establishes Subsidiary in Manila -- 
Keihin Co., a medium-sized warehousing and transport firm, has 
established a Philippine subsidiary, Keihin Everett Forwarding Co., 
headquartered in Manila.  As Japanese companies have expanded 
operations in the Philippines, the need for shipping services has 
grown.  Although Keihin has been handling product distribution and 
delivery services for Japanese companies there, establishing a 
subsidiary will allow it to initiate full-scale shipping services in 
the Philippines and expand its international transportation network. 
Initial annual sales for the subsidiary are expected to be 112 
million yen ($1.06 million).  Keihin already has subsidiaries in the 
United States, Singapore, Europe, and Hong Kong and resident offices 
in Taiwan and Australia.  (Tokyo NIKKEI RYUTSU SHIMBUN 24 Feb 94 p

   THAILAND:  Canon To Expand Office Automation Equipment Production 
-- Canon Hi-Tech (Thailand) Ltd., a Canon subsidiary that produces 
office automation equipment such as copiers for the Japanese, 
European, and U.S. markets, will expand operations this year and 
increase production capacity by 30 percent.  In the past, when a new 
Canon product was manufactured in Thailand, the product was made 
entirely from parts imported from Japan.  As production increased, 
the local parts content gradually increased as well.  In the future, 
however, Canon Hi-Tech's planned expansion will permit the shift of 
parts production.  Thus, Canon Hi-Tech will be able to develop and 
produce new products from scratch, with the majority of parts 
manufactured in Thailand.  To ensure the continued high-quality of 
parts used in its products, in 1994 Canon Hi-Tech will bring in a 
technology team from Japan to handle product development. 

   Canon Hi-Tech was established in 1990 in Bangkok to help Canon 
offset the effects of yen appreciation.  In 1993 the company shipped 
260,000 copiers and 430,000 printers, with sales totaling 20 billion 
yen ($190.5 million).  The expansion work will begin in March and 
should be completed by October 1994.  (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN

   UNITED STATES:  Kobe Steel, TI To Market Cladding Material in 
Japan -- Kobe Steel and Texas Instruments (TI) have agreed to 
jointly market cold-rolled cladding material in Japan manufactured 
in the United States by TI.  This will be the first introduction of 
cold-rolled cladding material on the Japanese market.  TI, which 
developed its own technology to produce cold-rolled cladding 
material that is two to three times stronger than existing 
materials, decided to link up with Kobe Steel in entering the Japan 
market because Kobe has the aluminum and steel resources and also 
has "deep connections" with its consumers.  The companies have 
already decided on one use of the cladding material--to make the 
stainless aluminum composite used in the canisters of induction- 
heating (IH) thermoses and in the pots for IH rice cookers. 
Kobe Steel and TI have set a FY94 sales target of 300 tons of 
cladding material and a turnover of 500 million yen ($4.8 million). 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. also unofficially plans to use 
this cladding material in its new IH thermos.  (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO

   Sumitomo Metal To Extend Technical Cooperation to Steel Rod Firm 
- Sumitomo Metal Industries will cooperate technically with American 
Steel and Wire (AS and W), a steel rod manufacturer based in Ohio. 
Sumitomo Metal will provide software-related support to AS and W in 
equipping its new high-grade steel bar mill, will help conduct 
various technical inspections, and also will provide operational 
support when the mill opens.  U.S. steelmakers are considering 
whether to file dumping charges against Japanese firms as a measure 
to shut out imports of high-grade steel.  AS and W decided to seek 
technical support from Sumitomo Metal, with which it has previous 
business ties in purchasing steel rods.  Sumitomo Metal, on the 
other hand, is seeking to establish a foothold in the U.S. market. 

   The new AS and W mill, which will cost an estimated $70 million 
and will have a production capacity of 550,000 tons annually, will 
produce high-grade steel bars 30-40 millimeters in size mainly for 
use in automobiles.  Plant construction is scheduled to begin this 
summer, with completion targeted for December 1995.  Sumitomo 
Metal's two-year cooperation agreement, which began in February 
1994, includes a financial commitment of- 100 million yen 
($962,000). 

   Sumitomo Metal may consider expanding its cooperation with AS and 
W to include technical support for remodeling AS and W's existing 
wire rod mill and building facilities to manufacture billets.  It 
will then follow up with consultations with AS and W on producing 
high-grade auto parts.  (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 22 Feb 94 p 15) 

   VIETNAM:  Japanese Firm To Assist Marine Products Processing 
Company -- Shinto Bussan, the importing subsidiary of Toyo Suisan, a 
major Japanese food products company, will expand the technical 
guidance it provides to the Vietnamese company that processes the 
marine products Shin to Bussan imports into Japan.  By raising the 
processing level of products like shrimp and squid, Shinto Bussan 
can sell them directly to Japanese sushi and specialty restaurants 
and other retailers and make far higher profits.  In this way, 
Shin to Bussan hopes to increase sales of products imported from 
Vietnam to 1.5 billion yen ($14.3 million) annually from the current 
1 billion yen ($9.5 million) level. 

   Shinto Bussan will expand the technical guidance it provides to 
its production consignee, SeaProdex, a Vietnamese state-operated 
enterprise that processes more than 30 marine products for Shin to 
Bussan at eight processing plants.  Shinto Bussan's imports from 
Vietnam constitute 20 percent of the company's total sales.  (Tokyo

   Machine Tools/Robotics - MT Sales Fell 25 Percent in 1993, 
December Sales Dropped 16 Percent -- According to statistics 
compiled by the Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association, machine 
tool (MT) sales for 1993 totaled 531.783 billion yen ($5.06 
billion), down 25.1 percent compared to 1992.  Sales of lathes and 
machining centers dropped by 45 percent.  Total domestic sales for 
the year came to 322.57 billion yen ($3.07 billion), down 32.0 
percent, while exports totaled 209.213 billion yen ($1.99 billion), 
down 11.2 percent.  The large decline in domestic sales raised the 
ratio of exports to total sales to 39.3 percent, topping the 
previous high of 36 percent recorded in 1986.  Outstanding orders 
fell to 267 billion yen ($2.54 billion) at the end of 1993 compared 
to 354.9 billion yen ($3.38 billion) in 1992. 

   For December, MT sales totaled 40.054 billion yen ($381.467 
million), down 16.7 percent compared to December 1992.  However, 
this is the first time in three months that monthly sales have risen 
above the 40 billion yen ($381 million) level.  December domestic 
sales came to 23.068 billion yen ($220 million), down 24.0 percent 
year-on-year but up 10.3 percent from November.  December exports 
were 16.986 billion yen ($161.8 million), down 4.3 percent from 
December 1992.  However, exports to the United States increased.

   Semiconductors/Computers/Electronics - NEC Wins Supercomputer 
Order From Private University -- NEC Corp. has won an contract from 
Fukuoka University, a private institution in Fukuoka City, to build 
a  research and education system" that includes a supercomputer at a 
total cost of just over 1 billion yen ($9.3 million).  The company 
will provide its "SX-3/IIR" vector supercomputer.  Further, NEC will 
construct a local-area network (LAN) that will combine image 
processing workstations, education-use personal computers, and a 
library information system.  One "special feature" of the system is 
that the supercomputer and workstations will use UNIX operating 
software.  The system will be delivered in August and is expected to 
be in operation by October. 

   This is NEC's first supercomputer order in the Kyushu region. 
Also, NEC's supercomputer will replace a Fujitsu-made "VP2100/10" 
the university has been using. 

   NEC has not won any of the bids for ten of the eleven 
supercomputers funded under the the government's first FY93 
supplemental budget, while Fujitsu has won four.  In several of the 
bids, including those sponsored by the Communications Research 
Laboratory and Tsukuba University, the two firms competed head on, 
but Fujitsu won out over NEC and the other bidders with lower prices 
and higher technical evaluations "beyond the scope of expectations." 
With the Fukuoka University contract, however, NEC "has had its 
revenge."  (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 4 Feb 94 p 7) 

   Seiko Epson To Build IC Design-In Center in China - Seiko Epson 
Corp. will establish an integrated circuit (IC) design-in center in 
Shenzhen, China in the spring of 1995.  The center's goal will be to 
strengthen local customer support for Seiko Epson's IC design-in 
operations in China, which were developed through Hong Kong. 
Currently most of Seiko Epson's design-in customers are in Japan, 
but the company has decided "it is essential to increase foreign 
sales."  Therefore it is expanding directly into China, where the 
company anticipates a huge demand in the future for design-in ICs. 
Seiko Epson first will focus on developing a market in southern 
China for semiconductors designed for use in light industry, such as 
electronic notebooks and game machines. 

   Seiko Epson derives about 50 percent of its sales from customized 
and semi-customized ICs.  In this field the ability to develop 
products which are specialized to a user's needs is the deciding 
factor in a company's success.  For this reason, after starting its 
semiconductor operations in 1980, Seiko Epson moved to aggressively 
strengthen its design-in system. 

   Domestically, Seiko Epson has semiconductor design-in centers in 
Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fujimi, and Sapporo.  The Shenzhen center will 
be Seiko Epson's fourth overseas design-in center; the other three 
are in Canada, California, and Taiwan.  (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN

   Telecommunications/Satellites - NEC, Mitsui To Build Ground 
Station For Sri Lanka Telecom -- NEC and Mitsui and Co. have won a 
contract worth 1.5 billion yen ($14.4 million) from Sri Lanka 
Telecom, the country's state-run telecommunications enterprise, to 
build an INTELSAT (International Telecommunication Satellite 
Organization) Standard-A ground station and supply NEAX61 switching 
equipment.  The ground station, the second in Sri Lanka, will be 
built in the eastern outskirts of Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, by 
early 1995.  It will increase the country's international 
communications capacity from the existing 500 lines to 2,500. 
Sri Lanka Telecom will set up support facilities in the Padukka 
region, east of Bombay, India, and plans to begin operations at the 
ground station in early 1995.  All financing for the project will be 
handled through the Asia Development Bank.  AT and T and Sweden's 
Ericsson also bid for the project, but Sri Lanka Telecom selected 
NEC and Mitsui based on its "high appraisal" of the first ground 
station the two companies built in 1975. 

   Demand for international communications in Sri Lanka is growing 
not only because the country is a popular tourist spot, but more 
importantly because several Asian countries, especially South Korea, 
have begun textile production operations there.  NEC is seeking to 
sell its equipment for both international and domestic 
communications in conjunction with Sri Lanka's active program to 
upgrade its communications infrastructure.  (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO

   NHK Will Lease Circuit on Panamsat Satellite - The Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) has confirmed that it will lease a circuit 
on the Panamsat (Pan American) satellite, scheduled to be placed in 
orbit this May, for video transmission of its newscasts between 
Japan and the United States.  NHK, which currently leases two 
circuits from INTELSAT (International Telecommunications Satellite 
Organization), reached its decision after "a comprehensive review of 
factors."  Reportedly the deciding factor was Panamsat's low costs, 
although NHK has not made a "definite statement" regarding this 
matter.  NKH and Panamsat are currently working out final details of 
the contract through Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), which is acting as 
the negotiating agent between the two firms because Panamsat does 
not have an office in Japan--a requirement for foreign enterprises 
seeking satellite communications business activities with Japan, as 
stipulated in the Japanese Government's deregulation measures for 
this sector of the communications industry. 

   NHK's decision to contract with Panamsat will likely encourage 
other Japanese customers to follow.  This trend will affect 
INTELSAT, which currently dominates the Japan-U.S. video 
transmission market, but will also affect Japanese companies like 
Japan Satellite Systems, which is seeking to establish a presence in 
the international satellite communications market.  (Tokyo NIKKEI

   Tokyo Experimental CATV Project To Be Operational by 1996 - The 
Tokyo Metropolitan Government soon will begin planning for a large 
experimental digital-based cable television (CATV) project in the 
new city center currently under development in the Tokyo Bay area. 
The CATV project is slated to be operational in 1996.  This May the 
metropolitan government will call on representatives from the public 
and private sector, including the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), NEC, Hitachi, Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co., and communications software companies to form a 
committee and define a project plan.  The government estimates it 
will cost about 3 billion yen ($28.8 million) to build the CATV 
project center and to develop the necessary software. 

   Once the committee defines an overall plan, the metropolitan 
government will proceed with building the project center and 
establishing a 100-channel CATV network for offices and residences 
in the city center area that also will provide services such as 
video-on-demand, home television shopping, interactive health and 
medical consulting, and business communications services.  The 
metropolitan government plans to officially inaugurate the CATV 
project in March 1996 during the "Tokyo Frontier" world trade fair.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., EO Revamp Production 
Agreement - Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has concluded an OEM 
(original equipment manufacturer) agreement with EO, a California- 
based company which develops portable communications terminal units. 
The move follows a request by EO to discontinue its existing 
consignment production relationship with Matsushita because the 
number of units currently produced is considerably lower than 
originally forecast due to a decline in demand in the U.S. market. 

   America Matsushita Computer, based in Illinois, has been 
producing EO terminal units on consignment since 1992, when EO was 
established with investment from Matsushita Electric Industrial, AT 
and T, and Olivetti.  Initially, the two companies set production 
targets of 5,000 units per month, but because of the decline in U.S. 
market demand, they realized only half the target figure. 
Matsushita states "it is not thinking about reexamining the other 
aspects of its EO relationship, such as withdrawing its investment 
from the company."  (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 Feb 94 p 12) 

   CHINA:  Domestic Developments - Shanghai Enterprise Ownership 
Composition Changes Through Reform -- Economic reform has had a 
tremendous impact on enterprise ownership composition in Shanghai, 
with the number of joint ventures, private enterprises, and other 
types of ownerships growing yearly.  According to the latest 
statistics, from 1980 to early 1993, state-owned enterprises 
declined from 85.9 percent to 62.2 percent of Shanghai's gross 
domestic product while collectives, private, and joint venture 
enterprises grew from 12.4 percent, 0.3 percent, and 1.7 percent to 
19.2 percent, 2 percent, and 18.2 percent of the gross domestic 
product respectively. 

   Shanghai has vigorously encouraged the development of collective 
enterprises in townships since 1985.  The ensuing policy of opening 
up has also helped to attract a lot of foreign investment.  With the 
liberalization of enterprise ownership, Shanghai's private 
enterprises have grown to over 5,000 at present.  After the 
socialist market economy was instituted in 1992, the shareholding 
system proliferated.  There are now over 90 Shanghai enterprises 
selling shares to the public, with capital exceeding 23 billion 
yuan.  The growing economic prosperity during the past 15 years 
proves that ownership reform is suited to China's general economic 
development.  This reform is not only beneficial to raising people's 
living standard, increasing state revenue, and maintaining social 
stability, it is also beneficial to establishing a socialist market 
economy.  (Shanghai WEN HUI BAO 8 Jan 94 p 1) 

   Textile Shortages, Price Increases Forecast in 1994 - According 
to estimates of the State Administration of Commodity Prices, this 
year textile supplies will not meet demand and prices will rise. 
Based on an annual output of 1,150,000 tons of cotton yarn, the 
textile industry needs 3.5 million tons of cotton, but cotton 
shortages will reach 1 million tons.  Because cotton prices have 
increased, the price of cotton yarn has also increased.  In 
December, 21-count yarn was 14,000 yuan per ton, and 32-count yarn 
was 15,000 yuan per ton, increases of 28 percent and 17 percent 
respectively over the first quarter of 1993.  This year the price of 
cotton yarn will continue to rise. 

   China produces about 2 million tons of chemical fiber annually, 
and imports 650,000 tons.  In 1994, the price of chemical fiber will 
increase.  Annual domestic output of polyester is 1.1 million tons 
while the processing industry needs 1.3 million tons.  Annual 
imports are 200,000 tons.  In December, the price was 10,3000 yuan 
per ton and in 1994 the price will remain at the current level. 
Annual output of dacron is 700,000 tons, and the processing industry 
needs 800,000 tons.  Annual imports are 150,000 tons.  However, in 
1993 the international market price increased and imports decreased. 
In December, the price was 12,5000 yuan per ton.  Production 
enterprises that use this material changed or stopped production. 
In 1994 dacron prices will rise.  Meanwhile, annual domestic output 
of acrylic fibers is 150,000 to 200,000 tons and the processing 
industry needs 400,000 tons.  Thus, imports supply over SO percent. 
In 1994 the price will follow the international market.  (Shanghai

   Shenzhen Calls Halt to Listing of New 'A' Share Issues - The 
Shenzhen stock exchange has imposed a complete halt on new listings 
of "A" shares, issued to locals, in an apparent attempt to ease 
strains put on the system by the rush of companies coming to the 
market.  Although the 22 February official statement said the ban 
applied to all issues, it is unlikely that "B" shares, which are 
traded by foreign investors, will be affected.  Saying that 
investors were unhappy with the flood of new shares being listed, 
the exchange indicated that listings would resume depending on 
market conditions. 

   Analysts said the problem lay with the government's overly 
ambitious plan to enlarge stock markets, while ignoring the markets' 
capacity to absorb new shares.  Of the 5 billion shares approved for 
listing in 1993, only about 2.6 billion had been listed by the end 
of the year, leaving 2.4 billion to be listed in 1994, thereby 
straining the listing schedule.  (Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MOENING POST

thereby retaining its 18-year lock on the position of China's 
leading gold producer.  Shandong's gold reserves amount to half the 
PRC's total, with annual production accounting for one-third of

   Foreign Trade and Investment - Fujian Sets Up Intellectual 
Property Rights Court -- Fujian provincial's procuratorial court has 
set up an intellectual property rights (IPR) judicial court recently 
and the City of Xiamen's Intermediate People's Court has also 
officially set up an IPR protection court.  The move is to 
demonstrate that the province will fully exercise its judicial 
authority in IPR cases and is determined to punish the infringement 
and violation of IPR.  According to an estimate, the various levels 
of the people's court in Fujian has in recent years handled 47 cases 
and tried 35 involving IPR.  These cases include disputes about 
authorship (copyright) rights, patent rights, and trademark rights. 
Some cases involve foreign enterprise contract disputes.  For 
example, one such case was between a certain company in Hong Kong 
and a certain unit in Fujian in dispute involving non-patent 
technology transfer and in patent application permits. 

   The cases being tried in the provincial procuratorial court cover 
seven categories of disputes:  patent disputes; trademark disputes; 
copyright disputes; disputes involving invention infringement, 
exclusive rights to technology and other scientific and 
technological achievements; technology contractual disputes; 
disputes involving illegal competition; and any other disputes

   Shanghai Exports Exceed Target in 1993 - Shanghai's exports 
exceeded $7.38 billion in 1993 and the export growth rate was higher 
than the national average.  In early 1993, the Shanghai municipal 
government set its export target at $7.34 billion, but by mid-year 
only 45 percent of the target had been fulfilled.  In June, a 
municipal economic and trade conference was held to further reform 
and to create an environment more compatible with a socialist market 
economy.  After administrative protection and preferential policies 
were abolished, foreign trade enterprises were forced into market 
competition.  Last year, foreign trade privileges were also granted 
to an additional 4,000 or so industrial units, research institutes, 
enterprises, and joint venture firms, bringing Shanghai's trading 
entities to approximately 7,000.  Meanwhile, all relevant government 
work units were instructed to support exports and to launch 
coordinated measures.  After concerted efforts, exports began to 
increase and eventually exceeded the 1993 target. 

   Future export growth is targeted at 15.4 percent annually.  Since 
the state abandoned the mandatory export plan and foreign exchange 
submitting quota, relevant export promoting measures, including 
transforming the operational mechanism of trade offices, providing 
incentives, and adjusting industrial production, should be 
instituted as soon as possible.  (Shanghai WEN HUI BAO 6 Jan 94 p 1)

export market, though the longer-term outlook envisions selling up 
to 50 percent of output in China.  (Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS 2 Mar

   Wuhan Iron and Steel Imports Spanish Machinery - On 1 March, 
China's fourth largest steel producer, the Wuhan Iron and Steel 
Corporation (WISC), signed a contract with two Spanish companies- 
-Tecnicas Reunidas Internacional SA and Eurocontrol SA--to import an 
$82.1 million continuous casting machine intended for the second 
stage of WISC's No. 3 steel smelting plant.  The two Spanish 
companies earlier had supplied equipment worth $320 million for the 
plant's first stage.  WISC used both Spanish Government and 
commercial loans to seal the deals.  The No. 3 plant, with an annual 
steel production capacity of 2.5 million tons, will go into 
operation in 26 months, laying the foundation for WISC to increase 
its annual steel output to 10 million tons by the end of the 
century.  In 1993, WISC produced 5.06 million tons of steel and 5.44 
million tons of iron, increases of 6.12 and 6.69 percent, 
respectively, over the previous year.  Sales revenues for 1993 
amounted to 11.37 billion yuan ($1.3 billion), up 26 percent; taxes 
and profits hit 3.1 billion yuan ($356 million), up 38 percent; 
while exports hit $110 million, up 25 percent.  (Beijing CHINA DAILY

to invest in Southeast Asia.  Chiang Ping-kun said such incentives 
would include extending workers' training period, urging banks to 
increase loans for companies which invest in Southeast Asia, and 
signing agreements with Southeast Asian countries to avoid double- 
taxation.  The ministry will also help secure loans to businessmen 
who are interested in establishing industrial development zones in

establish garment and dyeing mills in Vietnam soon.  At the end of 
1993, the Hualon Group applied to the Vietnamese Government to 
establish a comprehensive textile mill involving investment funds of 
$240 million.  The Huang Ti Lung Textile Company has decided to 
invest more than $20 million to establish knitting and spinning

to expand its knitting and spinning production facilities in 
Vietnam.  (Taipei CHING-CHI JIH-PAO 17 Feb 94 p 10) Okinawa Bureau 

   Government To Hold Current Tariffs on Automobiles, Parts for Now

government will take this into account, and at this moment will not 
consider lowering tariffs on imported automobiles and parts and 
accessories before the issues of Taiwanese restrictions on car- 
exporting regions and of local car-parts content rates are settled

States calls for Taiwan to lower its auto tariff from 30 percent to 
15 percent, the government will still uphold the principle of 
lowering it slightly, with 25 percent as the bottom line.  (Taipei

   MOEA Assesses Impact on Manufacturers of Joining GATT - According 
to an assessment by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, after Taiwan 
joins GATT and lowers tariffs, the automobile and motorcycle, 
textile, and machine tool industries will experience the greatest 
impact.  It is estimated that the output value of the auto industry 
will drop by 60 percent, auto and motorcycle parts by 50 percent, 
and machine tools by 12.4 percent.  However, Taiwan's net exports 
and imports of manufactured goods may increase by $1.8 billion and 
$546 million respectively. The net output value of the manufacturing 
industry is likely to increase by $1.3 billion.  In addition to a 
decline in the output values of the aforementioned industries, 
thousands of workers in the auto and machinery industries may also 
lose their jobs after Taiwan joins GATT.  (Taipei CHING-CHI JIH-PAO

   Statistics on Exports to PRC May Be Underestimated - According to 
an official of the Board of Foreign Trade, Taiwan's real export 
value to the PRC is about 10-20 percent higher than statistics 
indicate.  The cause of this discrepancy is because Hong Kong did 
not add the price of PRC-bound transshipped or transit goods into 
their statistics.  It is also because some goods were not exported 
to the PRC via Hong Kong; therefore Hong Kong's statistics cannot 
represent Taiwan's total exports to the PRC.  According to PRC 
customs, Taiwan exported $12.9 billion of goods to the PRC and 
imported $1.4 billion of goods from the PRC in 1993.  PRC statistics 
on Taiwanese exports should be more reliable because they were based 
on certificates of origin.  (Taipei CHING-CHI JIH-PAO 21 Feb 94 p 9)

   NORTH KOREA:  FEATURE:  DPRK-Chosen Soren Joint Ventures Face 
Continuing Problems -- SUMMARY:  According to South Korean press 
reports, since 1990, most of the DPRK's joint venture companies with 
Chosen Soren (the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) 
have failed because of contract violations, "excessive" government 
control, a shortage of electricity, and difficulties in obtaining 
technology from Japan.  The surviving companies are at "high risk" 
of closing down as well, if current conditions prevail, the reports 
say. 

   Since 1984, when joint venture laws were enacted in North Korea, 
Chosen Soren and the DPRK have established about 120 joint-venture 
companies which account for over 60 percent of the total number of 
DPRK joint ventures, according to the 13 January Seoul NAEWOE 
TONGSIN.  The 25 January Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN, citing the ROK 
National Unification Board's recent report to the National Assembly, 
states that since 1990, most of the North Korean joint ventures with 
Chosen Soren have closed down and only 20 some companies--out of 
more than 120--are currently in business.  Moreover, if the DPRK 
maintains its "excessive regulations" and "closed-door policy," the 
remaining joint ventures run the risk of going bankrupt as well, the 
paper asserts. 

   NAEWOE notes that, according to Chon Chin-sik, president of 
Moranbong Joint Venture Co. (one of the major DPRK-Chosen Soren 
joint-venture companies), as relations between Japan and the DPRK 
improved following former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru's 
visit to Pyongyang in September 1990, North Korea moved from mainly 
dealing with Chosen Soren to attempting to "recruit" Japanese 
companies for joint venture projects.  Chon said that during this 
period, North Korea "ignored" Chosen Soren joint-venture companies. 

   Moreover, after the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March 1993, it put "tight" 
restrictions on foreign visitors, including Koreans associated with 
Chosen Soren, and Japanese experts who were to advise the joint- 
venture factories on technical matters, NAEWOE reports.  In 
addition, the energy shortage in North Korea has had an impact on 
Chosen Soren joint ventures as well.  HANGYORE points out that North 
Korea has been giving preferential treatment to domestic companies 
which received their supply of electricity before Chosen Soren 
joint-venture companies.  Furthermore, North Korea has often 
exported substandard goods, causing a loss of credibility for the 
joint ventures and eliciting claims against them, according to 
HANGYORE.  For example, a large quantity of poorly made suits 
manufactured by Moranbong Joint Venture Co. was found at customs 
clearance in Japan last October, NAEWOE says. 

   NAEWOE cites additional reasons behind the difficulties 
experienced by the joint-venture companies, such as North Korea's 
violations of contract provisions,  excessive regulations," multiple 
inspections, and bribery.  North Korea has reportedly marketed goods 
in places that were not stipulated under existing agreements, such 
as Macao and Hong Kong, in order to obtain a better profit margin. 
NAEWOE reports that Chosen Soren "strongly protested" against such 
conduct in 1989 at the 4th annual meeting of Korea International 
Joint Venture Union Co.'s board of directors, which is responsible 
for coordinating and giving guidance to DPEK-Chosen Soren joint- 
venture projects.  The board's yearly meeting, whose purpose is to 
set guidelines for upcoming joint-venture activities, has not been 
held since November 1992, NAEWOE notes. 

   SOUTH KOREA:  FEATURE:  Patent Office Looks for Countermeasures 
to Patent Disputes -- SUMMARY:  According to recent Seoul press 
reports, the number of ROK patent applications is growing, as is the 
number of patent disputes that ROK firms face.  Yet most firms pay 
scant attention to issues of patents and technology protection. 
Recently, the Office of Patent Administration has started setting up 
patent technology councils to foster cooperation among ROK firms and 
help counterbalance patent disputes.  In addition, it has held an 
open forum to discuss reforming the patent judgment system. 

   According to an article in the 9 February CHUGAN MAEGYONG, there 
are four ways to protect ideas using the ROK legal system:  by 
registering patents, utility models, designs, or trademarks.  It 
takes an average of 32 to 34 months to screen a patent or utility 
model application.  While South Korea ranks sixth in the world in 
the number of applications filed for patents or utility models, it 
lacks the systematic backing to help commercialize these ideas, 
according to CHUGAN.  While there are funds available to help cover 
production costs for commercializing new ideas, they only amount to 
about 200 million won ($250,000) annually. 

   The 24 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN (HKS) publishes data from 
the Office of Patent Administration showing that South Koreans 
applied for 21,459 patents in 1993, an increase of 34.5 percent over 
1992.  At the same time patent applications by foreigners dropped 
0.6 percent.  ROK citizens' applications for low-tech utility models 
totaled 31,505, a l2.8-percent increase over 1992, while foreign 
applications fell 3.9 percent.  Design and trademark applications by 
Koreans rose by 20.4 percent and 40.4 percent, respectively. 
Industrial property rights applications rose 22 percent, to 155,870, 
with corporations accounting for 57.9 percent of the total. 
According to HKS, these increases are not caused by an increased 
awareness of the concept of technology as property, but rather they 
are spurred by the growing number of industrial property disputes 
between both domestic and foreign firms. 

   The 29 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN notes that intellectual 
property rights (IPR) disputes are growing in number, and that ROK 
firms do not have sufficient ability to respond to the problem.  The 
Hanbit IPR Center recently surveyed member firms about this issue. 
Of the 153 firms responding, 69.2 percent had been involved in such 
disputes.  For electronics firms, the percentage was even higher- 
-81.3 percent.  Disputes between ROK firms accounted for 50.5 
percent of the cases, while disputes with foreign firms accounted 
for 13.1 percent.  HKS adds that 35.4 percent of the firms had had 
disputes with both domestic and foreign firms.  With regard to 
dispute resolution, HKS reports that 31.3 percent of disputes were 
resolved in court, with the judge finding for one side or the other, 
while 30.3 percent were resolved through compromise.  According to 
HKS, when a dispute involved a foreign firm, ROK firms faced such 
difficulties as a lack of data or technical information (22 
percent), insufficient knowledge of foreign laws (14 percent), and 
high costs (12 percent). 

   Most firms have paid little attention to the issue of patents or 
technology protection, reports the 15 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN. 
According to statistics from the Office of Patent Administration, 
749 manufacturers, or slightly more than 1 percent of all 
manufacturing firms, have set up offices to deal with patent issues. 
Of these, more than 96 percent employ fewer than five workers in 
their patent office.  However, some of the larger firms are devoting 
resources to this area, HKS notes.  Samsung Electronics has a 130- 
member IPR team, Goldstar has a 43-member intellectual property 
management office, and Daewoo Electronics, Goldstar Electron, and 
Hyundai Electronics are all expanding their patent-related offices. 
HKS comments that the most "anxious" organizations within 
electronics firms are those responsible for industrial property 
rights.  Firms must control their technology through patents, the 
paper suggests, and patent experts, who are scarce, should be 
quickly trained.  HKS also notes by cooperating on technology 
development, firms might reduce the burden of industrial property 
rights disputes. 

   There are already moves towards cooperation on a larger scale. 
According to the 4 February MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN (MKS), "patent 
technology councils" are becoming active in high-tech areas.  These 
councils enable firms to share reciprocal licenses or patent rights. 
MKS reports that the Office of Patent Administration is considering 
cooperative "countermeasures" to international patent disputes and 
the rise in foreign countries "patent aggression," and this year 
will set up three new patent technology councils--for computers, 
electric ranges, and construction.  At the end of 1993 it set up 
nine councils, covering washing machines, electronic circuits, 
antibiotics, synthetic textiles, PVC processing technologies, 
organic and inorganic chemistry, waste disposal technology for steel 
producers, and CFC substitutes.  The patent administration believes 
that these councils could indirectly aid firms in technology 
development by supplying information on leading edge technologies. 
MKS predicts that as these councils become more active, cross- 
licensing agreements will flourish.  Another measure which would 
promote technological cooperation--a proposal to grant tax benefits 
to firms that have concluded cross-licensing agreements--is under 
consideration, according to MKS. 

   On the legal front, there are voices calling for establishing a 
"patent court," reports the 25 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN.  On 24 
January, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a public 
forum on the issue of revising the patent judgment system.  At the 
meeting, representatives from business and technology circles 
demanded the establishment of a patent court that includes judges 
who are technical experts.  (According to the 25 January MAEIL 
KYONGJE SINMUN, currently the Office of Patent Administration 
handles an initial patent dispute trial and the first appeal, if 
any.  If those involved in the case still disagree with the ruling, 
they may appeal to the Supreme Court for a third trial.)  Industrial 
circles question the cost, timeliness, and courts' ability to make 
technical judgments under the current system; they recommend setting 
up a patent court.  One industry representative emphasized that in 
patent judgments a factual trial is more important than a legal 
analysis.  HKS reports that patent attorneys oppose letting the 
patent office handle the first and second trials, and suggest 
establishing a patent court composed of both technical and legal 
judges.  Legal circles also oppose the patent office's role, 
maintaining that it is unconstitutional.  According to HKS, this 
group would like to see a patent department set up in the Seoul High 
Court, with the existing court handling matters and bringing in 
technical aides and advisory groups.  Finally, the Office of Patent 
Administration asserts that the current system is legal.  It does, 
however, recognize a drop in the quality of judges.  It recommends 
setting up a patent judgment court within the current framework, and 
raising the number of technical judges to improve the quality of 
judgments. 

   FEATURE:  ROK Efforts in Obtaining Foreign Commercial Technology 
Chronicled -- SUMMARY:  South Korea is using a variety of methods to 
acquire advanced foreign commercial technology, according to ROK 
press reports.  Recognizing a "gap" between the level of technology 
employed by foreign competitors and what is available domestically 
to ROK manufacturers, industry and government are jointly engaged in 
efforts to compensate by appropriating foreign know-how as the basis 
for the country's commercial S and T programs. 

   Seoul business newspapers recently published several articles 
describing efforts by the ROK Government and commercial firms to 
promote economic competitiveness through the use of foreign 
technology.  These methods reportedly include using public funds to 
indigenize foreign high-tech, hiring foreigners with technical 
expertise, collecting technical intelligence through overseas ROK 
subsidiaries, identifying and recruiting expatriate scientists, 
technical "cooperation" with foreign companies, and exploiting cash- 
strapped Russian firms for patented technology (see related article 
in PACIFIC RIM ECONOMIC REVIEW Vol 2 No 20, 6 Oct 93 pp 24-26). 

   The number of cases listed would increase significantly if 
reports of technical agreements, licensed production of foreign 
products, buyouts of foreign firms, "indigenized" products, new 
overseas "research" facilities, and other types of scientific 
"exchanges" (where the transfer or appropriation of foreign 
technology is implied) were also included.  The picture that emerges 
through ROK press reporting in recent months on South Korea's 
intensified quest for technology is that of a country striving to 
close the "gap" with "advanced countries" more through imitation 
than innovation.  This is reflected in the ROK press' habitual use 
of verbs such as "acquire," "accumulate," and "indigenize," while 
the term "develop" is usually restricted to broad technologies with 
little specific content or to ROK efforts to reinvent existing 
products, and the word "create" simply does not appear. 

   South Korea To 'Develop' Laser Disk Drive - The ROK Government 
and domestic computer manufacturers will jointly develop a laser 
disk drive for use with peripheral equipment in next-generation 
computers.  Work began in December 1993 with a 370-million won 
($462,500) grant from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy 
(MOTIE) to the Korea Computer Research Association, which is 
managing the project with Goldstar's and Hyundai Electronics' 
participation.  The drive will be ready for domestic use and export 
by 1997. 

   Goldstar has on hand laser disk drive technology which it 
imported from Japan in 1990.  Hyundai, for its part, obtained "world 
standard" technology from its buyout of the U.S. electronics firm 
Maxter, and claims  we won't have much trouble developing it."  The 
project is also expected to give a big boost to domestic 
manufacturers of recording equipment that uses laser disk 
technology, and could lead to "indigenizing" all parts connected 
with computer memory devices.  (Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 20 Jan 94 
p 15) 

   ROK Companies Hiring More Foreigners - The number of ROK firms 
that hire foreign specialists "to overcome the technological gap 
with competitors in advanced countries" is rising.  Even mid-size 
firms are discovering they can defeat "barricades to technology" 
erected by another country by hiring that country's nationals, 
directly or through overseas subsidiaries.  The latter are sent to 
South Korea periodically "to solve problems that occur on production 
lines and for technical consultations."  The strategy of hiring 
foreigners with technical skills to improve the competitiveness of 
ROK products is likened to "using barbarians to control barbarians." 
(Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 8 Feb 94 p 14) 

   U.S.-Based Subsidiaries Collecting Technical Information - ROK 
factory automation (FA) companies are busily setting up subsidiaries 
abroad to open up new markets for their products, and to "beef up 
their collection of technical information."  Poscon's new subsidiary 
in Delaware, Poscon International Corporation (PIC), will attempt to 
market its own FA products in the United States while it "engages in 
technical information collection activities."  Samsung Aerospace 
will form two "teams" this year for FA equipment exports and control 
equipment exports, while stepping up activities at its U.S. 
subsidiary Samsung Optical America (SOA).  (Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE 
SINMUN 7 Feb 94 p 18) 

   'Brain Pool' To Identify, Recruit Expatriate Scientists - The 
Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) will begin operating a 
"brain pool" this year aimed at inducing high-level scientists 
abroad to come to South Korea and help the country "acquire at an 
early date the newest science, technology, and know-how in the R and 
D stages in advanced countries, and breathe life into the domestic R 
and D scene."  The ministry will recruit 100 "overseas Korean" and 
other foreign scientists in 1994, and if the program is effective 
expand its scope in subsequent years. 

   Recruits will be leading scientists and technicians with more 
than five years postdoctoral experience in their countries of 
residence.  Exceptions will be made for personnel with world class 
achievements who lack these credentials.  South Korea will pay 
round-trip transportation, all moving expenses, and a salary higher 
than that currently received.  A review will be made every six 
months of each individual's performance as a basis for deciding 
whether to continue the contract. 

   The system will allow MOST "to make systematic use of more than 
40,000 expatriate Korean scientific personnel, including the 14,000- 
plus members of the Association of Overseas Korean Scientific and 
Technical Personnel" and "top notch" Western and former-Soviet 
scientists.  MOST is instituting the system "to deal effectively 
with the increasing reluctance of advanced countries lately to 
transfer core technology" and to help "overcome South Korea's 
inferior domestic research and educational environments."  (Seoul 
MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 25 Jan 94 p 13) 

   MOTIE Subsidizes Technical 'Cooperation' With Japan - MOTIE will 
spend 100 billion won ($125 million) between now and 1997 to support 
companies specializing in Japanese exports.  The ministry will also 
solicit greater "technical cooperation" with Japan through the "ROK- 
Japan Technical Cooperation Foundation."  Firms which shipped $1 
million in goods to Japan, and more than 50 percent of their total 
exports, will have up to two-thirds of their R and D costs 
subsidized from a "Basic Industrial Technology Development Fund." 
In addition, some 20 billion won ($25 million dollars) of the $125 
million export subsidy fund will be used to help ROK companies 
market their products in Japan. 

   Technical cooperation with Japan will be facilitated by 3.26 
billion won ($4.075 million) spent on personnel exchanges, 600 
million won ($750,000) to support joint research, 160 million won 
($200,000) on "structural activities for basic industrial 
technological cooperation," and other related subsidies totaling 4.4 
billion won ($5.5 million).  MOTIE will increase the number of 
technicians it sends to Japan for training from 197 in 1993 to more 
than 300.  Another 30 retired Japanese technicians will be invited 
to South Korea to provide "technical guidance" to ROK small and 
medium businesses (SMB's).  (Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 31 Jan 94 p

   ROK Firms Importing Patented Russian Technologies - According to 
the ROK Patents Administration, 41 South Korean companies have 
applied to transfer 365 different patented Russian technologies 
since October 1993.  The ROK firms include 22 conglomerates, 14 
SMB's, and five research institutes, including the Korea Atomic 
Energy Research Institute (KAERI).  Applications by field number 157 
in electricity and electronics, 143 in chemistry, 31 in machinery 
and metals, and 34 others.  (Seoul HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN 31 Jan 94 p

   FEATURE:  Electronics Companies Focusing on Large Screen TV's - 
SUMMARY:  South Korean electronics firms are marketing a variety of 
large screen color televisions, including conventional designs with 
screens up to 46 inches, and newer "widescreen" models which make 
use of redesigned picture tubes for a flatter chassis, according to 
Seoul press reports.  At least one ROK firm is seeking to apply 
plasma display technology to "multivision" TV's with screens more 
than eight feet wide.  The industry regards these products as 
"transitional" steps on the way to high-definition equipment now 
being developed. 

   South Korean electronics manufacturers are turning their 
attention to large screen color televisions in response to 
increasing demand for upscale commercial appliances both 
domestically and abroad.  According to the 9-16 February CHUGAN 
MAEGYONG, large color TV's held 5 percent of the ROK market in 1990, 
11 percent in 1991, 21 percent in 1992, and 27 percent last year (35 
percent by value).  At present, the most popular models are 25-inch 
sets which have 70 percent of the large screen market, 29-inch with 
25 percent of the market, and 33-inch with 4 percent.  A small 
number of homes have 42-inch and 46-inch projection TV's, the 
magazine reports. 

   These units, whose verticle-to-horizontal dimensions have a fixed 
ratio of 3:4, differ from the widescreen color TV's just now being 
marketed which are proportionately wider and based on different 
technology.  According to the 9 January MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN (MKS), 
South Korea's first domestic widescreen television--a 36-inch model- 
-was introduced in February 1993 by Goldstar.  A follow-up model 
with a 32-inch screen that can project as many as four pictures on 
the same screen (picture-in-picture or PIP) came out at the end of 
last year.  Goldstar expects 1994 sales of the two models to reach 
2,000 and 6,000 sets, respectively.  Samsung Electronics recently 
introduced its own 32-inch widescreen model with PIP and 
stereophonic sound, and is bringing out a 28-inch model later in 
1994.  Total sales are expected to pass 10,000.  Daewoo and Anam 
reportedly will market competitive products shortly. 

   Meanwhile, the 11 January MKS reports that Samsung Electron 
Devices has made South Korea the "second country after Japan" to 
develop a flat cathode ray tube for widescreen TV.  The company 
spent one year and 5 billion won ($6.25 million) "indigenizing" the 
part which will be used in 32-inch screens.  The tube reportedly is 
"twice as flat" as existing models.  It uses a 32.5 mm electron gun 
(down from 37.5 mm) and Samsung's "double dynamic focus" system to 
produce clear pictures.  The newspaper reports the tube will be used 
in widescreen televisions just now being produced in South Korea, 
and in the high-definition television (HDTV) sets of the future. 
The 9 January MKS states that the ROK electronics industry views 
widescreen TV as a "transitional by-product" of HDTV, which is 
expected to "dominate" the market by the year 2000. 

   In a related development, the 10 February Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO 
reports that Orion Electronics, a subsidiary of the Daewoo Group, 
has established a joint venture with Russia's Gas Discharge 
Equipment Research Lab (under the jurisdiction of Russia's Munitions 
Industrial Committee) to produce plasma display panels (PDP's).  The 
equipment, originally produced for Russia's aerospace program, 
reportedly is being designed for use with extra large 
("multivision") televisions with 100-inch plus displays.  According 
to the newspaper, PDP's are much narrower than conventional cathode 
ray tubes, and offer a brighter screen than liquid crystal displays 
(LCD's).  The new company, Orion Plasma Research and Production, 
will be located southeast of Moscow.  Each partner will supply half 
of the $4-million capital. 

   Government Committee Devising NAFTA Countermeasures - On 24 
January, the ROK Government's "NAFTA Countermeasures Committee" 
consisting of 17 members from trade-related agencies and industry 
met to discuss a "new strategy" that entails increasing local 
investment, moving "full-scale" into the U.S. distribution market, 
relying on trade diplomacy, and strengthening industrial 
technological "cooperation."  The committee agreed that plans to 
secure a share of the North American market will be frustrated 
unless accompanied by direct local investment.  In those sectors 
where South Korean exports lose their competitiveness to Mexican 
goods which enter the United States duty free, South Korea will 
react by reducing distribution expenses through more aggressive 
export marketing.  A fact-finding team will be sent to the United 
States in the first half of 1994 to survey the distribution market, 
while ROK companies are encouraged to participate in U.S. trade 
exhibitions and make other efforts to find local vendors. 
Competitiveness of South Korean products will also be enhanced by 
strengthening technological "cooperation" through the ROK-U.S. 
Industrial Cooperation Foundation.  In terms of diplomacy, South 
Korea will use the Uruguay Round and bilateral trade negotiating 
forums to check NAFTA's "excessive discrimination" against non- 
member countries as evidenced, for example, in its stringent 
country-of-origin criteria.  The committee plans to have a "full- 
blown NAFTA strategy" ready by March this year.  (Seoul MAEIL

   Study Compares ROK and Japanese Overseas Investment Strategies - 
The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry has published a 
"Comparative Study of Direct Overseas Investment Strategies by South 
Korean and Japanese Companies."  The study points out that Japan 
follows a two-part strategy of manufacturing high value-added, high- 
tech products at home while farming out medium and low value-added 
work to overseas production sites.  Also, Japan continuously shifts 
its overseas sites depending on the manufacturing cost and the 
"technological level of the product targeted for investment" so that 
no country obtains more technology than what it already has. 

   Conversely, the study notes that ROK firms appreciate less the 
need to keep technology out of other countries' hands, and are 
concerned only with raising productivity at the overseas site.  It 
adds that South Korean companies take high risks, by Japanese 
standards, in moving production to countries such as China, Vietnam, 
and Burma without making a full analysis of the situation and with 
no means to deal with unfavorable changes that may develop.  Japan's 
ability to keep high technology at home and diversify its overseas 
labor sites effectively "squeezes" ROK firms which are adept at 
doing neither.  (Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 26 Jan 94 p 12) 

   KDI Approves of Samsung's Entry Into Auto Production - The Korea 
Development Institute (KDI), a national policy group with close ties 
to the ROK Government, recently reported it "agrees in principle" 
with Samsung's bid to enter the passenger car market.  KDI 
acknowledged that "overlapping investment" would be inefficient in 
terms of the domestic market, but that exports could expand with the 
enhanced competitiveness that Samsung's entry would help bring 
about.  KDI observed that instead of putting "unreasonable 
restrictions" on the auto industry, government should support it by 
investing in related R and D and training of personnel.  KDI's 
approval follows a similar recommendation made last November at a 
seminar of international experts.  The findings are expected to have 
a major impact on the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and 
Trade's recommendation to the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and 
Energy this April.  (Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 17 Jan 94 p 3)

   SOUTHEAST ASIA:  INDONESIA - FEATURE:  Government Urged To Reduce 
Cost of Economy -- SUMMARY:  Jakarta press sources recently reported 
the views of several economists on Indonesia's "high cost economy." 
These economists stress the need to stimulate overall economic 
activity, reduce production costs, and attain better productivity 
and efficiency, so that Indonesia can achieve economic growth as 
well as become more competitive in overseas markets. 

   Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, President Suharto's senior economic 
advisor, recently expressed his concern over Indonesia's high cost 
economy and his remarks were cited in several major Jakarta dailies 
on 22 January.  Sumitro's analysis of the economic situation, as 
reported in BISNIS INDONESIA, KOMPAS, SUARA PEMBARUAN, and MERDEKA, 
is based on a "capital-output ratio," using quantitative and 
empirical data, as well as statistical figures from the Central 
Bureau of Statistics.  Sumitro's conclusion is that Indonesia's 
economic development has been "less efficient and less effective" 
compared with other ASEAN countries whose economies are 
"structurally similar."  The papers also note that Sumitro 
attributes this "undesirable situation" to the "large amounts of 
waste and losses," caused by mismanagement; investments in 
infrastructure that have slow or little yield; "incompetence" in 
planning, operating, and maintaining investment projects; and 
"irregularities" such as graft. 

   BISNIS INDONESIA reports that during Indonesia's fifth Five-Year 
Development Plan (1989-1994), public and private investments 
amounted to 33.4 percent of the national income, with annual 
economic growth at 6.8 percent.  Based on these figures, the 
incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) is 33.4 : 6.8 = 4.9 or 5. 
This ICOR, Sumitro points out, is "somewhat high" compared to the 
ratios for other ASEAN countries, which generally range from 3 to 
3.5.  Sumitro suggests that a reduction in the cost of the economy 
will ultimately result in Indonesia's becoming more competitive 
abroad and in a higher economic growth for the country; he adds that 
if the ICOR during the second stage of Indonesia's long-term 
development cycle could be reduced to 3.5, and if investments remain 
at 33.4 percent of national income, Indonesia could achieve an 
annual growth of 9.5 percent (33.4 : 3.5). 

   Sumitro's assessment of the country's economic situation 
coincides with that of Rizal Ramly, executive director of the 
economic, industrial, and trade consulting firm Ekonit.  According 
to a 23 January KOMPAS editorial, Rizal believes that new measures 
to directly address Indonesia's high cost economy should be worked 
out and implemented in order to improve the country's 
competitiveness in overseas markets. 

   Economists Priasmoro Prawiroardjo and Hadi Soesastro of the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies share Rizal's view 
that a new set of deregulation policies is deeded.  According to the 
22 January KOMPAS, Hadi believes that improving the business climate 
would play an important role in stimulating overall economic 
activity and in improving efficiency in the industrial sector, while 
Priasmoro views production efficiency as the key problem that 
Indonesian exporters must overcome to penetrate the world market. 
Priasmoro stresses that cutting back on production cost alone will 
not be enough and that improved macroeconomic conditions are also 
necessary.  Moreover, he asserts that implementation of the 
agreements reached at the Uruguay Round will pose more challenges 
than opportunities to the Indonesian industrial sector.  He also 
points out that Indonesia's electronic industrialists are already 
concerned about the competition that will come from AFTA (Asean Free 
Trade Area).  They fear that under the Common Effective Preferential 
Tariff (CEPT) plan of AFTA, the market will be saturated with 
electronic products from Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.  And 
because of the time-consuming procedures and "unpredictable costs" 
associated with investing in Indonesia (such as "illegal levies" 
that have to be paid to obtain business licenses), these 
industrialists predict that other Indonesian products have little 
chance of getting a share of the international market, KOMPAS 
reports. 

   FEATURE:  Workers Strike as Government Enforces Minimum Wage 
Decree -- SUMMARY:  Several Jakarta newspapers report that thousands 
of employees went on strike recently to demand better treatment by 
their employers and an increase to the $2 daily minimum wage 
recently set by the government for Jakarta and its surrounding 
areas. 

   The 4 February ANGKATAN BERSENJATA and SUARA PEMBARUAN report 
that thousands of employees of several companies in the Tangerang 
area went on strike three weeks after a ministerial decree on an 
increase in daily minimum wage went into effect on 1 January.  The 
strikes occurred after employers turned down the employees' demand 
for a 26-percent increase in the daily minimum wage--which is 
approximately $2--set by the government.  In Bekasi, 30 km east of 
Jakarta, 1,200 workers from five companies went on strike early last 
week, according to the 7 February ANGKATAN BERSENJATA.  In addition 
to a salary increase, workers demanded that companies grant them 
better benefits and special allowances.  The paper also states that 
reports from Bandung indicate that hundreds of employees went on 
strike for the same reasons as their counterparts in Bekasi, while 
hundreds of workers from Bogor demonstrated in front of the Ministry 
of Manpower.  The demonstration prompted a government investigation 
into allegations that employers are violating the minimum wage 
regulations, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA says. 

   SUARA PEMBARUAN notes that most employers have proposed that the 
decree enforcement be postponed until April, citing the need for 
more time to adjust their payrolls, not only in connection with the 
wage hike but also for the annual "Lebaran" (festivities at the end 
of the fasting month) bonus in March.  The paper also quotes 
Tangerang Regent Saifullah Abdulrahman who said that out of 870 
companies in the region, at least 80 small and medium firms cannot 
afford to pay their workers a daily minimum wage of $2.  Saifullah 
stated that some of the firms have even filed a protest to the 
Ministry of Manpower and have enclosed their financial statements. 
However, the paper continues, Manpower Minister Abdul Latief has 
stated that based on the outcome of a recent survey on cost 
structure, companies are in fact capable of and should be paying 
their workers more.  Latief said that labor cost averages only 9.8 
percent of total production cost, which is "too small."  He also 
asserted that, according to the All-Indonesia Labor Union (SPSI), 
some companies in the shoe industry have spent only 2 percent of 
their total operational budget on labor.  SPSI General Secretary 
Bomer Pasaribu attributes this "deplorable situation" to the fact 
that employers have always regarded wages as part of production 
cost, subject to reduction, and hence wages have always been 
suppressed. 

   Minister Latief warns businesses that more strikes will occur 
prior to Lebaran, unless employers become more responsive to 
workers' demand for better pay and better benefits, ANGKATAN 
BERSENJATA reports.  The paper also quotes Aburizal Bakrie, chairman 
of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who called on 
all employers to willingly comply with the minimum wage regulation. 
Bakrie said that "workers are assets, not production tools," and 
that the minimum wage is set at "a low level so companies won't be 
burdened." 

   According to the 8 February KOMPAS, the government is determined 
to make companies comply with the minimum wage regulation.  The 
paper says that President Suharto has ordered his cabinet ministers 
to make a list of the companies that violate the regulation and/or 
operate without a labor union, and to take the necessary steps 
against them.  The president has stated that employers should not be 
concerned with profits only, but that they must also pay attention 
to the rights and welfare of workers, the paper reports. 

   Central Bank Needs $400-Million 'Standby Loan' - The Bank of 
Indonesia (Central Bank) recently announced that Indonesia has 
tasked six international banks to come up with a $400-million 
"standby loan."  The six banks include Banque Nationale de Paris, 
Bank of Tokyo in Hong Kong, Chase Manhattan Asia, Dresdner, 
Industrial Bank of Japan, and Long Term Credit Bank, Asia. 

   The seven-year loan will be signed in March, with a utility 
period of five years after the loan is signed.  It will be repaid in 
five installments every six months, starting at the end of the first 
five years.  The interest for the first two years is set at 0.75 
percent above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), and in the 
third year, the interest will increase to 0.875 percent above LIBOR. 

   Former Finance Minister Frans Seda said the loan will only be 
used in the event the government is unable to pay for non-oil/gas 
imports, or as a safeguard for the balance of payments.  (Jakarta

is meant to force the national company P.T. Krakatau Steel to become

   VIETNAM:  FEATURE:  Losses in Rice Export Earnings Reported -- 
SUMMARY:  A Hanoi press report notes that Vietnamese rice dealers 
suffered losses of about $2 million in rice export earnings in 
October 1993, mainly because of a shortage of funds and stiff 
competition among the dealers.  The same report shows that Vietnam 
currently ranks third among world rice exporters and points out the 
need for changes in the State's management of rice export. 

   According to a 22 August 1993 Hanoi VNA report, between 1989 and 
1992, Vietnam exported 5.76 million metric tons of rice worth over 
$1 billion.  The 5 January THOI BAO KINH TE VIET NAM notes that in 
the last three years, the country has exported a yearly average of 
about 1.7 million metric tons of rice, which brought in revenues 
that are second only to earnings from  crude oil export.  The 6-12 
January TUAN BAO QUOC TE points out that although Vietnam currently 
ranks third among world rice exporters, rice dealers have registered 
losses of about $2 million in October 1993, in exporting more than 
100,000 metric tons of rice. 

   TUAN BAO QUOC TE (TBQT) suggests that one of the main reasons for 
the losses in rice export earnings is the stiff competition between 
rice dealers, resulting in rising domestic purchase prices and 
falling export prices.  Another reason cited by the newspaper is 
poor management" by the State.  Despite a government directive to 
reduce the number of principal rice exporters to 17, there were 
still over 40 exporters in November 1993, since any firm with a 
contract listing prices commensurate with government prices could 
obtain an export permit, including those who did not have storage 
space or processing mills. 
   TBQT also cites the shortage of funds used to buy rice as a 
problem.  Some $200 million were actually required to purchase rice 
in the Mekong River delta, but the largest amount received was only 
$740,000 and the smallest $45,000, while small enterprises received 
only 10 percent of the funds needed.  According to TBQT, few firms 
want to sign big contracts and take out loans to buy rice for export 
ahead of time, but they will rush out to make rice purchases only 
when customers offer letters of credit and ships start to come in. 

   TBQT reports that Vietnamese rice export increased from 1.42 
million metric tons in 1989 to 1.95 million metric tons in 1992, and 
totaled 1.7 million metric tons in 1993.  The number of countries 
who have signed purchase contracts with Vietnam has also increased 
from 24 in 1992 to 50 in 1993.  The quality of the exported rice is 
reportedly improving each year, with an increasingly smaller 
percentage of broken rice.  Currently, prices for Vietnamese rice 
are $50-$60 less per metric ton than Thai rice of the same quality. 

   TBQT concludes that to achieve success in rice export, the State 
needs to improve its management system, strengthen the Union of 
Grain Exporters, and give rice exporters regular guidance on 
domestic and international trade regulations in order to avoid the 
kind of losses experienced in the last quarter of 1993. 

   Government To Approve Foreign Construction of Infrastructure 
Projects - The Vietnamese Government will reportedly prepare 
legislation to implement a system whereby foreign companies will 
undertake the construction of infrastructural projects on a turnkey, 
or "build, operate, and transfer" (BOT) basis.  This "BOT-style" 
system involves entrusting all matters concerning infrastructural 
projects to foreign companies, from financing to construction and 
actual operation.  The government has "great expectations" for this 
system, since it will not have to provide financing and because 
foreign firms will contribute management and other knowhow to 
Vietnam.  China and Southeast Asian countries have successfully used 
the BOT system to build power-generating facilities and highways. 

   In the first half of March, the Vietnam State Committee for 
Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) plans to hold a "forum on BOT- 
style investment" in Hanoi for foreign financial organs and 
development companies.  At that time the SCCI will announce 
regulations concerning BOT bidding and contracting. 

   However, there have been "many problems" with the BOT system 
involving contracts let by government agencies and the companies 
signing them, as exemplified by the recent withdrawal of Japanese 
companies from an expressway construction project in Thailand.  In 
Vietnam's case, there probably will be difficulties over the long 
term in collecting fees from completed generating plants, highways, 
and bridges.  And even if some financing consortiums are formed, 
they will adopt a "cautious stance" regarding involvement in 
Vietnam.  It appears that initially, banks controlled by overseas

   Government To Develop 'Core' Groups of State Enterprises - 
According to an article in the 19 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN by 
Makoto Suzuki, the paper's Hanoi correspondent, the Vietnamese 
Government has decided to make the development of "core enterprise 
groups" from among major state enterprises a "pillar" of its 
economic restructuring program.  Although the government has been 
making efforts to nurture private companies as part of its economic 
reform measures, private companies still remain "weak."  Thus, the 
government's plan is to use selected "core" state enterprises as 
"locomotives" of economic growth. 

   As soon as possible, a list of candidate firms from among 
enterprises currently under the control of government agencies will 
be presented to Prime Minister Vo Van Khiet.  Then a "limited 
number" of core groups will be established--more will be designated 
later--and they will be removed from the control of ministries and 
agencies, "placed directly under the government," run 
"experimentally," and gradually will be expanded. 

   Suzuki writes that as explained by Le Xuan Trinh, minister and 
director of the Government Office, these core enterprises will be 
developed into "powerful" groups with capital levels of "several 
trillion" dong (several hundred million dollars).  Also, each group 
will have "several dozen umbrella companies" under it.  According to 
Trinh, companies under the Energy Ministry and the postal and 
communications authorities "will be the first" to be transferred. 

   Reorganizing state enterprises is one of the government's basic 
policy goals, Suzuki notes, along with privatization and 
reorganizing loss-making enterprises.  In this process, developing 
core enterprise groups appears to be a "precise" policy of 
selectively developing "superior" state enterprises. 

   Banking Association To Include Domestic, Foreign Banks - Vietnam 
will establish a Banking Association by mid-1994 that is expected to 
bring together various domestic financial institutions as well as 
foreign banks operating in Vietnam.  The government intends to use 
their views in modernizing Vietnam's financial system. 

   There are four types of financial institutions in Vietnam, in 
addition to Vietnam's State Bank--state-owned commercial banks, 
private joint-venture banks, credit cooperatives, and finance 
companies (nonbanks). There are "more than 20 large and medium-size" 
state-owned commercial banks and private joint-venture banks.  About 
40 domestic financial organizations intend to join the association. 
As for foreign banks, there are more than 30 operating in Vietnam 
through branches, joint ventures, or resident offices. 

   Among Japanese banks, Tokyo and Sakura Banks, which already have 
resident offices in Ho Chi Minh City, are expected to join the new 
association.  Also, it is anticipated that American banks will 
quickly enter Vietnam now that the economic embargo has been lifted. 
However, since foreign banks are "uneasy" about doing business in 
Vietnam because of the country's undeveloped financial markets, 
Japanese and other foreign banks hope to use the Banking Association 
to propose ways the Vietnamese Government might regulate the 
industry.  (Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN 22 Feb 94 p 2) 

   Finance Ministry Personnel To Study Japan's Securities Industry - 
In June, Nikko Securities, one of Japan's "big four" securities 
companies, will invite 15 employees of Vietnam's Finance Ministry to 
study Japan's stock exchange regulatory system.  Ten members of the 
group will be regular ministry employees and five are students that 
will be joining the ministry.  During their month-long stay, the 
group will visit the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, 
securities firms, and listed companies to study market regulations, 
regulation of securities sales, and market settlement issues. 

   Vietnam is planning to establish a stock exchange in Ho Chi Minh 
City, but whether the exchange will actually be opened this year, 
given delays in preparing its regulatory systems and slowness in 
issuing stock of government-owned companies, has become a "delicate" 
issue. 

   Anticipating that American investment banks will begin operations 
in Vietnam with the lifting of economic sanctions, Japanese 
securities firms and banks "are quickly establishing close personal 
ties (jimmyaku) with the Vietnamese Government so as not to lag 
behind."  (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 Feb 94 p 8)

<H3> <TI>      Yeltsin Angry At President Nixon Meeting Opponents </TI></H3>

</HEADER>


<TEXT>
SUMMARY 
                              Russian President Boris Yeltsin reacted angrily to former U.S. 
President Richard Nixon's meetings in Moscow with opposition 
leaders, including former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy, who 
had only recently been released from prison.  Despite his harsh 
reaction, he appeared to attempt to minimize the damage to U.S.- 
Russian relations.  Nevertheless, his reaction and the initial 
treatment of the incident by the Russian media suggest that 
Moscow is concerned that the United States may be reevaluating 
its policy toward his administration. 
                           END SUMMARY 
   Yeltsin angrily announced cancellation of his meeting with the 
former U.S. President on 9 March.  He told reporters that it was 
"impossible" for him to meet Richard Nixon after the latter's 8 
March meetings with Rutskoy, recently released from jail under an 
amnesty approved by the Russian legislature over Yeltsin's 
opposition, and Communist party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. 
Yeltsin stressed that neither he, the government, nor his chief 
of staff--all scheduled to meet with former President Nixon- 
-would now receive him.  Further highlighting his displeasure, 
Yeltsin stressed that "Russia is a great country" and "simply 
cannot be trifled with" (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, (9 March). 
   Yeltsin appeared concerned to limit the damage to relations with 
the United States while at the same time giving an implicit 
warning that bilateral relations could be harmed by such 
incidents.  He noted that he was "impressed" with the position 
taken by U.S. President Bill Clinton who he said had phoned him 
and "distanced himself from [former President] Nixon's trip," and 
stressed that the "U.S.-Russian partnership must be preserved and 
developed" as a "great achievement" that "we worked very hard for 
and we must not lose" (ITAR-TASS, 9 March). 
   Similarly, the Russian Foreign Ministry appeared to distance 
itself and the U.S. government from the former president's visit. 
According to Interfax, the ministry said that it "has nothing to 
do with [former President] Nixon's visit" and the news agency 
quoted a "high-ranking" Russian diplomat as saying that the 
ministry "would have monitored" the visit "had the American 
embassy been in charge of it" (9 March). 
   In contrast, Zyuganov and the Russian Communist Party's press 
service portrayed the meeting with former President Nixon as a 
deliberate effort by the U.S. government to broaden its contacts 
within Russia.  Claiming that the ex-president's meeting with 
Zyuganov will give U.S. officials a more realistic picture of 
what is happening in Russia, the press service announced that the 
meeting "proves" that such a "better understanding" is what the 
U.S. leadership wants.  Zyuganov himself claimed that the 
Communists and "all Russian patriotic movements" were "concerned 
over the inflexible U.S. approach to Russian political forces" 
and "believed that the growth in anti-American sentiment in 
Russia" was connected with "U.S. unconditional support for the 
present unpopular executive power" (Interfax, 9 March). 
   Media Coverage 
   Russian media coverage of the visit, as presented on 9 March, 
after his meeting with Rutskoy, was negative.  ITAR-TASS, citing 
"competent sources" on the reasons behind the cancellation of the 
government meetings, said that the former president's initiatives 
had been seen "as a sign of disrespect for the political will of 
the Russian leadership."  One Russian television commentary (see 
box)--describing Rutskoy as a "recent Lefortovo [prison] inmate"- 
-linked former President Nixon's meetings with what it claimed 
was recent U.S. "maneuvering" on foreign policy toward Russia and 
wondered "what's going on in American foreign policy," and if 
there was a "change of politicial direction" in Washington 
(Russian TV, 9 March). 
   Implications 
   Yeltsin's angry response to what he portrayed as a personal and 
political insult suggests a concern that the United States is 
reevaluating its relationship with Russia and with him 
personally.  Yeltsin's sharp reaction and the media coverage of 
the incident so far is consistent with previous Russian reaction 
to what are seen as the U.S. administration's efforts to review 
its policy toward Russia. 
   BOX 
   State-run Russian Television's coverage of former U.S. President 
Richard Nixon's visit to Moscow included what appears to be a 
deliberate attempt to raise questions about U.S. policy toward 
Russia and dramatize the Yeltsin administration's decision to 
cancel meetings with him. 
   The coverage of the visit on the 1100 GMT newscast on 9 March 
began with a commentary on relations between Russia and the 
United States which claimed that recent visits to the U.S. by 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Georgian President Eduard 
Shevardnadze had led to agreements with the U.S. that were 
"revisions" of agreements previously reached "with Russian 
participation."  The commentator, G. Shakhov then turned to the 
"private" visit by former President Nixon, noting that the latter 
"considered it necessary" to meet the previous day with former 
Vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and Russian Communist Party 
leader Gennadiy Zyuganov but "only today" intended to meet with 
leading officials such as Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
Administration Leader Sergey Filatov.  Shakov also noted the 
former President's intention to meet with Liberal Democratic 
Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and concluded his commentary 
by asking rhetorically whether "all this" is a foreign policy 
"maneuver" by the U.S. or a "change in political orientation." 
   The news anchor then reported that Richard Nixon was 'expected" 
to meet with Chernomyrdin and Filatov and hoped to meet with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.  The report was followed by 
another commentary, seemingly designed to embarrass both former 
President Nixon and U.S. President Bill Clinton and to suggest 
that former President Nixon would be reporting to President 
Clinton on his Russian visit.  The commentor noted that when he 
returned to the United States, the former president would be able 
to share not only his impressions from Moscow but also his "rich 
experience" in political scandals, asserting that President 
Clinton had already "suffered through" some "unpleasant moments" 
due to the "Whitewater scandal."  The news anchor concluded the 
program's coverage of the visit with an announcement that he had 
"just received" a report from ITAR-TASS that the "planned" 
meetings with Chernomyrdin and Filatov would not take place. 
ITAR-TASS was first observed to have run this report at 0745 GMT, 
more than three hours prior to the beginning of the news 
broadcast.

<H3> <TI>      Rabin, Peres Hint At Dismantling Settlements </TI></H3>


</HEADER>


<TEXT>
In     the wake of the Hebron massacre, both Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have hinted that the 
Israeli Government is laying the groundwork for dismantling a few 
controversial Jewish settlements.  Both leaders appear concerned 
to present any such action as a unilateral Israeli decision to 
head off criticism that they are bowing to Palestinian demands on 
the settlements, an issue which was to have been deferred to 
final status negotiations under the Israel-PLO Declaration of 
Principles (DOP).  Rabin seemed deliberately vague in a recent 
interview when asked if he favored moving settlers from the town 
of Hebron, where several small settler enclaves have become a 
focus of attention following the massacre.  He first said "I will 
not answer" the question, then went on to point out that the DOP 
did not call for moving settlements during the current phase of 
negotiations.  Therefore, he continued, there is no requirement 
to move any settlers "on the basis of the negotiations with the 
PLO" and the matter is "currently not on the agenda" of the 
negotiations, a position that seemed to leave open the 
possibility of action taken outside the framework of Israel- 
Palestinian talks.  Rabin also hinted that he is willing to 
negotiate with Yasir 'Arafat over the PLO leader's demand for an 
armed international observer force in the occupied territories, 
twice telling his interviewer "I do not conduct negotiations with 
['Arafat] through you" when pressed on the matter (IDF radio, 8 
March). 

   Peres, who prior to the massacre had openly questioned the 
justification for preserving a small settlement in the Gaza 
Strip, (Qol Yisra'el radio, 12 February) reportedly echoed 
Rabin's remarks on settlements in speaking with journalists on 8 
March.  As reported by The Jerusalem Post the next day, he said 
that "public opinion must be prepared for the possible 
dismantling of some settlements," but that the question of 
settlements "is an internal Israeli affair" and "completely 
divorced from the current negotiations with the PLO."  He 
explained that the Israeli Government had insisted on deferring 
the settlement issue to final status negotiations while 
negotiating the DOP in order to minimize public opposition to the 
DOP.  The government, he said, would "seek to convince the 
public" that evacuating some settlements "needs to be done," but 
"it cannot come as a result of PLO demands."

   France: Reaction to 'Super 301,' Fish Import Controversy 

   Super 301 Trade Legislation 

   Recent French commentary and reporting on the decision by 
President Bill Clinton to revive "Super 301" trade retaliation 
legislation to pressure Japan into opening its markets to U.S. goods 
has been mostly critical of the U.S. decision and has expressed fear 
over its effect on the completion of the final version of the GATT 
Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh on 12-15 April.  An article in 
the 7 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES stated that the revival of Super 
301 "can only add to the difficulties faced by the (EU) Twelve in 
speaking with one voice in Marrakesh..."  However, the 7 March LA 
TRIBUNE DESFOSSES article pointed out that "in Brussels, as in other 
capitals, everyone is convinced that (President) Clinton's decision 
is targeted to intimidate only Japan," not the EU. 

   French press reporting also contained the following official 
statements, most of which were also critical of the United States. 
For example: 

   * GATT Director Peter Sutherland:  Sutherland was quoted as 
saying the U.S. action is "a new effort in bilateral trade, which is 
about to test the results obtained in the Uruguay Round before they 
are even implemented."  (LIBERATION 4 Mar 94)  "The concept of 
managed trade constitutes a dangerous and unfortunate notion.  When 
bureaucrats interfere (in trade), the potential of risks increases." 
(LE FIGARO 4 Mar 94) 

   * Prime Minister Edouard Balladur:  "Happy to get rid of the 
label of bad boy of world trade," Balladur stated that the Super 301 
decision "completely validates the French position that one cannot 
have a system of free trade where each country creates its own 
justice." (LIBERATION 5, 6 Mar 94)  "It is the negation of an 
international free trade system, which is what we have always said 
it was." (LE FIGARO 5, 6 Mar 94)  Balladur, criticizing U.S. 
"threats" against France as a "breach of the rules of the game," 
declared, "It is proof that we are right to ask for the suppression 
of Super 301.  If we do not, the Uruguay Round agreement will only 
be hot air." (LES ECHOS 7 Mar 94) 

   Despite the negative comments by these officials, the press did 
report a more positive assessment: 

   * EU Officials:  An article in LIBERATION claims that while 
officials in the EU are declaring that they are hostile to the U.S. 
unilateral approach on trade with Japan, in private "some officials" 
understand U.S. "aggravation," acknowledging that the United States 
"had first tried everything, all in vain."  The article cites one of 
these unnamed official sources as saying, "This (Super 301) affair 
may threaten to deteriorate the climate of trust a bit more, 
especially in financial markets.  But, if it ends in the Japanese 
making a gesture, in them launching a real budgetary effort to 
stimulate domestic demand, then Europe will profit from it." 
(LIBERATION 4 March 94) 

   U.S.-France Fish Dispute 

   The press also noted coUents on the U.S.-France dispute over 
U.S. fish imports to France, on which France had imposed strict 
inspection regulations, prompting the United States to propose 
retaliation against French cheese.  An editorial in the 7 March LA 
TRIBUNE DESFOSSES stated that the United States "threatened" 
retaliation because "the Clinton administration has acted under 
pressure from the National Fisheries Institute and the shipowners' 
lobby, arguing that Massachusetts fishermen were losing $200,000 a 
week because of the restrictions on Fish imports imposed by France." 
The press also reported the following official comments: 

   * Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's Staff:  Viewing the 
retaliation threat as an indication of a tougher U.S. trade policy, 
Balladur's staff contended, "If the United States is stepping up the 
pressure on international trade, it is to cast doubt on the Uruguay 
Round's main achievement, which their Senate refuses to consider: 
the institutionalization of a World Trade Organization." (LA TRIBUNE 
DESFOSSES 7 Mar 94) 

   Foreign Minister Alain Juppe:  "Our decision (regarding fish 
imports) conformed perfectly with the applicable Community 
regulations.  If the United States engages in retaliatory measures 
against France, they will be responsible for an escalation (of trade 
tensions) just when we are preparing for the Marrakesh 
conference....  One should ask if this would be a good signal."  (LE 
FIGARO 5, 6 Mar 94) (DiI) 

   FINLAND 

   STUDY FINDS JOB TRAINING SUCCEEDING--According to a recent study, 
the national adult vocational training program has been enjoying 
some success in the greater Helsinki region.  The study, conducted 
in Uusimaa Province Labor District, which includes the densely 
populated Helsinki region, found that one of every three district 
trainees finds a job within two months of leaving the program.  Kari 
Kiuru, writing in the 25 February HELSINGIN SANOMAT, claims much of 
the program's success is due to its flexibility in responding to job 
market changes.  Officials constantly monitor these changes and 
solicit suggestions from industry on, for example, training programs 
which could fit the needs of laid-off workers.  New or expanded 
courses, however, cannot always keep up with rapid changes in 
student demands.  The boom in the export sector, for example, has 
led to a recent surge of applications for relevant training:  200 
people applied for just 20 available spaces this year. 

   In 1994, Uusimaa District will receive 163 million markkas, which 
will allow it to accept 12,000 students, or about one-tenth of the 
the area's unemployed.  The district will offer a wide variety of 
training opportunities, covering about 100 job fields and divided 
into some 800 separate courses.  Training lasts anywhere from one 
month to as much as an entire year.  (RB)

   FRANCE 

   BALLADUR MODERATES CIP PROVISIONS--Faced with mounting criticism 
from labor unions and student demonstrations, Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur has made "important" concessions to change the new 
Professional Insertion Contract (CIP), a measure which has been 
denounced by labor, student, and opposition forces as a 
discriminatory "Youth Minimum Wage."  According to Delphine Girard 
writing in the 4 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Balladur made these 
concessions to calm the "social tempest" he created in approving a 
law to implement the CIP, which originally would have allowed 
employers to hire those under 26 years of age--even those with a 
junior college degree--for 80 percent of France's guaranteed minimum 
wage (SMIC) and would have required that the company provide a 
mentor "to help the new employee to begin his career."  Balladur has 
agreed to "redefine" the CIP, stating that mentors must provide real 
training within the company."  He has also replaced the provision 
allowing junior college hirees to be paid at 80 percent of the SMIG 
with the stipulation they must be paid instead at 80 percent of the 
"conventional minimum wage" of the industry, which cannot be below 
the regular SMIC.  Those with no degree, however, may still be hired 
at the below-minimum-wage rate. 

   Balladur's concessions were made not only under pressure from 
labor, students, and opposition groups but also from members of his 
own governing coalition.  An article in the 3 March LA TRIBUNE 
DESFOSSES reported that former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac entered 
the debate, having declared "a Youth Minimum Wage is an ill-adapted 
way to solve unemployment," bringing with it "important 
inconveniences."  An article in the 4, 5 March LES ECHOS noted that 
Chirac had added, "If we allow companies to hire young people with a 
salary less than the SMIC, the difference must be counterbalanced by 
real training in the company..."  The UDF Youth Movement also made 
public its objection to Balladur's choice of fighting youth 
unemployment, asking him to "review his options."  The president of 
the finance committee of the National Assembly, Jacques Barrot, 
contended that "the text of the implementation law on CIP is not 
satisfactory," and that the tutorial obligations of companies using 
the CIP must be better defined.  He also said that "more detailed 
coordination on the strategies taken toward junior college graduates 
is needed." 

   Despite Balladur relenting to these pressures and subsequently 
redefining the CIP provisions, the labor unions are not convinced he 
has gone far enough, Girard continues in the 4 March LA TRIBUNE 
DESFOSSES.  The unions still refuse to support what they insist on 
calling the "Youth Minimum Wage" for those with no college 
education, to which Balladur responded, "Better this than nothing at 
all."  Workers Force (FO) head Marc Blondel declared, "Tensions will 
continue.  We still disagree with the prime minister's proposals." 
French Democratic Confederation of Labor (CFDT) secretary general, 
Nicole Notat, claims the government is trying to appear to relent on 
the issue "without relenting." (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in 
French 4 Mar 94 p 2; 3 Mar 94 p 4; Paris LES ECHOS in French 4, 5

   EMPLOYERS STAY OUT OF CIP DEBATE--The controversy that has 
embroiled the government and the labor unions over the CIP is not 
regarded as such by employers, according to an article in LA TRIBUNE 
DESFOSSES.  Employers state that "there either are jobs or there are 
no jobs."  Employing more workers depends above all on business 
activity and that "this type of measure (the CIP) can only serve to 
plug holes where personnel are needed for six or eight months," or 
until the economy picks up.  However, the article claims employers 
view the CIP as "rather positive," noting that apprenticeship 
contracts have worked well and that the idea of lowering the wage 
cost is nothing new.  The danger, according to employers, is that 
the CIP is becoming too politicized and is too associated with a 
Youth Minimum Wage.  As for the fears that the young will take jobs 
away from the more experienced, the article cites statements from 
staff members at the Vallourec company as saying, "It is a false 
problem since a company is always tempted to do just that.  The CIP 
would change nothing."  Other employers pointed out that they prefer 
a more long-term hiring policy and that in any case, companies are 
looking for workers with at least a junior college education rather 
than those with no advanced education. (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE 
DESFOSSES in French 7 Mar 94 p 6) 

   INSEE BACKS OFF EMPLOYMENT STUDY CONCLUSIONS--The National 
Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) has modified 
the conclusions of a study it conducted with the Bureau of 
Information and Economic Forecasting (BIPE) on the impact on 
employment of either a reduction in employer's social welfare costs 
or a reduction in youth wages.  The study, ordered by the Senate 
when the five-year law on employment was being considered, reported 
(see West Europe Economic Survey Special Report, Vol III, No 7, 24 
Feb 94) to have established a much sharper macroeconomic effect on 
employment when employer social charges were reduced (almost 300,000 
supplemental jobs in the medium term) than would establishing a 
"Youth Minimum Wage" (almost 150,000 more jobs). 

   In a communique released on 2 March, INSEE changed its 
conclusion, explaining that it is not possible to determine a 
precise distinction between the effects of lowering employer costs 
versus lowering youth wages.  (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in

   BANKS USE FROZEN IRAQI FUNDS TO PAY CREDITORS--Three large French 
banks--Societe Generale, National Bank of Paris (BNP), and the Union 
of French and Arab Banks (UBAF) have used frozen Iraqi assets to 
compensate the accounts of Iraqi clients without French Treasury 
approval, according to an article in LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE.  After 
months of investigation, the Finance Ministry has concluded that 
these banks have completed financial operations of several hundreds 
of millions of francs, despite the freeze on Iraqi assets in France 
instituted in August 1990 following the Gulf War.  Economy Minister 
Edmond Alphandery must now set the amount of the fines, which can be 
up to three times the sums in question. 

   The banks, having debited and credited accounts of Iraqi clients, 
reduced their financial exposure on Iraq.  In so doing, they have 
"designated themselves privileged creditors," the article notes. 
Between December 1992 and April 1993, for example, nearly 60 million 
francs (Fr) disappeared from Iraqi accounts at UBAF.  The banks 
argue that the transactions were made in "good faith and in a formal 
manner."  The article points out that some Iraqi creditors were not 
so lucky.  The CED-Viandes and Dumez companies, for example, have 
been trying for two years to recoup money from Iraq and have, 
without success, been trying to serve the banks with seizure notices 
on the Iraqi assets. (DiI)  (Paris LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE in French 21

   AEROSPATIALE WANTS EU AID TO FIGHT U.S. COMPETITION--French 
Aircraft and Space Industries Group (GIFAS) President Serge Dassault 
would like the EU to promote--"as (President) Bill Clinton does (for 
U.S. aircraft companies)"--Europe's aircraft industry, according to 
an article in LES ECHOS.  The article claims that the thinking of EU 
officials, meeting currently in Brussels to adopt a couon position 
on the next GATT aircraft industry negotiations, has been "marked" 
by the "intervention" of President Clinton to win the Saudi Airlines 
contract for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas at the expense of the 
Airbus consortium.  The article claims this augurs poorly for 
aircraft industry subsidy negotiations with the United States which, 
according to Dassault "is trying to enclose Europeans in rigid 
regulations to which the United States itself does not conform." 
Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois adds: "We do not have to go 
along with the U.S. game of managing the negotiations.  But, we must 
defend our system of reimbursable advances, which is a good system 
based on the idea of risk sharing.  At the same time, we must also 
prepare to progressively adopt indirect aid, as it is given in the 
United States, in order to have two irons in the fire and to achieve 
a balance between the two systems." (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in 
French 2 Mar 94 p 10) 

   EIB TO LOAN FRANCE MORE THAN FR15 MILLION--According to an 
article in LES ECHOS, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is ready to 
increase its lending if the EU White Paper plan to increase growth 
and employment in Europe requires it.  The bank loaned nearly Fr130 
billion to its target countries in 1993--funds which were raised 
without difficulty on the international markets--and the bank has 
the means to sharply increase its lending, according to bank 
president, Sir Brian Unwin.  "With a financing capacity of 144 
billion ECU's and a total loan portfolio of 98 billion ECU's, the 
bank can do more for Europe's economy," Unwin said. 

   In France, the EIB intends to increase its loans for public 
works, environmental protection, and automobile industry projects. 
Last year the country, which is the fourth largest beneficiary of 
EIB loans after Italy, Spain, and Britain, received Fr14.6 billion 
from the bank, a figure more than 13 percent higher than 1992 and 
which represents 12.4 percent of total  1993 EIB lending.  This 
amount was largely devoted to regional development to reinforce 
economic and social cohesion in Europe, lending which adheres to EIB 
statutory goals.  More than 50 percent of the loans were accorded to 
local projects in "industrial decline" zones or "delayed 
development" areas.  EIB lending for industrial priorities is also 
in line with general EU goals: transportation will receive Fr6.6 
billion for the super fast train, TGV Nord, and the Channel tunnel, 
while the aircraft industry is slated for Fr1.4 billion.  The 
environment will also garner increased support as will the 
automobile industry.  According to unnamed directors of the bank, 
EIB has "a very specific project currently under study which would 
involve French auto makers Peugeot and Renault." (DiI)  (Paris LES 
ECHOS in French 28 Feb 94 p 8) 

   LONGUET DISCUSSES TEXTILE AID--Industry Minister Gerard Longuet, 
speaking at a late February roundtable discussion with textile 
manufacturers, stated that if they had ideas for investment projects 
for their industry they should submit them to the government 
because, "If there are projects, there will be money."  He also 
noted that the government could allocate Fr160 million to textile- 
clothing investments without any requirements linked to employment. 
Such allocations would come from new regional funding approved to 
aid small to medium-sized industries, which in 1994 will amount to 
Fr80O million for various programs.  Additionally, the textile- 
clothing industry will be able to obtain EU funds targeted for 
training, of which France's share is Fr700 million and which is to 
be split among the automobile, electronic, and textile industries. 
These funds, however, are for training in the broader sense, such as 
that for trade certification and data processing technicians and not 
for training related to specific projects.  Longuet repeated that 
while these training funds can generally help textile companies, 
specific "projects are still needed" to generate additional help.

   WINNERS OF BALLADUR ECONOMICS LISTED--Gerard Desportes and 
Nathaniel Herzberg writing in the Paris daily LIBERATION have 
reviewed the results of 10 months of Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur's administration and has noted that except for the 
education field where Balladur's attempt to help finance private 
schools failed, many groups gained as a result of his economic 
policies.  They are: 

   Small Investors -- Privatizations gave small investors 
opportunities to buy shares of such companies as Rhone-Poulenc, Elf- 
Aquitaine, and National Bank of Paris at a discount price. 
According to the authors, such a discount on these shares amounted 
to a "gift" of Fr5 billion to investors. 

   Farmers -- The authors claim Balladur was "extremely firm" in his 
support for farmers during the GATT negotiations, despite the risk 
of international crisis.  Last May, Balladur granted farmers Fr1.9 
billion to "sweeten" the oil seeds agreement and Fr1.5 billion in 
November to facilitate the passage of the modified Blair House 
agricultural agreement. 

   Small Business -- Balladur temporarily banned the opening of 
large retail stores, a subject of controversy among small business 
owners who face stiff competition from such large stores. 

   Big Business -- To foster employment, Balladur has lowered the 
cost of labor and money, instituted more flexibility in the labor 
code, granted assistance to foundering sectors of the economy, and 
transferred part of the social costs paid by companies to the state 
budget. 

   Doctors --  Private physicians, a group traditionally favorable 
to the Right, have benefited from Balladur's economic policy, which 
raised taxpayers health insurance contributions and lowered the 
number of hospital beds. 

   Civil Servants -- These employees have maintained their 
retirement benefits and purchasing power, unlike the rest of the 
population, which has not only been affected by two "highly 
unpopular" austerity measures to reduce them but have also 
experienced lower private sector salaries. 

   The Press -- Showing "great understanding" for the difficulties 
affecting the press, the Balladur government has repeatedly 
supported modernization in this sector and granted "exceptional" 
assistance, which will total Fr721 million over several years, to 
publications foundering because of the loss of advertising funds. 
Retirees -- The authors contend that this group has benefited 
from Balladur's "greatest coup," which will modify the entire 
retirement system.  This change will be implemented by stages and be 
completed by the year 2003 and temporarily settles the problem of 
the retirement system's deficit. (RM)  (Paris LIBERATION in French 
15 Feb 94 pp 4-5) 

   CONZE CONCENTRATES WEAPONS PRODUCTION IN CHER--Convinced of the 
need to "gather forces," Henri Conze, director general of the 
General Armaments Delegation (DGA), signed an agreement with 
Aerospatiale, Matra Defense, Thomson and Giat-Industrie to create a 
number of jobs in the Cher department, where the weapons industry 
holds 20 percent of all industrial jobs.  Aerospatiale will create 
over 60 jobs before the end of 1995 and 40 more in 1996 in its three 
regional factories: one of which produces spare parts for aircraft, 
the second of which is dedicated to "small missiles," and the third 
of which manufactures ballistic missiles.  Matra Defense will create 
35 new jobs in its local plants, where the air-to-air Mica missiles 
are manufactured.  Some 200 jobs will be created by Thomson and 15 
by Giat-Industrie in the manufacture of various types of munitions. 
The DGA itself will transfer to the Cher department some of its lIe- 
de-France "missions," including the production of powders and 
explosives.  In addition, a weapons specialist will advise the 
region's prefect and a trade mission will promote the region's 
special defense products such as the Eryx missile.  The 
reinforcement of weapons manufacturing in the Cher region should 
ease this industry's budgetary problems and help it save an 
estimated 230,000 jobs. (RM)  (Paris LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS in French

   GERMANY 

   GERMANS OUTPACE JAPANESE IN PRODUCTIVITY--In 1993, Germany 
outstripped Japan in industrial productivity for the first time, 
according to a study by Bernd Hof of the Institute of the German 
Economy in Cologne.  According to Hof, Japanese labor productivity, 
measured in terms of real GDP per worker, declined by 1.2 percent in 
1993, compared with only a 0.1 percent drop for Germany.  In fact, 
Hof found that the productivity gap between Japanese and German 
industry continues to widen.  While the recession-related decline in 
production has caused the profits of Japanese companies to "tumble," 
German firms appear to be recovering and making progress, at least 
in cutting costs.  By reducing workforces and increasing 
productivity, the Germans have been able to achieve lower unit wage 
costs and higher profits.  This development also has its darker 
side, however, as evidenced by current unemployment figures and 
fears that, when the next economic upturn comes, the skilled workers 
currently unemployed either will no longer be available or will be 
employable only at "disproportionately" high costs.  The Japanese 
share these fears and are therefore hesitant to lay off permanent 
staff. 

   Hof, arguing that the "real" reason for the decline in Japanese 
productivity is its traditional reluctance to lay off workers, sees 
a "remarkable parallel" in the German automobile industry, with one 
"essential" difference as exemplified by Volkswagen.  Although 
Volkswagen has reduced working hours for its employees by 20 percent 
rather than lay them off, it has benefitted from workers giving up 
12 to 13 percent of their wages.  Consequently, Volkswagen is in a 
better wage-cost position than a Japanese company where workers are 
working fewer hours but drawing full salary. (JS)  (Berlin DIE WELT 
in German 15 Feb 94 p 12) 

   FRENCH-GERMAN REFINERY DEAL IN TROUBLE--Elf Aquitaine, two-thirds 
owner of the privatized Leuna refinery in the Halle-Bitterfeld 
region, is attempting to renegotiate the agreement under which it 
purchased the plant from the Trust Agency.  The agreement calls for 
Elf and its German co-owner, Thyssen Handelsunion (THU) to build a 
new 4.5 billion German marks (DM) refinery with a 10-million- 
ton/year capacity; the Trust Agency is pressing Elf to start 
construction or risk a DM1.5 billion contract penalty and 
cancellation of the sale of the profitable Minol gas station network 
which made the agreement attractive to the French in the first 
place.  Elf is reportedly looking for new investors so that it can 
become a minority shareholder but THU is not interested in 
increasing its share.  Since the original agreement, oil market 
trends have dictated that refinery output be reduced, rather than 
increased, and Elf has begun to privatize some of its own 
operations.  Because Elf's new management is selling stock on the 
market, it wants to avoid risky projects and is citing increased 
competition, declining demand, and flat economic growth in eastern 
Germany as grounds for revising its investment policy.  Guenter 
Rexrodt, German minister of economics, has insisted that Elf begin 
with the agreed upon construction and maintains that Elf cannot 
reduce its holdings by returning shares to the Trust Agency pending 
resale.  Rexrodt has allowed, however that renegotiation of later 
stages of the agreement may be possible, and notes that contacts are 
continuing with other firms, including British Petroleum, which 
showed interest in Leuna during 1992 negotiations.  (CW)

   HERMES INSURANCE FOR RUSSIAN RAILCAR SALES--Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt has advised the Berlin railcar firm, Deutsche 
Waggonbau (DWA), that he expects DM555 million in Hermes export 
credit guarantees to be available to support the company's 1994 
sales to Russia.  At the same time, however,  the ministry has 
expressed reservations about Russia's ability to meet international 
business standards, which normally dictate making a 15-percent down 
payment on contracts. 

   The recently privatized DWA had requested DM765 million in 
guarantees for the current year but the German Government has cut 
1994 credit guarantees to CIS countries from DM4 billion to DM3.5 
billion, thus limiting guarantees for individual export contracts. 
Consequently, DWA envisions needing more insurance guarantees in 
1995 and 1996.  The 1994 limits, however, do not affect pending 
applications for DM111 million in credit insurance on an existing 
Russian contract and for DM110 million on an order from Kazakhstan.

   ECONOMIST SAYS GERMANY MISSED LONG-TERM GROWTH CYCLE--According 
to one economist, Germany's failure to abandon outmoded industries 
in favor of the growth sectors of the information age has caused it 
to miss a long-term economic growth cycle and condemned it to a 
lengthy struggle with recession and high unemployment.  Leo Nefiodow 
of the Institute for Mathematics and Data Processing in Sankt 
Augustin contends that Germany has failed to recognize information 
technology as the driving force of the latest in a series of 50-year 
growth cycles.  Instead of encouraging the development of growth 
industries in the information field, Nef iodow argues, Germany has 
continued to subsidize the dying industries of the previous cycle, 
which was characterized by energy-intensive industries like 
automobiles and petrochemicals.  Consequently, those who believe 
renewed German prosperity will come with the next economic upturn 
"will have to wait a long time."  In fact, no upturn will come 
unless the country's economic structure adapts to these underlying 
shifts in the world economy. 

   In Nefiodow's view, other countries--notably Japan--have done a 
better job of riding the latest economic wave.  He notes that only 
one German firm--Siemens-Nixdorf--plays a significant role in the 
information field, while Japan is represented by over 20 companies. 
Nef iodow ascribes Germany's failure to capitalize on the current 
cycle primarily to social and cultural factors.  Germany's emphasis 
on individualism and hierarchical forms of organization, he 
maintains, makes it less able to respond to the demands of the 
information age than Japan, with its stress on group well-being and 
teamwork.  While Nefiodow believes it is too late for Germany to 
catch up, he contends the country may be well positioned to 
anticipate the next one, which he thinks could be driven by the 
information, environmental, and health industries, since Germany has 
high-quality measurement and process control and software and 
systems technologies and a top-flight chemical industry.  Above all, 
however, he emphasizes Germany's high degree of public awareness of 
environmental, health, and information issues.  (RoH)  (Munich 
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 21 Feb 94 p 20) 

   JOBLESS RATE, POLICIES COMPARED TO WEIMAR REPUBLIC--According to 
commentator Wolfram Engels, the unemployment rate in Germany is 
almost as high today as during the Weimar Republic but the German 
Government, unlike the Weimar Republic, has failed to alleviate the 
situation by reducing the cost of labor.  Engels notes that the 
unemployment rate in February 1932 stood at 19.2 percent and that 
the current rate--counting those in various publicly funded work 
programs and other "hidden" forms of unemployment--has reached 18.2 
percent.  "However," he writes, "that's where the similarity ends." 
Weimar's Chancellor of the Reich Heinrich Bruening, Engels points 
out, reduced the cost of labor from 5.57 million unemployed from 
5.57 million to 4.1 million by August 1933.  A reduction in the cost 
of labor, Engels maintains, would prove similarly effective today, 
with an 8-percent cut in real wages sufficient to produce full 
unemployment.  According to Engels, however, the German Government 
is moving in exactly the opposite direction.  Its new nursing care 
insurance program, he maintains, will "ignite a rocket" of labor 
cost increases.  Engels suggests that the program could increase the 
cost of labor by 6 percent or more within a few years, inevitably 
leading to a further loss of jobs.  (RoH)  (Duesseldorf 
WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE in German 11 Feb 94 p 150) 

   PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT ATTRACTING ATTENTION--With the number of 
unemployed in Germany at 4 million persons, the idea of expanding 
the part-time work force to alleviate the situation is attracting 
increasing attention.  Cologne's Institute for the German Economy 
(IW) reports that 2.66 million more Germans could be employed if the 
percentage of part-time workers in the labor force were raised from 
the current 15.5 to the 34.3 percent found in the Netherlands. 
Experts note, however, that the service sector would have to be 
significantly expanded and the proportion of working women slightly 
reduced if this adjustment were to succeed.  Calculations show that 
reducing the 22 million-person full-time labor force in Germany by 
2.53 million would add 5.19 million new part-time jobs to the 
existing 4 million.  Various surveys indicate that between 10 and 17 
percent of full-time workers would be willing to accept part-time 
employment, while somewhat lower percentages of unemployed persons 
would be agreeable to part-time work.  As of December, 281,000 
jobless were willing to work part-time but only 32,000 part-time 
jobs were reported available.  (CW)  (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER

   REXRODT SEES MEXICO AS 'BRIDGEHEAD' TO AMERICAS--Speaking at the 
late February trade fair in Mexico City, Economics Minister Guenther 
Rexrodt described Mexico as a potential "bridgehead" for German 
exports to North and South America.  Rexrodt noted that German 
industry had overlooked the Mexican market during the boom years of 
the 1980's, but had rediscovered its potential since the creation of 
the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  German companies 
now hoped, through Mexico, to gain duty-free access to the U.S. 
market.  Rexrodt also pointed out that increasing trade with Germany 
offered an opportunity for Mexico to lessen its dependence on the 
United States, which currently accounts for 70 percent of all 
Mexican foreign trade. 

   German trade with Mexico, which amounts to about DM5 billion, has 
"still not realized its full potential," according to an article in 
the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG.  By contrast, some progress has been made 
in the field of capital investments.  In 1993 alone, Germans 
invested DM20 billion in Mexico, 10 times more than in 1992. 
Experts expect a similarly high level of investment in 1994. 
According to the article, Mexico's recent trend toward economic 
privatization, coupled with its balanced budget deficit and its 
relatively low 8-percent inflation rate, have created favorable 
conditions for German investors.  In addition, the two countries 
have concluded an agreement to prevent double taxation, although 
they  have yet to sign an investment protection pact.  (RoH)

   ITALY 

   PDS PRESENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM--The Democratic Party of the Left 
(PDS) presented its election platform on 15 February.  The platform 
contains a large section on economic reforms and programs which 
advocate the following: 

   * Taxes 

   --Divide revenues equally between the central and local 
governments. 

   --Extend the tax base, reduce individual tax rates. 

   --Remove taxes from Treasury bills since it "serves no purpose" 
and the same result is currently being achieved by lower interest 
rates. 

   --Reduce red tape and accounting procedures. 

   --Abolish local income taxes, health taxes, health benefit 
contributions, and regional double taxation.  Allow individual 
regional and local taxes. 

   --Combine the payment of personal income tax (IRPEF), VAT, social 
security tax, and disability taxes for small companies and have them 
submitted under a single tax return. 

   --Modernize the way tax evasion is fought by accurately

   PORTUGAL 

   TELECOMMUNICATIONS MERGER APPROVED--To create a more 
internationally competitive telecommunications group, the council of 
ministers approved the April merger of the Telecom Portugal, Lisbon 
and Porto Telephones (TLP), and Teledifusora of Portugal (TDP) 
companies, which will form a single company under the name of 
Portugal Telecom.  Moreover, the government will soon hold 
negotiations with the Marconi company to discuss its anticipated 
merger into the new "giant" corporation.  Portugal Telecom will be 
ready for the privatization of about 30 percent of its capital by 
the end of the year.  The government estimates that it will earn 120 
million contos from the privatization process.  (RM)  (Lisbon DIARIO

   SPAIN 

   CONTROVERSY SURROUNDS GOVERNMENT PENSIONS--Concerned about 
skyrocketing  pension costs, Finance Minister Pedro Solbes warned 
Spanish workers "in their forties" that they may not receive their 
pensions if the current system is maintained, according to an 
article in the Madrid daily EL PAlS on 22 February.  In so doing, he 
elicited strong political reactions from his own party, the Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) and opposition groups.  The article 
noted that the Spanish pension system, which is administered and 
funded by the government, increased spending 73.5 percent during 
1989-93 and that forecasts indicate a 20 percent increase by 1997. 
However, Solbes publicly reassured workers that the system could 
still pay benefits but not over the long term.  He attributed this 
problem to an aging population, longer life expectancy, fewer 
contributors, and more annuitants.  Solbes suggested substituting 
the current payment system for one which more closely resembles a 
defined contribution plan rather than the current defined benefit 
plan, which guarantees pension benefits regardless of the amount 
contributed.  Currently, contributions are mandatory for 15 years. 

   An article in the 23 February EL PAlS claims that Solbes's 
remarks created a sharp reaction from factions within the PSOE. 
Although Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez defended Solbes by 
stating that he had acted in a manner which "brings him credit," he 
added that government pensions do not represent "a problem for today 
or tomorrow."  Gonzalez reassured current pensioners that they were 
well protected" and that there would always be decent government 
retirement benefits for all citizens.  He also said that "problems 
would not surface until the years 2020 or 2025" but governments 
needed to prepare in advance for changes in Spanish demographics. 
Socialist senator Juan Barranco stated, "this type of declaration 
unfortunately makes the PSOE lose votes and creates uncertainty 
among the citizenry." 

   This same article states that reaction from opposition groups was 
"far more belligerent" than that from the PSOE.  People's Party (PP) 
spokesman Rodrigo Rato demanded that Solbes appear before the 
parliament to explain the government's position on social security 
issues.  Rato characterized the finance minister's remarks as 
"irresponsible" and criticized him for "scaring people."  According 
to United Left (IU) Coordinator General Julio Anguita: "Solbes is 
only stating the obvious.  There is not going to be enough growth in 
employment to generate the necessary resources to be able to pay out 
retirement pensions."  Additionally, Fernando Gimeno, coordinator of 
the joint committee for the Office of the Controller of the 
Currency, reproached Solbes by stating that "such declarations only 
create uncertainty among people from lower income brackets who don't 
have the money to contribute to pension plans."  Gimeno added that 
the government was now working on reforming the taxation system for 
government pensions and he thought it "unfortunate" that people were 
trying to come up with scenarios for 15 years hence. 

   Responding to the criticisms, Solbes remarked that the government 
would continue to guarantee pensions but reaffirmed that "it will be 
necessary to review them" given the change in Spanish demographics. 
Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra agreed, stating that in the 
future the state system would guarantee a "decent pension."  (CH)

   LABOR REFORM INCLUDES REVIEW OF DISABILITY BENEFITS--An article 
in EL PAlS notes that the Labor Ministry is working on reforms 
encompassing disability, unemployment, and health issues in the work 
place, which would complete the labor market legislation being 
considered in parliament.  The Labor Ministry plans to blur two 
distinct categories which define workers as either "temporarily 
incapacitated" or "temporarily disabled."  These definitions would 
be combined into a single "temporary" category, paying benefits for 
less than the current six years.  By reducing the time that someone 
would spend on "temporary disability" before going on to be declared 
"permanently disabled," the Labor Ministry hopes to return workers 
to their jobs once they have overcome health problems so they do not 
remain on disability for six years.  Funds would then be directed 
exclusively to those who really need them. 

   The Labor Ministry also plans to establish teams, which would be 
administered by doctors working for the Social Security system, to 
evaluate disabled workers (EVI).  According to the article, the 
doctors will introduce more rigorous standards for the evaluation 
process to return employees more quickly to the work place.  These 
doctors would also review pensions which are in force to determine 
the status of disability benefits in the event that the worker 
should recover. (CH)  (Madrid EL PAlS in Spanish 22 Feb 1994 p 45) 

BBV PRESIDENT ON POSSIBLE BANESTO TAKEOVER--An article in the 
Madrid daily El PAlS by correspondents M.A. Noceda and J. Rivera, 
reports that BBV President Emilio Ybarra announced during a 
shareholders meeting that the bank was seriously considering the 
purchase of a "significant" amount of shares of Banesto, Spain's 
third largest bank and the subject of a Bank of Spain mandated 
reorganization.  Ybarra did not specify if BBV would be the only 
buyer or if other financial institutions would be involved but he 
added that everything would depend on "the conditions of the sale." 
He stated, "we are not going to be blinded by the zeal to be number 
one nor will we close the doors to other competitors."  Ybarra noted 
that it would be "interesting" to buy Banesto because such a move 
would reinforce BBV's position of leadership.  He cautioned, 
however, that BBV would not consider growth "at any cost."  He 
stressed that BBV would only contemplate the purchase of shares if 
it were deemed in the best interest of all shareholders. 
Reportedly, shareholders were divided on the proposed takeover. 
Ybarra also underscored that Banesto "would be worth zero were it 
not for the support of all of the banks," adding that Banesto's 
losses in 1993 will reach "over 50 billion pesetas."  He confirmed 
that Alfredo Saenz, who was formerly vice chairman at BBV, would 
continue as Banesto's chairman if the takeover occurs.  The article 
reported that the Bank of Santander is BBV's "principal rival" in 
the upcoming takeover bid for Banesto.  Because of their size these 
two banks would make it difficult for smaller institutions to bid on 
shares. (CH)  (Madrid EL PAlS in Spanish 27 Feb 94 p 43) 

   CONGRESS DESIGNATES SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR BANESTO--According to 
an article in EL PAlS by correspondent Jorge Rivera, the executive 
board for the Congress of Deputies reached an agreement on 24 
February to create a special committee to oversee the Banesto 
reorganization.  Jose Bevia, a Socialist and first vice president of 
the Congress, stated that the committee was to be created with a 
"basic agreement between Socialists and PP members."  Bevia was 
pleased that a committee had been decided on because it ensures 
public, open sessions, which the press will be able to attend.  The 
special committee will be coordinated by three members from the PSOE 
and PP respectively.  IU and Catalan Convergence and Union (CiU) 
will each have two representatives.  Canary Islands Coalition (CC) 
and the Mixed Group (Valencian Union) will each have one 
representative. (CH)  (Madrid EL PAlS in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 47) 

   SWEDEN 

   STUDY SEES JOB GROWTH CONFINED TO INDUSTRIAL SECTOR--According to 
a study carried out by the Labor Market Board (AMS), the only sector 
of the Swedish economy expected to show an increase in employment in 
1994 is the industrial sector.  AMS divides the labor market into 
four sectors:  industry, construction, private services, and public 
services.  The private services sector, which is the largest, 
includes most service industry workers, such as bank and insurance 
company employees and journalists.  The number of jobs in this 
sector has fallen by 7-percent in the last three years and is 
expected to continuing falling.  Unemployment is also expected to 
increase in the construction sector, where 29 percent of the jobs 
have been lost.  The public sector, which includes teachers and 
health and child care providers, has seen a 7 percent drop in the 
number of jobs.  This decrease is now expected to level off.  Only 
in the industrial sector, made up mostly of blue-collar workers, is 
an increase forecast.  The sector has, however, already lost 24 
percent of its jobs, and AMS fears these jobs are now gone for good.

   VOLVO SEEN SEEKING PROJECT-BY-PROJECT PARTNERSHIPS--After its 
rejection of a merger with Renault, Volvo must catch up 
internationally and will probably seek partners on a project-by- 
project basis.  This is the conclusion of an assessment published in 
the business weekly VECKANS AFFARER.  According to the assessment, 
Volvo has "lost" the last four years, which its competitors have 
used to conclude international partnerships.  Its credibility 
damaged, Volvo is hardly in a position to seek new long-term 
partners immediately.  Therefore, the most viable alternative is to 
establish a series of limited partnerships for specific projects. 
This strategy would reduce costs while retaining the company's 
independence and reputation.  The assessment cites Volvo's agreement 
with Mitsubishi to develop a new midsize car as a model for future 
cooperation.  Under the agreement, Volvo will develop a successor to 
its 400 model at greatly reduced cost while gaining access to 
Japanese technology.  The Swedish firm also recently concluded an 
agreement with Chrysler to build jeeps in Thailand.  (WS)

nationalists  in July 1991 to promote creation of an independent 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, initially achieved substantial influence 
within the nascent Ukrainian defense establishment, particularly 
in personnel and related matters.  Since mid-1992, however, the 
UOU has increasingly come into conflict with the military 
establishment and has lost much of its influence inside the 
Defense Ministry, a trend that has greatly accelerated since 
Vitaliy Radetskyy replaced Konstyantyn Morozov as defense 
minister.  The union has reacted belligerently to the loss of its 
insider status, returning to its roots as a military-oriented 
ally of the moderately nationalist Ukrainian People's Movement 
(Rukh) and seeking to influence the military from the outside 
through the political process. It is running candidates for 
parliament and is likely to remain a significant political force 
if it and its nationalist allies do well in the 27 March 1994 
parliamentary election. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   The Union of Officers of Ukraine:  From Establishment Insiders to 
Nationalist Opposition 
   The UOU'S Foundation by Ukrainian Nationalists 
   Rukh was evidently the moving force in the UOU's creation.  At 
least since the fall of 1990, Rukh's leaders had been calling for 
the creation of a separate Ukrainian army, saying this was an 
essential element in the drive for Ukrainian independence from 
the Soviet Union (Kultura i Zhyttya, 28 October 1990; Kiev radio, 
19, 22 February 1991).  When the First UOU Congress met in July 
1991, press reports said that Rukh had organized it specifically 
to pursue this goal (TASS, 29 July 1991; Kiev radio, 27 July 
1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991).  Several Rukh leaders 
played key roles at the congress.  Rukh Deputy Chairman Volodymyr 
Mulyava chaired the congress's organizing committee; Rukh 
Military Collegium Chairman Lt. Col. Vitaliy Chechylo was a 
deputy chairman of the organizing committee; and the congress 
elected Rukh Political Council member Col. Vilen Martirosyan as 
the UOU's first chairman (TASS, 29 July 1991; Komsomolskaya 
Pravda, 18 September 1991; Narodnaya Armiya, 29 June 1992). 
   With a large majority of its members ethnic Ukrainians and 
retired or reserve rather than active-duty officers, the UOU has 
always been more a Ukrainian nationalist organization than a 
military one.  Eighty-five percent of its members are ethnic 
Ukrainians, a proportion far higher than that in the armed forces 
overall (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). (See Note 1)  Only 
half of the delegates to the First UOU Congress were on active 
duty (Interfax, 29 July 1991).  At its most recent congress it 
was reported that twice as many members were retired as were on 
active duty, and that many UOU officers, including oblast 
organization chairmen, are either in the reserves or retired from 
the service (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994).  Many of the 
union's organizers were not military men.  For instance, Mulyava 
and Oleksandr Yemets (See Note 2) were civilians.  Other key 
leaders, such as former UOU chairmen Hryhoriy Omelchenko and 
Oleksandr Skypalskyy, were career police officers (See Appendix 
C:  Biographical Information). 
   (Note 1) In 1992, according to then-military personnel chief 
Oleksandr Ihnatenko, eighty-five percent of servicemen in Ukraine 
were ethnic Russians (Narodnaya Armiya, 5 May 1992). 
   (Note 2) Yemets, leader of the Party of Democratic Revival of 
Ukraine, was a deputy chairman of the First UOU Congress 
organizing committee (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991). 
   The rapid disintegration of the USSR led the UOU to shift its 
attention from its original goal of creating a Ukrainian national 
army to influencing the nascent army's development.  As the 
Soviet state rapidly withered awaY in the wake of the August 1991 
coup attempt, Ukraine enacted a package of laws in October 1991 
to create its own armed forces by placing Soviet forces stationed 
in Ukraine under Ukrainian government control.  Ukraine also 
appointed its own defense minister, Konstyantyn Morozov.  The UOU 
then set itself the task of shaping the armed forces--especially 
the officer corps--in what it considered a patriotic mold.  In 
practice, this meant striving to influence decisions on 
appointments, promotions, and dismissals, as well as seeking a 
leading role in military indoctrination activities.  In November 
1991, the Second UOU Congress demanded that all appointments, 
"from battalion commander on up," be "coordinated with" the UOU 
(Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991). (See Note 3)  The congress 
also passed several resolutions calling for an acceleration of 
the creation of a Ukrainian army and for measures to assure that 
the army be manned by soldiers whose first loyalty was to 
Ukraine.  In March 1992, then-First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy 
Chechylo said that the UOU should "take a most active part" in 
military personnel matters (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992). 
   (Note 3) The Soviet Defense Ministry was not reported to respond 
directly to these demands, but a few days after the congress 
Defense Minister Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov decried "centrifugal 
tendencies" in military affairs (Krasnaya Zvezda, 7 November 
1991).  The nascent Ukrainian Defense Ministry was also 
apparently silent; the newly-appointed minister, Morozov, 
addressed the congress but was not reported to discuss a role for 
the UOU in military personnel matters (Moscow Russian TV, 2 
November 1991).  Subsequently, however, Morozov strongly backed 
UOU aspirations in this area (See below, page   ). 
   From the beginning, many officers stationed in Ukraine- 
-particularly among the ethnic Russian majority of the officer 
corps--were hostile to the UOU, evidently fearing that its 
influence in personnel decisions boded ill for them personally. 
As early as the end of 1991, an assembly of air defense officers 
accused the union of seeking to arrogate to itself the powers of 
newly minted commissars" and to revive "democratic centralism" 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 14 December 1991).  Rival servicemen's groups 
sprang up, often with the apparent purpose of opposing the UOU. 
According to reports in the Moscow press, groups such as the 
Independent Officers Association (based in Vinnytsya, 
headquarters of the predominantly Russian 43rd Missile Army) and 
the Kiev Constructive Union sought to protect their members and 
the armed forces overall from what they charged were UOU "witch 
hunts" for supporters of the 1991 coup attempt.  The UOU 
actively, but unsuccessfully, opposed these groups' creation 
(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 November 1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 26 
November 1991). 
   Defense Minister Morozov Encourages the UOU 
   Despite the hostility of many officers, the UOU at first 
flourished, helped by the friendly attitude of nationalist-minded 
Defense Minister Morozov.  Morozov signalled early on that his 
thinking on military matters paralleled that of Rukh and the UOU. 
He told a Moscow News interviewer that Ukraine needed its own 
armed forces as soon as possible to guarantee its independence, 
echoing earlier statements by Rukh leaders (See above, page  ). 
In the same interview, he said that he shared the concerns 
expressed at the Second UOU Congress over the loyalties of the 
officers then stationed on Ukrainian territory (3-10 November 
1991).  A UOU Executive Committee session was held on Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry premises in January 1992, the members 
congratulating themselves on their new-found establishment 
insider status (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992).  Several UOU 
leaders were appointed to important Defense Ministry and Security 
Service posts where they were well-placed to pursue the UOU's 
agenda in personnel and related matters.  In December 1991, UOU 
Chairman Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the government's 
new Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS), with 
First Deputy Chairman Chechylo as one of his top aides (Narodnaya 
Armiya, 29 January, 11 March 1992).  A UOU Executive Committee 
member, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, headed the Security Service's 
Military Counterintelligence Directorate (Molod Ukrayiny, 17 
October 1991).  UOU Deputy Chairman Hryhoriy Omelchenko was 
especially well placed to weed out supposedly undesirable 
officers, heading the organized crime unit in Skypalskyy's 
directorate as well as sitting on the Defense Ministry Higher 
Certification Committee, which vets senior appointments 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 30 January 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993). 
   "Ukrainianizing" the Armed Forces 
   The UOU scored one of its greatest successes with the appointment 
of Volodymyr Mulyava, deputy chairman of both the UOU and Rukh, 
as chief of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's new Socio- 
Psychological Service.  This service was organized on the basis 
of ideas developed by Mulyava in his capacity as a Rukh deputy 
chairman to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism and national identity 
among the troops (See Appendix C: Biographical Information).  To 
this end, Mulyava launched a highly controversial program 
requiring servicemen to learn the Ukrainian language, history, 
and traditions (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992; Narodna 
Armiya, 29 July 1992).  President Leonid Kravchuk endorsed the 
program--at least in principle--at a Ukrainian Security Council 
meeting in late 1992 (Narodna Armiya, 9 December 1992).  However, 
Mulyava's critics--both in Ukraine and in Russia--charged that he 
actually sought to purge ethnic Russians from the officer corps 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 3 December 1992; 
Interfax, 6 January 1993; Pravda, 13 May 1993), a claim which he 
and other UOU and Defense Ministry officials heatedly and 
repeatedly denied (Kiev radio, 6 February 1992; Narodna Armiya, 5 
May 1992, 3 December 1992, 17 April 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22 
November 1992). 
   The UOU's influence in the Ukrainian government and armed forces 
reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1992.  Senior military 
and political figures addressed its Third Congress, which met in 
April 1992 and attracted 918 delegates, the largest number ever 
(Ukrinform, 6 April 1992).  Congress speakers congratulated the 
union on the large role it was now playing in military affairs 
(Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1993;  Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). 
UOU leaders had expansive ideas about the organization's present 
and future role in military affairs.  For instance, a "Draft UOU 
Program," signed by several top union leaders and published in 
the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodnaya Armiya on 4 June 1992, 
mapped out ambitious goals for direct UOU involvement in drafting 
military legislation, personnel decisions, training, 
indoctrination, and social welfare of servicemen.  On 24 June 
1992, Morozov ordered that the UOU should be involved in 
identifying and removing corrupt officers (Molod Ukrayiny, 23 
July 1992). 
   The UOU Under Attack, Fights Back 
   Even as its influence peaked in the middle of 1992, the UOU was 
apparently encountering growing resistance from the defense 
establishment--despite Morozov's friendly attitude--as well as 
from politicians outside the military.  The critics said that its 
influence within the military establishment was excessive and 
decried the ends for which that influence was being used.  For 
instance, in an interview published on the eve of the Third UOU 
Congress, Yevhen Hryniv, a moderate Rukh member of parliament, 
complained that the UOU had fixated on the "nationality question" 
and said its decisions should be taken by the armed forces only 
as recommendations (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992).  Several 
months later, a favorable article on Mulyava's activities claimed 
that the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya was developing 
a  disloyal attitude" toward him (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22 November 
1992).  At the end of 1992, 155 members of parliament called for 
Morozov's dismissal, on the grounds that he had supposedly 
allowed the UOU--in particular Mulyava--to "control" military 
personnel policy and to impose its "nationalist ideology" on the 
troops (Interfax, 6 January 1993). (See Note 4) 
   (Note 4) Press reports have not been observed to describe the 
political leanings of the 155 deputies, although Morozov's 
supporters consistently described them as communists.  Among the 
organizers of the call for Morozov's dismissal were Col. Valeriy 
Izmalkov, a deputy from Zaporizhzhya in the mainly Russian 
eastern Ukraine and an inveterate foe of the UOU; Oleksiy 
Prychkin, also from Zaporizhzhya and a former high communist 
party official; Maj. Gen. F. Kiparis; MVD Lt. Gen. O. Badurka; 
and Viktor Slyusarenko (Holos Ukrayiny, 6 January 1993; 
Nezavisimost, 13 October 1993). 
   Belligerent Response to Criticism 
   In response, UOU leaders rose to Morozov's defense, while they 
accused their critics in the military  and parliament of being 
corrupt, unpatriotic, and pro-communist.  Hryhoriy Omelchenko, 
elected UOU chairman at its Third Congress, repeatedly complained 
that a "nomenklatura mafia" in the government, parliament, and 
armed forces was blocking his efforts to prosecute officers whom 
he accused of corruption, communist sympathies and subservience 
to Russia.  Omelchenko also claimed that criticism of Morozov was 
motivated precisely by Morozov's support for the UOU's anti- 
corruption efforts (Nezavisimost, 18 July 1992; Molod Ukrayiny, 
23 July 1992; Kiev TV, 13 January 1993; Uryadovyy Kuryer, 3O 
January 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993; Molod Ukrayiny, 15 July 
1993; Khreshchatyk, 8 October 1993).  Mulyava dismissed the 
accusations in parliament against himself and Morozov as 
comical," describing Morozov's critics as "conservative 
generals" and "pro-imperialist and pro-communist forces" seeking 
to protect "corruption and abuses in the armed forces" (Kiev 
radio, 6 February 1993).  Morozov in turn defended Mulyava 
against charges of discrimination against ethnic Russians 
(Narodna Armiya, 17 April 1993).  The UOU issued a combative 
statement, published in Narodna Armiya on 4 February 1993, 
decrying "political provocations by pro-communist, chauvinist 
[pro-Russian] forces," which it said could lead to civil war and 
the loss of Ukrainian independence. 
   Furthermore, after the Third UOU Congress in April 1992, pressure 
from opponents began to unravel the web of personal links that 
the UOU had so successfully created between itself and the 
defense establishment, a process abetted by the endemic factional 
and personal rivalries within the UOU itself.  Martirosyan and 
Chechylo, the UOU's two most prominent figures in the area of 
servicemen's social welfare, broke with the union after the Third 
Congress (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993).  In March 1993, Morozov 
dismissed Deputy Minister for Personnel Oleksandr Ihnatenko, a 
key UOU ally, for allegedly tolerating corruption (Narodna 
Armiya, 26 March, 17 April 1993). 
   Meanwhile, there was infighting within the leadership of the UOU. 
Martirosyan was forced out from the UOU chairmanship at the Third 
Congress under heavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) 
and after his deputy, Chechylo, had publicly criticized him for 
being reluctant to step down (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992). 
Volodymyr Pylypchuk, a UOU deputy chairman as well as deputy 
chief of the Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate, 
attacked the UOU leadership--at that point chaired by Omelchenko- 
-for "authoritarian methods," incompetence and poor organization 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 19 June 1992).  In December 1992, Chechylo, at 
that point no longer a UOU official but still identifying himself 
as a UOU member, accused Omelchenko of tolerating and even 
encouraging corruption within the UOU leadership (Pravda Ukrainy, 
21 December 1992).  The following year, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, who 
had just been elected UOU chairman at the Fourth Congress in 
April 1993, told an interviewer that Omelchenko, his predecessor 
as chairman and his subordinate in the Security Service, had used 
his UOU position to advance his own career (Narodna Armiya, 13 
May 1993). 
   The Fourth UOU Congress 
   Despite clear signs that its opponents' attacks were taking a 
toll on the union, the UOU made it clear at its Fourth Congress 
in April 1993 that it was not backing down on its ambitions to 
play a leading role in military policy.  Attendance, as compared 
with the Third Congress a year earlier, was down sharply, from 
918 delegates to about 6OO.  Outgoing Chairman Omelchenko said 
Ukraine was facing "difficult times" in the economy, which he 
blamed on the "nomenklatura" parliament.  Other speakers 
criticized parliament for failing either to enact a military 
doctrine or to cut back the size of the armed forces, accusing it 
of protecting servicemen whom the UOU thought should be dismissed 
for corruption or disloyalty.  The congress also expressed 
considerable dissatisfaction" with the activities of the 
government's Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen 
(CSPS) and called--unsuccessfully--for the dismissal of CSPS 
Chairman Martirosyan, a former UOU chairman who was by that point 
estranged from the union (Ukrinform, 6 April 1992; Narodna 
Armiya, 13 April 1993).  Addressing the congress, Morozov praised 
the UOU's activities and said that it "should not be a bystander" 
in personnel and indoctrination matters (Narodna Armiya, 13 April 
1993; Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 27 April 1993), advice the UOU seemed 
inclined to take to heart.  Its new chairman, Oleksandr 
Skypalskyy, asserted shortly afterwards that the Fourth Congress 
had been held "exclusively to affirm the readiness and aspiration 
of the UOU to take an active part in the building of the 
Ukrainian army" (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). 
   New Defense Minister Cracks Down on the UOU 
   The UOU's position within the military establishment suffered an 
especially serious decline after Vitaliy Radetskyy's appointment 
in October 1993 as defense minister, replacing Morozov. 
Radetskyy brought with him a reputation as a foe of the UOU 
(Narodna Armiya, 17 September 1992), a reputation he did nothing 
to dispel.  Asked in parliament about his attitude toward the 
UOU, he was implicitly hostile, saying that the question of 
dissolving the union needed to be "studied attentively."  He was 
noncommittal when asked his evaluation of Socio-Psychological 
Service Chief Volodymyr Mulyava's activities, though he did tell 
an interviewer later that he would slow down--but not eliminate- 
-Mulyava's controversial program to promote use of the Ukrainian 
language in the armed forces (Kiev radio, 8 October 1993; Moloda 
Halychyna, 14 October 1993).  Meanwhile, the parliament sought to 
curtail the UOU's role, enacting a new Military Doctrine which 
banned political activity by servicemen (Golos Ukrainy, 29 
October 1993).  Omelchenko--clearly seeing the ban as a serious 
threat--called it a "gross violation of human rights" (UNIAN, 3 
November 1993). (See Note 5) 
   (Note 5) Ironically, only four months earlier, the Fourth UOU 
Congress had criticized the parliament's delay in enacting a 
military doctrine (Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993). 
   Once in office, Radetskyy took several steps to curtail the UOU's 
influence.  He shifted Mulyava to a new position as deputy 
defense minister for ties with the public, parties, and 
movements, a shift seen as a blow to Mulyava and the UOU, since 
it removed him from involvement in personnel-related matters. 
Radetskyy also removed Mulyava from the Higher Certification 
Commission, along with two UOU allies, former Defense Ministry 
personnel chief Oleksandr Ihnatenko and Yuriy Prokofyev, chief of 
the Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate (UNIAN, 2 
December 1993).  These actions led commentators to claim that the 
ministry was conducting a "purge" of UOU activists (Narodna 
Hazeta No. 44, November 1993; Valentyn Labunskyy in Holos 
Ukrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993).  One commentary in a nationalist 
Lviv newspaper even claimed that Radetskyy was serving Russia's 
interests by making these changes (Andriy Starostin in Post- 
Postup, 2 December 1993).  Radetskyy reportedly forbade officers 
to write for publication--supposedly in response to a critical 
article by Air Force Major General Oleksandr Rol, (See Note 6) a 
UOU member who was subsequently elected the union's chairman 
(UNIAN, 3 November 1993).  Radetskyy also revoked Morozov's 1992 
order giving the UOU a role in personnel matters (Kievskiye 
Vedomosti, 27 November 1993). 
   (Note 6) Rol's article, published only a few days after 
Radetskyy's appointment, excoriated the Defense Ministry 
leadership for incompetence and corruption and asserted that the 
military was incapable of reforming itself without the 
involvement of outsiders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993). 
   Radetskyy's apparent hostility toward the UOU communicated itself 
down the chain of command.  Some unit commanders reportedly tried 
to suppress UOU activities (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 22 November 
1993).  In December, the UOU's Kiev organization appealed to 
Radetskyy to put a stop to what it called "arbitrariness" and 
"pressure" against UOU activists by commanders (Molod Ukrayiny, 
17 December 1993).  UOU officials also claimed that the Defense 
Ministry had attempted to prevent officers on active duty from 
attending the UOU's Fifth Congress, granting permission only at 
the last moment (Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  At the congress, 
two delegates claimed that the military command was trying to 
"ban" UOU representatives from certification commissions at all 
levels, which vet appointments (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). 
   UOU Remains Defiant, Steps Up Political Activity 
   The Fifth UOU Congress 
   When the Fifth UOU Congress met in December 1993, the 
organization's estrangement from the defense establishment was 
near-total.  Attendance was down again, to a mere 225 delegates, 
less than a quarter of the attendance at the Third Congress a 
year and a half earlier.  Outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy 
and other participants attributed the decline to "persecution" of 
UOU members by commanders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993; 
Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  No top Defense Ministry officials 
attended (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994); by contrast, Morozov 
and other senior figures had addressed the Second, Third and 
Fourth Congresses (Moscow Russian TV, 2 November 1991; Narodnaya 
Armiya, 8 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993).  In 
contrast to its extensive favorable coverage of earlier UOU 
congresses, the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya 
published only a short Ukrinform report on the Fifth Congress (22 
December 1993). 
   The congress's mood was defiant.  It elected a new chairman, Rol, 
who was already in disfavor with the Defense Ministry and who was 
rumored to be on the verge of dismissal from the armed forces in 
retaliation for the critical article he had published in October 
(Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994).  Speakers 
attacked the government for not spending enough on defense and 
failing to promote arms exports (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993; 
Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  Delegates gave a standing ovation to 
a fiery speech threatening to revive the 1940's anti-Soviet 
Ukrainian Insurrection Army if "anybody" prevented the UOU from 
playing what it considered its proper role (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 
December 1993).  Mulyava called on the UOU, despite the "new 
conditions," to expand its influence "in all spheres of army 
life" (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994).  Another UOU official, 
Bohdan Vivchar, assailed the UOU's parliamentary critics as 
"national chauvinist [pro-Russian] forces" who sought to "prevent 
the consolidation of an independent Ukrainian state through the 
building of strong armed forces" (Halychyna, 4 January 1994). 
Delegates also pointed to recent opinion polls showing high 
popular support for the officer corps, evidently seeing this as 
proof that the UOU was in a stronger political position than its 
critics (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994). 
   Parliamentary Election Campaign Activity 
   Faced with official hostility and with its influence within the 
establishment on the decline, the UOU is re-emphasizing its long- 
standing links with Rukh and other nationalist groups in 
preparation for the March 1994 parliamentary election.  In 
December 1993, UOU Deputy Chairman Omelchenko appealed for all 
"democratic" groups to unite during the election campaign and to 
run a single "democratic" candidate in each parliamentary 
district (Interfax, 17 December 1993).  Addressing the Fifth UOU 
Congress, Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil likewise appealed for 
unity of all "democratic and patriotic forces" in the election 
campaign and urged the union to "engage in political activity 
more daringly" (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December 1993).  While the UOU 
is clearly taking an active role in the campaign, these appeals 
for unity are meeting with mixed success.  The Fifth Congress 
decided to run UOU candidates in all regions of the country 
(Halychyna, 4 January 1994)--a goal the union is unlikely to 
achieve--while at the same time UOU is participating in the All- 
Ukrainian Electoral Committee of the Democratic Bloc with Rukh 
and several other nationalist groups to try to unite behind 
common candidates (Interfax, 17 December 1993; UNIAR, 4 January 
1994). 
   At least six UOU leaders are candidates for parliament:  Rol; 
Omelchenko; Skypalskyy; Mulyava; Guards Lieutenant Colonel 
Oleksandr Lobashchuk, a member of the UOU's Executive Committee 
and deputy chairman of its Lviv Oblast organization; and Vasyl 
Krychun, a local government official and deputy chairman of the 
Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast UOU organization.  All but Krychun are 
apparently defying the Military Doctrine ban on political 
activity, since they remain on active duty.  Five of the six are 
running in nationalist western Ukraine, the UOU's main power 
base.  Rol is running in Lviv Oblast on the ticket of the 
Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, Lobashchuk also in Lviv 
Oblast as an independent supported by the UOU, Skypalskyy in 
Volyn Oblast, and Mulyava and Krychun in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast 
(Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 4, 14 January, 24 February 1994; Vechirniy 
Kyyiv, 21 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 12 January 1994; 
Halychyna, 27 January, 12 February 1994).  Omelchenko is running 
in Kiev as a candidate of the Party for Democratic Revival of 
Ukraine (UNIAR, 29 December 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 4 January 
1994). 
   Prospects 
   Despite the reverses it has suffered since mid-1992, the UOU is 
clearly determined to remain a force in Ukrainian military 
policy.  Recent statements by the UOU's leaders show that it has 
not abandoned its central ambition of playing a leading role in 
shaping the armed forces and acting as the guardian of their 
loyalty and honesty.  Its vigorous activity in the parliamentary 
election campaign shows its determination to seek alternate means 
to exert influence on the military even in the face of the 
Defense Ministry's hostility.  Its strong and long-standing links 
with Rukh and other important political groups will probably be 
helpful to it in this endeavor. 
   Appendix A:  The UOU'S Agenda 
   UOU spokesmen have said that the union's goal is to ensure that 
all members of Ukraine's officer corps will be honest, competent, 
and loyal to Ukraine (See for example the UOU Draft Program in 
Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992; as well as interviews by then-UOU 
First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo in Narodnaya Armiya, 28 
March 1992; then-UOU Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy and Kiev local 
organization Chairman Volodymyr Saladyak in Narodna Armiya, 13 
May 1993; and current UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol in Samostiyna 
Ukrayina, 5 February 1994).  Stated in such general terms, these 
goals are hardly controversial and in fact have been endorsed 
even by the UOU's opponents, including Radetskyy (see his 
articles in Armiya Ukrayiny, 26 January 1994, and in Ukrayinska 
Hazeta, 2 February 1994).  Controversy has centered instead on 
the UOU's aspiration to play a direct and leading role in 
personnel decisions, down to the level of influencing individual 
appointments and dismissals, as well as on its criteria- 
-particularly ethnicity--for ensuring loyalty to Ukraine. 
   Beyond its primary interest in influencing personnel and 
indoctrination, the UOU has also pledged to work for better 
living conditions for servicemen and to prevent the 
misappropriation of military property, either by corrupt 
individuals or by Russia.  Its focus on Ukrainian nationalism is 
displayed in its strenuous opposition to Crimean separatism.  It 
has also lobbied against ceding control of the former Soviet 
Black Sea Fleet to Russia and against the presence of any foreign 
troops in Ukraine (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994). 
   Military Personnel, Indoctrination and Loyalty Issues 
   The UOU's attempts to shape Ukraine's officer corps has been its 
main raison d'etre almost from the beginning.  Two key UOU 
leaders, Hryhoriy Omelchenko and Volodymyr Mulyava (See Appendix 
C: Biographical Information) have played the most prominent roles 
in this area.  Omelchenko has sought to use his positions in the 
Security Service and on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification 
Commission to weed out unsuitable officers--though he claims to 
have been thwarted in these efforts by entrenched conservatives 
in government (See above, page  ).  Mulyava, meanwhile, took the 
lead in attempting to mold servicemen into what he and the UOU 
considered Ukrainian patriots.  It remains unclear to what extent 
this meant--as critics charged--favoring ethnic Ukrainians over 
ethnic Russians (See above, page   ).  However, UOU leaders 
frequently warned union audiences against the danger of ethnic 
discrimination, suggesting that at least some UOU supporters, 
despite denials, may have in fact pursued discrimination against 
Russians.  For instance, UOU Deputy Chairman Andriy Haysynskyy 
told an interviewer in 1991 that "in my opinion" ethnicity should 
have no significance, implying that others did not share that 
view (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991).  At the Third UOU 
Congress, Deputy Chairman V. Lazorkin said the union should 
"help" military personnel authorities "make correct appointments 
to key posts," which should be filled only by "true patriots." 
While Lazorkin's statement was not unambiguously a call for 
ethnic discrimination, it may have been understood as such. 
Omelchenko, who was elected UOU chairman the next day, responded 
to Lazorkin by warning against seeking "enemies" on the basis of 
their ethnicity (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  The concern 
with ethnicity seems to be lingering, however, even among the 
UOU's friends; an interviewer for the nationalist newspaper Za 
Vilnu Ukrayinu praised newly-elected UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol's 
"good idiomatic Ukrainian" as evidence of his "healthy family 
roots" (14 January 1994). 
   Whatever its views on ethnicity, the UOU clearly will not 
willingly give up its claim to a role in shaping Ukraine's 
officer corps.  In a recent interview, newly-elected Chairman 
Oleksandr Rol, while making conciliatory statements about the new 
Defense Ministry leadership, asserted that "We [the UOU] consider 
it our duty to indoctrinate army personnel in the spirit of 
Ukrainian patriotism and glorious traditions of the Ukrainian 
Army" (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February 1994). 
   The UOU has also pushed insistently to require all officers to 
swear allegiance to the Ukrainian state.  Characteristically, the 
union presented itself as the guarantor that this goal would be 
achieved.  It early on created a data bank to identify officers 
who had or had not taken the oath (Moscow Ostankino TV, 29 
January 1992).  Then-UOU Chairman Vilen Martirosyan said he would 
use this data to lobby for the dismissal of all commanders who 
refused the oath (Moscow radio, 18 March 1992). 
   The Defense Ministry has endorsed this goal, but not a UOU role 
in enforcing it.  In mid-1992, then-military personnel chief 
Oleksandr Ihnatenko, a UOU ally, said that all officers who 
refused the oath would be transferred to service in Russia or 
other former Soviet republics (Krasnaya Zvezda, 9 June 1992). 
One officer, Major Grigoriy Nesmyanovich, claimed that this in 
practice meant denying salaries and other benefits to officers 
who refused the oath as a way of pressuring them to leave Ukraine 
voluntarily (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 July 1992).  Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy, a UOU opponent, recently ordered that any 
remaining officers who had not taken the oath be removed from 
active service (UNIAN, 1 February 1994). 
   Yet another aspect of UOU involvement in military personnel 
matters has been its campaign to bring Ukrainian servicemen, 
stationed in other parts of the former Soviet Union or in Eastern 
Europe, "home" to Ukraine.  Shortly after the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union, the UOU Executive Committee called for an 
interstate agreement to send all former Soviet servicemen to 
their "native" republics (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992). 
Then-Defense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov told the Third UOU 
Congress that the "return" of these servicemen would help to 
"Ukrainianize" the army (Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1992). 
   Protection of Military Property 
   The UOU has cast itself as the protector of military property 
from both theft and attempts by Russian authorities to 
appropriate equipment claimed by Ukraine.  The subject was raised 
at the Second UOU Congress (Literaturna Ukrayina, 7 November 
1991) and at a January 1992 UOU Executive Committee session 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992).  At its Third Congress, the 
UOU took credit for protecting military property against 
misappropriation (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  The Third 
Congress highlighted its concern with the corruption issue by 
electing Security Service Col. Hryhoriy Omelchenko as UOU 
chairman.  Although Omelchenko has complained that he has been 
prevented by conservative politicians from carrying out this 
mandate (See above, page    ), the UOU nonetheless remains 
determined to attempt to police the military.  The head of the 
UOU Lviv Oblast organization, Mykola Vasylkevych, recently 
asserted that "the UOU will take a most active part" in 
inventorying and protecting military property, "from ships under 
construction to the last cartridge" (Shlyakh Peremohy, 15 January 
1994). 
   "Social Protection" of Servicemen 
   The problem of the shortage of housing and other amenities for 
military officers evidently presented a dilemma for the UOU. 
While any organization aspiring to influence among servicemen in 
the former Soviet Union must address this issue, Ukraine's near- 
catastrophic economic situation makes it difficult for any group 
to deliver on its promises.  Although the union 
characteristically at first presented itself as the guarantor 
that living standards would improve, it eventually backed off its 
earlier aspirations and promises.  It may be a testament to the 
intractability of the problem that the UOU officials most 
identified with the social welfare issue, founding Chairman Vilen 
Martirosyan and former First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo, 
have both fallen out with the organization (See Appendix C: 
Biographical Information). 
   The UOU urged, and took credit for, the creation in late 1991 of 
a Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS) attached 
to the Ukrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 
January 1992).  Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the new 
committee (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992), and Chechylo chief 
of its General Department (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992). 
Martirosyan told the UOU Executive Committee in January 1992 that 
military housing and other "social protection" issues were a 
"main task" and "top priority" for the UOU and that his dual role 
created "new opportunities" to solve the problem (Narodnaya 
Armiya, 1 February 1992).  The "social protection" issue was a 
major topic of discussion at the Third UOU Congress, and 
Martirosyan told the congress that the union was establishing a 
fund to finance housing construction (Moscow radio, 4 April 1992; 
Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  In June, the UOU Draft Program 
repeated that promise (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992).  However, 
the Third Congress reportedly believed that Martirosyan could not 
adequately lead both the UOU and the CSPS.  Both he and Chechylo 
stepped down from their UOU posts, Martirosyan reportedly under 
heavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). 
   By 1993, the UOU was backing off from its earlier plans to play 
an active role in providing for servicemen's welfare.  In April, 
the Fourth Congress assailed Martirosyan's stewardship of the 
CSPS, calling for his dismissal but rejecting a call for the 
abolition of the CSPS (Interfax, 12 April 1993; Narodna Armiya, 
13 April 1993).  In May, then-UOU Chairman Skypalskyy said that, 
earlier promises notwithstanding, the union could not help 
finance housing construction, and would merely offer "moral 
support" to officers in need of housing (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 
1993).  In contrast to the Third and Fourth Congresses, the Fifth 
UOU Congress in December 1993 was not reported to have discussed 
"social protection" at all. 
   Crimea 
   In keeping with its Ukrainian nationalist roots, the UOU opposes 
any change in Crimea's status (Narodnaya Armiya, 9 June 1992). 
The union and its Crimea regional organization assailed the 
Russian parliament's July 1993 resolution claiming Crimea as 
Russian territory (ITAR-TASS, 1O July 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 28 
July 1993).  In September, the union declared that no bilateral 
issues could be solved until Russia "surrendered its territorial 
claims" (Kiev radio, 2 September 1993).  In December, a Crimean 
Ukrainian Civil Congress was created, headed by Lieutenant 
Colonel Serhiy Lytvyn, chairman of the UOU Crimea regional 
organization, to lobby for "preserving Ukraine's territorial 
integrity."  The congress opposed the very holding of a Crimean 
presidential election (Kiev radio, 2 December 1993; Moscow Radio, 
4 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993). 
   Box 
   Allegations of UOU Links to Radical Nationalist Groups 
   Although there have been claims that the UOU is linked to, and is 
even giving active support to, underground armed nationalist 
organizations such as Ukrainian Self-Defense (UNSO) (Moscow News, 
14-21 June 1992; Pravda, 13 May 1993; Valeriy Izmalkov in 
Kievskiye Vedomosti, 27 November 1993), Ukrainian news media have 
not been observed to report hard evidence of such ties.  It 
should also be noted that these allegations emanate mostly from 
Russian sources or from Ukrainian critics of the UOU.  Former UOU 
Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy has denied these claims; although 
he said that the members of UNSO and similar groups were 
"patriots," he also said "I do not share their methods" 
(Literaturna Ukrayina, 23 September 1993).  UNSO leader Dmitriy 
Korchinskiy recently told a Moscow News interviewer that UNSO has 
the support of "officers' circles," but he did not mention the 
UOU or any other organization by name (18-24 February 1994). 
   End Box 
   Appendix B:  Evolution of UOU Policy on Nuclear Weapons 
   The UOU has moved gradually from a position of supporting the 
country's denuclearization to one of seeking to retain a 
strategic nuclear arsenal for some time to come.  The First UOU 
Congress called for a nuclear-free Ukraine (TASS, 29 July 1991). 
The UOU's first chairman, Vilen Martirosyan, subsequently said 
that plans for separate Ukrainian armed forces did not include 
any ''strategic'' component, which he said should remain under 
central" control (Kuranty, 29 August 1991).  The Second UOU 
Congress in November 1991 supported this position (Literaturna 
Ukrayina, 7 November 1991).  However, the Third UOU Congress 
hailed a statement by Vasyl Durdynets, deputy chairman of the 
Ukrainian parliament, that any "strategic" forces on Ukrainian 
soil should be subordinated to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
(Moscow Radio, 4 April 1992).  The Fourth UOU Congress called for 
keeping nuclear weapons in Ukraine (Interfax, 12 April 1992).  At 
the Fifth UOU Congress, outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy 
spoke in support of the Ukrainian parliament's heavily- 
conditioned ratification in November 1993 of the START I Treaty 
and the Lisbon Protocol (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993).  His 
successor, Oleksandr Rol, recently told an interviewer that he 
believed that Ukraine would need a nuclear deterrent for as long 
as Russia possesses nuclear weapons--a position which he has made 
part of his parliamentary election campaign platform.  Rol also 
said that, in his capacity as UOU chairman, he would 
"investigate" the fact that the officers of the Vinnytsya-based 
43d Missile Army had not sworn allegiance to Ukraine (Za Vilnu 
Ukrayinu, 14 January 1994; Shlyakh Peremohy, 29 January 1994). 
The UOU has issued a statement opposing Ukraine's "unilateral 
nuclear disarmament" (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994), and the 
union's local organization in Kiev has called for a nationwide 
referendum on the subject (Khreshchatyk, 5 March 1994). 
   Appendix C:  Biographical Information 
   The following biographical entries are intended to illustrate the 
UOU's connections with Rukh and other nationalist organizations, 
as well as with the Defense Ministry and other government 
institutions.  Russian spellings, where they differ from 
Ukrainian, are given in parentheses. 
   Chechylo (Chechilo), Vitaliy, Lt. Col.  He was chairman of Rukh's 
Military Collegium; he then served as deputy chairman of the 
organizing committee for the First UOU Congress, where he was 
elected UOU first deputy chairman (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 18 
September 1991).  He is chief of the General Department of the 
Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen attached to the 
Ukrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992). 
He stepped down from his UOU post at the Third Congress 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992).  He has since been feuding 
with the union's leadership, accusing it of corruption (Pravda, 
Ukrayiny, 21 December 1992).  Former UOU Chairman Oleksandr 
Skypalskyy called his criticisms "ignoble and ungentlemanly," 
claiming that he had not been expelled only because the union had 
no expulsion procedure (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). 
   Haysynskyy (Gaysinskiy), Andriy, Lt.  A UOU deputy chairman (Za 
Vilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991), he served on the commission 
to organize the Defense Ministry Socio-Psychological Service 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July 1992). 
   Kostyuk, Roman, Col., reserves.  He was chairman of the UOU Kiev 
organization in 1992 (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992) and then 
UOU first deputy chairman (Narodna Hazeta No. 44, November 1993). 
He helped draft the 1991 legislation setting up the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  He was one of the 
signers, along with Rukh's Vyacheslav Chornovil, of a 
Proclamation of the Standing Council of Democratic Parties and 
Movements of Ukraine, calling for unity in the March 1994 
parliamentary election campaign (Khreshchatyk, 11 December 1993). 
   Krychun, Vasyl.  A former member of the Soviet Air Defense 
Forces, he is now a member of both the oblast and city soviets, 
as well as head of the city communal property fund, in Ivano- 
Frankivsk.  A member of Rukh since 1989, he is also deputy 
chairman of the UOU Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast organization and a 
candidate in the March 1994 election for parliament (Halychyna, 
12 February 1994). 
   Kubakh, M.F., Lt. Col., reserves.  A deputy UOU chairman for 
economic affairs and a member of the Kharkiv Oblast Soviet 
military commission, he was one of the authors of the UOU Draft 
Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992). 
   Lazorkin, V, Col., member of the Lviv Oblast Soviet (Narodnaya 
Armiya, 22 January 1992). He served as UOU deputy chairman 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and chairman of the UOU 
Coordinating Council (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 July 1992).  He helped 
draft the 1991 legislation setting up Ukrainian Armed Forces 
(Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and was one of the authors of 
the UOU Draft Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992). 
   Lytvyn (Litvin), Serhiy, Lt. Col., retired.  Chairman of the UOU 
Crimean regional organization and chairman of the Ukrainian 
Studies Department at the Symferopil Higher Building School, he 
was elected chairman of the new Crimean Ukrainian Civil Congress 
in December 1993, at which time he retired from active military 
duty (Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993). 
   Martirosyan, Vilen, Maj. Gen.  A member of Rukh's Political 
Council, he was elected the UOU's first chairman at its First 
Congress in July 1991 (TASS, 29 July 1991).  He served as 
chairman until the Third Congress in April 1992, when he stepped 
down under pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992), and 
subsequently left the UOU altogether (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 
1993).  He recently authored a scathing attack on the UOU, 
claiming that under Volodymyr Mulyava's leadership it had 
instigated an "open purge" of the officer corps in favor of then- 
Defense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov's supporters, which 
according to Martirosyan has resulted in a wholesale exodus of 
highly skilled servicemen, both officers and enlisted men 
(Kievskiye Vedomosti, 5 February 1994).  He has been chairman of 
the Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen, attached to 
the Ukrainian Council of Ministers, since its creation in 
December 1991 (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992; Kievskiye 
Vedomosti, 5 February 1994).  He is an ethnic Armenian (Narodnaya 
Armiya, 4 April 1992). 
   Mulyava, Volodymyr.  Mulyava's only military rank prior to 
January 1992 was sergeant in the reserves (Moskovskiye Novosti, 
10 November 1992).  He developed his ideas for a military Socio- 
Psychological Service to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism among 
servicemen as early as 1986, and was active in Rukh's 1990 and 
1991 preparations to organize the UOU (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July 
1992).  A deputy chairman of Rukh's governing board, he chaired 
the organizing committee for the First UOU Congress and was 
elected UOU deputy chairman (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991; Rabochaya 
Tribuna, 2 August 1991).  In September 1991, he submitted a 
report on behalf of Rukh to Ukraine's new defense minister, 
Konstyantyn Morozov, proposing to create a Socio-Psychological 
Service.  Morozov gave Mulyava the rank of colonel and appointed 
him to head a commission to organize the new service (Narodnaya 
Armiya, 29 July 1992).  In February 1992, Mulyava was appointed 
head of the service (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992).  He 
also sat on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Commission. 
At the end of 1992, he was promoted to major general (Narodnaya 
Armiya, 3 December 1992).  In late 1993, Mulyava was removed from 
the Socio-Psychological Service and appointed deputy minister for 
ties with the public, parties, and movements, a shift which was 
seen as weakening his and the UOU's influence since his new 
position gave him no role in personnel or indoctrination (Holos 
Ukrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993).  He was also removed from the 
Higher Certification Commission (UNIAR, 2 December 1993). 
Mulyava has served as Rukh spokesman on economic policy (Narodna 
Hazeta, No. 1, January 1992) and on Ukrainian Orthodox Church 
affairs (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 June 1992) and is the hetman of 
the Ukrainian Cossacks (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 4 March 1993; Kiev 
radio, 18 August 1993).  He is a candidate in the March 1994 
election for parliament (Halychyna, 27 January 1994). 
   Omelchenko, Hryhoriy.  Formerly a career MVD officer (Narodna 
Armiya, 13 May 1993), Omelchenko is now a colonel in the 
Ukrainian Security Service, where he heads the organized crime 
unit of the Military Counterintelligence Directorate 
(Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993).  He is also a member of the Defense 
Ministry Higher Certification Commission (Narodnaya Armiya, 30 
January 1993).  Omelchenko was a deputy chairman of the UOU until 
its Third Congress in April 1992, when he was elected chairman 
(Narodna Armiya, 8 April 1992).  He served as chairman until the 
Fourth Congress a year later, when he was again elected deputy 
chairman (Kiev radio, 15 September 1993); he was re-elected to 
that post at the Fifth Congress (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December 
1993).  He is a candidate for parliament on the ticket of the 
Democratic Revival of Ukraine Party (UNIAR, 29 December 1993). 
   Pylypchuk (Pilipchuk), Volodymyr, Colonel.  He helped draft 1991 
legislation setting up Ukrainian Armed Forces (Narodnaya Armiya, 
8 April 1992).  A deputy chief of the Defense Ministry Military 
Education Directorate, he headed a Ministry commission to take 
control of Crimean naval academies from Black Sea Fleet Command 
(Narodna Armiya, 3 September 1992).  He was one of the authors of 
the UOU Draft Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992) and a UOU 
executive committee member (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992) 
and deputy chairman (Narodnaya Armiya, 19 June 1992). 
   Prokofyev, Yuriy, Maj. Gen.  Chief of the Defense Ministry 
Military Education Directorate (Golos Ukrainy, 15 January 1993). 
Though not reported to be a UOU member, he co-authored, with UOU 
deputy chairmen Volodymyr Mulyava and Hryhoriy Omelchenko, an 
article accusing Lieutenant General Boris Sharykov, then military 
adviser to President Kravchuk, of corruption, pro-communist and 
pro-Russian sympathies, and disloyalty to Ukraine (Narodnaya 
Armiya, 3 June 1992).  He was removed from the Defense Ministry 
Higher Certification Commission by Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy (UNIAN, 2 December 1993). 
   Rol (Ryl), Oleksandr, Maj. Gen.  Once a senior Soviet Air Force 
officer, Rol is now chief of the Operational Administration Staff 
of the Ukrainian Air Force (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February 
1994).  He has persistently criticized the leadership of the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry for inefficiency and corruption and 
has called for a robust Ukrainian military, including offensive 
as well as defensive capabilities (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 17 March 
1992; Ukrinform, 3 March 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993; 
Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 8 February 1994).  He recently endorsed 
Ukrainian retention of nuclear weapons (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 14 
January 1994).  Rol was elected UOU chairman at the Fifth 
Congress (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993) and is a candidate 
in the March 1994 election for parliament (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 14 
January 1994). 
   Skypalskyy (Skipalskiy), Oleksandr, Maj. Gen.  A career KGB 
officer, Skypalskyy headed the Ukrainian Security Service's 
Military Counterintelligence Directorate (Molod Ukrayiny, 17 
October 1991) until he transferred to the Defense Ministry in 
1993 to head its new Strategic Military Intelligence Directorate 
(Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 23 July 1993).  A 
member of the UOU Executive Committee until April 1993, he was 
elected UOU chairman at the Fourth Congress (Narodna Armiya, 13 
April 1993).  He stepped down at the Fifth Congress in December 
1993 to run for parliament (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993). 
With Oleksandr Yemets, leader of the Party of Democratic Revival 
of Ukraine, he was one of the founders of the Democratic Center 
electoral bloc for the March 1994 election (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 
12 January 1994). 
   Saladyak (Solodyak), Volodymyr, Col., retired.  A deputy UOU 
chairman and head of the UOU Kiev city organization, he was one 
of the authors of the UOU Draft Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June

ethnic Ukrainian servicemen stationed outside the Ukraine back to 
Ukraine (Narodnaya Armiya, 17 March 1992). 
   Yemets, Oleksandr.  Leader of the Party of Democratic Revival of 
Ukraine (Interfax, 14 December 1993) and minister for 
nationalities and migration (Holos Ukrayiny, 28 April 1993),

chairman of the organizing committee for the First UOU Congress 
(Kiev radio, 27 July 1991).  The Second UOU Congress called 
unsuccessfully for his appointment as head of the Ukrainian 
Security Service (Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991).  With former 
UOU Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy, he was one of the founders of 
the Democratic Center electoral bloc for the March 1994 
parliamentary election (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 12 January 1994). 
Another former UOU chairman, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, is running for 
parliament as a candidate of Yemets's party (UNIAR, 29 December

SUMMARY 
                                        Apparently seeing little merit in a policy of open confrontation 
with the Chinese over human rights issues and at the same time 
eager to secure a share of China's burgeoning market, Germany and 
France have avoided all but the most muted public criticism of 
China's human rights record while steadily expanding diplomatic 
and trade contacts.  German and French media, while supportive of 
improved relations with China, have expressed doubts about the 
wisdom of sof t-pedaling the human rights issue and yielding to 
China's demand to stop selling arms to Taiwan. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   In marked contrast to recent U.S. policy, both Germany and France 
have chosen a low-key approach to the issue of Chinese human 
rights violations, arguing that it is more effective to promote 
democratic development through strengthened economic relations 
than through public admonitions.  Germany's efforts, including 
lifting sanctions against China and yielding to China's 
insistence that it not sell submarines to Taiwan, culminated in 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's trip to China in November 1993 and the 
signing of several large contracts.  Similarly, following months 
of diplomatic efforts to repair a rift in relations triggered by 
France's sale of Mirage airplanes to Taiwan in November 1992, 
France and China "normalized" relations on 12 January.  In return 
for two key French concessions--recognition of the PRC Government 
as the "sole legal government of China" and Taiwan as an 
"integral part of Chinese territory" and agreement "not to 
authorize" any French enterprises to sell arms to Taiwan--China 
agreed to welcome participation by French firms in China "on an 
equal footing," according to a joint communique (Xinhua, 12 
January). 
   Germany's "Quiet Diplomacy" 
   German leaders have repeatedly defended the government's policy 
of not pressuring the Chinese publicly on human rights and 
instead promoting change through economic relations and "behind- 
the-scenes" efforts.  Both Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
have stressed that Germany's approach on Chinese human rights is 
to use quiet diplomacy and to promote progress on human rights 
and democracy in China through trade and economic reform: 
   --Even after the recent roundup of Chinese dissidents, the German 
reaction was limited to an expression of "concern" over the 
arrests, and a caution issued by a foreign ministry spokesman 
that the arrests could "clearly disturb" German-Chinese 
relations.  Indicating that even in this case the usual German 
nonpublic diplomacy was being followed, the spokesman said Berlin 
had "approached" Beijing on this matter the previous week (DPA, 8 
March). 
   --Explaining Germany's approach to the human rights issue, Kinkel 
told German ambassadors to Asia on 26 January that "wagging an 
admonishing finger" at the Chinese would not be productive, 
because Europeans cannot "impose" their cultural principles on 
the Asian countries.  "Dignity," so important in Asia, he said, 
had to be respected.  He argued that instead of public 
confrontation, it would be more effective to be "secretly active" 
to help in concrete cases of human rights violations (Frankfurter 
Rundschau, 27 January).  Apparently with the United States in 
mind, Kinkel contrasted Germany's approach to those who "bang 
their fists on the table," and declared that the West "cannot 
enforce everything" with pressure on the leadership (Das 
Parlament, 24-31 December 1993). 
   --During his trip to China, Kohl defended his approach on human 
rights, saying that he had had an "intensive talk on human 
rights" with China's leaders but that it was "not a subject" for 
public discussion (N-TV, 19 November 1993). "History has shown," 
he argued in another interview, that "freedom leads to more 
freedom" and that free economic development "has an impact on 
human rights and the freedom of the citizens" (ARD, 19 November 
1993). 
   German Press Questions Policy 
   Until the arrest of Chinese dissidents in early March, media 
reaction had been largely supportive of the Government's trade 
initiatives in China and its low-key approach to the human rights 
issue.  The Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung even said in a 25 
January commentary that Kohl and Kinkel's efforts on human rights 
could "serve as a model" for dealing with China, because they 
demonstrated that "value-oriented" foreign policy does "not have 
to be an exercise in finger-pointing."  Since the largescale 
arrests, however, the press has questioned this policy, 
criticizing both Germany and the United States for acceding to 
China's demands and suggesting that the West's approach is giving 
Beijing every reason to believe that the West will do nothing to 
jeopardize trade relations: 
   --Following the arrest of prominent Chinese dissidents in early 
March, the influential daily Frankfurter Allgemeine on 5 March 
said the Chinese Government had shown what it thought of Western 
criticism:  namely, "nothing."  "For the sake of economic 
interests" the West will continue to turn a "blind eye" to the 
political suppression in China and even more so in Tibet, because 
the Chinese market is "too enticing."  Europe's argument that the 
"closer the economic ties," the greater the chances for 
"political loosening up," has proved "illusionary." 
   --On 17 February, Frankfurter Allgemeine chastized the German 
Government for the "shameful" way in which the city of Frankfurt 
had officially "invited and then uninvited" the Tibetan Dalai 
Lama to a celebration of Frankfurt's 1,200th anniversary, calling 
the move an "unnecessary kowtow" and an "undignified retreat" in 
the face of China's unreasonable demands. 
   --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau of 5 March said that 
"just as during Kohl's trip" to China, Beijing seems to have come 
to the conclusion that "all western admonitions" on human rights 
are meant "halfheartedly." 
   France Pleased 
   In announcing renewed relations with China, Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe avoided any mention of human rights issues, while 
saying that the "political weight of China and its economic 
power" justified France's decision to "resume the ties of trust." 
He expressed hope that this could be brought about through an 
"intense political dialogue with Beijing" and "strengthening of 
economic relations" (France-Inter Radio, 12 January). 
   Although they avoided pressing the Chinese on the issue, French 
leaders apparently did mention human rights in subsequent 
meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.  Following a 
meeting with Qian in Paris on 22 January, Juppe spoke of a "new 
departure" in relations with China, saying that he had addressed 
the issue of human rights with Qian and that "a lot must still be 
done" by China in that area (AFP, 22 January).  France's special 
envoy to China Alain Peyrefitte addressed the issue "with great 
subtlety" according to Le Figaro of 31 January, when he said at 
dinner with Qian in China that France, while it was unwilling to 
"impinge on a sovereign state's internal affairs," could "not be 
insensitive to matters relating to the respect of individual and 
group freedoms." 
   Skeptical French Press 
   The French press has criticized the government's failure to press 
the human rights issue, and has largely been skeptical of 
prospects for significantly improved trade relations.  Several 
commentaries attacked the government for yielding to China's 
demands on Taiwan and expressed pique at what they viewed as 
China's favoritism toward the United States, which they saw as 
having maintained relations with Taiwan without incurring Chinese 
retribution. 
   --The influential daily Le Monde was particularly skeptical.  An 
editorial on 14 January expressed doubt about the terms of the 
joint communique, saying that the Chinese have shown "how little 
regard" they attach to their promises of trade advantages.  As 
for human rights, it charged, Beijing is "convinced that 
'hypocritical' Western concerns for human rights" will eventually 
be superseded by greed.  On 25 January, Le Monde wrote 
sardonically that normalization of relations with China indeed 
represented a "new departure," since "commercial interests" had 
now "displaced the memory of the Tiananmen massacre," which the 
French government at the time had denounced with a determination 
"unmatched throughout the world." 
   --A commentary published in Liberation of 16 February charged the 
French Government with "obsequiousness" and "grovelling" toward 
Beijing in pledging not to sell weapons to Taiwan.  China's 
rulers "do not respect the rules" accepted by the international 
community with regard to human rights, weapons sales, or external 
trade, the commentary said, noting that the United States 
remained the "only country that still dares to say no to China" 
(Liberation, 16 February).

   ALBANIA 
   NEW TELEPHONE EXCHANGE IN LAC:  A new telephone exchange with 5OO 
numbers was inaugurated in Lac on 1 February.  This new exchange 
tripled the capacity of the existing one.  Future plans for 1994 
anticipate over 1,000 telephone numbers to be added to the existing 
ones in town.  The inauguration of this exchange was made possible 
due to cooperation with the Norwegian Telecom.  (Tirana ATA in 
English 1115 GMT 3 Feb 94 AU) 
   BUSINESSMEN'S CONFEDERATION:  A group of representatives from the 
existing businessmen associations held a meeting on 3 February to 
create the Confederation of Albanian Businessmen.  This association 
will be independent from the state, political parties, and religious 
communities.  Its program requires that the confederation appears in 
the country's economic and social life as an organization that will 
represent and support the interests of industrialists, constructors, 
merchants, traders and all businessmen who will be organized in 
their federations.  It will contribute to strengthen the democratic 
state and democracy in general as a worthy partner in the state- 
trade-union-employer triangle.  This confederation will be an active 
organization to protect the financial position of the Albanian 
businessmen in face of foreign capital competition.  The 
confederation will have relations with its analogous organizations 
abroad.  (Tirana ATA in English 1138 GMT 4 Feb 94; au0502183794 AU) 
   TRANSPORTATION MINISTER'S TALKS WITH GERMAN COUNTERPART: 
Transportation Minister Fatos Bitincka paid a one-day visit to Bonn 
at the invitation of his German counterpart, Wissmann.  During the 
talks, both sides agreed in principle to sign an agreement on roads, 
goods, and passengers and another one on maritime as soon as 
possible.  Wissmann said that Germany will continue to contribute to 
the development of Albanian infrastructure by granting its support 
through international organizations.  Bitincka also met with 
Schmidtbauer, minister at the cabinet of Chancellor Kohl.  They 
focused on developments in Albania and the situation in the region. 
Schmidtbauer assured Bitincka of a continuous support by the German 
Government in bilateral and multilateral aspects and presented some 
concrete possibilities of short-term, mid-term, and long-term 
cooperation.  Bitincka and his delegation also held a working 
meeting in German Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation.  (Tirana 
ATA in English 1108 GMT 5 Feb 94 AU) 
   EUROPEAN UNION ENVOY OUTLINES 1994 ASSISTANCE PLAN:  Elio 
Germano, EU Commission ambassador in Tirana, said today in a press 
conference that the European Union will continue to support the 
economic reform in Albania during 1994.  The 75 million ECU 
assistance, i.e. 10 million ECU more than in 1993, will be used in 
three directions:  35 million ECU for salaries, 20 millions for 
PHARE program, and 20 millions in the context of a regional program. 
In conformity with an agreement signed in principle by the Albanian 
Government, the regional program will be applied to agriculture, 
medicine and education fields as well as to develop the private 
sector and infrastructure.  The European Union, which started to 
operate in Albania in 1991, has so far assisted with 326 millions 
ECU ($38O millions).  The EU assistance has been used for the 
development of different sectors and for the growth of food 
products.  The assistance includes special programs for Albania, 
such as the Tempus Program, humanitarian aid given by governmental 
and non-governmental organizations, as well as concrete 
contributions by Italy, Greece and Germany.  (Tirana ATA in English 
0910 GMT 9 Feb 94 AU) 
   ITALY, EU TO FINANCE ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT IN SHKODER:  A joint 
Italian-Albanian environmental protection project based in Shkoder 
began operation in December 1993.  The goal of the project is to 
protect the environment of the city, famous for its cultural and 
historical interest and its excellent museum.  The project will also 
have an educational component.  The "Lvia Project" has employed 690 
people so far engaged in the reforestation of the hills round the 
city, the improvement of roads, restoration of the Rozafa Castle, 
including work on hospitals, schools, libraries, and the city's 
museum.  Gjon Markagjoni, Caritas director for northern Albania, 
said that "this is a good beginning," adding that in the future, the 
project will also cover the communes of Lac and Vau i Dejes.  The 
additional activity will increase the number of workers by several 
hundreds.  The Italian Government has allocated 3 billion liras to 
this joint venture.  This sum will finance the "Lvia Project" only 
for several months.  However, Markagjoni confirms that the European 
Union will contribute to the project in the near future.  The EU 
financing will permit the employment of additional workers and 
expand project activities.  Another Caritas representative said that 
future plans on the project will also cover agriculture, 
particularly vineyards.  (Tirana ATA in English 1126 GMT 27 Jan 94

   ASSEMBLY ADOPTS AGREEMENTS WITH POLAND, SLOVENIA:  At its morning 
session, the People's Assembly approved a bill on the ratification

   PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FARES TO RISE: Feim Godo, chief of the 
Road Transport Department at the Ministry of Transports and 
Communications, pointed out in an interview with Albanian Television 
on 27 January that the fuel price rise will also bring about an 
increase in public transportation fares.  Concerning the price of 
public urban, interurban, and railway transportation tickets, the 
ministry has specified a possible increase in tariffs, viewing the 
fuel price rise and the recent wage increase as a possible rise in 
inflation.  The Transports Ministry has envisaged a 40-percent 
increase in public transportation fares.  Godo states that the price 
of monthly public transportation cards will also be increased.  The 
ticket for an urban bus service will be five leks instead of three, 
thus denoting a 40-percent increase.  While the price of a monthly 
card will be 24-30 percent higher.  The train ticket fares will be 
about 30-40 percent lower than the price offered by private buses or 
cars.  Consequently, the state will cover losses in public urban and 
railway transportation to the amount of 350 million leks per year.

   DISTRIBUTION OF 2,000 CHINESE MINITRACTORS:  The Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food reports that on 24 January, 2,000 Chinese 
mini tractors, which reached Durres port on 15-17 January, were 
distributed to 11 private service centers in various districts of 
the country.  Ismail Bega, agricultural mechanisms director, stated 
that the mini tractors were sold to private farmers, mainly in 
northern areas, through four-year loans granted by the Agrarian 
Trade Bank at a 5-percent annual interest rate.  The Albanian 
Government bought these mini tractors in China at the cost of $4.4 
million to encourage local agricultural production.  Despite the 
poverty prevailing in the Albanian countryside, peasants bought the 
mini tractors in a short period of time, thus showing that the 
Albanian agricultural market badly needs agricultural facilities. 
   Land privatization, which was 92 percent completed by the end of 
1993, brought about the use of that part of the land that for 
various reasons remained untilled during the last two years.  A 
total of 9,000 agricultural appliances are presently functioning in 
the Albanian agriculture that counts 400,000 peasant families, each 
possessing a little more than one hectare of land.  Thanks to loans 
granted by the Albanian State Bank and various banks, and through 
private traders as well, during the last two years some 1,600 
tractors and 2,250 minitractors and cultivators have been brought to 
Albania from Germany, Italy, Britain, Greece, and other countries.

   CONSTRUCTION OF TIRANA-DURRES HIGHWAY TO BEGIN:  The Ministry of 
Transport has signed a contract for the construction of the first 5 
km of the Tirana-Durres highway.  The whole project is financed by 
the Albanian state.  The Albanian-Italian Euroteorema Joint Venture 
was announced winner of the tender.  The construction is expected to 
start in 45 days and be completed in a year or so.  The ministry 
sources confirm that this will open the way to other Albanian and 
foreign firms' making investments in the further construction of 
this highway.  Work to construct the first 5 km will start from 
Tirana.  The ministry has drafted other programs covering the 
restructuring of approximately 80 km of roads throughout the 
country.  Fatos Pojani, director of the Roads Department at the 
ministry, states that the World Bank has accorded a favorable loan 
to help in the construction of roads.  (Tirana ATA in English 1107

   TIRANA MUNICIPALITY AID TO FAMILIES:  During the second half of 
1993, the economic and social assistance sector in the Tirana 
municipality provided monthly economic assistance to 10,103 
families, to the sum of 126 million leks.  Economic aid for one 
family member has been given to 1,479 families, for two family 
members to 1,216 families, three members to 1,879 families, four 
members to 2,086 families and so on.  As for 1994, the necessary 
documentation is already compiled to grant economic assistance to 
this category of the population.  (Tirana ATA in English 1302 GMT 30

   TRAINING FOR BERAT UNEMPLOYED:  The Office of Social Assistance 
and Former Political Persecutees in Berat is arranging the training 
of unemployed people in order to employ them in the private sector. 
This will also contribute to the consolidation of the small business 
sector.  Tapir Numani, head of this office, said that 25 persons are 
being qualified at a private firm specializing in the production of 
bread and biscuits.  Every worker will receive 5,100 leks for three 
months with the condition that the firm's owner will employ 70 
percent of the workers trained there.  The same practice will also 
be followed in a construction firm.  At present, some 16,200 persons 
are receiving social assistance in Berat.  This figure has increased 
because the Textile Mill products are not being sold, so many 
textile workers have become jobless and are receiving assistance.

   STATE EMPLOYEES TO GET 'SIGNIFICANT' WAGE INCREASE:  Starting 
with 1 February, employees of budgetary institutions will have a 
salary increase of 33 percent.  Based on the decision by the 
Ministry of Labor and Emigration, a higher rise in wages is 
anticipated for senior state officials and institutions, including 
deputies.  This is the second year that the budgetary employees have 
received a significant salary rise.  The 1993 minimal wages, 
including the auxiliary sectors of state administration, will have a 
l00-percent increase, thus a monthly salary of 2,400 leks.  However, 
the minimum wage will be 1O times lower than the highest wage in the 
budgetary sector.  Both the rise and differentiation in salaries is 
made considering qualifications and positions in organizing and 
managing all state structures.  The decision on the salary rise came 
immediately after the Albanian Parliament approved the decision on 
taxes on personal incomes.  This decision does not cover monthly 
payments up to 4,000 leks and pensions.  (Tirana ATA in English 1108

   RESTITUTION PROBLEMS IN FIER:  The Commission for Restitution and 
Compensation of Properties in Fier have made only 60 decisions 
concerning houses, shops, and sites.  So far, the commission has 
received 220 requests for the restitution and compensation of 
properties.  Commission Chairman Shemedin Buci said that "we are 
facing many difficulties, although instructions have been very 
clear.  In some cases, two or three persons have claimed the same 
site.  That is why we have been cooperating with the district 
court."  Main reasons for the slowness in this process were the 
conflicts between the Town Planning Department and former owners who 
insist on taking the site pertaining to them, despite the town 
regulatory plan.  Another reason was also the uncontrolled sale of 
the buildings without first notifying their former owners.  (Tirana

   PRIVATE FARMERS ASSOCIATIONS:  By the end of December 1993, the 
number of private farmers associations reached 90.  They are 
concentrated in central Albania in the region of Elbasan, where 
there are 21 of them, and in Lushnje, where 10 associations are now 
operating.  Their number is limited in the north of the country, 
which is a mountainous area with limited land and populated by 
people with a strong feeling for land ownership.  The area that a 
farmers association covers is approximately 750 hectares.  The 
establishment of these associations has enabled the farmers to buy 
agricultural facilities and fertilizers and employ their family 
members in them.  A great number of families have now become members 
of these associations.  The Farmers Association of Kercukaj in 
Kavaje, central Albania, has 300 families as members, whereas the 
Farmers Association in Lac has 246 member-families.  Stock-breeders, 
too, have set up their own associations.  The largest of such 
associations is in Seman, in the Fier region, with about 700 head of 
livestock.  A great number of the farmers who possess greenhouses in 
Rrashbull and Kruje, central Albania, have joined the stock-breeders 
associations.  (Tirana ATA in English 1112 GMT 2 Feb 94 AU)

organized in one of the halls of the Dajti Hotel in Tirana.  "Our 
first step was an agreement we signed with the Albanian Government 
and which is a proof of its readiness to cooperate.  We are on the 
verge of signing a contract for the construction of 1,600-2,000 
flats.  If work goes well, then the number of flats will increase to 
6,000-7,000," Yona said.  Responding to questions by reporters 
present in the conference, Yona said that his firm is ready to start

construction firm.  Funds for the construction of this bridge have 
been allocated twice since 1963, but the bridge has not built before 
because there were only two construction enterprises in Albania that 
were specialized in such projects.  Recently, several construction 
enterprises in Mat competed for the bridge project.  (Tirana ATA in

contract, have launched their activity in Albania.  Other companies 
with a total of $70 million investment will launch their activity 
under contracts.  Foreign investors in Albania are free to transfer 
their profits.  All investors in the production sector are exempt 
from taxes for a four-year period.  The length of term may be 
prolonged for those companies that invest in the sector of tourism 
and continue to invest in production sectors.  Foreign investors are 
exempt from customs duty for the goods used in the process of

kind, such as supplying medicines and clothes, reconstructing a 
center for Albanian handicapped children, and furnishing farmers 
with seeds and chemical products.  The EU has given a larger fund 
for such projects this time because they have previously been

   FIRST PRIVATE BANK EXPECTS PROFIT FOR 1993:  In contrast to most 
of the Bulgarian commercial banks, the First Private Bank ended 1993 
with a profit, the bank's executive director Emiliyan Dimitrov 
informed the PARI daily.  The final figures are not yet known, but 
Dimitrov expected a net profit of about lOO million leva, most of 
which will be retained to build up the bank's reserves as required 
by law.  Dimitrov said that about 1O million leva would be 
distributed as dividends to shareholders.  Dimitrov attributed the 
lower profits in 1993 to the accumulation of bad debts, which 
increased from 9 percent in 1992 to 12-13 percent in 1993.  However, 
he considered this percentage normal for the conditions prevailing 
in Bulgaria.  One of the nonperforming loans is that made to the 
failed Yambol Bank.  However, Dimitrov said that the Bulgarian 
National Bank is likely to reach agreement soon with the committee 
of creditor banks.  (Sofia PARI in Bulgarian 2 Feb 94 p 4 AU)

   FIRM'S STOCK TO TRADE ON NASDAQ:  For several days now the U.S.

International Inc., the joint-stock company said.  Its officials say 
this is the first of the moves aimed at taking the shareholders on 
the U.S. stock market which will bring about a higher liquidity of 
investments.  Two months ago Lifechoice Int. launched an 
advertisement offensive in the press.  In terms of profitability, 
with its predicted dividends the company is way ahead of any other 
proposals for investment.  The setting up of the company with 
Canadian holding last June raised a stir.  It was said to be the 
first Bulgarian company to enter the international markets both with 
its output and with its shares.  Lifechoice Int. attracted attention 
following reports on the development of Factor-R, a new medicine for 
immuno-prophylaxis against HIV.  For the time being, most experts 
decline to comment either on the projected dividends or on the

   AGENCY CHIEF DENIES BEST COMPANIES ALREADY PRIVATIZED:  In an 
interview published in the latest issue of the CASH weekly, Khristo 
Pamukchiev, chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Privatization 
Agency, said that "nothing has been sold in Bulgaria yet to justify 
the claim that 'the tidbits' have already been eaten."  "The 
Bulgarian enterprises are in such a grave state that we cannot 
expect large financial proceeds.  That is why in the next few years 
we will pursue a policy of encouraging national investors.  The 
Privatization Agency intends to set into operation several 
additional techniques and levers such as leasing, management 
contracts with purchase and sale clauses, and the setting up of 
restorable privatization funds from which people will draw money at 
favorable terms and will gradually repay it from their profit," 
Pamukchiev says.  (Sofia BTA in English 1143 GMT 9 Feb 94 AU) 
   RECONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT FUND HAS 9.9 BILLION LEVA:  STANDART 
NEWS reported on 9 February that the state Reconstruction and 
Development Fund has 9.9 billion leva available for investment. 
According to a report on the state of the fund, last year it granted 
credits totalling some 2.8 billion leva.  The National Electricity 
Company received 728 million leva and the Sofia Municipality was 
granted a 15O million leva loan for the construction of the new 
metro system, which it has already paid back.  Balkancar got 300 
million leva to finance exports to Poland and Glavbolgarstroy was 
granted DM40 million for bank guarantees in connection with 
construction projects in Russia, at 10 percent interest and to be 
repaid by the end of the year.  The comparatively long list of 
enterprises and organizations financed by the fund does not include 
a single private company, STANDART NEWS observes.  (Sofia BTA in

   DANUBE RIVER PORT IDLE:  Never in its 155-year-long history has 
the Danube river port of Lom faced such a crisis.  The quays are 
empty, and the 600 employees, who are completely idle, fear heavy 
layoffs.  According to port manager Kuzman Khristov, the management 
has no other choice, because the port lost almost 5 million leva 
last year.  All attempts to conclude new goods handling contracts 
have failed.  Even longstanding business partners like Ukraine, 
which delivers power station coal and metals for the Kremikovtsi 
Plant, have failed to sign any new contracts.  (Sofia DEMOKRATSIYA

   PRIVATE BUSINESS LEADER MOLLOV INTERVIEWED:  In an exclusive BTA 
interview, Valentin Mollov, president of the Confederation of 
Industrialists (G-13, an organization of big private business), 
denies that G-13 has political ambitions.  The group is in favor of 
the majority electoral system for the next parliamentary elections. 
Mollov believes that, given Bulgaria's fledgling market relations 
and democratic practices, it is dangerous to have lobbies in the 
political circles formed by private firms or groups.  The G-13 
leader sees no worthy politicians among Bulgaria's present statesmen 
who might lead the country forward.  G-13 is waiting for government 
clearance on investment in various projects:  a free transport 
corridor to the Aegean, construction of a port at Alexandropolis and 
of tunnel beneath Mount Shipka in the Balkan range, and a proposal 
to take over an unused military material base, guaranteeing its 
exploitation.  G-13 has no formal contacts with G-21, the 
Association of Bulgarian State Industries.  Mollov thinks the 
association is faced with serious problems regarding bad bank 
receivables and their huge debts to the state.  (Sofia BTA in

   PRIVATE PRODUCTION INCREASES IN 1993:  The TRUD daily reported on 
27 January that there was a further expansion of private initiative 
in all sectors of material production in 1993.  Output totalled 
nearly 44 billion leva (more than U.S.$1 billion, with trade 
accounting for 44 percent, construction -- 22 percent, industry -- 
21 percent, and transport -- 7 percent.  Production rose 22 percent 
from a year earlier (at 1992 prices), with industry and trade 
growing even more, the paper reported.  However, only in trade is 
the share of the private sector larger than that of the state-run 
enterprises and the cooperatives.  Private firms accounted for 57 
percent of retail sales in 1993, up from 46 percent a year earlier.

   TRADE TALKS WITH INDIA:  The Bulgarian-Indian Intergovernmental 
Committee for Economic, Scientific and Technological cooperation 
will hold its 1Oth session from 1 to 3 February.  The committee is 
co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin 
Karabashev for Bulgaria and Minister of Agriculture Balram Jakhar 
for India.  The Indian delegation will include about 10 senior 
Indian Government officials and a group of Indian businessmen. 
Representatives of a number of Bulgarian companies will also take 
part in the session.  The sides are expected to sign an agreement on 
the avoidance of double taxation and map out measures to curb the 
decline in Bulgarian-Indian trade.  As compared with U.S.$90 million 
in 1985, the volume of trade between Bulgaria and India fell to $9.6 
million in 1992.  In the first nine months of 1993 it was $13.5 
million.  Bulgaria's exports to India mainly comprise petroleum 
products, ferrous and nonferrous metals, industrial goods, 
chemicals, fertilizers, electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and 
rare metals.  Imports from India include cars, knitwear, garments, 
leather wear, mica, jewelry, pharmaceuticals, and spices.  The 
Indian side wants to invest in Bulgarian industry, a Trade Ministry 
official said.  There is great interest in tractors, bulldozers, 
hoisting and hauling equipment, lighting fixtures, and seamless 
pipes.  (Sofia BTA in English 1826 GMT 27 Jan 94 AU) 
   INDUSTRIAL MANAGERS POLLED ON INVESTMENT POLICY:  According to a 
survey of corporate finance taken by the National Statistical 
Institute in late 1993, 78 percent of corporate managers in the 
nonfarming sector say high interest rates were a serious setback in 
1993, while 62 percent point to indebtedness.  Only 20 percent of 
respondents say the loss of markets was a major cause of fiscal 
instability. 
   According to inconclusive estimates by corporate managers, 
tangible and nontangible investment in 1993 amounted to some 10,500 
million leva, 500 million up from early-year forecasts.  Yet 
investment has been shrinking.  Money was spent to maintain old 
assets and less on new technology.  Experts put that down to the 
fact that capacities were utilized only 57 percent.  Some 70 percent 
of investors think money should be invested in upgrading existing 
assets.  Investment plans for 1994 are within the investment 
framework set in 1993, the survey shows.  The high prices of 
investment goods are seen as a key reason for constraints on 
investment in 1994.  (Sofia BTA in English 1235 GMT 28 Jan 94 AU)

   FIGURES ON 1993 PRODUCTION:  In the view of the National 
Statistics Institute (NSI), production enterprises have little 
opportunity to recover in the present economic situation.  According 
to the NSI, in 1993 over half the industrial sectors were unable to 
find markets for their products,  One enterprise in eight had to 
shut down its operations during the year, as a result of which the 
state sector shrank by 1O percent and the private sector by 8 
percent.  All in all, the volume of production fell by 12 percent 
compared with 1992.  Enterprises in the material production sphere 
produced goods valued at 357 billion leva during 1993, while retail 
goods turnover was 118 billion leva, 86 percent of which was in 
retail trading and the rest in public catering.  Compred to 1992, 
this represents a decline of 3.6 percent 1992.  Receipts from the 
sale of goods and services showed a decrease of 12 percent. 
   The continued decline in activity on the part of state and 
cooperative enterprises was to some extent compensated for by 
increased activity in the private sector, whose share of total 
output rose from 8.6 to 12.3 percent during the year, being valued 
at 44 billion leva.  In 1993 the official inflation figure was 15.6 
percent lower than in 1992.  Inflation was fueled by the higher 
prices of energy and postal and telephone services.  The cost of 
services rose by 93.66 percent during the year, and food products 
increased in price by an average of 40 percent.  The NSI estimates 
that the GDP will decline by 2.5 percent during 1994.  (Sofia PARI 
in Bulgarian 28 Jan 94 p 3 AU) 
   PRELIMINARY 1993 ECONOMIC DATA:  According to preliminary data of 
the National Statistical Institute (NSI), annual inflation in 1993 
amounted to 63.9 percent, which falls within projections, according 
to a 26 January KONTINENT report, quoting the boss of the NSI 
Economic Statistics Department Milcho Mladenov.  Foods rose 60.4 
percent, non-foods 55.9 percent, and services 93.7 percent in 1993. 
Wages rose by an average of 52.3 percent and social security 
payments by 50 percent.  By last October, the jobless totalled 
750,000.  In 1993 the GDP fell by 9 percent, industry shrank by 8.2 
percent, and construction by 22.6 percent.  Transport was the only 
sector to report a rise of 4.5 percent.  According to preliminary 
NSI estimates, the private sector accounted for some 25 percent of 
the GDP in 1993, up from 15 percent in 1992.  (Sofia BTA in English

   PRIVATE OIL COMPANIES ATTACK NEFTOKHIM:  Following the first 
meeting yesterday between private and state-owned oil companies, it 
emerged that private oil importers insist that the state-owned 
Neftokhim Refinery be transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the 
government, STANDART NEWS reported on 2 February.  The private firms 
allege that Nef tokhim owes the exchequer billions of leva and that 
these debts are rescheduled over and over again.  At the same time, 
Nef tokhim keeps exporting petrol and diesel fuel at a loss because 
it cannot sell it in Bulgaria, states a letter from the private 
firms Eltex, Europetrol, Petromax, Litex, and Elpida to the 
president, parliament, and government.  According to the private 
companies, Nef tokhim preferred cargo deliveries from Western 
partners under the pretext that they were more accurate.  This, 
however, is not fair and harms the interests of the Bulgarian 
suppliers, the private oil companies' bosses argue.  Nef tokhim 
charged U.S.$18 for processing a ton of crude from Bulgarian 
companies, but only $9 for crude supplied by Marc Rich.  (Sofia BTA

   CABINET CLOSES KOMI JOINT TIMBER ENTERPRISE:  On 10 January the 
cabinet decided to close down the Bulgarian wood-processing 
enterprise in the Komi Autonomous Oblast in the Russian Federation. 
The decision was prompted by Moscow's refusal to amend the agreement 
on joint wood processing to make it more profitable for Bulgaria. 
The cabinet ministers insisted on increasing the Bulgarian wood- 
processing quota from 38 to 42 percent and reducing the tariffs 
imposed on transporting the wood on Russian territory.  A further 
demand was for permission to export timber directly from Komi to 
third markets. 
   Khristo Todorov, head of the Forestry Committee, said that at the 
negotiations in September 1993 an agreement was reached with the 
Russian experts.  However, in November Moscow said that the 
Bulgarian demands were unjustified.  He added that beginning in 
April the enterprises in Usogorsk and Gorniy Mezen will gradually be 
shut down.  Two other joint Bulgarian-Russian enterprises in 
Blagoevo and Mezhdurechensk will also shut down in mid-June, as it 
has become impossible to continue their self-financing and self- 
maintenance under the current Bulgarian-Russian agreement.  The 
4,600 people currently employed at the four enterprises will have to 
seek other jobs as of September 1994. 
   "Before 1991 we used to process 3.6 million cubic meters of 
timber in Komi.  Last year production dropped to 1.2 million cubic 
meters," Todorov pointed out.  He added that the cessation of timber 
supplies from Komi will not cause a crisis in the Bulgarian timber- 
processing industry, as domestic timber production will satisfy 
local needs.  However, talks on joint timber production could 
continue and an agreement could still be reached, he said.     Prime 
Minister Berov has invited Komi's leaders to Sofia for talks.

   CABINET BARS OFFICIALS FROM BOARDS OF STATE COMPANIES:  On 13 
January the Council of Ministers decided to prohibit National

administrators from serving on the boards of directors and

approved a code of regulations for managing state companies.  The 
ban on serving as directors of state firms extends to mayors of 
municipalities and their deputies, secretaries of municipalities, 
senior officials of the Privatization Agency, and relatives of 
members of the managements of state companies.  Until now, the 
majority of top state officials have derived additional income -- up 
to one and a half times their regular salaries -- from serving on 
different boards of state companies.  Under the new regulations, 
executive directors who also serve on the boards of state firms may 
draw salaries of up to 35O percent of the national average wage.

   NATIONAL MEETING OF STOCK EXCHANGES:  "Bulgaria's stock market is 
chaotic, but so is the country's economy," the executive director of 
the Sofia Stock Exchange, Bozhidar Danev, said after the end of the 
second national meeting of stock exchanges and divisions on January 
14 and 15.  "The economy is stagnant and the stock markets are also 
flat.  To talk of a stock market in Bulgaria is an overstatement for 
the time being," Danev said.  "Wildcat exchange trade is going on 
now, but the taming of the economy will lead to a taming of the 
stock markets as well," he added.  According to Danev, capital has 
been immobilized over the past few years, above all due to the 
moratorium on transfer of state property.  Capital movement is now 
more restricted than in the first years prior to the passage of the 
Privatization Act, he added. 
   The participants in the meeting coordinated positions on security 
trading and adopted mutually acceptable principles and rules.  A 
Standing Coordinating Group was formed to draft uniform codes for 
stock trading.  They also adopted a declaration expressing readiness 
to provide stock market mechanisms to the state authorities for 
their fullest possible utilization in the privatization process. 
The existing bills on securities and stock exchanges were 
considered.  Differences will be thrashed out at a forthcoming 
roundtable discussion, organized jointly with World Bank resident 
representative John Wilton and experts of the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Viktor

   PROBLEMS WITH JOINT VENTURES:  Joint ventures attract little 
investment but create lots of problems, says an article in PARI on 
21 January.  The daily puts the amount of foreign capital invested 
in Bulgarian-based joint ventures at $53.1 million.  The problems 
are in-built in the joint ventures' memorandums of association, the 
article says.  According to the author, these memorandums fail to 
clear up some essential aspects of the companies' operation. 
Conditions are created for undervaluation of the Bulgarian 
contribution because the Bulgarian partner contributes its entire 
share right from the beginning, while the foreign partner 
contributes its share later and piecemeal, the feature says.  One 
possible way to solve the numerous problems of the joint ventures is 
to treat their formation as privatization.  This approach has been 
adopted in Hungary, Romania, and other countries, PARI recalls.

   BANKERS DEMAND AMENDMENTS TO BAD DEBTS ACT:  Bulgarian banks have 
demanded amendments to the act transforming into public debt the 
nonperforming loans contracted by state-owned companies prior to 
December 31, 1990, 24 CHASA reported on 25 January.  The bankers say 
that because of this time limit they will lose billions of leva. 
Many of the bad debts incurred before the end of 1990 were later 
transformed into new loans and under the law will not be exchanged 
for bonds.  Banks that have lent funds to trading companies will get 
least money back.  (Sofia BTA in English 1225 GMT 25 Jan 94 AU) 
   LEV RISES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET:  The Bulgarian lev has been 
rising on the interbank market, to 36.889-39.960 leva to the dollar 
on 24 January, up from between 37-39 leva during the previous week. 
The weakening of the national currency against the dollar last week 
caused tensions in the domestic foreign exchange market.  On 20 
January the central lev exchange rate hit a record low of 36.937 
leva to the dollar. 
   Meeting on 18 and 20 January, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, Trade 
Minister Valentin Karabashev, Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov, 
and central and large commercial bank leaders agreed to defend the 
lev.  The gentleman's agreement to cut the central rate by 0.20 leva 
a day succeeded in propping up the national currency, which began 
recovering on 21 January without much intervention by the Bulgarian 
National Bank.  As an additional measure to influence home market 
rates, the cabinet amended the exchange regulations on 24 January, 
obliging state-run companies to trade in foreign currency with 
commercial banks alone and not finance houses, brokerages, or forex 
offices.  According to a bank expert, the state-run companies 
reportedly stocked up on dollars to profit from the rising rate. 
flow through brokerages, he said. 
   The lev rate is expected to keep rising over the next few days, 
by as much as one lev, according to some traders.  Bank dealers said 
the dollar-buying spree is subsiding, but it is too early to predict 
a new margin of fluctuation in the short term.  If the central bank 
does not intervene, the rate could shoot up again.  (Sofia BTA in

   MINISTER CONFIDENT BAVARIA WILL ACCEPT PIPELINE GUARANTEE:  The 
Bavarian Land Government has responded favorably to the Czech 
proposal for a guarantee of the Ingolstadt Oil Pipeline project, 
Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy told 
correspondents today in reference to a telephone conversation he had 
on 1 February with Bavarian Economics Minister Otto Wiesheu.  The 
Czech proposal constitutes an 80 million German mark (DM) guarantee 
covering uninsurable and extraordinary damage to the pipeline (as a 
result of terrorist action, natural catastrophe, or war).  The Czech 
National Property Fund (FNM) would provide the guarantee. 
   The ministers agreed two days ago that experts would continue to 
discuss the guarantee next week, by then, the Bavarian side is 
expected to make known its position on the new Czech proposal.  The 
fact that they have already requested the FNM's detailed financial 
profile is a sign that the Bavarian Government is viewing the 
proposal favorably, Dlouhy said.  If the Bavarian side accepts the 
latest Czech proposal, the guarantee could be approved by Bavarian 
Parliament as early as in the spring, which will allow the pipeline 
construction to commence shortly thereafter.  Construction of the 
pipeline from the Bavarian town of Ingolstadt to Nelahozeves near 
Kralupy in central Bohemia began in the Czech Republic in September. 
Construction of the pipeline in Germany was expected to begin this 
spring.  The entire project should be completed in 1995, unless it 
is rejected by the Bavarian Parliament.  (Prague CTK in English 3

   LOW PRODUCTION COSTS MAKE PRODUCTS COMPETITIVE IN WEST:  Czech

Foundation, Dlouhy said the cheap labor force was one of the major 
factors positively influencing economic reform in the Czech Republic 
and the main reason for Czech exports being successful.  He 
dismissed claims by Western firms that the Czechs exported their 
goods at dumping prices.  Dlouhy said he appreciated cooperation 
with Germany, the Czech Republic's most important trade partner. 
Germany is the most flexible country in both investing and setting 
up joint ventures, he said, adding that of the total number of joint 
ventures in the Czech Republic about 30 percent had been established

border and Ostrava, north Moravia, the center of a mining and 
industrial region from where many Slovaks commute to work, returning

currency on the street, say that the trade in Czech money brings 
more profit than trade in dollars or German marks, the paper writes.

This is what Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told reporters.  According 
to Klaus, the first task of Konsolidacni Banka after its founding in 
the spring of 1991 was to reduce the load on other commercial banks 
and on firms with outstanding debts.  Since then, Konsolidacni Banka 
has demonstrated its viability and long-term ability to compete and 
gained a stable position in the republic's banking sector, Klaus 
said.  Konsolidacni Banka is a state financial institution, to which 
many outstanding debts have been transferred.  Because of the non- 
recoverable nature of these debts, the bank's reserves needed to be 
increased.  (Prague CTK in English 19 Jan 94 AU)

   ENVIRONMENT MINISTER WORRIED ABOUT RAW MATERIAL EXPORTS:  Curbing 
the alarming increase in the extraction and exports of raw materials 
is one of the top priority tasks of the Environment Ministry, 
Minister Frantisek Benda told CTK on 20 January.  According to 
Benda, the ministry will seek ways of stopping the current 
situation.  This situation has arisen due to lax border checks and 
due to the fact that some raw materials are exported as construction 
supplies.  Benda said that raw materials should not be extracted 
above certain limits.  The extraction should be scaled down to 
satisfy the most urgent economic needs only.  The environment 
ministry' objective was to reach a compromise during the talks with 
Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of industry and trade, on reducing export 
quotas, Benda said.  According to the data on foreign trade in raw 
materials compiled by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and 
furnished by the Green Party to CTK, only 89,000 tons of limestone 
were exported in 1989, while the figure rose to 2,362,000 tons in 
1992.  A similar increase was recorded in stone dust, sand, and 
lumber, the ministry's report reveals.  (Prague CTK in English 20

Czech Transport Minister Jan Strasky and Air France representatives 
on the possible sale of Air France's shares in the CSA are to take

that the sale of the shares would be "neither a sensation nor a 
tragedy for the Czech side.  However, neither would it be a solution 
to CSA's problems, though the negotiations will be the first step 
toward reaching an agreement with Air France," he said.   In his 
letter of January 7 to Air France, Strasky proposed that the shares 
be sold to a Czech entity.  The Czech side has proposed that 
Konsolidacni Banka purchase the shares, but any proposal submitted 
by the French side will be considered.  (Prague CTK 27 in English

   AIR FRANCE REPRESENTATIVE ON CSA PROBLEMS:  The probable sale of 
the CSA's shares is likely to harm Air France, a representative of 
the Public Relations Department of the French Airlines said in Paris 
on 28 January.  "If our Czech partners refuse to cooperate, Air 
France cannot force them to," the representative said in reply to 
Transportation Minister Jan Strasky's request on 27 January that Air 
France sell its shares by the end of February.  It is CSA, not Air 
France, that wants to break the 1992 agreement and have the French 
company sell its 19.1-percent share in the company, the 
representative emphasized.  He added that the final decision must 
take this fact into account, particularly when the issue of money is 
addressed. 
   The French company expected both airlines to benefit from 
cooperation.  "The probable divorce of CSA and Air France will 
certainly not help the French company, which is now experiencing 
financial difficulties.  At the very least, its reputation will be 
harmed," the Air France representative said.  He went on to say that 
the CSA management was responsible for CSA's problems, and now the 
Czech side was seeking the culprit elsewhere.  He also said that the 
French had pointed out early on that CSA's main difficulties were 
the result of bad management and the financially disadvantageous 
purchase of airplanes before signing the contract with Air France. 
The representative confirmed that Air France would participate in 
next week's negotiations.  (Prague CTK in English 28 Jan 94 AU)

at the end of 1993, Dyba said.  A total of 1.26 million licenses 
have been registered.  Dyba said the increase appeared all over the 
country, and made a remark saying that the number of business 
licenses issued in a district was indirectly proportional to that 
district's unemployment rate.  The minister also pointed out that 
small and medium-size industrial and construction firms were 
increasingly adding to the country's overall production and 
employment.  (Prague CTK in English 24 Jan 94 AU)

Minister of Economy Karel Dyba announced on 24 January.  The amount 
is equal to about 1.7 percent of the Czech Republic's 1993 gross 
domestic product.  More than half of the amount, Kc7.5 billion, came 
in the form of tax breaks granted by the Finance Ministry, Dyba 
said.  The Ministry of Agriculture provided Kc2.8 billion, the 
Ministry of Economy Kc1.2 billion, and the Ministry of Labor and 
Social Affairs Kc178 million.  The Ministry of Economy's support was 
granted primarily in the form of government-approved programs 
through the Ceskomoravska Zarucni a Rozvojova Banka (Czech-Moravian

   OIL SUPPLY RESUMPTION HALTS DRAWDOWN OF RESERVES:  The resumption

levels of reserves, the director of Chemopetrol's trade policy, 
Lubos Kyselo, stated 23 January.  He said that in the next few days 
reserves would begin to be replenished.  According to Kyselo, a 
similar fluctuation in the supply of Russian oil was usual at the 
beginning of the year.  This year's interruption in supply was 
unusually long, however, and caused production in the Litvinov plant 
to fall by a third.  This did not affect the supply of fuel and 
heating oil, he said, and Chemopetrol also managed to secure the 
necessary supplies of products to other enterprises.  (Prague CTK in

a natural-gas-fired plant, as suggested by  a member of Austria's 
opposition party, would be costly and difficult, a Czech university 
professor says.  Jiri Fleischhans, deputy director of the Nuclear 
and Physical Engineering Faculty at the Czech Technical University, 
said experts have already pondered over the problem.  However, 80 
percent of the completed structure would have to remain unused.  Gas 
to run the plant would require the entire capacity of a standard 
pipeline.  A strategic decision of whether to rely on one supplier 
for such a source of power would also have to be taken.  Fleischhans 
said that a large gas-fired plant would likely be more efficient and 
would thus release about one-third less steam, which is believed to 
cause global warming.  On the other hand, emissions of carbon 
dioxide would be greater.  He noted that cost estimates are not 
available for a project of this size.  Temelin is expected to be put 
into operation between 1996 and 1997.  The Austrian Press Agency 
(APA) reported that a spokesperson for Austria's opposition Free 
Party, Peter Rosenstingel, called on the country's president to make 
it clear to the Czech Republic that it would resort to sanctions if 
necessary.  (Prague CTK in English 25 Jan 94 AU) 
   CZECH INVESTMENTS ABROAD GROWING:  Direct Czech investments 
abroad reached $45.2 million in 1993.  This information has been 
provided by the director of the Ceska Narodni Banka (Czech National 
Bank) Director Jiri Zimola.  According to him, the activity of Czech 
enterprises has sharply increased compared with previous years.  In 
1992, $28 million were invested abroad and in 1991 only $3 million. 
The largest investors were Skoda Mlada Boleslav (Great Britain), 
Cementarny a Vapenky Prachovice (Netherlands), Invest Plzen 
(Russia), Strojimport (Austria), CSKD Intrans (Slovakia), Namorni 
Plavba (Malta), and Prumysl Kamene Brno (Croatia).  The largest 
investments were placed in Malta (28.4 percent), Russia (16.0 
percent), Great Britain (10.3 percent), Slovakia (12.7 percent) and 
other countries (26.5 percent).  The absolute majority of 
investments have been placed in trade and services.  (Prague

   KRALOVOPOLSKA BRNO FACES FINANCIAL PROBLEMS:  The discontinuation 
of the construction of the Mochovce nuclear power station has caused 
problems to one of the largest suppliers of technology -- 
Kralovopolska Brno.  The company has supplied work worth Kc1.2 
billion, and there is still work outstanding for Kc1.05 billion. 
According to the director general of the company, the material 
supplies to the Mochovce power plant alone represent Kc400 million. 
Moreover, the company has to put up with the consequences of not 
having met its obligation toward its own suppliers.  For instance, 
the German partner who was to deliver pumps worth Kc90 million, is 
claiming penalties amounting to 80,000 German marks per month.

machine guns, which have not been produced in Vsetin for at least 20 
years, was made at the end of 1991, when the factory had to produce 
a certain number of these guns for our army in a short period of 
time.  After machine-gun production is resumed, the factory will 
replace the Type 59, which is 35 years old with a new, more modern

   FOREST PROPERTY RESTITUTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS:  Approximately 70 
percent of the 145,000 applications by individuals for restitution 
of forest property in the Czech Republic have been settled, though 
compensation remains a problem, the director of the Lesy forest 
management enterprise, Jiri Oliva, said at a news conference today. 
The Czech Republic has 2.6 million hectares of forests, of which 20 
percent are to be owned by individuals and less than 20 percent by 
municipalities.  They are entitled to take over 410,000 hectares of 
forests, though 160,000 hectares have not yet been claimed, Oliva 
pointed out.  Six percent of the forest lands is to go to churches 
-- something that has not yet been carried out, Oliva said.  Around 
54 percent of forests are to remain in the hands of the state, he 
added.  (Prague CTK in English 27 Jan 94 AU) 
   ARMS DEALS UP IN 1993:  The Ministry of Industry and Trade 
granted 366 licenses for trade in military equipment and material 
last year, according to a 28 January statement by Bretislav Gregr, 
the ministry's senior official.  The number consists of 198 licenses 
granted for import from 19 countries and 258 for exports to 52 
countries, involving 23 European states, 12 Asian, 7 African, 5 
Central and North American and 5 South American, Gregr announced. 
In line with legal standards, the ministry removed three licenses 
already granted and turned down 15 license applications.  A total of 
35 companies were involved in trade in military equipment, Gregr 
said.  The total value of exports was $167 million, 17 million more 
than the figure for Czechoslovakia in 1992, Gregr reported.  The 
structure of the exported material has markedly changed:  while in 
1992 the exports included ground mobile equipment, particularly the 
T-72 tanks sold to Syria, last year the bulk of the exports was 
aviation technology, particularly L-59 aircraft along with spare 
parts exported to Egypt, Gregr announced.  In comparison with 1992, 
the proportion of infantry weapons increased, largely due to the 
export of the CZ-75 pistols to Turkey.  The export of mobile ground 
equipment (vehicles) was largely made up of supplies of spare parts 
for the armored equipment sold earlier and partly of the special 
vehicles on Tatra chassis.  (Prague CTK in English 28 Jan 94 AU) 
   KLAUS ON KORUNA CONVERTIBILITY:  Full Convertibility for the 
Czech korunas is not necessary as yet, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, 
on 28 January.  He pointed out that the Czech koruna became 
convertible three years ago for the purposes of foreign trade and 
the currency has retained a stable exchange rate for 37 months now. 
"We do not believe that by transferring to full convertibility five 
years after the velvet revolution (the toppling of the communist 
regime) we will gain anything particularly positive, Klaus was 
quoted as saying.  The government has rejected a plan proposed by 
the Czech National Bank whereby the Czech koruna could become fully 
convertible in January 1995.  Instead it favors a gradual 
liberalization of the currency regime with other countries.  (Prague 
CTK in English 28 Jan 94 AU) 
   CZECH KORUNA TO BE FULLY CONVERTIBLE BY 1997:  The Czech koruna 
will be fully convertible in 1997, at the latest.  It will be 
necessary to take gradual steps toward this goal, Finance Minister 
Ivan Kocarnik told a rally of the ruling Civic Democratic Party 
today.  He said that the interest rates of the Czech banks would go 
down fast since this trend has been stimulated by the inflow of 
foreign investments and the offer of credits by foreign banks.  This 
is a result of the fact that the world has found that the Czech 
Republic is a consolidated state with a stable economic and 
political situation, he added.  (Prague CTK in English 31 Jan 94 AU)

   FOREIGN TRADE TURNOVER FIGURES GIVEN:  The Czech Republic's 
foreign trade turnover was 10.6 percent higher in 1993 than in 1992, 
according to the preliminary results of a Czech Statistical Office 
study.  Czech imports increased by 2.7 percent and exports by 20.0 
percent last year.  The only countries with whom Czech trade 
decreased were those of the former Soviet Union.  Czech Republic 
exports to and imports from other countries increased.  A total of 
58.0 percent of Czech trade in 1993 was concluded with countries 
with advanced economies, while 8.7 percent was exchanged with former 
members of the Soviet Union, and 6.1 percent with other Eastern 
European countries undergoing economic transformation.  The Czech 
Republic's trade surplus was Kc5.9 billion ($200 million) last year. 
The largest surplus was recorded in trade with developing countries 
(Kc13.6 billion, $453 million), while the surplus with European

   HUNGARY 
   MNB TO REDUCE MANDATORY RESERVE RATE:  The Board of the Hungarian 
National Bank (MNB) decided to decrease the mandatory reserve rate 
by 1 percent from March 1 and by a further 1 percent from May 1. 
The mandatory reserve rate has been 14 percent since January 1, 
1993.  At the same time, the Board has decided to increase interest 
rates on mandatory reserve deposits on FOREX (foreign exchange) 
liabilities from 11 percent to 18 percent.  The 2 percent interest 
rate on reserves on forint deposits remains unchanged.  Mandatory 
reserves are to be allocated on all FOREX liabilities except those 
from the central bank or other domestic banks and not including 
FOREX deposits placed with the MNB.  The board has also decided to 
cancel securities repo deals for longer than three months and to 
cancel the two-weekly deals as of February 14.  From this date, the 
MNB will introduce passive repo deals.  The MNB estimates that a 1 
percent decrease in the mandatory reserve rate will result in 15 
billion Hungarian forints (HUF) worth of excess liquidity in the 
banking system.  In order to drain the excess liquidity, the MNB 
intends to boost passive repo deals.  With this in mind, the MNB 
plans to announce passive repo tenders when the liquidity position 
of the commercial banks makes it necessary.  (Budapest MTI in

   FOREIGNERS CAN PURCHASE STATE BONDS:  Foreigners will shortly be 
able to purchase state bonds with one-year or longer maturity, 
Hungarian National Bank (MNB) Chairman Peter Akos Bod said.  The 
permit will be extended to state securities with a shorter maturity 
from next year on.  The MNB strives to encourage domestic savings 
and thereby intends to cover the government's credit needs and to 
create the ever increasing amounts needed for local industry 
operations.  The Budget Law makes it possible for the Finance 
Ministry to issue state bonds with longer than one-year maturities 
to a value of HUF300 billion to cover the planned deficit of 
HUF329.56 billion (compared to the budget deficit of HUF199.7 
billion last year), and to raise the treasury bill stock by HUF29.56 
billion to refinance the deficit. 
   Hungary is issuing bonds on the international money market at 
more or less regular intervals as the so-called risk surcharge on 
Hungarian bonds has recently declined significantly.  When the 
country reappeared on the international market in 1991, it was 
ranked in the 300-point category in the European points system, 
which serves as the basis for the risk surcharge.  Today, Hungary 
has to reckon with a risk surcharge that accords to only 160 to 170 
points.  The pace of raising further loans depends on direct foreign 
investments.  "If the value of these remains at around $1.5-2 
billion, then we shall continue to be forced to raise loans," Bod 
said.  (Budapest MTI in English 1143 GMT 2 Feb 94 AU) 
   BANK, CREDIT CONSOLIDATION PROGRAMS COST OVER HUF300 BILLION: 
The bank and credit consolidation programs will require a total of 
HUF3IO billion to HUF320 billion from the state.  This includes a 
total of HUF99 billion for 1992 credit consolidation programs and, 
in 1993, HUF114 billion for the bank consolidation program and HUF57 
billion for debtor consolidation.  A capital injection of an 
estimated HUF20 billion to HUF30 billion is necessary in order for 
the banks involved in the second phase of the bank consolidation 
program to achieve a capital adequacy ratio of 4 percent.  The 
government has spent HUF13 billion on the consolidation of the 
Hungarian Railways (MAV), HUF6 billion on a capital injection for 
savings cooperatives, HUF4 billion on debt relief for drought- 
affected companies, and HUF1 billion on the repayment of soil 
improvement loans to banks.  The government's advisor on bank 
privatization, Credit-Suisse First Boston, is soon to prepare a 
study on the future structure of the banking system.  (Budapest MTI

   AV RT'S BANK PRIVATIZATION STRATEGY:  According to State Property 
Management Corporation (AV RT) officials, the property policy 
guidelines regarding the ownership of banks should be drawn up 
before privatization.  These should include the amount of the stake 
to remain in state ownership, the most favorable ownership 
structure, and the importance of foreign and small investors.  The 
AV RT has already drawn up a plan for the privatization of large 
banks under which the privatization of the Hungarian Commercial Bank 
(MKB) and Budapest Bank has been launched.  In accordance with this 
concept, the first stage is to find professional strategic 
investors.  The second stage is the involvement of owners with long- 
term interests such as local and foreign insurance companies, 
pension funds, and investment companies.  Finally, the third stage 
involves the banks' introduction onto the Budapest Stock Exchange 
(BSE). 
   AV RT's plan sets the stake of strategic investors in the banks 
at 30 to 50 percent, that of financial investors at 2 to 10 percent, 
that of employees and management at 5 to 10 percent, and that of 
small investors at 5 to 20 percent.  A 1992 government decree 
selected the eight banks where the state should retain long-term 
ownership.  Under the decree, the long-term state ownership will 
remain 50 percent plus one vote at the Hungarian Savings Bank RT 
(OTP RT) and the Hungarian Investment and Development Bank RT (MBFB 
RT), 25 percent plus one vote in the Hungarian Credit Bank (MHB), 
Commercial and Credit Bank (K and H), General Banking and Trust Co. 
RT (AEB), Budapest Bank (BB), and Hungarian Commercial Bank (MKB), 
and 20 percent in Postabank.  (Budapest MTI in English 0826 GMT 3

   MCDONALDS PLANS TO EXPAND:  The McDonalds fast-food chain has 
invested HUF2.5 billion ($25 million) in Hungary over the past five 
years.  Last year its investments here amounted to HUF650 million. 
McDonalds presently runs 12 restaurants in Hungary.  Last year its 
aggregate turnover came close to HUF2.5 billion, as compared to 
HUF1.6 billion in the previous year.  In 1993, the company increased 
its prices by 13 percent.  This year McDonalds plans to open seven 
restaurants and increase the turnover of its network by 30 to 40 
percent.  Despite the growing turnover, the company closed last year 
with a loss, though its deficit was smaller than a year before.

   MINERALIMPEX AGREEMENT WITH GAZPROM:  The Hungarian oil and gas 
trading company Mineralimpex is to import an annual 2.8 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas from the Russian company Gazprom over 
the next five years under an agreement signed between the two 
companies.  The contract was based on a former inter-governmental 
agreement that provides for the gas to be supplied by the Orenburg 
field from the beginning of this year.  In addition, 2 billion cubic 
meters of natural gas will be imported from the Yamburg field in 
Russia in repayment of Hungary's investment in the field.  An 
additional 1 billion cubic meters could be imported depending on 
demand and on further agreements with Gazprom. 
   The Industry and Trade Ministry (IKM) intends to extend the 
contracts on Yamburg and Orenburg gas that expire in five years. 
The demand for natural gas is expected to rise by 20-30 percent to 
12-13 billion cubic meters by the year 2000, up from 10 billion 
cubic meters.  The building of a transit pipeline through Hungary to 
Italy is advocated by the IKM.  The users of the pipeline could pay 
the transit fee in gas, for the use of which a new gas-fuelled, 
combined cycle power station would be built.  Gazprom said that it 
was willing to participate in a consortium established for this 
purpose.  It also intends to become involved in the privatization of 
Hungary's gas and electricity supply companies.  (Budapest MTI in

   SUPPLIERS TO GET STAKE IN CENTRUM CHAIN:  Strategia KFT, the 
company formed by the management of Centrum Aruhazak RT, is to 
transfer 23 percent of its 25 percent stake in the department store 
chain to a consortium of food and clothing suppliers.  Strategia, 
which was set up by 270 managers, bought its 25 percent stake in 
Centrum at the same time as the company's 3,500-member ESOP 
(employees' share ownership program) organization purchased a 26 
percent stake from the State Property Agency (AVU).  The AVU made a 
decision on the sale of the 51 percent stake in mid-January, with 
the contract to be signed in two weeks' time.  Strategia KFT 
included in its bid its intention to transfer the 23 percent to 
suppliers.  Strategia and the ESOP organization will pay for the 
shares with HUF420 million cash, HUF754 million worth of 
compensation coupons and an E-loan (as received) to the value of 
HUF1.374 billion.  The E-loan bears interest of 7 percent and has a 
maturity of 15 years, with a grace period of three years. 
   Centrum Aruhazak has drawn up a three-year strategic plan which 
requires an additional HUF3.1 billion worth of capital.  A Canadian- 
Hungarian businessman, Andrew Sarlos, has offered to carry out an 
equity raise of HUF2 billion and the MHB-Daewoo Bank would grant a 
loan of HUF500 million.  The company's bank, the Commercial Bank 
(OKHB), and the World Bank are prepared to lend the remainder. 
   The Centrum department store chain, which has registered capital 
of HUF5 billion, consists of 25 department stores and has total 
assets of HUF9 billion.  The company had turnover of HUF16.3 billion 
last year (HUF15.4 billion in 1992) and achieved a pre-tax profit of 
HUF300 million (HUF450 million in 1992).  Centrum is expected to 
have total turnover of HUF19.5 billion this year and to achieve a 
pre-tax profit of HUF450 million.  Centrum owed HUF150 million in 
loans at the end of last year, compared to HUF200 million at the end 
of 1992.  The loans were mostly short-term working capital loans. 
The company invested HUF260 million in remodelling 12 shops last 
year and plans to invest HUF180 million in development this year. 
Centrum has also begun establishing a HUF800 million bar-code stock 
control system which will transfer data through satellite.

   DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTER INDUSTRY:  Although Hungary has certain 
traditions in computer sciences, its computer industry and trade can 
only look back on a few years' past.  The industry is about to face 
recession, some experts claim.  The number of solvent companies is 
decreasing and Hungarian companies cannot compete with multinational 
corporations.  The estimated number of companies specializing in 
computers is 300, while the number of Hungarian specialists is 
presumably several thousand.  In the past few years, computers have 
become widespread and commonly used in Hungary.  Computer industry 
in Hungary began to take shape at the beginning of the l98Os -- a 
period when computer scientists could start their own enterprises, 
mainly focusing on software development.  Their small firms have 
been expanding and are the leading companies today (for example 
Microsystem, Controll, Rolitron), while subsidized research centers 
have had to close down one after another because their specialists 
realized they could earn more in business enterprises. 
   In the 1990's, the liberalization of import conditions and the 
lifted western embargo resulted in a multitude of small firms, most 
of which became personal computer dealers without any adequate 
background for service.  Many a leading firm found its prices too 
low to compete with them and went bankrupt.  Meanwhile many powerful 
Western firms appeared in Hungary (IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Epson). 
Their share of the market has been gradually increasing due to the 
direct distribution of products and professional service network. 
At present computer industry and trade in Hungary can be divided 
into three main areas.  There are 2OO to 300 small firms selling 
cheap, mainly Taiwanese hardware.  There are about 10 Hungarian 
companies mostly involved in such services as building computer 
networks, maintaining computer service shops, and teaching computer 
sciences.  The third group consists of some multinational firms 
selling both hardware and software, and also having well-developed 
service networks. 
   By 1993, hardware development in Hungary almost came to an end. 
There are only a few experts dealing even with special software 
development because multinational firms offer almost complete 
program packages to customers in each professional field.  Hungary, 
following the Western market tendency, has entered a period of 
recession in computer business, some experts claim.  Hewlett-Packard 
is said to possess one-sixth of the Hungarian computer market and is 
prepared to face a continuous recession ending only in 1995. 
Established in Hungary three years ago with 72 employees, Hewlett- 
Packard made an income of HUF3 billion, or $30 million, in 1993. 
The European marketing manager of the firms expects a 10 percent 
fall of income by 1996.  The cause of decreasing prices both on the 
international and Hungarian market is standardization, a phenomenon 
expected also in software business.  The 1993 results, however, for 
example the 121 percent rise of turnover on the Hungarian market, do 
not indicate the penetration of world-market recession into Hungary.

   CENTRAL EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA:  Creating a Central European 
Free Trade Area (CEFTA) helps the countries concerned catch up with 
Western Europe because it stimulates their economic growth and 
transformation into market economies, Minister of International 
Economic Relations Bela Kadar Said.  In Kadar's view, sound economic 
cooperation is the best tool for stabilizing Central Europe.  Owing 
to the free trade agreement which came into force on March 1 last 
year, half of trade among the four countries has been liberalized by 
now.  According to Kadar, trade among the countries concerned will 
be almost entirely liberalized by 1998.  (Budapest MTI in English

   REAL WAGES DECLINED IN 1993:  The per capita gross earnings 
during the month of December 1993 amounted to HUF37,358, with blue- 
collar workers earning HUF27,109 and white-collar workers earning 
HUF6O,399 on average, the latest report of the Central Statistical 
Office (KSH) says.  In 1993, gross earnings grew by 25 percent on 
average.  The increase was 21.1 percent for blue-collar workers and 
27.2 percent for white-collar employees.  Real earnings dropped by 
1.6 percent in 1993.  Last year the average gross monthly earnings 
for employees working in firms with a staff of over 20 amounted to 
HUF28,243 -- 25.6 percent more than in 1992.  The net monthly income 
of full-time employees was HUF18,901 -- 20.6 percent over the 1992 
figure.  Major wage increases in December were registered only in 
the financial and mining sectors.  (Miners received their loyalty

   UNEMPLOYMENT RISE FIRST IN 11 MONTHS:  The number of registered 
unemployed was 641,000 at the end of January, 9,000 more than a 
month earlier, the National Labor Center announced.  This is the 
first time the unemployment figure has risen since February last 
year, when it stood at 705,000.  From the start of this year, the 
calculation of the unemployment rate is based on Central Statistical 
Office (KSH) estimates of the total working-age population in 1993 
and not in 1992.  As a result, the unemployment rate is 0.5 percent 
higher (12.8 percent) in January.  The highest rate (21.1 percent) 
was registered in Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen county, the second highest 
(20.6 percent) in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, and the third highest 
(19.1 percent) in Nograd.  The unemployment rate was relatively low 
(6.3 percent) in Budapest.  Using the same basis for calculation as 
last year, the unemployment rate was 12.3 percent in January.  The 
number of first-time job seekers continued to fall in January. 
47,300 people lost their jobs in January and 36,900 people were 
taken off the list of registered unemployed.  22,800 new jobs were 
available in January, 40 percent more than in January, and the total 
number of job vacancies grew by 3,200 to around 51,000.  (Budapest

   The Hungarian budget law makes it possible for the Finance 
Ministry to issue state bonds with longer than one-year maturities 
in a value of 300 billion forints to cover the planned deficit of 
329.56 billion forints (compared to the budget deficit of 199.7

shows.  Ninety percent of the losses were posted by the 
manufacturing sector.  Half of the industrial-companies which do 
make profits account for 60 percent of industrial output.  They 
employ less than 50 percent of the industrial workforce.  Industrial 
companies' assets account for more than 50 percent of the economy's 
total assets, and the sector employs 60 percent of the country's

   COST OF BANK, CREDIT CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM:  The bank and credit 
consolidation programs will require a total of 310 billion to 320 
billion forints from the state.  This includes a total of 99 billion 
forints for 1992 credit consolidation programs and, in 1993, 114 
billion forints for the bank consolidation program, and 57 billion 
forints for debtor consolidation.  A capital injection of an 
estimated 20 billion to 30 billion forints is necessary in order for 
the banks involved in the second stage of the bank consolidation 
program to achieve a capital adequacy ratio of 4 percent.  The 
government has spent 13 billion forints on the consolidation of the 
Hungarian Railways (MAV), 6 billion forints on a capital injection 
for savings cooperatives, 4 billion forints on debt relief for 
drought affected companies, and 1 billion forints on the repayment 
of soil improvement loans to banks.  It is seen to be unfortunate 
that the stakes owned by the state in banks were in the hands of 
different state institutions.  It was time to draw up contracts 
between the Finance Ministry and the Hungarian State Holding Company 
(AV RT) on the handling of these stakes.  The government's adviser 
on bank privatization, Credit-Suisse First Boston, was soon to 
prepare a study on the future structure of Hungary's banking system.

   BAUXITE MINING FIRM'S PROBLEMS:  Hungary's sole bauxite mining 
company, which operates four mines (Bakony Bauxite Mine Kft.) has 
decided to close down for the last week of January.  The company has 
orders for only 250,000 tons of bauxite in the first three months of 
this year.  The company now employs 1,800, compared with 3,000 in 
1988, when it mined 3 million tons of bauxite.  Some 1.7 million 
tons of bauxite was mined in Hungary in 1992, and 550,000 tons of 
alumina and 27,000 tons of aluminum were produced.  Although the 
same amount of aluminum was produced last year, production of 
alumina and extraction of bauxite fell 10-15 percent.  At present, 
HUNGALU's three alumina plants (in Ajka, Mosonmagyarovar, and 
Almasfuzito) are still in operation but it now has only one

   U.S. INVESTORS BUY INTO DANUBIUS HOTELS:  Three U.S. financial 
investors have bought into the hotel chain Danubius Hotels Rt. 
following the largest-ever deal on the Budapest Stock Exchange on 28 
January.  One of the three is Kingdon Capital Market Corporation 
based in New york, which manages a $1 billion investment portfolio, 
another is Indian Harbor Holdings, registered in Connecticut, an 
asset managing firm with a portfolio worth $100 million, while the 
third is the Investment and Pension Fund of an undisclosed U.S.- 
based multinational company.  The three together now hold 29.8 
percent of Danubius Rt's 8 billion forints registered capital. 
   CA Securities stood on both sides of the 2.38 billion forints 
deal in Danubius shares on 28 January, as it was commissioned to 
sell by the State Property Agency (AVU) and Danubius Hotels Rt. 
while also acting for the three U.S. purchasers.  In the 28 January 
transaction, AVU sold a 26 percent stake in Danubius, while the 
remaining 3.8 percent stake sold was held by Danubius itself.  The 
AVU still holds a 10 percent stake in Danubius Rt. which will be 
eventually offered in exchange for compensation coupons.  34.7 
percent of Danubius's equity is in the hands of small investors, 
10.6 percent is owned by local councils and 7.5 percent by 
employees.  The remaining shareholders include institutional 
investors, brokerage firms and the vehicle third party liability 
fund.  According to preliminary figures, the hotel company had 1993 
gross profits of 882 million forints on net turnover of 5.098

   FAR EASTERN CLUB TO BREAK FROM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  The Far 
Eastern Business Club (FEBC) of the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce 
(HCC) plans to have itself registered as an independent interest 
organization.  Since its foundation in 1982, the FEBC has operated 
as an associate body of the HCC promoting links between companies. 
In the future, the club will work independently, in close 
cooperation with the chamber, with the principal aim of furthering 
Hungarian ventures' business ties in Hong Kong, Macao, China, South 
Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina.  (Budapest MTI in English 1534 GMT 1

   STATE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS:  Central Statistical Office 
figures show that infrastructure was a crucial area of the national 
economy in 1993.  Over the first nine months of last year, 90.9 
billion forints ($900 million), or 37 percent of the total 
investment spending, was channelled into transport, storage, post, 
and telecommunications, as well as electricity, gas, heat, and water 
supply.  The volume of overall investments, in real terms, was the 
same as in 1992, while that of infrastructure projects increased. 
The fastest development is in the telephone system.  Last year, 1.3 
million main stations operated in the country, 4O percent more than 
in 1989.  The over 500,000 applicants waitlisted at the end of 1993 
have all been promised a telephone by 1997.  To accelerate the 
process, the government allowed each local municipality, meeting 
dozens of concession requests, to set up a telephone distribution 
system.  Privatization of the Hungarian Telecommunications Co. last 
December mobilized foreign capital worth $875 million for the 
purpose.  Over 90 percent of the main stations were connected to the 
direct distance dialing system, which is planned to be completed 
nationwide by 1997.  (The 1989 ratio was 85.5 percent.) 
   The national road system last year measured 30,800 kilometers. 
This compared to 30,000 in 1992.  Construction of the M1 highway 
from Gyor in western Hungary to the Austrian border began last year 
and will be completed in 1995.  (It presently covers the 150-km 
distance between Budapest and Gyor.)  The M15, leading to Bratislava 
and Prague via Mosonmagyarovar, will be opened to traffic in 1997, 
with the new section of the MO, around the capital, opening this 
autumn.  Beginning this year, the M3 speedway, currently 80 
kilometers long, is being built further towards northeastern 
Hungary, but will not reach the border by the time of the 1996 
Budapest World Expo.  The large cities of the region -- Debrecen, 
Miskolc, Nyiregyhaza -- will be linked to it from the National Road 
Fund.  The southern motorway towards Serbia will be completed up to 
Kecskemet, central Hungary, with two lanes by 1996.  The M7 motoway 
running across Transdanubia by Lake Balaton at a length of 90 
kilometers, will be extended in the direction of Croatia and 
Slovenia. 
   These projects will be carried out on a concession basis.  M1 
will be built by a French-Austrian-Hungarian consortium in 
cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD), and M7 with Italian participation as part of the 
Trieste-Kiev axis.  The European Union also supports development of 
Hungary's southern and eastern transit routes and the extension of 
the northern Hungarian section of the Polish-Slovak-Hungarian road 
system.  Six towns will receive bypasses from state and local 
authority finances.  Utilizing the state road fund, 443 towns and 
villages built 103 kilometers of road and 177 kilometers of cycle 
track last year.  Regional projects are also given foreign 
assistance.  For example, several border posts have been set up with 
aid from the European Union's PHARE (Economic Reconstruction Aid for 
Poland and Hungary) scheme.  The World Bank and the EBRD have 
granted 17 billion forints ($170 million) for the reconstruction of 
tramways and an underground line in Budapest.  Both transport and 
communal infrastructure projects are expected to narrow the gap 
between regions with varying degrees of development. 
   So far, the various counties have spent state support, granted 
under a regional development program, on different sectors of their 
infrastructure:  The drinking water supply and roads in Nograd, the 
telephone network in Borsod, both in northern Hungary, and the gas 
program in the eastern county of Szabolcs-Szatmar.  Public utilities 
are expanding at an accelerated rate.  The length of water mains 
last year exceeded 55,300 kilometers, of which 4,000 were built over 
the past four years.  At present, 89 percent of towns and villages 
have conduit water supply, reaching 3.6 million households, or more 
than four-fifths of the total.  Full-scale supply is planned for 
1997.  Drainage measured 16,300 kilometers in 1993, with 1,900 
kilometers built during the last three years.  Thus, 17 percent of 
towns and villages and nearly 38 percent of households -- 1.7 
million -- are connected to the drainage system.  Of the 600 towns 
and villages (18 percent) supplied with gas last year, 172 have been 
connected to the system since 1989.  The 30,000-kilometer-long pipe 
network carries gas to 40 percent of the households, numbering 1.8 
million.  (Budapest MTI in English 1004 GMT 26 Jan 94 AU) 
   UNEMPLOYMENT DECLINE CONTINUES:  Registered unemployment 
continued to fall last December, the National Labor Center said. 
With 632,000 jobless listed at the end of December, 3,000 fewer than 
in the previous month, the unemployment rate went down from 12.2 
percent to 12.1 percent.  However, a few counties in the north are 
still facing massive unemployment, including Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen 
(19.9 percent), Nograd (19.7 percent), and Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg 
(18.7 percent).  This compares to 6.3 percent in the capital city of 
Budapest.  (Budapest MTI in English O946 GMT 31 Jan 94 AU) 
   ELEVEN-MONTH INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT UP 4.3 PERCENT:  Industrial output 
was 4.3 percent up in real terms in the first eleven months of 1993 
as compared with the same period of the previous year, the latest 
Central Statistical Office report shows.  Overall output in the 
construction industry in the first nine months was the same as in 
the comparable period of 1992 but house construction in January- 
November was 16 percent down on the first eleven months of 1992. 
Sales of farm produce were down 24 percent in the first 11 months of 
last year as compared with January-November 1992.  Preliminary 
figures show a grain harvest of 8.4 million tons last year, 13 
percent less than in 1992, the sugar beet harvest down 24 percent, 
and the sunflower seed harvest down 11 percent.  Livestock numbers 
for all kinds of farm animals were lower in September 1993 than a 
year earlier. 
   Consumer prices rose 22.5 percent in the whole of 1993. 
Industrial producer prices rose 10.8 percent in the first 11 months 
and agricultural producer prices rose 25.3 percent in the 12 months 
up to the end of November.  The total personal cash income in the 
first 11 months was 18 percent higher than in the same period of 
1992, which represents a fall of 3 to 4 percent in real terms.  The 
total gross wage income in the first 11 months was 25.5 percent up 
and the net wage income 20.5 percent up on the corresponding period 
of the previous year.  The workforce of companies with more than 20 
employees was on average 9 percent lower in the first 11 months than 
in January-November 1992.  The number of unemployed at the end of 
December was 632,OOO, 73,OOO fewer than its peak in February 1993.

   AGRICULTURAL CROPS SHRINK IN 1993:  Owing to a serious drought 
hitting agriculture for two years, last year's grain crop was 13 
percent down on that of 1992 and 40 percent down on the average of 
the years 1986-1990, the Central Statistical Office reported.  In 
1993, grain crops totalled 8.4 million tons, 1.3 million tons less 
than in 1992 and 5.5 million tons less than the average of 1986- 
1990.  Cereals yielded 4.4 million tons in 1993, 19 percent less 
than in 1992, despite the area sown being 7 percent larger.  The 
sown area of wheat grew by 17 percent but the average crop fell by 
25 percent per hectare.  The sown area of maize shrank by 2 percent 
compared with 1992 and its yield by 5 percent.  Sugar beet grews on 
an area 9,000 hectares smaller than in 1992, and the crop fell by 18 
percent per hectare.  Sunflower crops dropped by over 10 percent, 
potato crops by 22 percent.  According to the report, besides 
drought, the low average of crops was due to a drop in the use of 
artificial fertilizers.  Fertilizers used on one hectare were under 
40 kgs, compared to 180-200 kgs in previous years.  Also, owing to 
restructuring and the low level of income, agricultural companies 
failed to complete part of the work properly.  (Budapest MTI in 
English 0811 GMT 20 Jan 94 AU) 
   MINISTER EXPECTS 'STABILIZATION' IN AGRICULTURE:  The year 1994 
may be one of stabilization in agriculture, according to Agriculture 
Minister Janos Szabo.  Szabo says, in 1994, the output of 
agriculture is to increase by 5 to 8 percent, within that, plant 
cultivation by 14 to 20 percent, while animal husbandry is expected 
to stagnate.  Production of the food processing industry is expected 
to rise by 3 to 5 percent.  The domestic market of agriculture will 
probably stop shrinking.  A boost in demand is expected in external 
markets as well, which could mean agricultural exports of at least 
$2-2.2 billion.  According to preliminary figures, agricultural 
exports in 1993 exceeded $2 billion.  Compared with a record $2.7 
billion in 1992, this is a drop but is still more than the best 
results in the socialist years.  Last year, agricultural exports 
were down on the previous year by 8 to 9 percent.  Szabo denied that 
there is a disastrous situation in agriculture.  Domestic food 
supply is not in danger, he added, and a price of 100 forints for a 
kilogram of bread is out of the question.  (Budapest MTI in English 
1434 GMT 19 Jan 94 AU) 
   CENTRAL BANK CREDIT LINE FOR LONG-TERM EXPORT FINANCING:  The 
Hungarian National Bank (MNB) plans to earmark 10 billion forints -- 
half of its planned 1994 net loans to the banking system -- for 
export financing.  The MNB will refinance the Hungarian Eximbank, 
which is currently being established, up to the 10 billion forints 
limit, so that Eximbank may grant long-term export loans.  The MNB 
will grant the credit to Eximbank in foreign exchange, with the 
latter to grant foreign exchange loans to exporting companies at 
conditions which are in line with OECD standards.  The details of 
the loan structure will be prepared soon.  The loan is designed to 
help engineering exports.  Hungarian companies have until now 
suffered from not being able to offer long-term loans to clients 
because the Hungarian banking system has in general only short-term 
resources.  The document stresses that this solution is only 
temporary.  Eximbank will have to finance itself from the capital 
market in the long run.  The MNB stresses that halting the fall in 
exports requires well-coordinated government efforts.  (Budapest MTI 
in English 1623 GMT 24 Jan 94 AU) 
   CENTRAL BANK ISSUES 1994 MONETARY POLICY GUIDELINES:  The 
Hungarian National Bank (MNB) published its 1994 monetary policy 
guidelines focusing on improving the country's external balance and 
slowing inflation.  The main aim is to reverse last year's 
unfavorable trends in the external balance.  This year's current 
account deficit should stay below $1.5-2 billion.  The MNB predicts 
the,arrival of $1.3-1.5 billion working capital in the country.  The 
guidelines stress that imports must not be allowed to exceed exports 
consistently or considerably.  Exports should increase by a minimum 
of 7 to 9 percent, while imports may only rise by 0.2 percent. 
Consumer prices in 1994 may increase at a somewhat slower pace than 
in 1993.  Inflation is expected to be 16 to 22 percent, producer 
price rises by 11 to 13 percent, and the budget deficit 340 billion 
forints.  Personal savings are likely to rise by 24O billion 
forints.  Budapest MTI in English 0734 GMT 21 Jan 94 AU) 
   PRIVATE SAVINGS UP 212 BILLION FORINTS IN 1993:  According to the 
latest Hungarian National Bank figures, total personal savings 
increased by 212.1 billion forints in 1993, a smaller increase than 
in 1992, when private savings grew by 307.8 billion forints.  At the 
same time, private borrowings were up 41.8 billion forints to 294.1 
billion forints, compared with an increase of 11.3 billion forints 
the year before.  Personal savings deposited at financial 
institutions showed a 185.8 billion forint growth last year, 
compared with a rise of 281.2 billion forints the preceding year. 
At the end of last year, savings totalled 1395.8 billion forints, of 
which 1228.7 billion forints were deposited with financial 
institutions.  Savings deposits totalled 704.4 billion forints, of 
which deposits in foreign exchange were worth 204.4 billion forints, 
an increase of 51.8 billion forints over 1992.  Foreign exchange 
worth 3.9 billion forints was deposited by private persons at 
domestic banks in December.  The value of securities issued by non- 
financial institutions, including state securities, held by private 
individuals totalled 116.1 billion forints on December 31, 1993, 
16.6 billion forints up on the year.  This included a 8.8 billion 
forint rise in December.  Personal net savings totalled 1101.7 
billion forints on December 31, 170.3 billion forints more than a 
year earlier.  (Budapest MTI in English 1431 GMT 19 Jan 94 AU) 
   1993 PRIVATIZATION REVENUE:  The State Property Agency (AVU) had 
a revenue of 77.9 billion forints from privatization in 1993, 25.5 
billion forints, or 32.7 percent, in convertible currency.  Total 
expenditure exceeded revenue in 1993, amounting to 79.1 billion 
forints, over two-thirds of which were obligations to the national 
economy.  The AVU used 53.56 billion forints for that purpose.  A 
total of 22.2 billion forints was used to pay state debts.  The 
withdrawal of compensation vouchers cost 13.04 billion forints, 
while a further considerable sum was used to raise the state holding 
company's registered capital by 6.5 billion forints.  The costs of 
reorganizing and restructuring companies to be privatized amounted 
to 13.67 billion forints, while costs related to the privatization 
process itself, for example amounts spent on handling assets, on 
founding corporations, and on sales, totalled 11.89 billion forints. 
The largest foreign investors in 1993 continued to be Austria and 
Germany.  Austria is involved in 96 companies, while Germany in 65. 
The share of foreign capital in privatized property has totalled 176 
billion forints over the past three years, a third of which was 
invested in Hungary by Austria and Germany.  (Budapest MTI in

   20 BILLION FORINTS FOR SMALL INVESTORS PROGRAM:  The board of AV 
Rt.  (State Property Management Corporation) has allocated total 
stakes worth 20 billion forints face value to be offered this year 
for the Small Investors Share Ownership Program (SISOP).  The 
following stakes have been offered:  3 percent of MVM Inc. worth 7.5 
billion forints, 5 percent of MATAV Inc. worth 4.5 billion forints, 
5 percent of EGIS Inc. worth 320 million forints, and 2 percent of 
MOL Inc. worth 2 billion forints.  Zsolnai Porcelangyar Inc. 
(Zsolnai Porcelain Factory Inc.) and Kalocsa Kornyeki Agraripari 
Inc. (Kalocsa Area Agricultural Inc.) are also in the portfolio with 
10-percent stakes.  Following the government's reduction of the 
stake of AV Rt.-owned companies remaining under permanent state 
ownership at the end of last year, part of the share packets 
released has been included in the portfolio.  As a result, a further 
5 percent of MATAV shares, 5 percent of Pick Szeged Inc., 5 percent 
of Szegedi Paprika Inc., and 10 percent of Richter Gedeon Gyogyszer 
Inc. (Richter Gedeon Pharmaceutical Inc.) have been added.  A 3 
billion forints face value share packet was assigned by the State 
Property Agency (AVU) earlier to be offered this year for small 
investors within the SISOP.  (Budapest MTI in English 1723 GMT 19

   TRADE AT BUDAPEST COMMODITY EXCHANGE PICKS UP:  In 1989, the 
Budapest Commodity Exchange (Budapesti Arutozsde, BAT) reopened 
after a 41-year hiatus.  In 1993, trading on the exchange exceeded 
13 billion forints ($130 million), two-and-one-half times the amount 
of the previous year.  Grain transactions amounted to a ninth of 
commodity-exchange turnover last year, while trading on the two- 
year-old meat division remained sluggish, with a turnover of less 
than 200 million forints.  The newly founded foreign-currency 
exchange produced a turnover of 1.2 billion forints in its first 
nine months.  Although the first day of trading on the reopened 
commodity exchange was October 25, 1989, trading began to gather 
momentum only after price liberalization in 1990.  Grain turnover 
that year reached 600 million forints.  Meat was introduced onto the 
BAT in 1991, but the 3 billion forint turnover that year was almost 
exclusively in grain.  Total trade in 1992 was close to 6 billion 
forints, with 1.5 million tons of grain changing hands there -- 
nearly a quarter of Hungary's overall grain trade. 
   1993 was successful for the BAT in several respects.  Although 
its turnover of 13.1 billion forints ($130 million) lagged far 
behind that of the Budapest Stock Exchange (Budapesti Ertektozsde, 
BET), this was still Eastern Europe's highest commodities exchange 
turnover, matched only by the Prague commodity exchange.  The 
foreign-currency exchange, which opened last March, had a turnover 
of 1.2 billion forints in 1993.  Both this and the BET's currency 
exchange base their speculative market in U.S. dollars and German 
marks on the safe background of Hungary's $20 billion export-import 
traffic -- $3 billion of which is transacted by joint ventures. 
   In mid-October 1993, the Central Accounting House and Assets 
Store Co.  (CAHAS) was founded by the BET and the Hungarian National 
Bank with equity capital of lOO million forints.  It operates as a 
central clearing house and joint backing to Hungary's commodity and 
capital markets, conducting deals in futures, options, inter-bank 
securities, and foreign-currency exchange.  The house guarantees 
that contracts are fulfilled on time, thus diminishing interest risk 
for domestic investors and exchange-rate risk for foreign investors. 
To tackle its increasing role, last year the BAT opened a new 
exchange room and started preparations for a new Central European 
energy-trade division.  Its planned opening in the second half of 
1994 was supported by an international conference of the Central 
European Energy Exchange Foundation, held in Budapest last November. 
Annual oil trade in Eastern Europe is around 6O million tons, worth 
$12O billion.  Hungary's location at the intersection of two large 
pipelines makes Budapest a good place to host an exchange for crude 
oil from various countries, especially considering that the price of 
oil from the former Soviet Union is not yet quoted on international 
exchanges.  However, Hungary must first adopt an exchange law before 
setting up the Central European energy exchange.  The draft of the 
law was drawn up in 1992 and will probably go before the new 
parliament (to be elected this spring) sometime in the third quarter 
of 1994.  (Budapest MTI in English 0905 GMT 19 Jan 94 AU) 

   ESZTERGOM TO BUILD OVER 30,000 SUZUKIS IN 1994:  Esztergom's 
Suzuki plant will turn out 30,000-35,000 cars in 1994, three times 
the number produced in 1993, the January report of the company says. 
In 1993, 12,556 Hungarian-made Suzukis, 35O imported Swifts, and 
1,766 Marutis were sold in Hungary.  The export of over 10,000 cars 
starts in April through Suzuki's Western European distributors. 
Currently, 34 Hungarian companies deliver spare parts for the 
Esztergom factory.  The proportion of domestic suppliers is expected 
to reach 50 percent by late March, which, together with 1O percent 
European suppliers, will give the 60-percent ratio that exempts 
Hungarian Suzukis from European Union customs duty.  Suzuki 
officials think there will be a further need for investment 
supported by the finance and industry ministries.  Last year, eight 
firms supplying Suzuki received financial support or interest 
preferences worth a total of 200 million forints.  This was used to 
help upgrade production to replace imports from Japan.  (Budapest

   GE INVESTS $30-50 MILLION PER YEAR IN HUNGARY:  The U.S. General 
Electric (GE) company invests $30-50 million a year in its Hungarian 
projects.  According to GE's plans, Hungary will continue to be its 
European manufacturing center.  After lay-offs in the initial 
period, the company has created 1,500 jobs.  Also announced was that 
Tungsram, an affiliate of General Electric Lighting Europe, is to 
end 1993 with a profit.  (Budapest MTI in English 1522 GMT 25 Jan 94

   MALEV TO LEASE BACK BOEING 767'S FOR U.S. FLIGHTS:  Hungarian 
airlines MALEV is expected to deal with a cash crisis by signing a 
deal with a U.S. airline in the next two weeks to have its two 
Boeing-767 aircraft jointly operating on the Budapest-New York route 
this summer.  The aircraft were sold to a Cayman Islands firm fully 
owned by MALEV, which will then lease the aircraft back.  Malev 
bought the two 767's last year and flew them jointly with Italian 
airline Alitalia on a Budapest-Rome-New York route.  (Alitalia has a 
third of MALEV's shares.)  By the end of 1993, the aircraft had 
caused losses of $2 million.  The flights were well booked, but only 
because of low ticket prices forced on MALEV by strong competition. 
Revenue also suffered because the aircraft made stops in Rome. 
MALEV lost 1 billion forints in 1993, with big exchange rate costs 
on loans coming from devaluations of the Hungarian forint.

   NEW POWER STATION FOR BUDAPEST WORLD EXPO:  A new 180-megawatt 
block is to be completed at the Budapest Power Station of Kelenfold. 
To be constructed by the joint Hungarian-Italian company Ganz 
Ansaldo -- from World Bank and European Investment Bank credit -- 
the new block will not only produce electricity but will heat 50,000 
flats with what is called "tired steam."  The 260 million forint 
investment will be completed in the second half of 1995.  The new 
unit will completely meet European noise and pollution standards and 
is intended to be a reference establishment for the Hungarian 
electricity industry.  The Kelenfold Power Station supplies energy, 
including distance heating, to one of the country's largest regions, 
which includes the suburbs of Kelenfold, Gazdagret, and Budapest 
Castle.  Experts believe this new project will promote Hungary's 
increasing independence in energy supplies.  The new power station 
is expected to play a major part in energy supply for the 1996 World 
Expo.  (Budapest MTI in English 1123 GMT 21 Jan 94 AU) 
   ENERGY USE ROSE IN 1993:  The greater use of energy last year was 
mainly due to more intensive heating in the winter period, the State 
Authority for Energy Management and Energy Safety reported.  Total 
energy consumption was 1,067 petajoules in 1993, nearly 10 percent 
up on 1992.  The share of domestic production was 48.4 percent, 2.8 
percent down on the previous year.  Within the total energy 
consumption, the proportion of coal fell from 18.2 percent in 1992 
to 15.9 percent last year.  Domestic coal production totalled 14.5 
million tons, and imports amounted to 1.17 million tons.  Oil 
production was 1.7 million tons and natural gas production 5 billion 
cubic meters, 0.25 billion more than in 1992.  Including imports of 
6 million tons of oil and 5.87 billion cubic meters of gas, 
hydrocarbons accounted for 67.8 percent of energy use.  Electricity 
consumption rose by 0.5 percent and consumption was close to 35,000 
gigawatt-hours, including imports of 2,474 gigawatt-hours, which 
covered 7.1 percent of consumption, compared with 10 percent in 
1992.  (Budapest MTI in English 1143 GMT 25 Jan 94 AU) 
   NUMBER OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS INCREASES:  The number of 
business organizations continued to increase last year, with units 
financed from the central budget being the only exception to the 
rule.  Business organizations without legal personality showed the 
sharpest increase.  According to a recent report of the Central 
Statistical Office, in late 1993 there were 85,638 business 
organizations with legal personality, 23.4 percent more than a year 
before, in the country.  Business organizations without legal 
personality numbered 98,036, 13.6 percent more than in late 
December.  The number of private entrepreneurs increased by 13.6 
percent, to 688,843.  The structure of business organizations 
changed to a slight extent:  35 percent of them were specialized in 
trade, 20 percent in industry, 18 percent in real estate and 
services, and 10 percent in construction.  In the category of 
private entrepreneurs, 35 percent were artisans, 35 percent traders, 
and 20 percent intellectuals.  (Budapest MTI in English 1300 GMT 25

   SEPARATE STATE FUNDS MAY BE MERGED:  The Finance Ministry plans 
to present draft legislation to the government which will merge 
certain separate state funds and eliminate overlaps between 
individual funds.  As the funds are regulated by law, only 
Parliament has the authority to change them.  Under the law on 
public finances, as of last year, only separate state funds that 
have been set up by legislation are eligible for central budget 
support.  Seven funds were established under one law:  funds for 
tourism, trade development, investment promotion, water management, 
environmental protection, market intervention, and regional 
development.  A further six agricultural funds were set up under one 
law and other funds are regulated by individual laws.  The draft 
bill proposes that all funds connected with economic development be 
merged.  This would involve the creation of a single fund, managed 
by the Finance Ministry, to replace the existing separate funds for 
employment, regional development, investment promotion, trade 
development, and technical development. 
   I 1993, just over a third of the funds' total income came from 
central budget support, and this year the proportion will fall to 
slightly over a sixth, even though the total income of the funds 
will be 20 billion forints higher this year than last.  Other 
sources of income for the funds this year include 26 billion forints 
from tax revenue allocated directly to the funds, of which 15 
billion forints will go to the Road Fund.  The total revenue from 
contributions from the corporate sector will be 60 billion forints, 
of which 50 billion forints will come from employers' contributions 
to the Solidarity Fund.  Employees' contributions will generate a 
further 15 billion forints, and 28 billion forints will come from 
the income from privatization, of which 13.5 billion forints will go 
to the Employment Fund.  The other resources of the funds are sums 
carried over from last year, various capital income, and credit. 
This year the Road Fund plans to take out the largest single amount 
of credit, almost 20 billion forints.

company will rent the "West Beta" oil rig from the Norwegian firm 
"Smedvig AS," the Norwegian agency NTB announced on 27 January. 
Under a $6.1 million contract, signed for two years with a

   POLSAT RECEIVES LICENSE FOR NATIONWIDE TV CHANNEL:  The National 
Radio and Television Council on 27 January awarded the Polsat TV 
network a license to broadcast a nationwide television channel. 
Polsat, the only legal private TV broadcaster in Poland, was the 
first station to receive a satellite broadcasting license last year. 
The capital of Polsat amounts to 250 billion zlotys (Z) (about $11.6 
million, 97 percent of which is owned by Polish businessman Zygmunt 
Solorz.  Polsat plans two share issues in the future.  The first 
issue is planned to amount to 250 billion zlotys and the second to 
500 billion zlotys.  After the last issue the share of the company 
founders is to be limited to 25 per cent.  (Warsaw PAP in English

   REVENUE HIGHER, SPENDING LOWER IN 1993 BUDGET:  State budget 
revenues in 1993 were Z458.9 trillion (some $21.5 billion) or 5.9 
percent higher than forecast in the budget law, while expenditures 
amounted to Z502.7 trillion, 2.3 percent lower than the planned 
figure, the Finance Ministry's press office said in a document 
released on 28 January.  The budget deficit was Z43.8 trillion, 
compared with the planned Z81 trillion figure.  According to the 
Finance Ministry, income was higher due to the better implementation 
of VAT and excise tax, an effective collection of advance income 
taxes, as well as higher payments of profits of the National Bank of 
Poland.  Poland's budget expenditures were lower by Z11.8 trillion 
because subsidies for the social insurance fund and expenditures for 
foreign debt servicing were cut by Z5.9 and Z4 trillion, 
respectively.  According to the ministry, there were Z4.2 trillion 
left in the Treasury.  (Warsaw PAP in English 1454 GMT 28 Jan 94 AU) 
   1993 ECONOMIC STATISTICS:  According to the Central Statistical 
Office, the GNP in 1993 increased by 4 percent, industrial and 
agricultural production went up, unemployment figures did not 
decrease, and inflation remained high.  The purchasing power of the 
zloty also declined.  In 1993 prices went up by 35.3 percent.  Such 
a high inflation rate was caused mainly by increases in the cost of 
energy, transport, telecommunications, and fuel.  Unemployment was 
still high in 1993, amounting to 15.7 percent in December.  There 
were 2,889,600 unemployed people registered in job centers.  The 
budget deficit was lower than the amount envisaged in the budget law 
and amounted to Z44 trillion (over $2 billion).  Imports exceeded 
exports by $3.5 billion, which was connected with an increase of 
imports by 47 percent in comparison with 1992 before the 
introduction of VAT.  At the same time, exports went up by only 24.1 
percent.  (Warsaw PAP in English 1808 GMT 28 Jan 94 AU) 
   SCANIA BUS, TRUCK PLANT OPENS IN SLUPSK:  The Polish-Swedish 
joint venture which produces Scania trucks and buses has opened a 
factory in Slupsk.  The company was set up in the autumn of 1992 by 
the Swedish firm "Scania Trucks and Bus" and the Polish state 
enterprise "Kapena".  Since that time the firm has produced 80 
trucks of various kinds.  The success of the company led to the 
decision to manufacture buses.  These buses will be made with 
Swedish parts at first, which will gradually be replaced by Polish 
parts.  The first buses will be deployed in the Slupsk transport 
system.  Scania hopes its investment in Slupsk will be a springboard 
for future investments in East European markets, especially in the 
republics of the former Soviet Union.  (Warsaw PAP in English 2118

   PUBLIC DEBT EXPECTED TO GROW IN 1994:  The public debt stood at 
1,372 trillion zlotys (Z), approximately $64 billion, at the end of 
last year, Piotr Dziewulski of the Finance Ministry said on 2O 
January.  Of that total, some Z360 trillion represented domestic 
debts, while the rest was due to foreign creditors.  The ministry 
expects that in 1994 the overall debt will increase to some Z1,7OO 
trillion zlotys, of which some Z500 trillion will be sums due to 
internal creditors and some Z1,200 trillion will be in foreign debt. 
Last year the state budget paid Z48 trillion zlotys of interest on 
domestic debts and another 12 trillion in interest on foreign debts. 
This year the expected figures are 82 and 30 trillion respectively.

closer cooperation in selected areas between the two ministries and 
cooperation that would create conditions for joint actions of 
economic units, CUP Chief Miroslaw Pietrewicz told correspondents 
after a four-day visit to Poland by Israeli Economics and Planning 
Minister Shimon Shetrit.  Shetrit headed a delegation of Israeli 
businessmen whose task was to find ways of stepping up trade and 
tourist exchange between the two countries.  Shetrit said that 
"politicians have marked out the roads, but it is businessmen who 
will drive along them."  (Warsaw PAP in English 1519 GMT 20 Jan 94

   SWEDISH PETROCHEMICAL CONCERN TO INVEST IN POLAND:  The Swedish 
petrochemical concern OK Petroleum has announced plans to invest 
some $17 million in Poland.  Sven-Erik Zachrisson, managing director 
of the concern, said that in the first stage of its presence in 
Poland, OK plans to sell its gasoline which, according to experts, 
is the cleanest and environmentally friendliest in the world at this 
moment.  The concern also has plans to open its own depots and later 
on build a network of gasoline stations together with the Norwegian 
Statoil concern.  Zachrisson said the concern has initially 
earmarked almost $17 million for investments in Poland, not 
including the costs of the building of gasoline stations.  (Warsaw

   DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH LITHUANIA:  Marek Borowski and 
Eduardas Vilkelis, the finance ministers of Poland and Lithuania, 
signed an agreement on barring double taxation on 20 January.  "This 
is the third in a series of agreements Poland has signed with the 
Baltic states.  It ends the series and undoubtedly takes us closer 
to a Polish-Lithuanian treaty.  This is a good sign in our 
neighborly relations," Borowski told correspondents.  Stressing the 
importance of the agreement for the development of bilateral trade 
relations and the conclusion of the treaty, Vilkelis said the 
agreement will create favorable conditions and opportunities for 
political and economic cooperation of the two countries and the 
growth of their economies.  The agreement is also of considerable 
significance for over small 500 joint venture manufacturing and 
trading companies that have their operations in Lithuania.  Poland 
and Lithuania signed an agreement on mutual trade and economic 
cooperation in February 1992 and since then have developed their 
trade exchange in all branches of the economy, chiefly in the 
construction materials industry, the food-processing sector, 
finances, banking, tourism, and health care.  Poland's Ministry for 
Foreign Economic Relations claims that there are possibilities of 
increasing Polish-Lithuanian trade exchange in such sectors as 
agriculture, construction, maritime economy, and timber industry.

   IMPROVEMENT OF GERMAN BORDER CROSSINGS:  Poland and Germany have 
agreed on the need to adjust the pace of the modernization of the 
existing Polish-German border crossings and build new ones to cope 
with the constantly growing border traffic.  Polish Minister of 
Transport Boguslaw Liberadzki, returning to Warsaw on 2O January 
after talks with his German counterpart Mathias Wismann, said they 
focused on structural and legal reforms in rail transport and on 
Polish-German border crossings.  Liberadzki said that last year saw 
an "explosion" of Polish-German border traffic.  Poland's western 
border was crossed by some 80 million people in 1993.  He said that 
construction works at the Swinoujscie-Garz crossing and the building 
of bridges in the border towns of Jedrzychowice and Zgorzelec should 
end this year.  The ministry also plans to modernize border 
crossings in Swiecko and Podroze and, taking advantage of credits 
from the World Bank and PHARE (Economic Reconstruction Aid for 
Poland and Hungary) programme, develop the existing crossings in 
Kolbaskowo, Olszyna and Gubin, all on Poland's western frontier. 
   Liberadzki said he also discussed with Minister Wismann the 
possible construction of German-Czech freeway going through the 
Polish region of Turoszow.  Poland is currently studying documents 
received from the German Ministry of Transport.  Liberadzki also 
announced that the Transport Ministry will examine the proposal by 
the German air carrier Lufthansa to become a strategic partner of 
LOT Polish Airlines.  (Warsaw PAP in English 1609 GMT 20 Jan 94 AU) 
   ONE-THIRD OF STATE FARMS PRIVATIZED IN 1993:  The Agricultural 
Property Agency of the State Treasury last year managed to sell or 
lease into private hands almost one-third of land formerly under 
cultivation by the state farms.  Of the 3.3 million hectares 
formerly managed by these farms, 890,000 hectares were leased and 
another 58,000 hectares sold to private owners.  The agency put to 
the bloc last year 1.7 million hectares of state farm land, of which 
nearly 57 percent found customers.  The land still remaining to be 
sold (about 2.1 million hectares) has been under temporary 
administration by treasury plenipotentiaries.  The agency hopes to 
speed up the process of privatization this year, largely thanks to 
the new regulations that took effect on 19 January.  The amended law 
on agricultural property of the State Treasury now allows greater 
flexibility in fixing starting prices at auctions and offers more 
favorable terms to buyers of land.  (Warsaw PAP in English 1728 GMT

last November, 35 percent of the polled firms reported growing 
production.  In December, the figure was 31 percent, while the 
expectations for January stand at 22 percent.  In November, 45

cities.  The already existing regular connections between Warsaw, 
Lvov, and Kiev will be extended to two more cities in each of the 
countries.  This is the first agreement between Poland and 
independent Ukraine, said Polish Ministry of Transport spokeswoman 
Marzena Grabiszewska-Gryka.  Until now, the services have been based 
on an agreement with the former Soviet Union.  Ukrainian Deputy 
Minister of Transport Nikolai Marchenko asked the Polish Ministry of 
Transport for aid in training Ukrainian aviation administration 
staff.  (Warsaw PAP in English 2102 GMT 20 Jan 94 AU) 
   FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION PLANNED:  Some 2,500 kilometers of freeway 
are to be built in Poland, according to Transport Minister Boguslaw 
Liberadzki said.  The Government Economic Committee (KERN) examined 
a bill on the building of freeways on 21 January.  The government 
plans to build the following freeways:  A-1 Gdansk-Cieszyn, A-2 
Swiecko-Terespol, A-3 Szczecin-Czechy, and A-4 Wroclaw-Przemysl 
motorways.  The latter s to have a branch from Wroclaw to Lodz.  The 
expressways will be built by investors who will win licenses for 
this by way of a tender.  The land through which the freeways will 
pass will be purchased.  Construction costs will be recouped by 
means of tolls.  The building of one kilometer of expressway costs 
about $2.5-3 million.  (Warsaw PAP in English 1612 GMT 21 Jan 94 AU) 
   NEW BANKNOTES WITH ANTI-COUNTERFEIT FEATURES:  New high- 
denomination banknotes incorporating anti-counterfeit features are 
to be introduced as of 24 January 24, the National Bank of Poland 
has announced.  The new notes, with face values of Z500,000 zlotys 
and Z1,000,000 are improved versions of the existing notes.  They 
are printed on better-quality paper, incorporating a new watermark 
and new security threads, which change color under ultra-violet 
light.  There are also slight color changes, although the basic 
design is largely unchanged from the existing notes of the same 
denominations.  The changes have been made in response to widespread 
concern over the increase in circulation of counterfeits of the 
higher denomination Polish banknotes.  However, the existing 500,000 
and 1,000,000 zloty notes are to remain in circulation alongside the 
new ones, and will be replaced only as they become worn out.

   THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF STOCK EXCHANGE:  Wieslaw Rozlucki, president 
of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, presented Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak with one share in the Warsaw exchange at the inauguration of 
the third year of its operations on 24 January.  The prime minister 
gave the president a green clover as a sign of good luck.  Under the 
stock market regulations, one share in the stock exchange makes its 
holder eligible to apply for direct participation in stock market 
tradings.  The prime minister may thus open its own brokerage house 
provided that he is granted a license from the Securities 
Commission.  "The stock market is very useful for the budget as a 
seller of shares in privatized companies.  The history of this 
institution proves that it performs the role of market pricing of 
enterprises well," Pawlak said. 
   Rozlucki recalled that 1993 was very successful for investors 
contrary to the previous years when prices of most shares had been 
noting markdowns.  In 1993, prices of securities rose over 10 fold 
and turnover 40-fold, Rozlucki said.  Prizes for the best brokerage 
houses were awarded during the inaugural ceremony, with the Central 
Brokerage Office winning as regards turnover and the Wielkopolski 
Credit Bank winning as regards a rise in the number of customers.

   AGRICULTURE MINISTER REVIEWS 1993 RESULTS:  The 1993 agricultural 
production exceeded the 1992 one with about 3 million tons of grain, 
1 million tons of potatoes, 500,000 tons of grapes and 1 million 
tons of other fruits, said Agriculture Minister loan Oancea.  In 
1993 milk and eggs production leveled the 1992 production, while 
meat production fell by about 300 tons.  The fall was explained by 
the agriculture minister through the lack of fodder and funds, 
especially in the state sector.  Food exports mounted in 1993 to 
over $55 million which means a 15 percent fall compared with 1992. 
1993 is the first year when the production decline flattened out for 
several items such as oil, margarine, vegetables, fruit, beer and 
wines.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1308 GMT 7 Feb 94 AU) 
   AGRICULTURE MINISTER DISCUSSES RESTRUCTURING:  A new phase in the 
restructuring of Romanian agriculture is about to start, which is 
intended to replace a number of links in the food-processing chain 
and to do away with monopolies in services for agriculture, Romanian 
Minister of Agriculture and Food loan Oancea says in an interview. 
516 agricultural machines units will be passed into private hands 
over 1994-1996 and consequently competition is likely to appear. 
Minister Oancea mentions that last year private owners bought most 
of the 16,138 tractors on the domestic market.  Private farmers own 
44,000 of the existing 149,000 tractors.  Services for agriculture 
are expected to turn into an efficient lever for agriculture 
activities.  A number of food-processing companies in which the 
state holds most of the capital at present are also expected to get 
privatised until 1996, Oancea said.  (Bucharest ROMPRES English 1409

   ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM:  Raw material in shortage in the 
Romanian economy will be brought from Vietnam in 1994, Romanian 
Commerce Minister Cristian Ionescu told ROMPRES on his coming back 
from a recent session of a Joint Romanian-Vietnamese Commission. 
The trade balance has looked even in the recent years as Romania has 
exported none but imported goods from Vietnam on account of 
Vietnam's debts to Romania.  The Joint Commission has agreed that 
Vietnam pay out its debt through commodity deliveries worth about 
seven million rubles yearly.  The debt would be further denominated 
in rubles as a hard currency denomination would have come to be 
detrimental on Romania's interests, said Minister Ionescu who added 
that the Joint Commission works had marked the normalization of the 
economic relations between Romania and Vietnam. 
   In the context, the Romanian commerce minister said the 
Commission had found out opportunities for Romanian exports to 
Vietnam such as Dacia cars for the Vietnamese Police and other 
public authorities, drilling equipment, electric railway engines to 
replace the older ones imported also from Romania in the 8O's. 
"These goods will be paid for in hard currency or through goods 
swaps," said Minister Ionescu.  The Romanian cars are going to be 
paid for in hard currency, the tires would be swapped for Vietnamese 
natural rubber and the drilling equipment for crude oil.  (Bucharest

   PROJECTS TO IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK:  Under a $403.4 
million project to increase efficiency and adjust the road traffic 
network in Romania to international standards, the World Bank is to 
bring financing of $120 million, the EBRD is to contribute $80 
million and the European Bank of Investment $80 million, to which 
$123.4 million are to be added from Romania's Government.  The 
project envisages an improvement of the 1,000 km of national routes, 
in view of a daily flow between 2,000 and 10,000 vehicles, most of 
them part of the master routes connecting the West with the East of 
the continent.  Moreover, modernization of border crossing points at 
Nadlac, Varsad, Borsa, Siret, Albita, and Calafat is also in view to 
ease international traffic, reads an article in the weekly 
ECONOMISTUL.  Works concerning the safety of routes are to include 
placement of international road signs and milestones on 5,000 km. 
(the total length of European routes in Romania), in view of 
bringing more information and security on road traffic. 
   Investment for railway transport will help purchase of railway 
network maintenance equipment, spares and an improvement of the data 
processing system under the program of restructuring of the Romanian 
railway network and help correlate it to international networks. 
The article reads that the World Bank has already started to grant

   FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ROMANIA:  Germany ranks first among 
the countries represented in Romania by companies with foreign 
capital participation, with 3,821 such companies registered over 
December 1990-December 1993, according to a report issued by the 
National Trade Register.  In point of the amount of subscribed 
nominal capital, Italy first comes with 58,438.3 million lei, 17.6 
percent of it in hard currency.  Syria and Turkey are both 
registered with 2,380 mixed-capital companies each, followed by 
Jordan (more than 1,500), Hungary and the United States (more than 
1,300 each) and Lebanon (more than 1,100 companies).  Even though

   PRIVATIZATION PROSPECTS IN INDUSTRY:  So far 27 state-owned 
companies have been turned to the private sector.  Some are in the 
textile industry, others in the wood processing, electrical, 
electronic, and chemical branches, in oil and gas drilling, machine- 
building, all cumulating a nominal capital of 1.8 billion lei.  The 
information comes from VOCEA ROMANIEI (Romania's Voice), the 
government's newspaper, which carries an interview with Industry 
Minister Dumitru Popescu.  A standard methodology was elaborated in 
June 1993 for the assessment of the companies' degree of 
profitability and solvency.  The selection for privatization is a 
continuous process that gives Premier Vacaroiu's statement that 
"1994 will be the year of wide-scale privatization" the chance to 
make this come true in industry, the minister said.  He is also 
quoted as having said that "industry still furnishes over 45 percent 
of the gross domestic product, over 50 percent of the national 
budget, about 90 percent of Romania's exports, and keeps 45 percent 
of the work force employed.  The main assets of the industrial 
sector are well trained hands, specialists with a solid technical 
education comparable to Western standards.  Most sectors, the 
minister opined, have the force to survive free market competition 
provided the necessary technological updating is done at moderate 
and short-term recoverable costs and that the social protection 
rules stipulated by the international regulations Romania has 
adhered to are observed.  Romanian industry is also capable, 
Minister Dumitru Popescu said, to cover its own imports from 
exports, many Romanian suppliers being well known on the 
international market for years.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0402

   1993 INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT, 1994 PROJECTIONS:  The industry of road 
transportation means ranks first in point of growth in 1993 with 
125.7 percent, followed by furniture, 129.7 percent, the industry of 
communications equipment, radio and television sets, 119.2 percent, 
the rubber and plastics processing industry, 105.9 percent, rail, 
sea and air means of transportation, 112.7 percent, the chemical 
industry and that of synthetic fibers, 103.9 percent.  "Energy- 
greedy" industrial sectors and those based on imports, such as the 
paper and pulp industry and textiles reported drops in 1993 as 
against 1992.  The production of the units subordinated to the 
Ministry of Industries will grow by 2-4 percent in 1994, the 
ministry estimates.  Most branches are expected to redress (as 
received), with important growth in electricity and heating -- 3-5 
percent; textiles, leatherware -- 5-7 percent; chemistry and 
petrochemicals -- 3-4 percent; machine-building -- 4-6 percent; and 
the wood-processing industry -- 4-5 percent.  A 2 percent drop is 
estimated in crude and natural gases extraction in 1994 against 
1993.  Estimates for 1994 have taken into account both data from 
economic units and departments and expected effects due to the 
improvement of the legislative and institutional framework.

   AIRCRAFT ENGINE PLANT:  The "Turbomecanica" plant is the only 
manufacturer of aircraft jet engines in Romania.  The company was 
set up in 1975 to revive an old tradition in Romanian aircraf t- 
manufacturing.  At present the company manufactures a wide range of 
items for the aircraft industry, as well as for other industrial 
fields.  The company is entirely state-owned and employs some 2,400 
people, many of whom have undergone highly specialized training in 
Romania and abroad.  There are 400 engineers working at 
"Turbomecanica," which can develop programs for aviation and other 
related economic fields.  The aviation profile (profile 1) consists 
of four types of engines (military and civilian) and spare parts for 
helicopters; some of the items are also exported.  The licenses for 
aircraft parts were bought from prestigious firms:  Rolls Royce 
(Britain), Turbomeca and Aerospatiale (France).  The second profile 
of the company involves manufacturing free turbines (for high-power 
gas pumping stations) as well as other parts derived from aircraft 
systems.  Within the same profile "Turbomecanica" manufactures parts 
for nuclear and medical equipment (like the "Dermojet," which has 
been approved by medical authorities), compressors for freezing 
units, compressed-air turbines, and so forth.  In view of the wide 
range of its products and the delicate fields they belong to, 
"Turbomecanica" strives to achieve high overall quality, in keeping 
with all international standards.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in English

by between 0.8 percent and 3.3 percent in 1994 compared with 1993. 
In the opinion of P. Karasz, an expert at the Institute, it would be 
realistic to reckon with a further decline in households' 
consumption.  "Compared with last year, it is possible to estimate a 
0.7 percent to 1.4 percent decline," he said.  Despite the envisaged 
increase of 14 to 17 percent in the population's nominal disposable 
income, its real value will fluctuate around the level recorded in

   DAILY QUESTIONS OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS:  The Bratislava

unemployment statistics, which reflect the number of job applicants 
registered with labor offices, and argued that they "distort" the 
actual rate of unemployment.  As Mikulas Sliacky, the author of the 
article, pointed out, job applicants who do not find a job within 
six months after their registration with the labor office are 
automatically deleted from the official statistics of job seekers 
and are no longer considered unemployed for statistical purposes. 
He suggested that, by means of this ploy, some 229,400 people who 
were jobless did not figure in the official unemployment statistics 
for October 1993.  Had these people been included, Sliacky said, 
October 1993 unemployment rate would have been 22.8 percent, rather

Lachkovic of the ministry's Budget and Economic Policy Department. 
The analysis also showed that in some state farms it will be 
necessary to resort to the application of the law on bankruptcy and 
settlement.  The Ministry of Agriculture has therefore proposed that 
bankruptcy proceedings be initiated in 10 state farms that the 
analysis showed to be the least efficient.  (Bratislava SME in

   MEASURES TO CONTROL SWINE FEVER:  The District Anti-Epidemiologic 
Commission in Prievidza, central Slovakia, adopted special measures 
against the spread of swine fever on 18 January, after the disease 
was discovered in the tissue of a boar shot in the area on January 
9.  District Veterinarian Jaroslav Hatapka told journalists that two 
protective belts had been set up within a 15-km and 25-km radius 
from where the disease was found.  The regulation orders reducing 
the number of boars by shooting them, then having every shot animal 
examined by a vet and samples of its tissue tested.  (Prague CTK in 
English 18 Jan 94)  Swine fever has been identified in four Slovak 
districts to date -- Nove Zamky, where 3,848 infected pigs have been 
slaughtered, Rimavska Sobota (138 pigs), Lucenec (10 pigs), and 
Prievidza, where only wild swine have been identified as carriers of 
the disease thus far.  (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 24 Jan

   BALANCE SHEET OF 1993 STOCK EXCHANGE TRADING:  A total of 1,383 
transactions with 138,251 shares and bonds in an aggregate volume of 
Sk177.38 million were realized at the Bratislava Securities Exchange 
(BCPB) between 6 April 1993, when the BCPB went into operation, and 
the end of the year.  The total turnover was thus lower than the 
turnover on a single day of trading at the Prague stock exchange.  A 
total of 17 different securities (shares in 9 companies, 3 state 
bonds, 2 bank bonds, 2 participation certificates, and one company 
bond) were registered on the BCPB's listed market and another 499 
securities (shares in 496 companies and 3 investment funds) on the 
unlisted market at the end of 1993.  Turnover in listed securities 
amounted to Sk1O6.72 million and turnover in unlisted securities to 
Sk7O.66 million. 
   The most liquid securities were the Vseobecna Uverova Banka bond 
(turnover of Sk44.748 million), state bond number O4 (Sk38.51 
million), Figaro shares (Sk33.6 million), Nafta Gbely shares 
(Sk24.88 million), and shares of the Slovnaf t refinery (Sk14.22 
million).  Some 9O percent of the shares registered on the unlisted 
market were not traded even once in the course of the year.  The 
BCPB had 25 registered members at the end of 1993, 17 of which were 
institutions based in the Slovak Republic (13 banks and insurance 
companies, three brokers, and the National Property Fund) and 8 
institutions based in the Czech Republic.  The Czech institutions do 
not yet possess a license for trading in securities in Slovakia, 
however.  (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY BURZOVE NOVINY in Slovak 13

   BALANCE SHEET OF 1993 RM-SYSTEM TRADING:  Between its 
inauguration in March 1993 and 16 December 1993, the RM-System 
Slovakia electronic market in securities organized seven periodic 
auctions, during which 199,810 shares worth Sk41.786 million changed 
hands.  The number of registered issues increased from 497 in the 
first periodic auction to 548 in the seventh auction, but actual 
trading was restricted to a few issues.  The three most traded 
shares were those of VSZ (East Slovak Iron Works) Kosice with a 
turnover of Sk7.9 million, Slovnaf t (Sk4.05 million), and Vseobecna 
Uverova Banka (General Credit Bank, VUB) (Sk2.26 million).

   POPRAD BID FOR 20O2 OLYMPICS:  Jan Madar, mayor of Poprad, said 
after the 18 January meeting of the Slovak Government, which 
approved Poprad's bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics, that 
expenditures on sports facilities would amount to Sk8.5 billion, 
while overall budgeted costs, including infrastructure improvements 
and construction, were projected at Sk27 billion.  The state budget 
would participate with about Sk3 billion in the project's financing. 
Proceeds from television rights, advertising, and ticket sales are 
estimated at Sk13 billion.  (Bratislava SME in Slovak 19 Jan 94 p 2

   PEPSI-COLA INVESTMENTS:  Representatives of the Pepsi-Cola 
International company announced in Bratislava on 19 January that the 
firm intends to invest $30 million in Slovakia over the next five 
years.  The plans include the construction of at least three 
distribution and sales centers with three warehouses and a car pool 
of at least 100 vehicles.  This should create about 200 new jobs in 
Slovakia in the next two years.  (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 20 Jan

   BANK PROJECT CRITICIZED:  A commentary in the Bratislava daily 
PRAVDA voiced serious objections to the National Property Fund's 
plan, promoted by Prime Minister Meciar, to set up Banka Slovakia in 
Banska Bystrica and, thereby, to establish Banska Bystrica as 
Slovakia's "second banking center."  Ivan Podstupka, the daily's 
economic commentator, asked why a second banking center needed to be 
set up at a time when "the first center, Bratislava, stands on feet 
of clay."  He pointed out that Slovakia's problem did not lie in the 
small number of banks, but in the shortage of capital, and 
criticized the further fragmentation of the banks' already scarce 
resources.  Podstupka also questioned the wisdom of "pressuring 
state-controlled financial institutions to make their deposits with 
Banka Slovakia where there is not the least guarantee of an 
efficient use of resources" and compared the entire project with 
"growing strawberries at Skalnate Pleso," the highest-altitude lake 
in the High Tatra mountains. 
   Speculating about the motives behind the project, Podstupka 
suggested that the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia needed 
"an obedient bank" that would finance privatization and thereby help 
"lay the foundations for an ownership structure that will survive 
for at least decades."  Given these motives, Podstupka said, "it 
does not matter in the least that an inorganic and non-market 
element of the banking system is coming into being, one lacking in 
professional background and without the least chance of establishing 
itself abroad." (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 20 Jan 94 p 5 AU) 
   GAS UTILITY CUSTOMERS FAIL TO PAY BILLS:  Customers of Slovensky

   ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION, IMPORTS:  Slovensky Energeticky Podnik 
(Slovak Energy Company, SEP) is the largest generator of electricity 
in Slovakia.  In 1993, it generated 24.5 billion kilowatt hours of 
electricity (84 percent of Slovakia's overall production), about 
one-half of which was nuclear power.  In 1992 Slovakia imported 6 
billion kilowatt hours of electricity, 21 percent of total 
consumption.  (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 24 Jan 94 p 12

   ZILINA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT DELAYED:  The construction of a 
hydroelectric power plant in Zilina has been delayed because the 
state does not yet own all the land where it will be built, 
according to Julius Binder, the director of the state water 
construction enterprise Vodohospodarska Vystavba Bratislava.  The 
power plant is to be built on the Vah river, and its construction 
demands the relocation of residents in the villages Mojsova Lucka, 
Mojs, and Hrustina.  According to Binder, so far it has not been 
possible to purchase about one-half of the 700 plots of land 
included in the future building site.  The state is expected to 
exercise its right of expropriation and pay the current residents 
for the land.  An acceleration of the whole process could allow for 
the beginning of construction within the first half of the year. 
The entire project will cost Sk5 billion (some $170 million) 
invested over three years.  International financing is being sought 
for the project.  Once completed, the power plant will provide 
170,000 megawatt hours of electricity every year, which will cover 
the annual consumption of electricity of more than 50,000 households 
and help save 190,000 tons of coal.  (Prague CTK in English 25 Jan

   TRADE WITH POLAND:  Trade turnover between Slovakia and Poland 
reached Sk6.9 billion in 1993, which made Poland Slovakia's eighth 
largest trading partner, after the Czech Republic, Germany, Russia, 
Austria, Hungary, Italy, and Ukraine.  The trade balance between the 
two countries showed a Slovak surplus of Sk1.191 billion.  A total 
of 122 Polish firms with an aggregate capital of SkIS million were 
registered in Slovakia at the end of September 1993.  (Bratislava

   SHOE FACTORY TO BE SOLD TO EMPLOYEES:  JAS Bardejov, the second 
largest footwear manufacturer in Slovakia, will be privatized by 
means of direct sale to a shareholding company established by 4,527 
of the company's 4,980 employees.  The management will acquire 83.3 
percent of the shares, with the rest going to the other employees. 
The shareholding company proposes a purchase price of Sk510 million, 
which is slightly above the company's book value of Sk508 million, 
but it demands that Sk180 million in investments planned by 1996 be 
subtracted from this amount.  The terms of payments will be agreed 
with the National Property Fund.  JAS Bardejov made a profit of 
almost Sk2O million in 1993.  (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 26 Jan

   RECESSION IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY:  According to F. Slavik, 
president of the Association of Slovak Contractors, construction is 
one of the branches of the Slovak economy hardest hit by recession. 
The "alarming" situation is demonstrated by a 30-percent drop in the 
volume of building work and by the loss of another 16,000 jobs in 
1993.  According to Slavik, 40 building companies have gone bankrupt 
thus far, 22 of them in 1993.  The liquidation of at least another 
40 building companies is expected this year.  "Liquidation is thus 
almost becoming the main form of privatization in construction," 
Slavik said.  The branch employs about 105,000 people.  (Bratislava

   HUNGARY SLOVAKIA' S FOURTH-LARGEST TRADING PARTNER:  Hungary is 
Slovakia's fourth largest trading partner, Hungarian ambassador to 
Slovakia Jeno Boross said on Slovak Radio.  He held a consultative 
meeting with Slovak Deputy Premier Sergej Kozlik on 31 January, 
before the meeting of Czech, Slovak, Polish, and Hungarian Economics 
Ministers in Prague on 3 February.  He and Kozlik discussed the 
possibility of bilateral investments, the foundation of a Hungarian- 
Slovak bank, the possibility of cooperation after the Adria oil 
pipeline was opened and the tourist industry.  Boross said he 
believed bilateral relations will not only be tied to Bratislava. 
Hungary is interested in opening a trading and marketing center in 
Kosice, east Slovakia.  Reacting to Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar's 
earlier statement that there is too much Hungarian capital in south 
Slovakia, Boross said that investments by ethnic Hungarians must 
have been meant, as investments from the republic of Hungary were 
slight.  (Prague CTK in English 31 Jan 94 AU) 
   HEALTH-CARE SECTOR'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS:  According to Engineer 
M. Janovicova, director of the Health Insurance Fund Administration, 
the 15.7 billion Slovak korunas (Sk) which the 1994 state budget 
approved for the Health Insurance Fund falls "at least Sk7.1 
billion" short of the fund's needs.  As Janovicova points out, the 
fund's "demonstrable need" is for Sk28.1 billion, while its "minimum 
variant of solvency" reckons with Sk22.5 billion.  The health 
sector's current debt is estimated at between Sk3.5 to 6 billion. 
Hospitals' unpaid bills alone amounted to Sk2.1 billion at the 
beginning of December.  (Bratislava SME in Slovak 3 Jan 94 p 1 AU) 
   NOVEMBER CONSUMER PRICE DATA:  Consumer prices increased 1.1

percent, prices of manufactured goods went up 1.3 percent, the cost 
of restaurant meals increased by 1.6 percent, and the cost of 
services rose by 0.9 percent.  Compared with December 1992, November 
1993 consumer prices were 15.9 percent higher.  The greatest 
increase was in the cost of restaurant meals (27 percent).  Food 
prices, on the other hand, went up only by 12.3 percent in the first 
11 months of 1993.  (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY BURZOVE NOVINY in

   BUDGET DEFICIT TO AFFECT CREDIT AVAILABILITY:  In an interview 
for the Slovak News Agency TA SR, Marian Jusko, vice governor of the 
Slovak National Bank, conceded that "1994 will not be an easy year 
in terms of the availability of credits."  As he observed, 
"obtaining credit will continue to be rather complicated because a 
considerable proportion of bank credits will be allocated to cover 
the state budget deficit." (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak

   PUBLIC, PRIVATE SECTOR CREDIT:  The volume of credit in the 
Slovak economy increased from Sk236.0 billion at the beginning of 
1993 to Sk249.93 billion at the end of September 1993.  The bulk of 
it (Sk231.53 billion at the end of the third quarter of 1993) had 
been extended to the "enterprise sphere."  While the volume of 
credit extended to the "public sector" declined from Sk131.35 
billion on 1 January 1993 to Sk127.59 billion on 30 September 1993, 
the volume of credit extended to the "private sector," which 
includes cooperatives, increased over the same period from Sk79.31 
to Sk99.O3 billion.  (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 4 Jan

steps taken in recent years, Eva Bonova, director of the ministry's

retained in branches where a competitive environment does not yet 
exist and in branches with a "natural monopoly," she said, adding 
that this applies mainly to energy and heat prices, 
telecommunications and postal rates, fares for passenger traffic, 
health services, housing rents, water and sewage rates, and the 
like.  (Bratislava SME in Slovak 4 Jan 94 p 2 AU)

in the procurement, sale, and distribution of petrochemical products 
and in the construction and operation of gas stations.  By the end 
of 1994 it intends to open the first five to seven gas stations at 
an "international standard."  The company intends to invest $6 to $8 
million in Slovakia annually, which is equivalent to 5 percent of 
all foreign investment in Slovakia in 1993.  According to Wilhelm 
Weiss, general director of Shell Slovakia, the company's aim is to 
achieve a 10 percent market share in Slovakia.  (Bratislava

first half of the year, Slovakia imported from the Czech Republic 
Sk1.205 billion worth of agricultural commodities, while Slovak 
exports of these commodities to the Czech Republic reached only 
Sk379 million.  The 10 percent devaluation of the Slovak koruna in

SUMMARY 

                                        In a move designed to realize high-level U.S.-DPRK talks, 
Pyongyang used the 12 March meeting with Seoul to suggest a 
willingness to withdraw the four demands it had previously 
insisted Seoul must meet before presidential envoys could be 
exchanged.  In signaling its willingness to move toward holding 
an inter-Korean summit, the North also claimed that it is the 
South that has repeatedly rejected North Korean summit offers, 
including one heretofore unreported.  In keeping with its new 
interest in exchanging envoys, Pyongyang media have so far 
continued to temper personal attacks on ROK President Kim Yong- 
sam, a circumspection first noted last week. 

                                  END SUMMARY 

   Pyongyang media treatment of the 12 March working-level talks 
suggested that the North is poised to strike a deal with the 
South on the exchange of special envoys.  Pyongyang radio on 12 
March depicted the North Korean chief delegate--identified in 
South Korean media as Pak Yong-su--as noting that of the 28 
points raised in connection with procedural matters for the envoy 
exchange, "all but four points" had been agreed upon "in 
principle."  Furthermore, Pak was cited as making conciliatory 
gestures for resolving the four North Korean demands: 

+ Pak said that two issues--the "large-scale nuclear war 
exercises" and the "international cooperation system" (an 
allusion to threats of UN sanctions)--could be discussed by the 
envoys.  Further defusing these issues, he claimed that the South 
had announced its decision "not to stage" Team Spirit this year. 

+ On the introduction of the Patriot missile to the South, he 
seemed to agree with the South's alleged statement that "the 
situation had changed" because Seoul "had already decided to 
shelve the plan" to bring in the missiles. 

+ On ROK President Kim's earlier remarks that he "cannot shake 
hands with a party that possesses nuclear weapons," Pak seemed to 
suggest that the question is moot, since the "person in the 
highest authority" in the South subsequently said that the North 
has no nuclear weapons. 

   Pak noted that although the South's response to the four North 
Korean demands still falls "short of our expectations," it is 
proof of Seoul's recognition of the basic "reasonableness" of the 
demands (Pyongyang radio, 12 March)--a formulation that may allow 
Pyongyang, having made its points, to yield without losing its 
"dignity." 

   Summit Talks     Signaling a willingness to eventually hold a 
North-South summit meeting, while at the same time illustrating 
North Korea's desire to put the South on the defensive, Pak 
claimed that the South has rejected the North's offers of top- 
level talks dating back 20 years.  In particular, he revealed 
that in "early April 1992" an unnamed North Korean "special 
envoy  visited Seoul and invited the ROK president to Pyongyang 
around the time of DPRK President Kim Il-song's 80th birthday. 
Implying that Pyongyang could use the South's rejection of the 
summit for propaganda purposes, Pak pointedly noted that up to 
now the North had "never mentioned" its special envoy's visit to 
Seoul or his offer. 

   Joint Communique     Seeking to foster the impression of progress 
at the 12 March meeting, the North unsuccessfully proposed a 
North-South joint communique(SEE NOTE) to "reconfirm" both sides' 
intention to exchange envoys "at an early date."  Pyongyang 
apparently hoped it could use such a communique to claim to 
Washington that North Korea has met its prerequisites for 
reconvening high-level U.S.-North Korea talks.  (Although U.S.- 
DPRK high-level talks tentatively are set to start on 21 March, 
Washington is reportedly insisting that the special envoys must 
be exchanged between the North and South before such talks could 
be held (Yonhap, 12 March).) 

(NOTE: Precedents for issuing North-South joint communiques in 
recent years are somewhat mixed.  A joint communique was issued 
at the fourth round of inter-Korean prime ministerial talks 
(Pyongyang radio, 24 October) in a departure from the practice of 
the previous three rounds.  Communiques were also issued 
following inter-Korean talks on the nuclear issue in 1992 
(Pyongyang radio, 19 February 1992, 14 March 1992).  However, in 
August 1992 the South rejected a North Korean proposal for a 
joint communique following another meeting on the nuclear issue 
(Yonhap, 31 August 1992).) 

   Just how eagerly Pyongyang wanted a joint communique was 
demonstrated in the extraordinarily conciliatory remarks Pak made 
in pressing for the communique.  In accusing the South of 
delaying the realization of the envoy exchange by "suspecting" 
Korean motives, Pyongyang radio portrayed Pak as indirectly 
admitting that the North was also partly to blame for the delay 
(12 March).  The radio cited him as saying that the North on its 
part had created "four barriers "--a clear reference to the four 
North Korean demands.  In pleading for compromise, Pak also 
cautioned against the sides playing a zero-sum game, declaring 
that neither side should "absolutize" its own position. 

   Limiting Rhetoric     In line with the image of conciliation the 
North Korean leadership is trying to project, Pyongyang media 
have in recent days continued to moderate their personal attacks 
on ROK President Kim.  The KCNA report of an 11 March commentary 
in the party paper Nodong Sinmun calling for unity of South 
Korean "patriots" against their government avoided using the 
South Korean leader's name, referring to the ROK Government only 
as the "'civilian' fascist forces" (11 March).  For the past few 
months, Pyongyang media have been signaling the North's 
reluctance to deal with the South Korean government with repeated 
harsh personal attacks on President Kim.  The first sign of 
moderation on this issue appeared last week. 

   Implications     Pyongyang's attempt to project a conciliatory 
stance toward Seoul suggests that the North may try to work out a 
substantive accord on the envoy exchange at the next scheduled 
session on 16 March.  Failing that, the North may hope that 
taking the high road on this issue will strengthen its contention 
of the South's intransigence and thus enable it to pressure the 
United States to proceed with bilateral talks.

SUMMARY 

                                    Amid foreign media reports of IAEA inspectors departing North 
Korea after encountering difficulties, Pyongyang on 15 March used 
the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry spokesman's 
statement to demand that Washington proceed with the 21 March 
DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in Geneva as scheduled.  Reinforcing 
earlier warnings against the imposition of preconditions for the 
talks, the spokesman threatened that North Korea would call off 
the meeting and refuse future nuclear inspections.  Pyongyang 
radio at the same time issued an oblique threat to proceed with a 
nuclear arms development program. 

                                END SUMMARY 

   Seeking to place Washington on the defensive, the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's statement, carried by Pyongyang radio on 15 
March, declared that North Korea has "completely fulfilled" its 
obligations under the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement and called 
on the United States to do its part without setting "unreasonable 
preconditions."  Repeating the familiar refrain on the 25 
February accord, the spokesman said that the accord set forth 
"simultaneous" action by both sides, namely 1)"resumption" of 
inter-Korean contacts for exchanging special envoys and 2)IAEA 
inspections for ensuring continuity of safeguards on Pyongyang's 
part, in return for 1)suspension of Team Spirit and 2)resumption 
of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March.  Now that 
"several rounds" of inter-Korean talks have been held and IAEA 
inspections "enough for continuity of safeguards" have been 
completed, he warned, any U.S. failure to fulfill its obligations 
will "automatically" render the 25 February accord "invalid."  If 
Washington persists in its "unreasonable" insistence that nuclear 
inspections must be proven "satisfactory" to the IAEA and that 
special envoys must be exchanged by the North and the South 
before Team Spirit can be cancelled or the bilateral talks can 
take place, the spokesman warned, Pyongyang will consider DPRK- 
U.S. negotiations to have ended in a "rupture" and will take 
unspecified "unilateral" and "appropriate" action. 

   Ominous Threat     Clearly seeking to add weight to its threats, 
Pyongyang seems to be preparing a public fallback position in 
case of failure of its nuclear talks with Washington by hinting 
at a readiness to proceed with a nuclear weapons program.  In the 
latest variant of this threat, Pyongyang radio on 15 March 
reiterated North Korea's profession of concern for alleged 
Japanese plans to develop a nuclear capability.  After 
criticizing Japanese Foreign Minister Hata's alleged statement on 
"countermeasures" in case of North Korean intransigence on the 
nuclear issue, the radio declared that Pyongyang "may face a 
situation of having no choice but to reconsider [its] position 
regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." 

   IAEA Inspections     The 15 March statement comes amid reporting 
of the departure of a group of IAEA inspectors from Pyongyang 
(KCNA, 15 March) and speculation that the IAEA may hold a special 
Board of Governors meetings to address difficulties encountered 
by the inspectors (Yonhap, 15 March).  Giving credence to foreign 
media accounts of disputes between Pyongyang and IAEA inspectors, 
Seoul's KBS-1 radio carried a report of a North Korean Embassy 
official in Beijing saying that Pyongyang had rejected a request 
by IAEA inspectors to extract samples from "one facility," 
regarding it as an "unjust demand" (15 March).  The councillor, 
Choe Han-chun, was depicted as playing down the significance of 
the dispute, claiming that it was "not a serious problem" and can 
be resolved through future dialogue between North Korean and the 
IAEA. 

   Implications     Pyongyang is clearly moving to forestall any 
IAEA move to convene a special meeting of the Board of Governors- 
-a predecessor to possible referral of the North Korean nuclear 
issue to the UN Security Council.  By assuming a tough position 
and emphasizing the gravity of the situation, the North Korean 
leadership seems to hope that Washington will propose a 
compromise solution.

S                            U M M A R Y 
      Although the vote by the State Duma to amnesty prisoners 
implicated in the August 1991 coup and the October 1993 Supreme 
Soviet uprising marks the Duma's most confrontational move 
against President Boris Yeltsin to date, it was passed as part of 
a compromise package that somewhat mitigated its anti- 
presidential thrust.  Centrists and moderate reformers supported 
the amnesty after hardliners gave up a legislative commission 
that was to have investigated last autumn's constitutional crisis 
and agreed to accept an additional document defining the amnesty 
as part of a movement toward national reconciliation.  The 
amnesty vote appears to have weakened Yeltsin politically and has 
deepened the divisions among reformers, further undermining their 
ability to fight the anti-Yeltsin opposition in the legislature. 
                           END SUMMARY 
   Hardliners in the Duma scored a political victory over Yeltsin 
when, with the help of centrists and moderate reformers, the Duma 
adopted on 23 February a package of decrees amnestying prisoners 
charged in the 1991 coup attempt and the 1993 uprising, including 
Yeltsin's archenemies Ruslan Khasbulatov and Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
The Duma had debated but failed to approve a political amnesty 
several times previously, but proponents scored a breakthrough on 
22 February when the Duma's Council put together a "large" 
compromise package that included decrees on a criminal and 
political amnesty, a memorandum calling for national accord, and 
a decree that apparently abolishes a Duma commission established 
on 9 February to investigate the events of 21 September to 4 
October (see box 1) (Radio Rossii, 9 February; Segodnya, 23 
February).  Legislative hardliners had intended to use the 
commission to attack Yeltsin by publicly questioning the 
constitutionality of his edict dissolving the Supreme Soviet. 
During the Council's session, hardliners reportedly agreed to 
"act as if the vote on setting up the commission never took 
place," a choice that reportedly caused considerable anguish 
among more extreme Yeltsin opponents, who did not want to give up 
the commission (Segodnya, 23 February; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 
February). 
   How the Factions Voted 
   The compromise amnesty package passed 252 to 67 (with 28 
abstentions)--just 29 votes above the required majority--with the 
bulk of support coming from hard-line deputies.  According to an 
account by a Communist Party (CPRF) deputy published in 
Sovetskaya Rossiya (26 February), the CPRF, Agrarian Party, 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and the hard-line 
nationalist "Russian Way" group led by Sergey Baburin provided 
147 votes for the compromise amnesty package.  Some hardliners, 
however, including nine CPRF deputies and one each from the 
Agrarian Party and Russian Way, were so intent on retaining the 
Duma's investigative commission into the September-October crisis 
that they voted against the final compromise. 
   After a decree abolishing the investigative commission was added 
to the "large" package, enough centrists and moderate reformers 
joined in supporting the amnesty compromise to put it over the 
top.  Apparently at the urging of Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord (PRES) leader Sergey Shakhray, PRES and the Women of 
Russia faction, joined by at least some members of the centrist 
New Regional Policy group, made their support for the amnesty 
package contingent on the inclusion of a "Memorandum of Accord," 
essentially a political declaration calling for round table talks 
on economic and political issues and recommending amnesty as a 
step toward "national reconciliation" (Interfax, 23 February). 
Even with the inclusion of the Memorandum of Accord, however, 
this "small" amnesty package did not have enough support to pass. 
Only two PRES deputies voted for the "small" package.  When the 
decree abolishing the commission was added to the "large" 
compromise package, it gained the votes of 16 more PRES deputies 
(of 24 present to vote).  Similarly, 35 deputies from the New 
Regional Policy group voted for the "small" package, but an 
additional 12 members voted for the final compromise that 
abolished the commission.  Other centrist deputies voting for the 
final compromise included all 22 members from Women of Russia and 
all 14 deputies from the Nikolay Travkin's Democratic Party of 
Russia faction who were present to vote (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 
February). 
   The compromise package appears to have deepened divisions among 
reformers, pitting the pro-Yeltsin Russia's Choice faction 
against PRES and splitting the moderate reformist Yabloko bloc 
led by reform economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy.  Russia's Choice 
held together in its opposition to the political amnesty, with 
only one of its members--Ivan Starikov of Novosibirsk--willing to 
vote for the final compromise (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2 March). 
However, only 57 of its 75 members were present to vote.  Most of 
the Yavlinskiy bloc--16 of the 22 who were present at the vote- 
-either abstained or voted against both amnesty packages, but the 
other six took a strong anti-Yeltsin stand, voting only for the 
"small" package and against the final compromise (Sovetskaya 
Rossiya, 26 February).  Their position appears related to the 
stance voiced by some members of the bloc following the October 
rebellion. (See Note 1) 
   (Note 1)  During the election campaign, Vladimir Lukin, a 
coleader of the Yabloko bloc, advocated a full investigation into 
the events of 21 September-4 October, though lie acknowledged that 
extremists in the Supreme Soviet had "started this carnage" and 
had "brought about dozens of human casualties" (Literaturnaya 
Gazeta, No. 47, 24 November 1993).  Shortly after the election 
another bloc member, Valeriy Borshchev (of the Christian 
Democratic Union), expressed the bloc's intention to promote the 
establishment of a parliamentary commission to conduct the 
investigation (Segodnya, 23 December 1993).  Lukin's support for 
the commission evidently caused him, as well as other Yabloko 
deputies Viktor Sheynis and Nikolay Petrakov, to abstain from the 
vote for the final compromise package (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2 
March). 
   Background to the Amnesty Issue 
   Since convening, the Duma has debated two kinds of amnesty 
proposals, one a criminal amnesty aimed at minor offenders and 
the other a political amnesty for the 1991 coup plotters and 
participants in the 1993 Supreme Soviet uprising.  During the 
first week of the Duma's session, hard-line deputies made their 
first move toward securing a political amnesty for their 
political allies, but their failure to coordinate with the LDPR, 
which was pressing its own political amnesty proposal, caused the 
move to fail (ITAR-TASS, 17 January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 
January).  Yeltsin revived the amnesty issue when he submitted a 
proposal for a criminal amnesty "in connection with the adoption 
of" the constitution (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), continuing 
a Soviet-era tradition of declaring amnesties to mark major 
holidays and significant political milestones.  In retrospect, 
this move was doubly unfortunate for Yeltsin.  His proposal 
failed to attract support from reformers and gave hardliners 
another opportunity to raise the issue of a political amnesty. 
   -- On 17 January, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, a close associate of 
Rutskoy, proposed putting the political amnesty issue on the 
Duma's agenda, but the motion fell 18 votes short of a majority, 
reportedly because the LDPR did not back him (ITAR-TASS, 17 
January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 27 
January).  At the time, the LDPR was advocating an amnesty that 
would have freed anyone sentenced on "political or economic 
charges" after April 1985 and also would have released from jail 
Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other participants in the October 
uprising but placed them under house arrest (Interfax, 31 
December 1993; ITAR-TASS, 4 January). 
   -- Yeltsin's proposal, submitted shortly after he signed it on 21 
January, quickly ran into trouble.  The CPRF and Agrarian Party 
were unwilling to consider it because it did not amnesty their 
political allies, and the LDPR stood by its version.  Even 
Russia's Choice--the faction most likely to support the 
president--was unwilling to back the bill, apparently in an 
effort to erase public perceptions that it is soft on crime. 
Faction leader Yegor Gaydar stated that Russia's Choice could not 
support Yeltsin's initiative because "we are very doubtful about 
the provisions . . . which reduce punishments for serious 
criminal offenses" and pointedly drew attention to the "existing 
criminal situation in the country" (ITAR-TASS, 21 January, 7 
February).  In a further indication of trouble for Yeltsin, his 
proposal was assigned to the Committee for Legislation, Judicial, 
and Legal Reform, headed by Vladimir Isakov--a staunch Yeltsin 
foe from the Agrarian Party (ITAR-TASS, 24 January). 
   -- The amnesty issue was scheduled to come up for debate in the 
Duma's 4 February plenary session, but the Duma's Council 
postponed the debate, probably in recognition that none of the 
competing proposals would win a majority (Interfax, Segodnya, 3 
February).  According to the Duma's First Deputy Chairman Mikhail 
Mityukov (Russia's Choice), the Council postponed debate because 
"certain factions" wanted to "play the amnesty card for political 
purposes" (Izvestiya, 5  February).  By that time, Isakov's 
committee had drafted its own decree to amnesty the participants 
in the 1991 coup attempt and the October uprising (Segodnya, 4 
February). 
   -- By mid-February, elements of the final compromise began to 
emerge as the Duma agreed to examine both Yeltsin's criminal 
amnesty proposal and an apparently revised LDPR political amnesty 
proposal.  The Duma took no direct action on Yeltsin's criminal 
amnesty proposal during its 16 February debate, possibly because 
the debate made it clear that it lacked majority support 
(Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Kommersant-Daily, 17 February).  The Duma 
then decided to consider separately two draft decrees--Yeltsin's 
on a criminal amnesty and an LDPR proposal on an economic and 
political amnesty (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 16 February).  More 
ominously for Yeltsin, the PRES and Women of Russia factions 
offered conditional backing for the political amnesty, reportedly 
insisting on "circulating" a "clarification document" --evidently 
a reference to the Memorandum of Accord that the Duma later 
adopted in the final compromise package--making it clear that the 
factions supported the amnesty as a step toward "national 
reconciliation" and not simply for the sake of freeing Rutskoy 
and Khasbulatov (Segodnya, 16 February).  On 17 February the 
LDPR's political amnesty proposal fell 23 votes short of adoption 
and was sent back to committee for "improvement," this time going 
to the security committee, headed by Yeltsin foe Viktor Ilyukhin 
(CPRF), as well as to Isakov's legislation committee (Interfax, 
ITAR-TASS, 17 February). 
   Disarray in the Yeltsin Camp 
   The varied responses from Yeltsin's advisers to the Duma's 
passage of the amnesty suggest that the event caught them 
unprepared, even though the approval of the compromise package by 
the Duma's Council on 22 February should have given them some 
warning of its improved prospects. (See Note 2)  National 
Security Adviser Yuriy Baturin opted for a confrontational 
stance, arguing that the amnesty was unconstitutional because it 
was in fact a pardon, which is a presidential prerogative (ITAR- 
TASS, 24 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 February).  By 
contrast, Aleksandr M. Yakovlev, Yeltsin's official 
representative to the legislature, responded in sanguine fashion, 
contending that the amnesty was "completely in keeping with the 
constitution from a judicial point of view" (Russian TV, 24 
February).  Georgiy Satarov, a Yeltsin adviser on legislative 
relations, did not weigh in until two days after the vote, when 
he indicated that Yeltsin was preparing a "calm and businesslike 
letter" asking the Duma to reconsider its stance (Interfax, 
Moscow radio, Ostankino TV, 25 February). 
   (Note 2)  Much of the disarray in the Yeltsin camp may be 
attributed to the absence of presidential Administration Leader 
Sergey Filatov, who was apparently in Switzerland at the time 
(ITAR-TASS, 27 February).  Yakovlev, Satarov, and Baturin are all 
relatively new to the Yeltsin team, and their inexperience may 
have contributed to their uncoordinated response (For more on 
Yeltsin's advisers, see the Trends of 9 March 1994, pages 4-12). 
   Yeltsin himself responded too late to postpone or block 
implementation of the political amnesty.  On 26 February he sent 
a letter to Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, drawing upon Baturin's 
line of argument and reportedly asserting that the deputies had 
confused the constitutional principles of amnesty and pardon. 
The letter urged the Duma to "improve" the decree to bring it in 
line with the constitution.  Yeltsin also proposed that the Duma 
adopt a "system of criteria" defining the responsibility of state 
institutions and politicians "for decisions [that] hamper our 
joint policy towards national reconciliation, civil peace, and 
accord"--evidently an attempt to impress upon the Duma its 
accountability for the actions of individuals released under the 
amnesty (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  Satarov reportedly delivered 
Yeltsin's letter to Rybkin on the afternoon of 26 February, when 
Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other prisoners arrested after the 
October uprising were already walking out of Lefortovo prison 
(see box 2) (ITAR-TASS, 26 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 
Izvestiya, 1 March). 
   After the futile letter to Rybkin, Yeltsin appeared to waver 
between taking a confrontational approach and trying to defuse 
political tensions.  At first he was confrontational, with 
S,,atarov announcing on 28 February that Yeltsin was preparing 
certain actions aimed at defending the democratic state and 
society" (Russian TV, 28 February).  Satarov's comments and 
others by Baturin and presidential press secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov fueled speculation that Yeltsin would address the 
country that night in a special televised appeal (ITAR-TASS, 28 
February).  Nezavisimaya Gazeta's Ivan Rodin reported (2 March) 
that Yeltsin was to have announced on television an edict that, 
while not containing "any specific tough measures," nonetheless 
brandished a "menacing" tone.  Rodin also suggested, however, 
that threatening a tough presidential response may have been a 
deliberate tactic to bring pressure on Rybkin before a meeting 
held the same day between Yeltsin's advisers--including the newly 
returned Head of Administration Sergey Filatov--and Rybkin. 
Rybkin and Filatov reportedly discussed ways to improve 
"interaction" between the two branches, paving the way for 
Yeltsin to meet with Rybkin the following day (ITAR-TASS, 28 
February). 
   After his meeting with Rybkin, Yeltsin appears to have adopted a 
position of accepting the amnesty and placing the burden of 
responsibility for it--and for the actions of the released 
prisoners--squarely on the Duma.  At their 1 March meeting, 
Rybkin reportedly promised Yeltsin that the Duma would "ensure a 
more balanced approach" when adopting decrees likely to have 
"serious political and moral consequences" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). 
Yeltsin apparently also extracted a pledge from Rybkin that he 
would urge the Duma "probably in the near future" to adopt a 
memorandum on the "responsibility of state institutions and 
politicians for preserving civic calm in Russia" (Moscow radio, 1 
March).  In return, Yeltsin assured Rybkin that he had opted 
against "immediate tough measures," but he warned that he would 
not tolerate misbehavior by his amnestied foes, saying: "Should 
the slightest attempt be made at destabilizing the situation in 
the country, [the amnestied prisoners] will be arrested straight 
after" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). 
   As a result of the initial confused reaction by his advisers and 
the conflicting signals about his course of action, Yeltsin 
appears to have lost political stature in the aftermath of the 
amnesty vote.  His acceptance of the amnesty conflicts with his 
repeated assertions--most recently stated at the 4 March 
Government meeting--that the Duma's amnesty is unconstitutional 
(Moscow radio, 4 March).  In an effort to counter press accounts 
of executive disarray (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Izvestiya, 1 March) as 
well as criticism of his handling of the amnesty by Russia's 
Choice members (Izvestiya, 3 March), Yeltsin apparently saw the 
need to verbally assert his presidential authority after meeting 
with Rybkin: "I . . . am in full control of the social and 
political situation" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). 
   Implications 
   The Duma's successful passage of a political amnesty suggests 
that Yeltsin and his team of advisers have learned little since 
the confrontation with the old Supreme Soviet about how to manage 
relations with the legislative branch, much less to effectively 
advance a presidential agenda.  By contrast, the Duma has again 
demonstrated its ability to compromise effectively on issues it 
considers important, with the Duma Council apparently playing a 
key role.  By postponing debate when it recognized that the Duma 
lacked consensus on the issue and brokering the final key 
compromise, the Duma's leadership demonstrated a knack for 
managing the legislative process.  Rybkin personally appears to 
have emerged from the amnesty vote with enhanced political 
stature.  His meetings with Filatov and Yeltsin and pledges to 
improve legislative-executive coordination suggest the makings of 
an effective political player, at least for as long as his 
Communist-Agrarian colleagues are willing to back such 
conciliatory politics and allow Rybkin to deliver on his pledges. 
   Box 1 
                 The "Large" Compromise Package 
   Resorting to the kind of package compromise that has worked for 
the Duma in the past,* deputies voted on a total of five 
documents, all of which came into effect after their publication 
in Rossiyskaya Gazeta on 26 February.  The decree overturning the 
Duma's investigative commission into the October crisis was not 
included in an earlier "small" package that failed to pass: 
   -- "On Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of 
the Russian Federation Constitution."  This decree, based largely 
on the draft amnesty bill that Yeltsin submitted to parliament 
(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), amnesties criminals convicted 
of minor offenses as well as certain groups of offenders, such as 
women and invalids.  According to Minister of Internal Affairs 
Viktor Yerin, the criminal amnesty affects "less than 10 percent" 
of convicted criminals, and another MVD general put the number at 
about 20,000 (Argumenty i Fakty No. 6, February; Pravda, 26 
February). 
   -- Decree outlining the procedures for implementing the above 
decree. 
   -- "On Declaring a Political and Economic Amnesty."  This 
document--the one opposed most bitterly by Yeltsin supporters- 
-specifically terminates legal proceedings against the 1991 coup 
plotters and hardliners arrested after the violent 1 May 
demonstrations in Moscow and the October 1993 Supreme Soviet 
uprising and stipulates that their release from prison take place 
"immediately."  In an apparent effort to gain the support of some 
reformers and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), it 
also amnesties criminals sentenced for various Soviet-era 
economic crimes. 
   -- "On the Adoption of the Memorandum of Accord."  This decree 
formally approves the "Memorandum of Accord" put forward by PRES, 
the Women of Russia, and the New Regional Policy factions calling 
upon the legislative and executive branches to consider "jointly" 
problems presented by "political, economic, and social reforms in 
society" and urging authorities to wage their "political struggle 
within a legal framework."  The memorandum also suggested that a 
political amnesty could serve as an "integral part" of the 
process toward "national accord."  Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has 
repeatedly called this memorandum the most important document of 
the package (Pravda, 1 March; Komsomolskaya Pravda, 2 March). 
      "On Overturning a Decree of the State Duma."  This decree 
reportedly over turns the 9 February decision of the Duma to set 
up a commission to investigate the events of 21 September-4 
October, although its wording is somewhat ambiguous.  It annuls a 
16 February decree on the "composition" of the commission, 
leaving open the possibility that the commission has not formally 
been disbanded. 
   *See the Trends of 9 February 1994, pages 15-25. 
   End Box 1 
   Box 2 
            Prosecutor Protests Yeltsin Pressure on Amnesty 
   Judging by comments made after the prisoners' release, both the 
Yeltsin team and Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin were counting on 
Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik to block or delay 
implementation of the amnesty.  Kazannik's office reportedly made 
an "inquiry" to the Duma about certain provisions in the amnesty, 
and Rybkin indicated in his meeting with Satarov on 26 February 
that the Duma's legislation and security committees were 
responding to the inquiry and that no prisoners would be released 
until the questions were cleared up (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  At 
a meeting of parliamentary officials on 28 February, Rybkin 
charged that the prosecutor's office acted on the amnesty with 
undue haste" and without waiting for a response to its questions 
(Interfax, Radio Rossii, 28 February).  He later appeared to 
change his story somewhat--possibly in an attempt to deflect 
blame from the security and legislation committees--when he 
contended that the committees had "clarified every point" of 
Kazannik's inquiry by 26 February (Pravda, 1 March). 
   Yeltsin reportedly tried to pressure Kazannik to delay 
implementing the amnesty, but Kazannik, while declaring his 
distaste for the amnesty, said that he had no legal authority to 
block it and resigned rather than submit to Yeltsin's pressure. 
Kazannik had implicitly warned Yeltsin that he would not bow to 
political pressures over the amnesty issue when he stated that 
his office does not give "political assessments" to various laws 
but only ensures their "lawfulness and strict fulfillment" (ITAR- 
TASS, 24 February).  In his resignation statement, Kazannik 
charged that Yeltsin had appealed to him to "suspend" the amnesty 
process, and though he indicated that he personally agreed with 
the "civic attitude" of Yeltsin's appeal, he made clear his 
professional and political independence: "The prosecutor in 
Russia does not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act 
[or] to appeal to the State Duma for a resolution to be 
reconsidered" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  Despite his refusal to 
delay implementing the amnesty, Kazannik appears to harbor no 
sympathy for the amnestied prisoners, asserting in his 
resignation statement that he considered the Duma's vote for 
political amnesty a "black page in the history of Russian 
parliamentarianism" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February). 
   * Kazannik has now changed his mind about resigning and has 
indicated that he will ask the Federation Council, which has the 
constitutional authority to confirm the appointment and dismissal

appears intent on securing Kazannik's resignation.  On 14 March 
he issued a decree affirming his acceptance of Kazannik's 
resignation and arguing that because Kazannik was appointed by

Continuing     earlier signs that Beijing would reward France for its 
accommodating stance on Taiwan arms sales by expanding Sino- 
French aviation cooperation, Beijing has recently announced 
contracts with the French-based European consortium Airbus 
Industrie (Xinhua, 4,6 March).  According to a Xinhua report of 6 
March, Airbus has reached an agreement worth "tens of millions of 
U.S. dollars" with China Aviation Supplies Corporation for 
production of aircraft parts in a move that reportedly will 
"increase Airbus' share in the potentially huge China market." 
Xinhua also reported on 4 March that Chinese airlines have 
recently announced plans to purchase nine aircraft from Airbus 
(Xinhua, March 4).  Following the restoration of bilateral ties 
in January, and a French pledge to reverse France's previous 
policy of selling arms to Taiwan, China awarded a major subway 
contract to a French firm.  Beijing had previously shunned French 
companies to protest a November 1992 French decision to sell 
Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan.

SUMMARY 
                                           While seeking to wrest as many concessions as possible from 
Israel and the United States in the aftermath of the Hebron 
massacre, PLO leaders also appear to be maintaining a degree of 
flexibility in their position on terms for resuming peace 
negotiations with Israel.  In addition, PLO statements aimed at 
Palestinian audiences appear to be preparing popular opinion for 
a compromise. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   Following meetings in Tunis between Palestinian leaders and 
delegations from Israel and the United States, PLO Executive 
Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh reiterated PLO demands that 
Israel must take action against Jewish settlers in the occupied 
territories before the PLO will agree to resume negotiations. 
Meetings with U.S. officials, he told an interviewer, "have not 
achieved progress," and he complained that Washington is seeking 
to link issuance of a Security Council resolution on the Hebron 
massacre to PLO acceptance of a date for resumption of 
negotiations.  A Security Council resolution, 'Abd-Rabbuh argued, 
would be effective only "if it ensures practical steps . . . to 
guarantee international protection for the Palestinian people" 
and should not be "a bargaining card to resume talks."  More 
specifically, he called for "ending the settlers' presence in the 
heart of Hebron" and other areas constituting "hotbeds of tension 
and explosion," "tackling the issue of the presence of armed 
settlers . . . in Palestinian towns and villages," and "providing 
international protection, especially in Hebron" (Radio Monte 
Carlo, 15 March). 
   Other recent statements by mainstream PLO leaders and media have 
also stressed that Israel must act against settlers and that 
security for Palestinians in the territories must be ensured, but 
the statements appear to have been carefully crafted to avoid 
taking any uncompromising positions that might threaten 
resumption of negotiations.  For example: 
   --PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat branded Jewish settlements in Hebron 
as "illegal" in an interview with a French newspaper but said 
that he is "not asking for them to be destroyed, but moved."  He 
also repeated his call for an "international presence" in the 
territories to ensure Palestinian security, but appeared careful 
to couch the demand in terms designed not to offend Israel.  Such 
an international presence, he said, would be consistent with the 
provisions of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP)--a 
condition laid down by Israeli leaders.  In addition, 'Arafat 
suggested an armed international force only when questioned 
explicitly on the subject, asking rhetorically "who will protect 
this international force?  The armed Jewish settlers?" and 
answering that the observers must "protect themselves." 
Similarly cautious on U.S. policy, 'Arafat complained that the 
United States is blocking inclusion of any reference to Jerusalem 
in the UN Security Council resolution currently under discussion 
but was circumspect overall in commenting on U.S. policy.  "We 
must . . . wait until the whole U.S. reaction is revealed at all 
levels and not just in the Security Council," he said, and he 
asked rhetorically whether the United States will "be up to the 
responsibilities which it has shouldered since the signing of 
this DOP."  He also demanded that Israel complete withdrawal from 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho by 12 April in keeping with the DOP, 
but when asked what he would do if the deadline was not met, he 
answered only "that would mean that the Israeli Government had 
decided not to respect our agreements" (Paris Le Figaro, Il 
March). 
   --Commenting on Israel's decision to ban extremist settler 
organizations, PLO official Ahmad Quray', a key figure in 
negotiating the DOP, described the Israeli action as "a good step 
in the right direction" but "not enough."  There must be, he 
added, "a more substantial solution" specifying that "measures 
must be taken around the Ibrahimi Mosque [sight of the Hebron 
massacre] and the locations of settlers" (Ool Yisra'el, 13 
March). 
   --A PLO radio commentary excoriated the United States for 
allegedly blocking a Security Council resolution on the Hebron 
massacre, but avoided any explicit threats or demands.  The 
United States, the radio charged, is "resisting this desire for 
justice by the international community" and displaying its 
"support for, bias toward, and collusion with Israel; that is, in 
favor of terrorism, crime, and massacre."  Washington's "strange 
and abnormal logic," the commentary added, "runs counter to 
justice and history" and "destroys the foundations of the peace 
process," to the detriment not only of Palestinians but of "all 
parties, including Israel and the protector of its terrorism, the 
United States" (Voice of Palestine [VOP] in Yemen, 13 March). 
   Preparing Palestinian Opinion for a Deal 
   Two recent commentaries in PLO media addressed to Palestinian 
audiences strongly suggest that the PLO leadership, mindful of 
popular Palestinian anger following the Hebron massacre, is 
attempting gradually to prepare Palestinian opinion to accept an 
eventual compromise formula on resuming formal peace negotiations 
with Israel. 
   --A VOP commentary said that 'Arafat "is under strong pressure to 
leave the peace talks" but argued that the peace process must 
continue.  Palestinians, the commentary said, are seeking "a more 
effective U.S. role" following the massacre, but it warned that 
"there are limits to what the Clinton administration can do in 
its dealing with the Yitzhaq Rabin government" and that "the PLO 
should be satisfied with achieving limited gains."  "What will 
eventually be required," VOP argued, "is to effect a balance 
between the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators."  Although 
Palestinian gains may initially be limited, the commentary 
concluded, "unquestionably the decision to go ahead with the 
negotiations will achieve more significant gains in the future"- 
-a conclusion it justified by noting that "for the first time, 
the . . . issue of settlements . . . is being raised inside the 
Israeli Government itself" (10 March). 
   --An article appearing in the PLO's weekly news magazine 
acknowledged that the PLO's demand for a Security Council 
resolution "condemning the massacre, calling for an international 
presence in the occupied territories . . . and indicating that 
Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories as a condition for 
resuming bilateral talks with Israel" could result in "some sort 
of confrontation with the United States."  Nonetheless, the 
article continued, the PLO "realizes that the United States has a 
genuine interest in resuming the negotiations as soon as 
possible," along with other members of the international 
community.  Moreover, the article argued, "Israel's position is 
weak," thus giving the PLO a chance for "better political gains 
than previously offered to it."  Under these circumstances, the 
article concluded, "it is inevitable that the PLO return to the 
negotiating table."  The PLO, it explained, "is not in the 
business of revenge governed by instant angry reactions, but is 
seeking a political achievement that may return things to the 
right track and make up for our loss in the negotiations [on the 
DOP] in Davos and Cairo" (Filistin Al-Thawrah, 13 March). 
   Implications 
   PLO leaders clearly see an opportunity following the Hebron 
massacre to extract concessions on some issues, most notably 
settlements, on which they deferred to Israeli demands during 
negotiations leading to the DOP.  Moreover, they are undoubtedly 
also concerned that they must be seen to have made significant 
political gains before returning to negotiations in order to 
satisfy angry and skeptical Palestinians in the territories. 
'Arafat has almost certainly decided that he must eventually 
continue negotiations on the DOP, but judging by his conduct of 
the talks leading to the Cairo agreement in February, he will 
seek to prolong the current diplomatic maneuvering until he is 
convinced he can make no further gains.

   Aerospace 

   (China) Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute 
of Semiconductors in Beijing have developed an aluminum gallium 
arsenide/gallium arsenide heterojunction solar cell fabricated with 
a multiwafer extrusion-boat liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) technique. Up 
to 20 epitaxial wafers can be grown per cycle, compared with one 
wafer per cycle with traditional LPE graphite-boat techniques. Full- 
surface conversion efficiencies for the two best samples were 18.78 
percent and 17.33 percent.  The new LPE technique is applicable to 
the fabrication of solar cells, especially for space vehicle power 
sources, as well as the manufacture of light-emitting and other 
optoelectronic devices. (ZHONGGUO KEXUE BAO 24 Nov 93)* Thomas T. 
733-6342 

   (China) The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Space Sciences Applied 
Research Center has developed a 275-kilogram balloon microgravity 
experimental system under the state's 863 program. The system, which 
is like those already developed by Japan and Germany, simulates the 
microgravity environment in space by dropping a capsule from a 
balloon at an altitude of 35 kilometers in order to maintain a 
microgravity environment of 10(exp)-4 g to 10(exp)-2 g in free-fall 
for 31 seconds.  In the initial test, which analyzed the 
characteristics of dust explosion, all on-board instruments 
functioned well and capsule recovery was successful.  Researchers 
plan to conduct experiments in the areas of materials, life 
sciences, fluid dynamics, and fuels, as well as on various 
experimental payloads for satellites and airships. (ZHONGGUO KEXUE

      (Italy) The European Space Agency (ESA) has assigned the 
development of a robot control system for aerospace applications to 
an industrial team led by the European space automation and robotic 
company Tecnospazio. The project is based on an industrial control 
system developed by Comau (Fiat group) and will be integrated into 
the Columbus Automation Testbed (CAT) delivered to ESA in 1992.

   (South Korea/Russia) Daewoo Heavy Industry will open an aviation 
technology research center near Moscow on 30 March. Daewoo plans to 
improve upon the design for Russia's 28-passenger helicopters--the 
MI-8 and the MI-17--and to develop the next-generation transport and 
5-ton class multipurpose helicopters.  The company plans to use 
Russia's aviation technology for its own helicopter design, engine 
manufacturing, and maintenance technologies to produce ready-for- 
market helicopter products. (MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 8 Jan 94) William

   Battery Technology 

   (China) Researchers at the Institute of New Energy Materials 
Chemistry at Nankai University in Tianjin have developed a high- 
performance AA-size sealed nickel metal hydride battery. Its key 
performance indicators include a nominal capacity that exceeds 1,000 
milliampere-hours; a 5-ampere discharge-to-0.8-volt average capacity 
that exceeds 950 milliampere-hours (95 percent of rated capacity); a 
low-temperature (-18 degrees C) 2-ampere discharge-to-1.0-volt 
average capacity of 835 milliampere-hours (83 percent of rated 
capacity); a seven-day self-discharge of 15 percent and a 28-day 
self-discharge of 29 percent; and a lifetime of more than 500 
cycles, based on a 1.75-hour 400-milliampere-charge/1.25-hour 400- 
milliampere-discharge test.  The researchers have completed batch 
trial production and have built an intermediate testing site with a 
single-shift annual output of 500,000 units. (GAO JISHU TONGXUN Dec

   Biotechnology 

   (Japan) Under the guidance of the Biochemistry Department at the 
Cancer Institute of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 
Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company is conducting human genome research 
with the intent of cloning genes associated with disease. The 
company established the Tokushima Research Center within its 
Diagnostic Medicine Division in May 1993 both to do the research and 
to develop commercial applications for human genome analysis. 
Following the installation of eight DNA sequencers at the Tokushima 
center,  Otsuka Pharmaceutical succeeded in cloning a partial 
sequence of DNA that is complementary to messenger RNA extracted 
from fetal brain tissue.  The company is establishing a library of 
these cloned complementary DNA fragments, which have been linked to 
disease. Otsuka researchers, who began complete sequencing of newly 
discovered genes this year, plan to examine the role of the cloned 
complementary DNA fragments in the expression of genes associated 
with disease.  Otsuka Pharmaceutical ultimately hopes to develop 
diagnostic and therapeutic drugs using the results of its research 
on DNA sequencing and gene expression. (NIKKEI BIOTECHNOLOGY 17 Jan

   Computers 

   (France) A group of researchers led by Nobel Laureate Jean-Marie 
Lehn at the College De France in Paris has developed an optical 
switch consisting of a thiophene molecule. When hit with ultraviolet 
light the molecule "closes" and allows electrons to pass through; 
when hit with infrared light it "opens" and blocks the flow of 
electrons. This molecular "switch" could have applications in the 
development of optical molecular computers. (ANSASERVICE 29 Dec 93) 
Wendy P. (Brussels Bureau)/Renee McG. 733-6339 
   (China) Engineers at the China Aerospace Corporation's (CASC's) 
Third Academy and at Harbin Institute of Technology have jointly 
developed the nation's first advanced supercomputer real-time three- 
dimensional computer image generation (CIG) system.  With a peak 
speed of 300 million operations per second (MOPS), the system can 
process 80 million pixels per second or generate 200,000 triangles 
per second.  It can also generate in real time lifelike three- 
dimensional images from a variety of observation points and with up 
to 16 million color varieties.  China's CIG system will have 
applications in astronaut and flight training, and in missile 
development.  (RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION 15 Dec 93)* 
Thomas T. 733-6342 

   (China) The State Science and Technology Commission announced in 
December 1993 that China's first computer software state engineering 
research center (SERC) will be established in Shenyang to engage in 
multimedia software R&amp;D and marketing. The facility will grow out of 

the Northeast University Software Center, which produced 30 million 
yuan ($3.45 million) worth of software in 1993.  In a separate 
development, ground was broken for the Southern Software Industrial 
Park in Zhuhai on 29 November 1993.  Funding and construction for 
this Key State Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) Project are the joint 
responsibility of the Ministry of Electronics Industry and the 
Zhuhai Municipal Government. Investment for the 320,000-square-meter 
park totals almost 300 million yuan ($34.5 million). When first- 
phase construction is complete in two years, 15 to 20 firms with 
1,500 engineers and managers are expected to establish facilities 
there. Annual sales are projected at 400 million yuan ($46 million), 
with 70 percent of the products to be exported, realizing annual 
export revenues of 250 million yuan ($29 million). (KEJI RIBAO 18

   (Japan) An Aizu University research group that includes 20 
software specialists from the former Soviet Union is developing the 
world's fastest massively parallel supercomputer.  In Japan, where 
very few manufacturers have succeeded in developing massively 
parallel computer technology, this reportedly is the first time a 
university has pursued R&amp;D in this area without outside 
participation or support. The university plans to make all developed 
technology available to other research organizations. (TOKYO SHIMBUN

   Environment 

   (Russia) The Astrofizika Scientific Production Association is 
seeking financing for a project to market a military gas detection 
device converted for environmental monitoring. The self-propelled 
mobile unit, which was developed for remote rapid detection of the 
most toxic neuroparalytic gases, scans 25 square kilometers per 
minute using a lidar laser locator.  Astrofizika has created a 
database containing several hundred thousand spectra for detecting 
various environmental pollutants.  The Russian scientists claim a 
truck-mounted version of the environmental monitoring device can 
detect toxic industrial emissions, and a helicopter-transported unit 
can detect oil and gas pipeline leaks.  The Russian Federation 
Ministry of Science and Technology Policy has promised subsidies for 
the project, but Moscow reportedly has not yet provided any funds.

   (Japan) Hosokawa Micron has a contract for nearly 1 billion yen 
($9.5 million) to deliver exhaust gas reprocessing equipment to a 
Russian aluminum refinery by the end of 1994. Hosokawa Micron's 
affiliate in Germany developed the system, which recycles fluorine 
waste generated in the electrolysis of aluminum oxide. The equipment 
previously had been exported to Canada and Europe, but this is the 
first such equipment to be used in Russia. Hosokawa Micron has also 
received an order from Russia amounting to about 500 million yen 
($4.76 million) for equipment to recycle telephone and electrical 
power cables. The recycling equipment can break cables down into 
vinyl, copper, and aluminum and recycle the metals.  The first 
shipment of the equipment, which was developed by a German company 
now owned by Hosokawa  Micron, was to be in January 1994. (NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 Dec 93) Junko A. 733-6346 

   (Japan) Kobe Steel,  Ltd. is testing and hopes to market a 300- 
kilowatt plasma fusion plant that detoxifies low-level radioactive 
waste generated in nuclear power plants.  The company has already 
delivered a small plasma fusion pilot plant (under 100 kilowatts per 
hour fusion capacity) to the Central Research Institute of the 
Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI).  Originally developed to treat ash 
from incinerated urban refuse,  plasma fusion technology reduces the 
volume of waste to one-fifth and the amount of exhaust gas to less 
than one-thirtieth that produced by combustion.  The compact, 
cylinder-shaped plasma fusion furnace continuously supplies ash and 
generates ingots, resulting in a low concentration of nitrogen oxide 
in the exhaust gas.  The furnace's plasma torch provides highly 
efficient heating as well as a choice between transfer-type and non- 
transfer-type plasma generation.  Various non-flammables such as 
metals and concrete can be processed simultaneously, and continuous 
processing allows the handling of large amounts of material. Plasma- 
fused materials are buried in concrete shields, and exhaust gas is 
treated with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and 
ceramic filters. (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 13 Dec 93) Junko A. 733-6346 

   Industrial Technology 

   (Russia/Uzbekistan) Moscow State University researchers have 
demonstrated the feasibility of using alternating nonuniform 
electromagnetic field energy to accelerate the enzymatic hydrolysis 
of cellulose for the commercial production of methane, food, and 
animal feed.  The researchers added ferromagnetic particles to a 
mixture of cellulose and cellulolytic enzymes from the fungus 
Trichoderma reesei and excited the particles with an electromagnetic 
field. This agitation increased the speed of hydrolysis by as much 
as nine times and resulted in a higher concentration of glucose and 
cellobiose hydrolysis products in one to two hours than did the two- 
day control experiments.  In a related development, the Scientific 
Research Institute for Chemical Technologies in Tashkent has 
developed a clean technology for making cellulose from rice straw. 
The process produces 0.5 ton of cellulose from 1 ton of straw, while 
reducing water consumption by nearly 90 percent. (DOKLADY AKADEMII

   Lasers 

   (Japan) Mitsubishi Electric Corporation has developed a 24-watt 
green light laser with twice the power of other Japanese green light 
lasers. It is part of a solid-state laser system that also includes 
an yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser and a potassium titanate 
phosphate crystal element that converts the 1,064-nanometer- 
wavelength infrared (IR) YAG laser light to green laser light with a 
wavelength of 532 nanometers and 24 watts of power. Previous 
attempts by Japanese researchers to achieve conversion to such a 
high output level failed because the strong IR radiation caused 
crystal damage. Mitsubishi claims to have solved this problem by 
lengthening the wavelength conversion element, increasing the YAG 
laser beam's spot size, and finding the optimal phase matching for 
the adjoining parts of crystals that form the long wavelength 
conversion element.  Commercial applications for this green light 
laser include compact disc recording.  (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 24 Nov

   (Japan) Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has developed a 
surface-emission laser optoelectronic integrated circuit system that 
operates at optical switching speeds of up to 10 gigahertz, ten 
times the speed of conventional systems of this type. The new system 
uses 64 unique surface-emission lasers arrayed in a 480-micron 
square cell. All of the lasers operate at a wavelength of 0.98 
nanometer and have built-in driver transistors. The company expects 
this "transistor-on-laser" system to serve as a basic technology in 
the development of ultrafast  high-volume optical communications and 
optical computers. (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 8 Dec 93)* John H. 733-6341 

   Microelectronics 

   (France) SGS-Thomson has developed a fuzzy logic microprocessor, 
based on 0.7-micron complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 
technology. The Weight Associative Rule Processor (WARP) 
microprocessor integrates over 400,000  transistors on an 88-square- 
millimeter chip and can process 10 million inferences per second 
with 40 megahertz clockspeed.  This is a complete fuzzy processor 
that includes "fuzzification," processing of inferences, and 
"defuzzification."  According to the director of SGS-Thomson's 
Advanced Systems Architectures Group, the WARP microprocessor is 
capable of evaluating 32 rules with 5 inputs and one output in less 
than 1.85 microseconds.  (For previous reporting on the WARP 
microprocessor, see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 2, 29 Jan 93.)

   (China) Qinghua University scientists, in collaboration with 
colleagues from four other domestic research organizations, have 
developed China's first semiconductor-laser-pumped erbium-doped 
fiber-optic amplifier.  Pumped by both 980-and 1,480-nanometer- 
wavelength laser diodes, the amplifier has measured optical gains of 
28 decibels and 25 decibels, respectively; maximum saturated output 
power measures 6.3 milliwatts at both wavelengths; and frequency 
bandwidth measures 26 nanometers and 40 nanometers, respectively.

Vice President Yan Yixun and Japan's National Space Development 
Agency (NASDA) Director Masato Yamano signed a bilateral agreement 
in Tokyo that will allow China to receive and distribute data from 
Japan's Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1). According to the

   Telecommunications 

   (Japan) Hitachi has developed five radio-frequency power modules 
for use in portable telephones.  The new modules result in an 
improvement of 10 percent or more in operating efficiency and allow 
a 20-percent increase in communication time compared with previous 
types.  Sample shipments of the modules, which are made using 
submicron metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) 
technology, will begin in 1994. Hitachi, which is aiming to increase 
its share of foreign markets, will supply analog 6-and 4.8-volt 
units to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in North America 
and Europe. (DEMPA SHIMBUN 20 Dec 93) Steve Z. 733-6340

locations throughout Japan, including the company's headquarters in 
Osaka, laboratories, plants, and offices. Local area networks (LANs) 
are being established at 17 of the locations using integrated 
services digital networks (ISDN) and other systems.  Larger 
facilities are using 10-million-bit-per-second Ethernet LANs within 
offices and high-capacity fiber-optic communications between 
buildings. Sharp is using its own independent and ISDN circuits to 
connect the LANs. The company is investing more than 1 billion yen 
($9.5 million) in the new network, with which Sharp expects to 
quintuple its communications efficiency.  (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 21

   FRANCE/ITALY: SMALL SATELLITE LAUNCHER PROPOSED 

   Key Points: Following two years of joint studies, France's 
National Center for Space Studies and the Italian Space Agency have 
proposed a four-stage launcher capable of placing satellites 
weighing 1 ton into low-Earth orbit. 

   Topic Sentence:  The European Small Launcher proposed by the 
French and Italian space agencies would deliver 1-ton payloads to 
low-Earth orbit. 

   Following two years of study, France's National Center for Space 
Studies (CNES) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) have jointly 
proposed a four-stage launcher capable of placing satellites 
weighing up to 1 ton into low-Earth orbit, according to a recent 
article in AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION INTERNATIONAL (20 Dec 93-2 Jan 94). 

CNES and ASI expect the European Small Launcher (ESL) to fill a need 
they believe will exist by the year 2000 for a small launcher 
offering maximum reliability at minimum cost and capable of two to 
10 launches a year. The  ESL would also allow Europe to compete in 
this market with Lockheed's LLV minilauncher, due to enter service 
in late 1994.  CNES  estimates the ESL could launch 1 ton to an 
altitude of 700 kilometers for $20 million, which approximates the 
cost of a comparable launch using the LLV. CNES further estimates 
the total development cost for the ESL at 1.8 billion francs ($310 
million) over four and a half years. 

   COVER GRAPHIC: Color illustration of European Small Launcher 

   Although the European Space Agency (ESA) recently began a market 
study for a mini launcher, CNES and ASI believe an ESA-sponsored 
mini launcher is neither politically nor financially feasible, and 
that it will therefore be up to France and Italy to build and 
finance the project, with contributions from European industry. 
Participating companies include Aerospatiale and SEP (France), BPD 
(Italy),  DASA (Germany), Contraves (Switzerland), and SABCA 
(Belgium).  (For previous reporting on Aerospatiale's plans to 
compete in the minilauncher market, see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 8, 
31 Aug 93 and Vol. 8 No. 12, 30 Dec 93.) 

   CNES and ASI believe the ESL will meet the need for several 
launches per year of clusters of 200-to 700-kilogram commercial 
telecommunications satellites (such as the Iridium and Globalstar 
systems), to be placed in low-Earth orbit at inclinations of 60 to 
90 degrees; one or more 500-kilogram Earth observation satellites to 
be placed in sun-synchronous orbit at 800 kilometers; at least one 
200-to 500-kilogram scientific satellite (such as Sweden's Viking 
and Freja);  and military telecommunications or reconnaissance 
satellites. The ESL will be capable of launching a minimum payload 
of 100 kilograms to any orbit, up to 600 kilograms to a 1,400- 
kilometer orbit, or 1,000 kilograms to a 700-kilometer orbit. With a 
cylindrical volume of 4.8  meters x 2.2 meters, the launcher's 
maximum payload will be 1.4 to 1.5  tons.  The ESL will attain a 
maximum altitude of 5,000 kilometers. Launch reliability is expected 
to be 99 percent and the accuracy of payload insertion into orbit 
will be 4 kilometers on the semimajor axis and 0.01 degree in 
inclination. The single or dual payload will be accommodated in a 
fairing measuring 4.8 meters long with a maximum diameter of 2.2 
meters. Acceleration will be 7 g. 

   Because CNES believes a low development cost for the launch 
vehicle is critical, the ESL's design incorporates as many existing 
components as possible. The launcher, which measures 25 meters long 
by 2.6 meters in diameter and weighs 121 tons, was built with 
technology developed for the Ariane 5.  Its first three stages use 
Ariane 5's hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) solid propellant. 
The launcher's first two stages are identical in size but have 
nozzles adapted for functioning on the ground  (P50 A) or in space 
(P50 B). These first two stages each carries 51.2 tons of HTPB in a 
lightweight carbon-fiber wound casing made using the same technology 
as that used for France's M5 ballistic missile; thrust for these 
stages measures 173 and 190 tons, respectively. The third stage, P7, 
carries 7.2 tons of HTPB in a carbon-fiber casing measuring 2.3 
meters in diameter and has a 23-ton thrust. The fourth stage is a 
liquid-fuel terminal-propulsion module (LM)  housed in the equipment 
bay, which measures 2.6  meters.  This stage provides roll and 
attitude control, final trajectory correction, and orbit 
circularization. It carries 260 kilograms of hydrazine and its six 
nozzles provide 400 newtons of thrust. 

   As an alternative to the P7 solid-fuel third stage, DASA has been 
studying a liquid-fuel third stage (L5) carrying 5 tons of 
unsymmetrical dimethyl-hydrazine (N(sub)20(sub)4/UDMH).  It uses the 
Aestus engine, which is derived from the Ariane 5's L9.7 third stage 
and has a thrust of 27.5  kilonewtons.  Because it would require a 
200-kilogram reduction in payload capacity, DASA's alternative 
probably will not be used, according to AIR &amp; COSMOS. CNES estimates 

the ESL can be built in four and a half years, and hopes to get 
final approval by 1995 in order to begin construction in early 1995 
and begin flying in mid-1999.  ANSASERVICE (12 Jan 94) reports that 
the project's definition phase is to be completed by June 1994. 
Initial plans are for two launches per year from the Ariane 5 launch 
platform in Kourou, French Guiana,  with expectations of increasing 
the number to between five and ten launches per year.

   SOUTH KOREA: 1994 S&amp;T BUDGET, 1993 S&amp;T ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

   Key Points:  The South Korean Government's 1994 S&amp;T budget of 
nearly 2 trillion won ($2.5 billion) is the country's largest to 
date, representing 2.2 percent of the national budget and a 32.7- 
percent increase over last year. Figures on the 1994 distribution of 
funds among the ministries, and within the Ministry of Science and 
Technology (MOST), are provided along with a summary of that 
ministry's key accomplishments in 1993. 

   Topic Sentence:  The largest share of the nearly 2-trillion-won 
1994 S&amp;T budget is allocated for R&amp;D. 

   South Korea's 1994 science and technology budget--defined as 
"direct support" to agencies of the central government for S&amp;T- 
related activities--has been set at 1.9596 trillion won ($2.45 
billion), according to a report in the 5 January CHUGAN MAEGYONG. 
The amount, which includes  R&amp;D,  S&amp;T promotion, and administrative 

budgets, is 32.7 percent higher than the reported 1993 S&amp;T budget of 

1.4767 trillion won  ($1.846  billion). Government S&amp;T expenditures, 

which make up 20 percent of the  total funds spent by South Korea on 
science and technology, account for 2.2 percent of the 1994 national 
budget, compared to 4.7 percent in the United States and 2.9 percent 
in Japan, according to the report. 

   The largest share of the new S&amp;T budget, some 1.5132 trillion won 

($1.892 billion), is allotted to R&amp;D,  representing a 30-percent 
increase over 1993. Specific R&amp;D categories to be funded include: 
state-funded research expenses 712.2 billion won ($890 million), up 
20 percent; R&amp;D subsidies 252.1 billion won ($315 million), up 54 
percent; and "testing and research expenses for national testing and 
research agencies" 243.3 billion won ($304 million), up 17 percent. 
The largest overall increase of 240 percent will go to the Ministry 
of Education, followed by the Environmental Agency with a 65.8- 
percent increase, and the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy 
whose budget will grow by 49 percent (CHUGAN MAEGYONG). 

   S&amp;T budgets within the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), 

funded by public and private sources, are shown in the following

   MKS further reports that in late 1993 MOST decided that beginning 
in March 1994, its institutes will specialize in particular 
technologies. For example, KIST will focus on three-dimensional 
image media technology, "human robot systems," and advanced medical 
treatments. 

   MOST's key technological successes of 1993, published in the 29 
December CHUGAN MAEGYONG include:

   SOUTH KOREA: INDUSTRY PLANNING MAJOR DRIVE INTO LCD MARKET 

   Key Points:  South Korea's large electronics firms are investing 
heavily in technology and equipment for liquid crystal displays in 
an effort to make South Korea more competitive with Japan. The South 
Korean Government expects patent friction to arise as the product 
line expands. 

   Topic Sentence:  Hyundai is developing advanced liquid crystal 
display products through its US subsidiary, while Samsung benefits 
from a joint technology agreement with a Japanese firm. 

   South Korean electronics companies are investing heavily in thin- 
film-transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs),  with a goal of 
transforming this into the industry's second highest value-added 
product after semiconductors, according to the 5 January MAEIL 
KYONGJE SINMUN (MKS). The newspaper reports that South Korea's three 
major producers--Goldstar Electron,  the Samsung Group, and Hyundai 
Electronics--in their first three years of work on TFT-LCDs, have 
already commercialized a number of high-quality  products at the 
super video graphic array (VGA) level. 

   Goldstar plans to invest 500 billion won ($625 million) in new 
assembly lines to be completed in May 1995 that will have an annual 
production of 500,000  3-  to  12.3-inch  units.  In November NIKKEI 
MICRODEVICES reported that $400 million of that investment will go 
toward the production of 10-inch panels. MKS meanwhile reports that 
Goldstar has become the second company in the world to develop a 
high-resolution 12.3-inch LCD  panel.  MKS and NIKKEI report that 
Goldstar will spend an additional $250 million by 1997 to raise its 
annual LCD production capacity to 1 million units. South Korea plans 
to invest another 140 billion won  ($175 million) in R&amp;D to improve 

product quality "beyond that of its Japanese competitors," according 
to MKS. 

   NIKKEI and MKS also report that in 1992 Hyundai began developing 
10.4-inch TFT-LCD color panels at its US research subsidiary, Image 
Quest Technology. It has  completed preparations for trial runs at 
its US pilot plant and expects to begin production in South Korea by 
1995. 

   According to the 5 January MKS, Samsung, which is already 
producing small quantities of TFT-LCDs on a pilot line for use in 
its own notebook PCs, is planning to expand its TFT-LCD production, 
with the ultimate goal of completely indigenous production. MKS 
reports the group will invest 450 billion won ($562.5 million) in 
LCDs in  1994. The 8 November MKS said that Samsung Electron 
Devices, one of the group's subsidiaries, was investing 300 billion 
won ($375 million) to increase annual LCD production by 100 percent 
to 2 million units by 1994, and to 5 million units by the year 2000. 

   Samsung's efforts to assume a more prominent position in LCD R&amp;D 

probably will be bolstered by cooperation from Japanese industry. 
For example,  according to the 8 November MKS, Samsung Electron 
Devices was planning to set up a research institute in Japan to 
obtain LCD technology, and to proceed with arrangements for LCD 
technology transfer from Japanese companies.  Late last December 
Samsung announced its agreement with Japan's Toshiba to jointly 
develop integrated circuits for LCDs by merging its own basic 
technology with Toshiba's production technology (MAEIL KYONGJE 
SINMUN 28 Dec 93).  The two companies reportedly will cooperate 
throughout all stages of development,  from basic standards through 
final reliability tests to create a product that "stands at the 
forefront of world technology."  According to MKS, Samsung believes 
the arrangement will help the company expand sales in the United 
States, Europe, and Japan, while at the same time helping to 
strengthen South Korea's  position in the development of nonmemory 
semiconductors. Tokyo DENPA (28 December 93) reported that work will 
begin this summer on chips with applications for TFT-LCDs and super- 
twisted nematic (STN)) LCDs,  and that the two companies will also 
work to standardize pin  arrangements, which has been an industry 
bottleneck. 

   South Korea's move into LCDs is raising concern there about the 
need to devise "countermeasures" in anticipation of a foreign 
patents offensive," according to the 13 January MKS. Although LCD- 
related patent disputes have not yet surfaced, the newspaper expects 
friction to arise in 1996 when South Korean firms begin mass- 
producing advanced devices.  According to the South Korean Patents 
Administration, foreign patent  applications in this field numbered 
862 between 1976 and 1992, with Swiss, British, and German companies 
already demanding royalties from South Korea for premium color LCDs, 
TFT-LCDs, and liquid crystal materials. For their part, South Korean 
companies have filed 1,350 LCD-related patent applications, most of 
which have been for black-and-white equipment, so the industry can 
expect some "hard blows," MKS predicts.  The newspaper quotes a 
Patents Administration official who urges South Korean firms to 
reduce the potential damage to domestic companies by "signing 
licensing agreements beforehand" for technology about which there is 
concern over patent infringement." 

   Commenting on South  Korea's  LCD efforts overall, the 1 December 
SILMUL KYONGJE, a Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade 
(KIET) publication, notes that South Korea's 1992 LCD production 
amounted to $88 million or just 2 percent of the world market. 
Current investment plans, however, will cause the domestic LCD 
industry to grow, on average, 51 percent annually between 1994 and 
2001, by which time South Korea will have 14 percent of the world 
market and will rank second only to Japan. KIET estimates the level 
of domestic production technology for LCD's at 90 percent that of 
Japan's, although design and basic technology are only about half. 
South Korean companies have the technology to mass-produce twisted 
nematic LCDs at 90 percent of Japan's rate, STN LCDs at 40 percent, 
and TFT-LCDs at slightly less than 70 percent of Japan's rate, 
according to SILMUL KYONGJE. 

   KIET says it would like to see South Korean LCD manufacturers 
cooperate in the joint development of components. In 1992, domestic 
firms reportedly organized a manufacturer's association that has 
focused its research on displays, which, according to KIET, helped 
reduce  "overlapping  investment."  In KIET's view, however, 
competition between South Korean firms will continue to stand in the 
way of joint efforts. NIKKEI MICRODEVICES notes as well that plans 
by Samsung and Goldstar to manufacture their own components for TFT 
panels is at odds with the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy's 
policy of apportioning parts  and  materials production to small and 
medium-sized businesses.

   JAPAN: HOPE ALFLEX WIND TUNNEL TESTS 

   The National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and the National Space 
Development Agency (NASDA) are preparing the automatic landing 
flight experiment (ALFLEX) as part of the H-2 orbiting plane (HOPE) 
program. (HOPE, an unmanned space plane, is to be launched by an H-2 
rocket in 1999.) The ALFLEX experimental plane is now in the design 
phase and its maiden flight is scheduled for fiscal year 1995. The 
plane's developers have been conducting ground effect tests at the 
Gust Wind Tunnel in Chofu Airfield Branch since June 1993, in order 
to assess the plane's aerodynamic behavior during high-speed landing 
and at high angles of attack during flare.

   According to a report in KOGIKEN NYUSU (Sep 93), engineers are 
using rapid prototyping techniques to construct wind tunnel models 
out of photosetting resin using data generated with three- 
dimensional computer-aided design.  Using off-the-shelf technology 
developed for industrial robots,  NAL has built a six-degree-of- 
freedom robot with a 150-kilogram load capacity that functions as a 
support structure and positioning system for the wind tunnel test 
models. The ALFLEX test model is attached to the sting at the tip of 
the robot arm, allowing adjustments in angle of attack, yaw, and 
roll. Variation in the positioning of the models is less than 0.1 
millimeter and variation in the re-creation of positions is 0.5 
millimeter.

   During the wind tunnel ground effect tests, researchers took 10 
measurements of variation in lift and drag after making incremental 
changes in the model's altitude relative to a plate simulating the 
ground. In the dynamic test,  measurements were made while the model 
was being moved continuously from the highest altitude to the lowest 
altitude (KOGIKEN NYUSU Sep  93; NATIONAL AEROSPACE LABORATORY 1993-

      JAPAN: NEC DEVELOPS SEMICONDUCTOR LASER WITH LOW OPERATING 
CURRENT 

   Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (NEC) has developed a new type of 
semiconductor laser that begins to emit infrared radiation when 
stimulated by an electric current of 190 microamperes, according to 
a report in NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN (5 Jan 94). This amperage--the 
world's lowest operating current--is reported to be less than one 
tenth the current used by conventional semiconductor lasers and NEC 
expects it to lead to a large reduction in electric power 
consumption by high-speed optoelectric integrated circuit devices 
used in optical communications and optical computers. 

   The NEC laser is a "sandwich" of crystalline film layers stacked 
on a substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. Infrared radiation with a 
wavelength of 1 micron generated in the optically active middle 
layer is emitted from the top surface of the laser in a direction 
perpendicular to the substrate instead of horizontally from the side 
of the laser, as is the case with conventional semiconductor lasers. 
Unlike the latter, the NEC laser is easily focused and can be 
integrated with optoelectronic devices, in a fashion analagous to an 
ordinary transistor. 

   In experiments the NEC laser began to emit radiation when the 
injection current reached 190 microamperes.  When the current was 
raised to 2 milliamperes, optical output power reached 50 
microwatts. The NEC researchers kept radiation loss to a minimum by 
making the thickness of the active layer equal to the radiation 
wavelength. The laser is limited to pulsed emission operation, but 
NEC intends to develop a method to reduce the laser element's 
resistance in order to make it suitable for continuous emission.

   JAPAN: QUANTUM BOX LASER 

   The Tokyo Institute of Technology has conducted experiments at 
-196 degrees C on a quantum box laser that generates pulses of 
infrared radiation at a wavelength of 1.3 microns and requires only 
1.3 amperes of current for oscillation. The laser element consists 
of a plane-surface indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) film with many 
microscopic particles of InGaAs arranged in a grid pattern and 
embedded in the film. The particles are 70 nanometers apart and each 
is 30 nanometers in diameter and 12 nanometers thick. The InGaAs- 
film laser element is sandwiched between insulating layers of indium 
phosphide. Unlike electrons in the thin-film layers of conventional 
semiconductor lasers, electrons confined in the point-like particle 
boxes of the new laser cannot move in any dimension, so they can 
emit radiation with virtually no waste, according to the 
researchers. 

   After development is complete the laser is expected to perform at 
room temperature.  Researchers believe the ultrahigh radiation 
efficiency will make it possible to operate it using only a few 
tenths of the electric power required by conventional 
semiconductors. The institute expects that the new laser will be 
used in optical communications and optical computers because it 
consumes little power and generates little heat, even when several 
lasers are grouped together (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 19 Nov 93).

   FRANCE: RESEARCH ON LOW-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY 

   Two groups of French researchers are focusing their research and 
development efforts on low-temperature superconductors that operate 
at temperatures between -63 degrees C and 7 degrees C. For example, 
researchers at the Paris School for Advanced Physics and Industrial 
Chemistry have developed semiconductors that exhibit 
superconductivity at -23 degrees C, according to IL SOLE-24 ORE (11 
Jan 94). The semiconductor is composed of five to 10 layers of 
copper oxide produced using molecular beam epitaxy deposition 
techniques at low temperatures.  Possible applications are in 
electronics and computers. 

   In related research, a team from two National Scientific Research 
Center (CNRS) laboratories in  Grenoble--the  Center for Research on 
Very Low Temperatures and the Crystallography Laboratory--has 
observed superconductivity in mercury cuprate compounds at 
temperatures ranging from -63 degrees  C  to  7 degrees C, at normal 
pressure. According to AFP SCIENCES (23 Dec 93), this breakthrough 
follows the team's September 1993 experiment, which achieved 
superconductivity at 157 K and 245 kilobars of pressure, and which 
demonstrated that critical temperature rises at the rate of 0.05 K 
per kilobar as the atomic density of cuprates increases with 
increasing pressure. (Previous research  achieved the same result by 
replacing certain atoms in a compound with others.) The experimental 
samples were 10 cubic millimeters in size and consisted of mercury, 
barium, calcium, and copper oxide phases.  A dramatic drop in 
electrical resistance was observed in seven samples and diamagnetism 
was observed in 15 samples, at temperatures ranging from 190 K to 
280 K depending on the compound, with the highest critical 
temperature occurring in 1 percent of the sample. Future research 
will focus on identifying the structure of that portion of the 
sample.

   RUSSIA: ANTICANCER, POTENTIAL AIDS DRUG PATENTED 

   In June 1993 Russian  officials granted four patents to a Russian 
chemist who developed Viturid, an immunostimulant said to be ten 
times more effective against second-  and third-stage cancers than 
current US and Russian therapies for the disease. After declining an 
offer from a US hospital to conduct clinical trials of the 
pharmaceutical in exchange for rights to its use, the scientist 
founded her own testing firm in the United States but later returned 
to Russia following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. 
Clinical trials in Russia showed that malignant tumors became benign 
and ultimately regressed completely following treatment with 
Viturid.  The drug's developer also claims it is effective in 
treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prior to the onset of 
immunodeficiency. Russian Health Minister Nechayev has authorized 
doctors to begin treating some unspecified diseases with Viturid in 
order to finance further testing (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 6 Jan 94).

   JAPAN: SYNCHROTRON ORBITAL RADIATION FACILITY FOR CIRCUIT ETCHING 

   Mitsubishi Electric has completed construction of a synchrotron 
orbital radiation (SOR) facility designed for circuit etching of 
future-generation semiconductor chips.  It includes a linear 
accelerator, a synchrotron, and an accumulator ring for the storage 
of electrons after they have been accelerated to relativistic 
speeds. Superconducting electromagnets in the ring are used to 
deflect the electrons from their orbit, thereby causing them to emit 
the intense radiation required for the ultrafine processing of 
future-generation 256-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 
chips. The compact SOR facility, which cost several billion yen, is 
designed to supply radiation simultaneously to 20 processing units. 
The circumference of the electron beam orbit in the SOR ring is only 
9.2 meters, and the amount of liquid  helium required to cool the 
superconducting coils is reported to be only a "fraction" of the 
amount necessary for conventional SOR facilities. Mitsubishi, which 
is currently using the SOR facility for the development of 
semiconductors within the company, is also planning to market it 
externally (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 Nov 93).

SUMMARY 
                                None of the leaders of the former Yugoslavia, whether Serb, 
Muslim, or Croat, has expressed any interest in seeing the Serbs 
join the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
was called for in the 1 March Washington agreement.  Serbian 
leaders, while rejecting a federation, have suggested forming a 
confederation loosely linking the Serb entities, Croatia and the 
proposed federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia.  However, 
Croatian and Muslim leaders have rejected any confederal 
relations between Bosnia and the so-called Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (FRY, Serbia and Montenegro). 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   Having already expressed their strong opposition to joining the 
proposed Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Bosnian Serb leaders, along with the Serbs of Croatia, are 
pressing for at minimum a confederation of all Serb-populated 
territories in former Yugoslavia.  Serb leaders in Bosnia and 
Croatia have reiterated their longstanding claims that their 
respective territories never seceded from Yugoslavia--as did the 
Bosnian and Croatian republics--and thus have the right to remain 
united with the FRY.  For example, Nikola Koljevic, "vice 
president" of the so-called Republic of Srpska (RS), demanded the 
right for the Bosnian Serbs to have "very close links" with the 
FRY since, "legally speaking," they "never left Yugoslavia" 
(Belgrade radio, 14 March).  Similarly, Milan Martic, "president" 
of the so-called Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in Croatia, 
maintaining that the RSK never seceded from Yugoslavia, has 
called for establishing "everlasting connections with the FRY" 
(Politika, 10 March).  This apparently represents a significant 
and possibly coordinated shift in emphasis, since leaders of both 
entities had recently emphasized their contrary claims that their 
"republics" should be recognized as separate, sovereign states. 
   The Bosnian Serbs have not ruled out some type of future 
political links with the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina and Croatia.  Bosnian Serb "President" Radovan 
Karadzic suggested that the RS is willing to consider "broader 
integration" of the territories of former Yugoslavia, broaching 
the idea of joining Croatia and the FRY together "into some 
relationship" with the RS and the RSK (Tanjug, 14 March). 
Similarly, although Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Bosnian 
Serb assembly, described the prospect of the Serbs joining the 
Muslim-Croatian federation as "unnatural, illogical, and 
unacceptable," he said the Serbs would "accept" talks on a 
"future modality" for linking the three peoples (Tanjug, 12 
March). 
   At the same time, another Bosnian Serb official set conditions 
for joining the negotiations on the fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
that would almost preclude Serb participation.  After delivering 
what Krajisnik said would be the "official" Serb position to 
Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin in Belgrade on 14 March 
(Tanjug, 13 March), Koljevic insisted that the Serbs would 
participate in talks with the Croats and Muslims only "on an 
equal footing, which would mean without sanctions" on the FRY. 
(Belgrade radio, 14 March).  Suggesting that he would prefer to 
see the Washington agreement derailed, Karadzic has called for a 
return to the Geneva negotiations, with the EU taking the lead 
back from the United States (Tanjug, 15 March). 
   Belgrade's Stance 
   Although the leadership of the FRY, including Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic, has not rejected the Washington agreement out 
of hand, Belgrade has not indicated any willingness to negotiate 
within the terms of the plan.  Milosevic stopped just short of 
rejecting the plan after talking with Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, releasing a statement that made no mention of 
the plan but endorsed a peace settlement based on the November 
1993 European Union plan for a union of three sovereign states in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina (Tanjug, 11 March).  At the same time, 
apparently not wanting to be held responsible for rejecting the 
Washington agreement, Milosevic maintained what Churkin called a 
"flexible attitude" toward a Bosnian settlement at their 14 March 
meeting, a point that was stressed on Milosevic-controlled 
Belgrade television (Belgrade TV, 14 March).  Other comments from 
Yugoslav leaders and media have reiterated the position that the 
Serbs do not oppose a Muslim-Croatian federation as long as it 
does not threaten Serbian interests, while at the same time 
expressing skepticism that such a federation can long survive 
(Belgrade radio, 3 March; Belgrade TV, 12 March). 
   Bosnian Government Stand 
   The Bosnian Government has rejected Serbian proposals for 
confederal ties linking Bosnia-Herzegovina with the FRY and 
insisted that the Serbs will not be allowed to alter the borders 
of the country by seceding with the territory they control. 
While inviting the Serbs to sign on to the Washington agreement, 
President Alija Izetbegovic flatly declared during an interview 
with Zagreb television that a confederation between Bosnia- 
Herzegovina and the FRY is "out of the question."  He also warned 
that the Serbs would not be allowed to "snatch away part of 
Bosnia and attach it to Serbia."  Although he did not rule out 
the possibility of "certain forms of cooperation"--specifically 
"economic cooperation" --between the states of the former 
Yugoslavia, he contended that no "serious, responsible people" 
were considering the creation of a "new Yugoslavia" (Zagreb TV, 9 
March). 
   Croatia's Stance 
   The Croatian Government has also rejected the possibility of 
confederal ties between the FRY and either Croatia or Bosnia- 
Herzegovina.  Asked about Krajisnik's proposal to link the 
Serbian "states" with Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic flatly declared it "absolutely impossible" 
to accept.  He further stressed that "under no circumstances" 
would Croatia consider "any kind of relationship" linking it 
"directly or indirectly" with the FRY.  Attributing the proposal 
to Churkin, Granic said that he had conveyed his negative views 
"very firmly" to both the Russians and the Bosnian Government 
(Zagreb TV, 13 March).  Although President Franjo Tudjman has not 
directly rejected ties between the Bosnian state and the FRY, he 
did offhandedly dismiss the idea during a 7 March press 
conference in responding to a question on the subject (Zagreb 
radio, 7 March). 
   Implications 
   The Croat and Bosnian Governments' refusal to accept a confederal 
relationship between the Bosnian Serbs and the FRY appears to 
doom any possibility, however remote, that the Serbs will agree 
to the Washington plan.  In the near term, the Serbs are likely 
to continue combat operations to secure territory linking their 
enclaves into one entity, with the aim of declaring the new lines 
of demarcation to be the borders of their republic.  Although 
they may be willing to make territorial concessions in exchange 
for concessions from the Bosnian Government and the international 
community--particularly lifting the UN sanctions on Belgrade- 
-they are likely to continue to pursue the goal of eventual union 
with the FRY and the RSK.

<TEXT>
SUMMARY 
                                 Pyongyang appears to be trying to grant the IAEA just enough 
access to its nuclear sites to prevent the collapse of U.S.-DPRK 
talks, a strategy that may be aimed at retaining maximum 
bargaining leverage with Washington. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   Although Pyongyang media have not yet commented on the outcome of 
the IAEA inspection team's just-completed visit to North Korea, 
the South Korean news agency Yonhap on 16 March cited IAEA 
spokesman Hans Meyer as saying that although the IAEA inspection 
team was allowed to inspect North Korea's seven declared sites, 
it was not permitted to examine every item on its original 
agenda.  Similarly, Seoul's  KBS-I radio the same day cited the 
IAEA team as reporting that compared with past inspections, there 
had been "improvement" in inspection activities allowed during 
the IAEA team's latest visit.  However, the team could not 
extract enough samples to prove definitively whether or not North 
Korea had diverted nuclear materials for uses other than what it 
had declared, according to the radio. 
   Not surprisingly, Pyongyang is pursuing an equally minimalist 
strategy in its talks with South Korea.  Pyongyang radio on 16 
March accused Seoul of attempting to obstruct upcoming DPRK-U.S. 
high-level talks by blocking progress at the latest round of 
inter-Korean talks.  According to the radio, at the latest round 
the North adhered to its "reasonable" insistence that the sides 
issue a joint communique declaring their basic intent to realize 
an exchange of special envoys at an early date.  Pyongyang radio 
also asserted that the South had refused to accept the North's 
version of a draft agreement on procedural matters and claimed 
that Seoul is "deliberately" creating difficulties, bent on 
"putting the brakes" on DPRK-U.S. talks, tentatively set to start 
in Geneva on 21 March. 
   Pyongyang seems to be calculating that by making limited 
concessions at the North-South talks, it can cast the South in 
the role of obstructing the planned talks with Washington.  For 
example, according to Pyongyang radio accounts of the 16 March 
meeting, the North Korean chief delegate juxtaposed the North's 
"broad-minded and epoch-making" willingness to lift four demands 
that North Korea previously advanced in the talks to the South's 
"sanctimonious" rejection of North Korean proposals. 
   Interest in Foreign Trade     Despite its stance on IAEA 
inspections and North-South contacts, Pyongyang also seems to be 
tempering its hardline stance by carefully signaling that its 
long-term goal is to reach a peaceful settlement of the nuclear 
issue.  To this end, the North Korean news agency KCNA waited 
until 15 March--the day a Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a 
threatening statement about U.S. preconditions on DPRK-U.S. 
talks--to publicize a set of free trade zone regulations that had 
been adopted on 21 February.  The regulations concern the 
operation of foreign businesses within North Korean free trade 
zones.  Similarly, the next day KCNA reported on regulations, 
also adopted on 21 February, for the implementation of the tax 
law on foreign enterprises.  Both sets of trade regulations 
presuppose an influx of foreign investment into North Korea, an 
event not likely to occur without a peaceful resolution of the 
nuclear issue. 
   Implications     Pyongyang media treatment of recent developments 
concerning the nuclear issue suggests that the North Korean 
leadership may believe that it has already given Washington 
enough incentives so that it would not be willing to risk the 
heightening of tensions on the Korean peninsula by breaking off 
U.S.-DPRK talks.  Pyongyang appears to be trying to retain as 
much of its "nuclear card" and control over the inter-Korean 
issues as possible in order to enhance its position at any future 
bilateral negotiations with Washington.

SUMMARY 
                                           As Ukraine enters the final weeks before the 27 March Supreme 
Soviet election, a very large number of candidates are competing 
for most of the 450 parliamentary seats, guaranteeing many 
runoffs and even raising the possibility that not enough deputies 
may be elected to form a parliament.  Activity by parties varies 
widely--strong in Lviv and Donetsk but weak in many other places. 
With nationalist and democratic parties likely to run well in the 
west, leftist and liberal parties in the east, but non-party 
candidates likely to win the most seats nationwide, prospects are 
for a badly splintered Supreme Soviet with weak parties and 
little ability to resolve the country's tough problems. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   Easy filing requirements and lax filing deadlines contributed to 
the flood of candidates.  According to the election law, 
candidates had to file only 10 signatures by 60 days before the 
election (late January) to become a "candidate for candidate" and 
then 300 signatures by 45 days before the election (i.e., 10 
February) to become a registered candidate (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi 
Rady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993).  Although plenty of candidates 
had already qualified, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) 
allowed registration to continue after 10 February (Nezavisimost, 
11 February), apparently until individual local electoral 
commissions decided to close it.  Robitnycha Hazeta reported on 
18 February that registration had ended in 211 of the 450 
districts, and Holos Ukrainy reported on 23 February that all 
registration had finally ended on 17 February.  In late February 
the CEC reported that 5,833 (86 percent) of the 6,750 "candidates 
for candidate" had been registered as final candidates (Holos 
Ukrainy, 2 March).  The lists of candidates began appearing in 
local papers in mid-February, and candidates began appearing on 
local television in groups--for example, the 16 candidates for 
Kiev city district no. 14 were slated to make the first joint 
appearance on 14 February (Vecherniy Kiev, 12 February). 
   Parties' Role Limited 
   Parties played a limited role in putting forward candidates, 
formally nominating only a small percentage of the candidates in 
most districts.  Groups of voters nominated 3,633 (62 percent), 
work collectives 1,557 (27 percent), while parties nominated only 
643 (11 percent), according to the 2 March Holos Ukrainy. 
However, some areas, such as Lviv and Donetsk, had a much higher 
proportion of party nominees than the republic-wide 11 percent 
(See Box 1). 
   In reality, however, there are far more party-affiliated 
candidates on the ballot than party nominations would indicate 
because some who were identified with a party in local papers 
were nominated by groups of electors or collectives.  In Kiev 
Oblast, only 12 candidates were nominated by parties, but 46 
candidates actually belong to parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 28 
January).  And in Donetsk, lists of candidates for the first 10 
districts in Vecherniy Donetsk identified one third to one half 
of the candidates in most districts as affiliated with parties, 
far more than the number nominated by parties. 
   At the same time, not all candidates affiliated with a party are 
endorsed as candidates by the party.  A DemPU (Democratic Party 
of Ukraine) candidate is running against former Defense Minister 
Kostyantyn Morozov in Kiev district No. 1 but DemPU itself is 
backing Morozov (Samostiyna Ukraina, 23-28 February). 
   So far, no parties have published republic-wide lists of their 
candidates, and though several publicly set a goal of running 
candidates in all districts, it appears none came close.  Few 
parties have even provided numbers of their candidates.  The 
paper Rada (published by Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil) on 3 
March carried an article reporting that Rukh members were running 
in 260 of the 450 districts and that there also were dozens of 
independent candidates "who support Rukh and promise to join 
Rukh's faction if elected."  The URP's paper Samostiyna Ukraina 
(23-28 February) reported that the URP had registered 132 
candidates (including 17 in Lviv, 17 in Kiev, 10 in Ternopil, and 
8 in Ivano-Frankivsk), while the DemPU was running fewer 
(including only 6 in Kiev city).  The Post-Postup News Agency 
reported that a 24 January UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly) 
press conference announced 60 candidates (15 in Kiev, 15 in 
Poltava and Cherkassy, 12 in Donbass, 4 in Rivne, 3 in Kiev 
Oblast, 2 in Odesa, Ternopil, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Vinnytsa). 
The Central Electoral Commission announced that the CPU was 
running the most candidates--6.7 percent of all, followed by Rukh 
(4.1 percent), SPU (3.11 percent), URP (2.42 percent), Liberal 
Party (1.43 percent), and DemPU (1.28 percent), but that there 
were also many "hidden" party candidates (Holos Ukrainy, 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March). 
   Joint Candidacies 
   Another of the reasons for the limited number of party-nominated 
candidates may be agreement among parties to back each others' 
candidates to avoid fratricidal contests between like-minded 
parties.  In the initial months after announcement of the 
election, success at uniting parties behind candidates was very 
limited.  More recently, Levko Lukyanenko, head of the "Ukraine" 
Democratic Union (the latest name for the coordinating organ set 
up by democratic parties in December), has claimed that 
democratic parties have made great progress in agreeing on 
candidates.  He said at a February press conference that 
democratic parties had "agreed on a single candidate" in over 320 
of the 450 districts (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February).  In another 
version of his remarks--given in the 22 February Silski Visti and 
23 February Khreshchatyk--he reportedly said there were "agreed" 
candidates in 342 districts.  He named candidates in 6 Kiev 
Oblast districts that the "Ukraine" union would back with both 
organizational and financial support (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 
February). 
   Rukh Chairman and longtime Lukyanenko foe Vyacheslav Chornovil 
took a more pessimistic view than Lukyanenko of democratic 
parties' success in uniting behind agreed candidates.  In a 15 
February Sribna Zemlya interview, Chornovil said that the 
"Ukraine" union was mainly just Rukh, the URP, and DemPU.  The 
PDVU, New Ukraine, social democrats, liberal democrats, christian 
democrats, and the "left center" had not joined, he said.  He 
also complained that in Lviv the URP had fielded too many 
candidates. 
   Moreover, even Lukyanenko admitted that democrats had been unable 
to agree on candidates in 38 districts--mainly in Lviv, Ivano- 
Frankivsk, and Ternopil (Silski Visti, 22 February).  In these 
areas, where democrats are virtually sure to win, they apparently 
felt less need to unite and more opportunity to win on their own. 
When the Lviv democratic coordinating council finally announced 
its list of candidates, it was able to endorse an agreed 
candidate in only 2 of the 23 districts; in the rest it endorsed 
more than one candidate or noted that some member-parties were 
backing candidates other than the council's (Vysokyy Zamok, 5 
March).  Lukyanenko also acknowledged that democrats had been 
unable to field any candidates in 18 districts, mainly in the 
east--5 in Odesa, 4 in Donetsk, 4 in Luhansk, 2 in Zaporizhzhya, 
2 in Krym, and 1 in Poltava (Khreshchatyk, 23 February). 
   Prospects Vary in Regions 
   Lists of candidates and reports on party activity in local Kiev, 
Lviv, and Donetsk papers provide a sample of the varied and 
complex picture in Ukraine's regions. 
   Kiev 
   Party strength among candidates for Kiev city's 23 seats is hard 
to measure because in listing candidates local papers often 
failed to indicate if candidates were associated with a party. 
Among the few candidates identified with parties in the papers, 8 
were from the CPU, 6 from the SPU, 5 from Rukh, 5 from the PDVU, 
3 from the UNA, 3 from the tJKRP (Ukrainian Conservative 
Republican Party), and only 1 from the URP and the Liberal Party, 
and none from DemPU or New Ukraine.  Fifty-eight were 
specifically identified as nonpartisan.  Most of the rest of the 
almost 500 candidates listed in the paper Khreshchatyk were not 
identified with any party or even identified as nonpartisan. 
   Although few Kiev candidates bear the Rukh label, Rukh should win 
some seats because it has some big names--Chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet's democratic faction, Narodna Rada, Ivan Zayets, outspoken 
Rukh leader Serhiy Holovatyy, and Minister of Environmental 
Protection Yuriy Kostenko.  Democrats in general should do well 
since some of their prominent candidates look like easy winners- 
-former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, city soviet chairman 
Vasyl Nesterenko, popular maverick Kiev leader Ivan Saliy (who 
was fired by Kravchuk as presidential representative for the 
city), outspoken Vecherniy Kiev editor Vitaliy Karpenko, and 
economic reformer and former Deputy Premier and Minister of 
Economy Volodymyr Lanovyy.   Morozov, Karpenko, Zayets, 
Holovatyy, and Kostenko were endorsed by several nationalist 
democratic organizations (Vecherniy Kiev, 6 January).  Democratic 
parties could not reach agreement on single candidates in many 
districts, however.  When the "Ukraine" Democratic Union issued 
its list of approved candidates, it endorsed candidates for only 
14 of the city's 23 districts (Vecherniy Kiev, 10 March). 
   In general, though, Kiev city appears likely to produce fewer 
prominent deputies than in the past.  Many big names on the 
incumbent Kiev Supreme Soviet delegation are running for 
reelection in other regions where they apparently rate their 
chances for election better.  VNRU (National Rukh of Ukraine--the 
anti-Chornovil Rukh) leader Larysa Skoryk and Rukh leader Les 
Tanyuk are running in Lviv, democrat Pavlo Movchan in Ivano- 
Frankivsk, former Premier Vi told Fokin in Cherkassy, and URP 
leader Oles Shevchenko in Kiev 'Oblast.  Lukyanenko complained 
that too many Kiev democrats were running in the west, where it 
is easier to win (Kiyvska Pravda, Khreshchatyk, 22 February)- 
-although Kiev city has also been relatively receptive to 
democrats in the past, since 17 of the 22 deputies elected from 
Kiev city in 1990 joined the democrats' Narodna Rada shortly 
after the election. 
   Lviv 
   Lviv will remain the main stronghold for democrats and 
nationalists.  Its present delegation has many prominent 
democrats and nationalists--Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, UKRP 
chairman Stepan Khmara, former Deputy Premier for economic reform 
Viktor Pynzenyk, former First Deputy Premier Ihor Yukhnovskyy, 
Rukh Chairman Chornovil, city Mayor Mykola Horyn, nationalist 
Iryna Kalinets, and PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv.  Now, with others 
from outside--Skoryk, Tanyuk, prominent Rukh economist Volodymyr 
Chernyak, and Rukh Deputy Chairman Oleksandr Lavrynovych added, 
the field has become crowded.  Despite Lukyanenko's complaint 
that Kievites are running in Lviv because it is easier to win 
there, Tanyuk reportedly dropped out of a Kiev race to clear the 
way for an URP candidate (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January), probably 
as part of efforts to coordinate candidacies.  Rukh Chairman 
Chornovil actually went against the trend, deciding to run in 
Ternopil, not Lviv, this time.  He explained that he was not 
running in Lviv district 266 in order to help clear the way for 
election of Rukh candidate Mykhaylo Boychyshyn (who was kidnapped 
a few weeks ago and is still missing) or in district 267 to make 
way for Tanyuk (Kievskiye Novosti, 18 February). 
   Rukh, URP, and New Wave have coordinated some candidates, and 
democratic candidates are prominent enough to probably win on the 
first ballot in several Lviv districts.  Probable first round 
winners include Yukhnovskyy (New Wave), Pynzenyk (New Wave), 
Tanyuk (Rukh), Chernyak (Rukh), Lavrynovych (Rukh), Ihor Hryniv 
(backed by New Wave, Rukh, and the PDVU--Vysokyy Zamok, 11, 20 
January, 3 February; Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 12 January), Lviv tJRP 
Chairman Oleh Pavlyshyn, Lviv Rukh Chairman Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy, 
and Supreme Soviet member Mykhaylo Kosiv (backed by Rukh, New 
Wave, URP, and other organizations--Vysokyy Zamok, 5 February; 
Rada, 10 February). 
   In contrast, the many extreme nationalist candidates (KUN, OUN, 
UNA, UKRP, and SNPU) will probably splinter the ultranationalist 
vote.  These parties appeared to make little attempt to 
coordinate, with the SNPU (Social National Party of Ukraine) 
nominating 21 candidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Kievskiye 
Vedomosti, 5 March), KUN 14 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January) and the 
UKRP 9 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 5 January). 
   District races in Lviv include some notable contests between 
prominent figures, sometimes pitting democrats against 
ultranationalists:  URP Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn is facing 
controversial ultranationalist UKRP Chairman Stepan Khmara in 
district no. 261; PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv opposes KUN leader 
Iryna Kalynets in district no. 273; and oblast soviet Chairman 
Mykola Horyn (Rukh) is running against UNA leader and commander 
of UNA's paramilitary arm UNS0 (Ukrainian National Self-Defense) 
Oleh Vitovych in district no. 275. 
   Donetsk 
   Judging by identifications in the Donetsk press, leftist parties 
(CPU, SPU, and the Party of Labor) and the more centrist Liberal 
Party and Party of Justice have been the most active in 
nominating candidates, while Rukh has some candidates, but few 
PDVU, URP, DemPU, or ultranationalists are running.  The 138 
candidates for the 10 districts (listed in Vecherniy Donetsk on 
19 February) include 11 Liberal Party affiliated candidates, 9 
CPU, 8 SPU, 5 Party of Labor, and 5 Party of Justice, but only 3 
Rukh, 2 KUN, 1 URP, 1 DemPU, and 1 PDVU.  Holos Ukrainy on 8 
February said the largest number of the party candidates in 
Donetsk are Communists and Liberals, followed by the Party of 
Labor, but most candidates were nominated by groups of electors. 
CPU leaders Petro Symonenko and Yevhen Marmazov are running here 
(Pravda Ukrainy, 18 January). 
   Democrats, at least nationalist democrats, are clearly weak in 
Donetsk.  Lukyanenko said that there are few democrats running in 
general and none at all in 4 Donetsk districts (Khreshchatyk, 23 
February).  Post-Postup reported a 15 January Rukh conference had 
managed to nominate 12 candidates for Donetsk's 47 districts. 
The lists of candidates, at least in the first 10 districts, not 
only showed few Rukh, URP, and DemPU candidates, but also few or 
no candidates from the non-nationalist democratic parties or 
blocs that should be strong in the east--New Ukraine, PDVU, the 
Labor Congress of Ukraine, and the Interregional Bloc for Reform 
set up by former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet 
Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov, which appears active in 
Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk. 
   A new local Donetsk bloc has also sprung up recently and 
nominated many candidates.  The "People's Congress of Donetsk," 
which backs Ukrainian independence but opposes what it calls the 
present "speculative anarchy" and wants more state control and 
social protection for the public, registered candidates in most 
Donetsk districts, according to a 3 February Demokratychna 
Ukraina article. 
   Dangers in Electoral Process 
   The large number of candidates and limited ability of parties to 
organize support for candidates and provide some sort of order to 
the competition indicates there may be few winners on the first 
ballot, necessitating runoffs in many districts.  To win, a 
candidate has to get over 50 percent of the votes cast and votes 
of at least 25 percent of registered voters (according to the 
election law in the Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).  For the 
election itself to be valid, 50 percent of the registered voters 
have to vote, according to the Ukrainian law.  These requirements 
apply to all rounds of balloting.  If no candidate qualifies as a 
winner on the first round, the two highest vote-getters run in a 
runoff, which must be held within two weeks after the first 
round.  In the 12 December Russian parliamentary election, only a 
plurality was needed, so almost all seats were filled on the 
first ballot. 
   In addition to the difficulty of getting enough voters out to 
vote and of candidates garnering a majority of the votes cast, 
the voting procedures may produce many invalid votes, which also 
could prevent anyone winning.  As in past elections, voters have 
to cross off all candidates except the one they wish to vote for. 
With 25 or 30 candidates in many districts, the voter has to 
cross off a large number of names, and if he inadvertently leaves 
more than one name not crossed off, the ballot will be invalid. 
If a voter crosses off all names, his vote is valid, however.  In 
the 12 December Russian election, Russia changed over to positive 
voting, whereby voters put a mark only by the names of those they 
wished to vote for. 
   The prospect of many runoffs has led to concern that voters will 
lose interest and too few will vote in the second round to meet 
the requirements for a valid election or that even in the runoff 
no one will win a majority (if a substantial number of voters 
cross out both candidates).  In this case, the election rules 
provide for new elections within a month of the original election 
in which all candidates in the original election would be barred 
(Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).  With the need to quickly come up 
with new candidates who had not participated earlier, it seems 
likely that the quality of the candidates would decline and voter 
interest may drop further, producing more invalid elections and 
leaving many seats unfilled--perhaps even enough to prevent the 
formation of a new Supreme Soviet. 
   Outlook 
   Although most news reporting on the Ukrainian elections has 
focused on the activity of parties and their candidates, most 
candidates are unaffiliated, and presumably they will win most 
seats, especially in rural areas where parties are weakest.  Many 
of these unaffiliated may be conservative-leaning representatives 
of interest groups, lobbies, or behind-the-scenes power 
structures.  While democrats are strong in west Ukraine, they 
appear to have little organization or support in much of the rest 
of the country, further adding to the prospect for returning a 
conservative legislature.  There is also a danger that low voter 
turnout could void the balloting in enough districts to prevent 
formation of a new Supreme Soviet, raising the prospect of a 
paralysis of government. 
   Box 1 
                        Regional Variations in Party Activity 
   In Lviv, parties were very active, judging by reports in local 
papers of meetings by Rukh, KUN (Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists), New Wave, UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican 
Party), and the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party that nominated 
candidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4, 12 
January; Vysokyy Zamok, 4, 6, 18 January).  Although lists of 
candidates in Lviv papers often did not report the organization 
nominating, a relatively large proportion of candidates were 
identified as affiliated with a party--in most districts about 
half the candidates.  Many of these candidates, however, were 
nominated by groups rather than parties. 
   In Donetsk, which encompasses 47 districts as the most populous 
oblast of Ukraine, a high proportion of candidates were 
identified with parties and parties nominated numerous 
candidates.  The 19 February Vecherniy Donetsk report on the 
first 10 Donetsk districts* identified 51 of the 138 candidates 
with parties and listed 7 candidates nominated by the CPU 
(Communist Party of Ukraine), 6 by the SPU (Socialist Party of 
Ukraine), 6 by the Liberal Party, 4 by the Party of Labor, 3 by 
Rukh, 3 by the Party of Justice, 3 by the Peoples Congress of 
Donetsk, and 1 by the URP (Ukrainian Republican Party). 
   In Zaporizhzhya (18 districts) 20 percent of the candidates were 
nominated by parties (18 by Rukh, 18 by the SPU, 12 by the CPU, 7 
by the Liberal Party, and 4 by the Labor Party), according to the 
8 February Holos Ukrainy. 
   On the other hand, in Kiev Oblast (17 districts) only 12 of the 
264 candidates were nominated by parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 
February)--about 5 percent.  Kiyvska Pravda on 20 January 
identified the 1JRP as the most active party in nominating 
candidates.  In Dnipropetrovsk (34 seats) only 17 candidates were 
nominated by parties, versus 129 by groups of voters and 58 by 
collectives (Pravda Ukrainy, 27 January)--about 9 percent.  In 
Krym (23 seats), parties--the URP, CPU, PDVU (Party of Democratic 
Revival of Ukraine), and the Party for Economic Revival of Krym- 
-nominated only 26 of the 140 candidates (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 23 
February). 
   *The subsequent Donetsk papers listing the candidates in the 
other 37 districts have not yet come in.

protection of the public, according to a 3 February Demokratychna 
Ukraina article). 
   TKU (Labor Congress of Ukraine), led by Anatoliy Matviyenko. 
Ukrainian Party of Justice, led by Mykhaylo Hrechka.  (Classified 
as "liberal centrist," along with the Liberal Party and Labor

                           Nomination of Prominent Leaders 
   Supreme Soviet:  Chairman Ivan Plyushch, at present representing 
Kiev Oblast, is now registered as a candidate in Chernihiv 
(Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February), while Deputy Chairman Vasyl 
Durdinets is running in Kirovohrad (Holos Ukrainy, 22 January), 
where he was elected before--apparently safe districts.  Most of 
the Supreme Soviet's incumbent deputies are not running, however. 
The Central Electoral Commission announced that only 145 current 
deputies are running, while 42 others had been candidates for 
candidate but had dropped out (Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March). 
   Presidential hopefuls:  Former Premier Kuchma switched from his 
native Dnipropetrovsk to run in Chernihiv (Rada, 3 March; 
Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March), former Supreme Soviet Deputy 
Chairman Hrynyov is again running in his home oblast of Kharkiv, 
and Rukh Chairman Chornovil switched from Lviv to Ternopil. 
   Leaders of parties:  SPU leader Oleksandr Moroz is apparently 
running again in Kiev 0blast, UKRP leader Khmara again in Lviv, 
TKU (Labor Congress of Ukraine) leader Anatoliy Matviyenko again 
in Vinnytsa, CPU leader Petro Symonenko in Donetsk, URP leader 
Mykhaylo Horyn again in Lviv, and DemPU leader Volodymyr 
Yavorivskyy again in Kirovohrad.  Liberal Party Chairman Ihor 
Markulov announced he would not run for parliament (Pravda 
Ukrainy, 1 February). 
   Members of the government:  Many officials are registered as 
candidates even though they apparently cannot retain their jobs 
if elected, since the new Supreme Soviet is supposed to be a 
fulltime job--to avoid the present frequent absences by deputies 
with other jobs.  The election law stipulates that candidates 
must file a statement promising to give up other jobs if elected. 
Despite this, acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and Deputy 
Premier Valentyn Landyk were nominated in their native Donetsk, 
and in all, 4 deputy premiers and 37 ministers and deputy 
ministers are registered as candidates (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 
March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March).  President Kravchuk was 
nominated in several districts but, pointing out that the law 
does not allow the president to run for the Supreme Soviet, 
declined the nominations (Ukraina Moloda, 15 February).

SUMMARY 

                              Damascus turned the unprecedented visit of an Israeli Arab 
delegation to Syria into a major media event, eliciting from the 
visitors strong rhetorical support for Syrian policies. 
President Hafiz al-Asad also used the event to restate Syria's 
overall position on the peace process.  The visit itself, and the 
fact that the delegation head was permitted to use Syrian media 
to portray a relatively positive image of the Israeli public and 
government, marks a significant, albeit limited, step in the very 
gradual thawing of Israeli-Syrian ties--a step that Damascus 
probably hopes will play well in Washington and Israel. 

                          END SUMMARY 

   Both Damascus and the 57-member delegation of Israeli Arabs 
professed that the delegation's 7-10 March visit was for the sole 
purpose of extending condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad on 
the death of his son Basil in January.  (For example, Jerusalem 
Qol Yisra'el, 18 February; Damascus radio, 7 March); nonetheless, 
the event was also viewed by both sides as having clear political 
significance.  For their part, Syria's tightly controlled media 
gave the visit far more extensive coverage than they did a visit 
of a large Druze delegation from the Golan Heights in September 
1992.  Reflecting the political nature of the visit, both 
President al-Asad and delegation head 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah- 
-leader of the Arab Democratic Party and Knesset deputy--spoke 
only briefly about the death of al-Asad's son, focusing instead 
almost entirely on the Arab-Israel peace process, in televised 
speeches (Damascus Television, 9 March). 

   A Show of Support for Syria 

   Syria orchestrated the visit as a show of support for its own 
policies, from the peace process, to the PLO, to Syrian Jews. 
Damascus elicited the visitors' vocal support via the Syrian 
media, which carried numerous statements by Darawshah extolling 
Syria and scoring Israeli policies.  For example: 

   -- According to Damascus radio, Darawshah called the destruction 
of Qunaytirah1--which the delegation visited on its second day in 
Syria--"a deplorable crime" and "praised the heroic struggle of 
the Syrian Armed Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in 
defense of Arab territory" (8 March).  In his address to al-Asad, 
he asserted that "we share the same position with you" on the 
peace process. 

   -- Damascus radio quoted Darawshah as saying that the purpose of 
his delegation's visit with Syrian Jews was "to clarify some 
Israeli political and public opinion issues" and "prove to all 
who seek to distort the truth that Syria does not discriminate 
against the Musawi community" [community of the followers of 
Moses]. 

   -- In an interview with Damascus radio, Darawshah said the 
delegation had found that in Syria "everything is abundant, 
freedom is available, and loftiness and dignity characterize 
every action by Syria, led by President Hafiz al-Asad, may God 
preserve him" (9 March). 

   -- Delegation member and Knesset deputy Talib al-Sani' was even 
quoted as scoring Israel for trying to "penetrate the Arab world 
economically and to propagate the idea of a Middle East market" 
(Damascus radio, 10 March)--a recurrent theme in Syrian media in 
recent months (for example, a Tishrin editorial, as reported by 
Damascus radio on 8 February). 

   Even Syria's choice of personalities to greet the delegation on 
arrival at the airport was clearly meant as a statement: Khalid 
al-Fahum, head of a Syrian-backed umbrella group of Palestinian 
rejectionists opposed to the PLO, was the only figure reported to 
accompany the governor of Damascus to the airport (Damascus 
radio, 7 March).  The Syrians thus created the appearance of an 
affinity between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians supported by 
Damascus, while giving the PLO--still scorned by the Syrians 
because of the 13 September Israeli-PLO declaration of 
Principles--a symbolic jab. 

   1Qunaytirah was captured by Israel in 1967 and returned to Syria 
in ruins following the conclusion of a disengagement of forces 
agreement in 1974. 

   Al-Asad Uses Visit for Peace Message 

   While the visitors were used as channels for extolling Syrian 
policies, the visit also afforded Damascus an opportunity to send 
some signals on the peace process for foreign--particularly U.S. 
and Israeli--consumption.  Al-Asad used his meeting with the 
delegation as a platform for his first policy statement since the 
death of his son.  While breaking no new ground, al-Asad stressed 
Syria's commitment to peace, at times echoing his now famous 
"peace of the brave" speech to the 1992 Druze delegation 
(Damascus radio, 9 September 1992).  He told the Israeli Arabs: 
"We seriously seek peace, and the Israeli officials know this," 
adding, "In light of what they [Israel] are proposing, it seems 
that their vision of peace is not the same as ours.  Therefore, 
we will struggle until their peace becomes identical with our 
peace . . . . Peace means rights.  In other words, each party has 
its rights and each party is the master of itself and its 
interests . . . . When we said the peace of the brave, we meant 
that each party will achieve full peace with all its rights, and 
that neither party will humiliate the other." 

   A Limited Opening to Israel 

   The visit itself marked a symbolic though limited advance in 
Syrian willingness to take small steps toward opening contacts 
with Israel.  It follows such modest advances as an evidently 
officially sanctioned series of meetings outside the Middle East 
between Syrian and Israeli academics reported by Israeli and 
international media (for example, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el, 31 
December 1993; Yedi'ot Aharonot, 2 January 1994), and the 1992 
visit by the Druze delegation, which crossed into Syria directly 
from the Golan Heights and--according to Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin--included some Israeli passport holders (Jerusalem 
Qol Yisra'el, 1 September 1992; Tel Aviv Bamahane, 23 September 
1992, respectively).  The fact that Darawshah and al-Sani' are 
not only Israeli citizens but also members of Knesset made the 
symbolism of the visit still more salient.  In addition, coverage 
of the visit for Israel radio by Israeli Arab correspondents who 
filed a series of live dispatches from Damascus was another 
unprecedented event. 

   Damascus took pains to prevent the visit from appearing as a 
precedent for normalization with Israel but nonetheless allowed 
the visit's symbolism to be clearly conveyed to the Syrian 
public.  On the one hand, delegation members were forced to 
travel to Syria via Cairo rather than directly from Israel and 
were barred from using Israeli passports (Cairo MENA, 7 March, 
Qol Yisra'el, 1O March).  In addition, Syrian media--and even 
the delegation members--avoided any explicit reference to the 
group's citizenship, referring to the visitors repeatedly as 
"1948 Palestinians."  On the other hand, the political status of 
the delegation members was made perfectly clear on Syrian media. 
For example, Darawshah was quoted by the official Syrian news 
service SANA as saying on arrival in Damascus:  "We represent the 
Palestinians in the Galilee, in the Negev, and other cities" (7 
March).   Moreover, Syrian media's airing of remarks by Darawshah 
even made it clear that he is a Knesset member.  For example, 
after calling in a Damascus television interview for Israeli 
withdrawal from all the occupied territories, Darawshah declared: 
"We say this from Damascus, and we also say the same thing in the 
Knesset in Jerusalem." 

   The visit also brought somewhat greater openness in Syrian 
media's treatment of Israel, as Darawshah was permitted to use 
Syrian television to convey an unusually detailed and relatively 
sympathetic portrayal of the Israeli government, the internal 
Israeli political situation, and Israeli public opinion.  After 
calling in his televised address for an Israeli commitment to 
withdraw from the occupied territories, Darawshah asserted that 
"of late, many people in Israel have begun to express stands 
supportive of this formula" and that their numbers are 
"increasing."  In his 1O March television interview, Darawshah 
depicted the government as interested in making further 
concessions but constrained by domestic political factors.  He 
noted that the current Israeli coalition government "is supported 
by the Arab parties" and that an expanded coalition "would enable 
the government to continue the peace process and to make 
concessions that will respond to the true Arab demands."  He also 
described what he said was "a rational trend" in Israel that is 
"strong indeed" and which believes that "we must end occupation." 
He observed that "the demonstrations staged by tens of thousands 
of people" in the wake of the Hebron massacre "was a joint 
demonstration by the Arab and Jewish pro-peace forces," adding 
that "we participated in it." 

   Although the Syrian television host openly took issue with some 
of Darawshah's remarks--such as the notion that there are doves 
in Israel--the visitor's overall message was evidently agreed on 
in advance, as suggested by the manner in which the interviewer 
appeared to pave the way for Darawshah's comments.  For example, 
he asked Darawshah, "What is new in Zionist thought and 
direction?" 

   Further Visits? 

   The delegation's visit has prompted reports in Israeli media that 
there will be future visits to Syria by other Israeli citizens, 
but there have been no such reports in Syrian media.  Evidently 
based on comments by an Israeli Arab journalist who was part of 
the delegation, Qol Yisra'el reported that Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' had told the group the delegation's visit "is an opening 
for additional visits to Syria by Israelis" (11 March).  Ool 
Yisra'el reported the same day that a delegation led by Ibrahim 
Nimr Husayn, chairman of Israel's National Committee of Arab 
Local Councils, and Ahmad al-Tibi, an Israeli citizen and adviser 
to PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat--"may soon leave for Syria."  Another 
Qol Yisra'el report claimed that a 170-member delegation of Golan 
Druze was being permitted by Israel to visit Damascus to extend 
condolences to al-Asad on his son's death, but that the Syrians 
had not yet approved the visit (15 March). 

   Implications 

   The very fact that Darawshah was given a forum for his more 
favorable statements on Israel suggests that Syria wants the 
visit to be seen as a significant indication of a genuine Syrian 
openness to peace with Israel and as meeting Israeli demands that 
such openness be conveyed more clearly to the Syrian public.  Now 
that the barrier to visits by Israeli Arabs has been lifted, 
there may well be more such visits.  But, considering Syrian 
sensitivity over even the appearance of normalizing relations 
with the Jewish state, and given Syria's repeated objections to 
Israeli demands for a commitment to such normalization in the 
future, similar visits by Jewish citizens of Israel are probably 
not imminent.

SUMMARY 
                                        The Japanese Government appears to be making only slow progress 
on the package of measures it is drawing up to demonstrate to the 
United States that it is willing to open Japanese markets and 
deregulate the Japanese economy.  This slowness is apparently due 
in part to divisions within the government over prospective parts 
of the package, such as increases in long-term investment and tax 
cuts.  Infighting within the coalition government and a growing 
perception that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government is 
ineffective also appear to be slowing progress on the market 
opening package. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   Japanese Government leaders continue to send signals that 
progress on the package of market opening measures that Tokyo is 
drawing up is proceeding slowly and will not be completed by the 
originally projected date at the end of March.   According to the 
16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura told a news conference on 15 March that a final package 
of measures would not be presented to the United States until the 
G-7 Summit in July.  Although earlier reporting indicated that an 
interim package might be ready by the end of March, the 16 March 
Nihon Keizai Shimbun report did not quote Takemura as saying 
anything about such a package.  Similarly, the 16 March Mainichi 
Shimbun quoted Minister of International Trade and Industry 
Hiroshi Kumagai as telling reporters on 15 March that it would be 
"impossible" to complete measures designed to deregulate the 
Japanese economy by the end of March.  Kumagai reportedly added 
that it would "probably take until the end of June to resolve" 
issues connected with the measures. 
   One of the factors delaying progress on the package appears to be 
that the government is divided over several of the most important 
measures in the package.  One of these measures is reportedly a 
plan to increase investment under Japan's current 10-year plan 
for investment in public works projects by about 100 trillion yen 
over the current 430 trillion yen.  This plan appears to have 
support from several cabinet ministers, including Director 
General of the Economic Planning Agency Manae Kubota, 
Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, and Transport Minister 
Shigeru Ito, all of whom belong to the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan (SDPJ), the largest party in the ruling coalition. 
According to a 4 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun report, Kubota came 
out in favor of increasing the investment plan during a 4 March 
news conference, arguing that the increase would help jump start 
the sagging Japanese economy.  A 4 March Kyodo report indicated 
that Igarashi supported Kubota and advocated increasing 
investment to 600 trillion yen.  The 10 March Yomiuri Shimbun 
identified Ito as another supporter of the plan.  In addition, 
Japan's two leading business groups, the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) and the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai) have also supported the increase, 
according to 7 March Kyodo and 8 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun 
reports. 
   The Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, reportedly opposes the 
increase because there are no clear sources of revenue to finance 
it.  The 1O March Yomiuri Shimbun quoted Minister of Finance 
Hirohisa Fujii, a member of the Shinseito, a key party in the 
ruling coalition, as telling a 9 March news conference that 
discussions of the increase, "including financial resources, are 
just beginning and there is no need to change our pace."  The 
paper also cited an unnamed MOF official as stating that "it 
would be irresponsible to make a pledge to expand investment when 
there is no hope of securing financial resources."  According to 
Yomiuri Shimbun, MOF is particularly concerned about increasing 
investment in public works when reform of the tax system is still 
under debate.  In addition, the paper reported that unnamed 
officials in MOF are arguing that there was no need to include an 
increase in the 1O-year investment plan in the measures the 
government is currently drawing up in the wake of the collapse of 
U.S.-Japan trade talks because the United States "has not once 
asked for expansion of public investment during the framework 
talks." 
   Tax Reform 
   Another contentious issue among the market opening measures is 
tax reform, particularly the timing and scope of proposed tax 
cuts.  Some ministries and some bureaucrats, including some 
officials in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), appear to be pressing the coalition to decide quickly on 
a tax reform package to include in the package of market opening 
measures.  An unnamed senior MITI official told an Asahi Shimbun 
reporter on 10 March that the ruling coalition should make a 
"quick decision" about tax system reform and include tax reform 
plans in the market opening measures (Asahi Shimbun, 11 March). 
Speaking at a news conference several days later, MITI Minister 
Hiroshi Kumagai also reportedly pressed for a rapid decision on 
tax cuts, stating that the government must come up with a plan by 
the end of June.  The SDPJ has also been widely reported to be a 
strong supporter of tax cuts. 
   Here too, however, the MOF appears to be blocking progress.  The 
ministry apparently continues to oppose any measures to cut taxes 
unless sources of revenue other than deficit financing bonds can 
be identified to offset the cuts.  During a news conference on 11 
March, Finance Minister Fujii argued that the Japanese Government 
should not make hasty decisions about tax reform or tax cuts only 
in order to include them in the package of measures designed to 
address U.S.-Japan trade friction, according to an 11 March Kyodo 
report. 
   Bureaucratic Resistance 
   Resistance from elsewhere within the government bureaucracy may 
also be stalling work on some of the market opening measures, 
particularly those designed to deregulate the Japanese economy. 
The 10 March Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed officials in the 
Cabinet Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs, which is 
reportedly charged with compiling deregulation measures, as 
complaining that the ministries were "reluctant" to draw up any 
measures beyond those that they have already presented to the 
Hosokawa administration.  Similarly, according to the 10 March 
Yomiuri Shimbun, many government ministries and agencies are 
arguing that they have already implemented as many measures to 
deregulate their operations as they are currently capable of 
doing. 
   Coalition Infighting 
   A fourth factor delaying progress on the market opening package 
appears to be infighting within the ruling coalition government 
over the handling of the package.  In particular, tensions 
between Prime Minister Hosokawa and Shinseito Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa on the one hand and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura 
on the other seem to be spilling over into the handling of the 
market opening package.  According to the 10 March Asahi Shimbun, 
Takemura was charged with overseeing work on the market opening 
package.  However, because of the tension between Hosokawa and 
Takemura, some government offices seem to have been reluctant to 
work with the Chief Cabinet Secretary.  The 10 March Asahi 
Shimbun reported that some ministry officials question whether he 
has Hosokawa's confidence. 
   Tensions between Ozawa and Takemura and also between the 
coalition and the bureaucracy may have derailed Ozawa's planned 
trip to Washington at the end of March to discuss market opening 
measures.  According to the 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun, both Ozawa 
and Takemura appear to have been working from different 
directions to resolve bilateral trade frictions, and Takemura may 
have seen Ozawa's trip as as undercutting Takemura's official 
role in coordinating work on the market opening package.  In 
addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appears to have 
resented Ozawa's plans to get involved in bilateral relations. 
The 13 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted MOFA and Japanese 
Embassy officials as claiming they never heard of plans for 
Ozawa's trip and denying that it had been approved by the 
Japanese Government.  According to the 16 March Nihon Keizai 
Shimbun, MOFA officials were miffed that they were not consulted 
about the trip. 
   Outlook 
   The divisions within the government, the resistance of parts of 
the bureaucracy, and infighting within the coalition will 
probably not only continue to delay progress on the market 
opening measures, but also to limit the scope of any measures 
that are ultimately drawn up.  Some of the steps being debated, 
such as tax reform, involve deep, long-standing divisions among 
the parties in the ruling coalition that will probably be very 
difficult to resolve in the near future.  In order to incorporate 
such steps in the market opening package without threatening the 
unity of the already splintering coalition, the coalition parties 
will probably have to work out compromises that will water down 
the measures to the point that they will have relatively little 
impact.

<H3> <TI>      Shining Path Document Raises New Doubts over Call for Peace </TI></H3>

<TEXT>
SUMMARY 
                             A lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned Shining Path 
leadership, published recently in a leading opposition newspaper, 
provides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace 
proposal made by the insurgents last fall.  While the newspaper 
has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the 
Shining Path, the paper has also stressed that the peace called 
for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical 
retreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not, as President 
Alberto Fujimori has contended, an implicit admission of defeat. 
                         END SUMMARY 
   Although La Republica, a prominent anti-Fujimori daily, provided 
little information on the origins of the "important and unusual" 
document that it published in a special 25 January supplement, it 
assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining 
the Shining Path's "struggle for a peace agreement" was a genuine 
Shining Path statement.  The paper claimed that the "anonymous 
sources" who supplied the "secret" document provided "full 
authentication" and that "experts" consulted by the paper also 
"agreed" that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned 
Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman (La Republica, 26 
January).(See Note 1) 
   (Note 1) La Republica did not assert that the document was 
actually signed by Guzman.  However, the paper did claim that the 
document was "approved" by imprisoned Shining Path Central 
Committee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote 
Barrionuevo, Marta Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez and Rosa 
Angelica Salas de la Cruz (25 January). 
   While the anti-Fujimori daily may have, at least in part, 
published the document to discredit President Fujimori, it 
contended that it was motivated by a desire to provide Peruvians 
with information on the peace proposal that had not been made 
available by the government.  The paper declared that it was 
"clearly" its "duty" to publish the document "given the mantle of 
silence that the government has cast" over the peace negotiations 
(26 January). 
   La Republica's publication of the Shining Path strategy statement 
follows by three months the October 1993 release by the Fujimori 
government of letters from Guzman calling for peace talks with 
the government (Radio Programs del Peru, 1 October 1993; Radio 
and TV, 4 October 1993; Global de Television, 10 October 1993; 
Panamericana Television, 30 October 1993).  The Shining Path 
leadership's sudden willingness to pursue peace talks with the 
government, just as the 31 October national referendum vote was 
approaching, raised questions in the media about whether the 
letters really represented authoritative Shining Path policy [see 
box].(See Note 2) 
   (Note 2) Among other objectives, the narrowly successful 
referendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second 
successive term. 
   Tactical Retreat for Guzman 
   Implicitly rejecting Fujimori's claim that the Shining Path's 
call for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political 
defeat by the insurgents, La Republica concluded that the 
movement's leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than 
a "temporary ceasefire" (25 January).(See Note 3)  According to 
the daily's 26 January editorial, the Shining Path tract "makes 
it clear" that in the eyes of Abimael Guzman a "peace agreement" 
is simply an "armed truce" until after the year 2OOO, at which 
time the Shining Path "would resume its bloodbath."  La Republica 
offered a possible explanation for the insurgents' tactical 
retreat in a 3O January interview with a "military and subversion 
analyst," who suggested-that a temporary withdrawal may offer 
Guzman an opportunity to preserve his authority as political 
leader despite the obvious limitations of beings imprisoned.  Thee 
analyst concluded, therefore, that the insurgents' peace strategy 
represents "an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's leadership" 
and "recognition that circumstances have changed." 
   (Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording 
of Guzman's first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the 
Shining Path "political" leadership "has tacitly admitted that 
the Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in 
confronting the Shining Path" (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October 
1993). 
   Outlook 
   La Republica's assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy 
document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling 
for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders. 
At the same time, however, by concluding that the published 
strategy statement is merely the Shining Path's declaration of 
temporary retreat, the daily has raised new questions about the 
credibility of Fujimori's claim that the call for peace 
represents a victory for the government.  While such doubts are 
unlikely to seriously affect Fujimori's prospects for reelection 
next year, they may have further tarnished the image of the 
Peruvian president, already damaged by his narrow victory in the 
constitutional referendum last October. 
   BOX 
   Media Doubts over Earlier Shining Path Peace Letters 
   -- Following the first Guzman letter calling for peace talks, 
announced by Fujimori at thee United Nations last October (Radio 
Programas del Peru, 1 October 1993), the conservative daily El 
Comercio reported that one seasoned political observer had 
warned" that Guzman's "reported" desire "to reach a peace 
agreement" does not mean there is reason "to claim a victory in 
the ongoing struggle against terrorism" since, according to the 
observer, the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control 
the Shining Path (2 October 1993). 
   -- Following the second Guzman letter, which supplemented the 
call for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for Fujimori's 
economic and political program (Lima Global de Television, 1O 
October 1993), a commentator for the anti-Fujimori weekly Caretas 
wrote that the government was using a "broken" Guzman "in the 
campaign for the 'yes' vote" for the upcoming referendum, adding 
that "it is no coincidence that the letters . . . have come out 
during the 3O days prior" to the 31 October vote (14 October 
1993). 
   -- Responding similarly to the second Guzman letter, an editorial 
in La Republica wondered whether "government representatives," 
working to promote the "yes" vote on the referendum, had not 
"fallen into a trap" by thinking that Shining Path militants 
would take seriously such an "unctuous" call for peace talks as 
appeared in the letter (14 October 1993). 
   -- Also in response to the second letter, Caretas on 14 October 
claimed that Fujimori was "using" Guzman "in the campaign" to win 
the 31 October referendum, noting that "with Guzman's letters" 
calling for peace talks, Fujimori's "promise" to wipe out the 
Shining Path by 1995 "may gain credibility."

<H3> <TI>      Kozyrev Hails Renewed Partnership Af ter Vladivostok Meeting </TI></H3>


</HEADER>


<TEXT>
SUMMARY 
                                        Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hailed the results of his 
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher as 
indicating that the U.S.-Russian partnership is able to surmount 
recent strains and continue to develop.  Kozyrev's reaction 
contrasted with his recent statements on the bilateral 
relationship in which he suggested that Russia was being 
relegated to a subordinate role ill-suited to its capabilities 
and national interests. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   Kozyrev gave an upbeat assessment of the state of U.S.-Russian 
relations following his 14 March meeting with Secretary 
Christopher in Vladivostok.  He expressed satisfaction with the 
results of the meeting, emphasizing that the two countries acted 
as equals during discussions on a broad range of international 
issues.  Dismissing the recent strains in the relationship, 
Kozyrev asserted that "we are partners and we will continue to 
work in this direction" (ITAR-TASS, 14 March).  He told reporters 
that "circles" in both Russia and the United States object to the 
"mature and strategic nature" of the bilateral relationship and 
that "all sorts of hiccups and problems," like ex-President 
Richard Nixon's protocol difficulties or "spy fever," are bound 
to occur, "but we are too serious to give into them" (Interfax, 
14 March). 
   Previous Concerns 
   Prior to the meeting, Kozyrev had expressed concerns about the 
state of U.S.-Russian relations and suggested that adjustments to 
the partnership needed to be made: 
   -- On the eve of his departure from Moscow for Vladivostok, he 
told reporters that the aim of the meeting would be to develop 
the partnership on a "new basis," stressing that there could be 
no question of a "junior" or"senior" partner, or "more freedom 
for one to the detriment of the other."  Rejecting suggestions 
that relations had begun to cool, he noted that there can be 
"differing interests" within the partnership (Moscow radio, 14 
March). 
   -- Similarly, in a 10 March television interview he said that he 
and Christopher would discuss what form of partnership the two 
countries should have, stressing that "we should agree on this so 
it does not cause annoyance" or "come as a surprise when Russia 
comes out with its own initiative."  Noting that Russia feels 
"offended" when U.S. officials launch an initiative that the two 
countries should have agreed upon together, Kozyrev said that 
such differences needed to be "clarified" and a "mechanism for 
interaction" should be "finalized" (Moscow TV, 10 March). 
   -- In an article on U.S.-Russian relations published in Izvestiya 
on 11 March, he also called for adjustments in the relationship, 
while at the same time stressing that "there is no reasonable 
alternative to partnership," which he implied is essential to 
shape a democratic Russia and "transform the unstable post- 
communist world into a lasting democratic one."  He claimed that 
Russian and U.S. national interests concerning "the main world 
problems" not only "do not conflict" but "complement each other." 
He stressed, however, that "certain illusions" such as a Western 
view that "if the Russians are good they must follow us in 
everything," or a Russian view that partnership "is an idyllic 
situation without conflicts and problems" must be abandoned.  He 
contended that partnership "based on common values and 
sympathies" does not mean renouncing "competition and disputes" 
or "a firm or aggressive policy of upholding your own national 
interests."  He cautioned, moreover, that agreeing to play a 
subordinate role would be as "unwarranted as it is politically 
dangerous" for Russia in view of the "extreme nationalist and 
reactionary [domesticj forces" who would "immediately take 
advantage" of such a stance.  Warning that exponents "of gloomy 
self-fulfilling prophecies" would exploit U.S.-Russian disputes 
if they continue, he called upon the two countries to develop a 
strategy and instruments for partnership, and particularly a 
mechanism "for coordinating their actions" on international 
problems. 
   Media Concerns About Relationship 
   Russia media commentary on the Vladivostok meeting has so far 
been sparse, but its thrust has been to dismiss the upbeat 
official assessments of the meeting and continue to focus on 
problems facing the relationship.  A 15 March commentary in the 
reformist newspaper Kommersant-Daily dismissed the official line 
that the meeting "plastered over the cracks" in the relationship, 
asserting that despite "the upbeat tone of the joint statement," 
"more cracks may develop soon."  Commenting on Russia's new 
involvement in the Middle East, the article noted that U.S. 
actions in the region were "emphatically independent from Moscow" 
and warned that "there is an obvious rivalry in Middle East 
peacemaking between Moscow and Washington."  In a 16 March 
article in the reformist newspaper Segodnya, a commentator, 
chiding the "incompetence" of both U.S. and Russian officials, 
contended that the Russian Foreign Ministry, by displaying the 
"most intense activity possible," had created a "legend" about 
"stunning foreign policy successes" that could trigger U.S. ideas 
about "containment."  The commentator said that Washington 
appeared "ready to go to any lengths" to prevent a return to a 
"global nuclear standoff," but warned that the "stabilization in 
bilateral relations" proclaimed at Vladivostok "may be 
shortlived." 
   Before the meeting, Russian media commentators had speculated 
about whether or how badly U.S.-Russian relations had been 
damaged in the wake of controversy over Bosnia, the Ames spy 
case, the Nixon visit, and other differences.  Some commentators, 
echoing Kozyrev, tried to minimize any coolness or weakening in 
the partnership while others, ignoring the Vladivostok meeting, 
contended that the United States had already changed its policy 
toward Russia: 
   -- Echoing the government line, Moscow radio commentaries on 12 
March played down any differences.  Commentator Yuriy Solton said 
Secretary Christopher had refuted reports that Washington was 
dissatisfied with Moscow's active policy in Yugoslavia, noting 
that he had said the United States welcomed Russia's initiatives, 
in Bosnia and elsewhere.  Solton stressed that statements that 
U.S.-Russian relations had become "more strained" or "in poor 
condition" were "absolutely groundless."  Admitting that each 
country "wants to pursue its own end," Solton emphasized that 
Moscow and Washington were doing this "in close cooperation with 
each other" and without any of the "rivalry" of the Cold War. 
Contending that both Moscow and Washington saw their main task as 
consistently improving their relationship, Solton said this task 
would "define" the atmosphere at Vladivostok.  Likewise, 
commentator Valentin Zorin, dismissing the recent disputes as 
occurring in a period marked by "the loss of illusions" on both 
sides, stressed that "global confrontation" between the two 
countries is "a thing of the past" and that "what unites them is 
so much more important that frictions that may emerge." 
   -- In contrast, a 5 March article in the mass-circulation 
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda took issue with Secretary 
Christopher's reported statement that Russia could not act 
unilaterally in responding to appeals for military assistance 
from countries of the former Soviet Union, but could only respond 
under the auspices of the United Nations or other international 
organizations.  The article also alleged that the Secretary had 
commented on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 24 February 
speech, which had spoken of Russia's right to act to ensure 
stability and protect Russians in the near abroad, "with some 
scorn."  Contending that the warnings from Washington were an 
attempt to keep Russia in the inferior state to which it had been 
reduced in recent years, often by the "shortsightedness of 
[Russian] diplomats," and to "guarantee" Washington's 
"superpowerdom," the article advised Kozyrev to have a "serious 
talk" about this with Secretary Christopher in Vladivostok. 
   -- A 12 March article by prominent foreign affairs commentator 
Aleksandr Golts in the Defense Ministry's newspaper, Krasnaya 
Zvezda, titled "The Chill Must Not Develop Into Confrontation," 
warned that "conflicts and microcrises" in U.S.-Russian relations 
had been following each other "virtually without interruption and 
in ever-increasing intensity."  Criticizing Washington for, among 
other things, intensifying U.S. involvement in CIS affairs in 
order to prevent the revival of a dreaded Russian "empire," Golts 
charged that such an approach not only was inappropriate for 
states "that only yesterday were calling themselves allies," but 
went "beyond the bounds of common sense" and could scuttle 
efforts to settle conflicts.  Taking issue-with Secretary 
Christopher's remarks on Russian peacekeeping efforts, Golts 
asked with evident sarcasm if the United States allowed its own 
freedom of action to be restricted "anywhere at all" by 
consultations with international organizations.  Golts contended 
that Russia's active involvement in trying to end conflicts both 
in the former Soviet republics and elsewhere was important not 
only because Moscow was "offering sensible ways to end the 
suffering of thousands," but also because it strengthened 
Russia's self-esteem by demonstrating that Russia was a state 
that could resolve global problems.  While asserting that US.- 
Russian differences were "not insoluble," Golts warned that 
neither Russia nor the United States can afford the "luxury of a 
new confrontation" while they search for a new model of mutual 
relations, and he called upon both states to use the Vladivostok 
meeting to "prevent undesirable developments." 
   -- A 12 March article in the pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya 
headlined that U.S.-Russian relations are experiencing "the most 
serious crisis of recent years."  In describing the reasons for 
the "time of coolness," the article supported Moscow's "proper" 
response to the Nixon visit and diplomatic activism in the 
Balkans, the Middle East, and the "near abroad," but fretted over 
how Washington might react to such policy "changes."  For 
example, the article cited a "Western diplomat" as complaining 
that after the reformers' poor showing in the December 
parliamentary elections, the Yeltsin administration adopted the 
"slogans of the opposition," adding it was difficult to know who 
was making foreign policy pronouncements--Kozyrev or Communist 
leader Gennadiy Zyuganov.  Ending on an optimistic note, the 
article reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry would "strive 
to avoid confrontation with Washington" at Vladivostok and quoted 
an "informed" ministry source as saying "there are no major 
reasons for exacerbating" U.S.-Russian relations. 
   -- Ignoring the upcoming meeting entirely in a 12 March article 
in procommunist newspaper Pravda, commentator Vladislav Drobkov 
reported on what he called "Washington's change of direction" and 
"campaign" to reevalute relations with Russia and develop ties 
with other countries of the former Soviet Union.  Claiming that 
all his Washington interlocutors had "invariably" said that 
"coolness" had set in between Moscow and Washington, Drobkov 
backed up his argument by quoting alleged statements about Russia 
by U.S. officials.  For example, he quoted Senator Richard Lugar 
as saying "[The United States] is not Russia's partner, we are 
bitter rivals." 
   Implications 
   Kozyrev's efforts to play down any substantive differences with 
Washington probably reflect Moscow's determination to keep 
bilateral relations on track, but his emphasis on achieving 
equality in the relationship indicates an equally strong 
determination that Russia not be relegated to what Russians would 
view as an inferior role.  The media's continuing preoccupation 
with the differences and disputes between Washington and Moscow 
suggests an ongoing tension between pride that Russia is resuming 
what is perceived as its rightful role as a global power and 
concern that a confrontation with Washington might revive a Cold 
War-like climate.

SUMMARY 
                                        The Japanese Government appears to be interpreting portions of 
the 12 March agreement to expand Motorola's access to the 
Japanese cellular phone market in ways that differ significantly 
from the reported U.S. reading of the accord.  Tokyo's divergent 
interpretation may reflect an attempt to keep the agreement from 
serving as a precedent for Tokyo's acceptance of targets for 
measuring its trade performance in other sectors. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   In comments to the Japanese press, a number of Japanese 
Government officials have taken issue with reported statements by 
various U.S. officials on the 12 March cellular telephone 
agreement.  These differences with U.S. officials' 
interpretations focus on language that commits the Japanese 
Government to ensuring that the Japanese telecommunications 
company Nippon Idou Tsushin (IDO) carries out its pledges to 
increase market access for the U.S. firm Motorola. 
   -- According to the 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, when the 
agreement was announced on 12 March, Vice Minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications Takenori Kanzaki specifically denied that the 
Japanese Government had accepted any sort of numerical targets. 
   --  The 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun also reported that Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) General Affairs Councillor 
Masahito Tani on 13 March took issue with comments reportedly 
made by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that the 
agreement represented a victory for the U.S. Government's 
results-oriented policy in dealing with U.S.-Japan trade issues. 
Tani reportedly said that in the Japanese Government's view, 
IDO's commitment to increase the number of base stations capable 
of handling Motorola equipment was "neither a numerical target 
nor an objective criterion.  It is nothing but a private 
corporation's contract." 
   -- According to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Vice Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Kunihiko Saito attempted to play down a clause 
in the agreement between the U.S. and Japanese Governments which 
states that Tokyo will use "all available measures" to ensure 
that IDO fulfills the agreement.  The paper quoted Saito as 
stating that "All this means is something like conducting regular 
checks on the degree of progress being made in dealings between 
the private companies."  Saito also reportedly told Kyodo on 14 
March that the Japanese Government was in no position to 
intervene in the affairs of private companies and asserted that 
any difference in the U.S. and Japanese interpretation of the 
agreement was because of Washington's misunderstanding of the 
accord. 
   -- Similarly, Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications 
Futoshi Shirai, in comments to Kyodo on 14 March, took issue with 
reported remarks by U.S. officials, stating that the Japanese 
Government had in no way agreed to guarantee that IDO would meet 
the target of building 159 base stations using Motorola 
technology as stipulated in the cellular phone agreement. 
   -- An unidentified senior Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry MITI) official reportedly told Kyodo on 15 March that 
the Japanese Government had provided no guarantee that IDO would 
fulfill its commitments. 
   Concern Over Precedent 
   One of the major reasons for the Japanese Government's efforts to 
limit the way in which the cellular phone agreement is 
interpreted appears to be a concern that the United States will 
attempt to use the agreement as a model for setting numerical 
targets for market opening measures in other sectors.  A 15 March 
Kyodo report quoted an unidentified senior MITI official as 
stating that Japan could not accept any interpretation of the 
agreement that would lead to the setting of numerical targets. 
According to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MITI is 
particularly worried that the United States might try to use the 
model of the cellular telephone agreement in the auto sector, 
asking Japanese Government to provide guarantees for voluntary 
targets for imports of U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts that 
Japanese automobile companies are reportedly currently drawing 
up.  In a 16 March speech, MITI Vice Minister for International 
Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu reportedly specifically stated that the 
cellular telephone agreement could not be applied to the 
automobile sector.  According to a 16 March Kyodo report, 
Okamatsu stated that while the telecommunications sector was 
regulated by government licenses, the auto and auto parts 
industries were "completely free trade areas" which could not be 
controlled by the government. 
   The cancellation of a planned visit to Washington by Ichiro 
Ozawa, Secretary General of one of the key parties in the ruling 
coalition and the Japanese politician widely reported to have 
been instrumental in framing the cellular phone accord may also 
reflect the Japanese Government's desire to limit the impact of 
the cellular phone agreement.  The 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun 
quoted senior members of Ozawa's party and other Japanese 
officials as stating that the United States pinned too high hopes 
on Ozawa, expecting that he would come to Washington with "a bag 
packed with a lot of gifts." 
   Outlook 
   Japanese officials will probably do everything possible to keep 
the cellular telephone pact from serving as a precedent for the 
setting of numerical targets in other sectors.  The difference in 
interpretation with the United States, however, has the potential 
to create further friction in bilateral relations.  In the past, 
Tokyo has differed with the United States over the wording of 
such agreements as the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement 
and the agreement setting up the U.S.-Japan framework talks 
reached by former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President 
Clinton in July, 1993.  In the semiconductor agreement, Tokyo has 
consistently argued that the United States has misinterpreted a 
pledge that the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor 
market would reach 20 percent by the fourth quarter of 1992 as a 
formal commitment, when the Japanese government intended it only 
as a goal.  Similarly, in the framework agreement, the Japanese 
government has consistently disagreed with the United States over 
how to define the "objective criteria" which the agreement stated 
would be established to measure Japan's trade performance.

SUMMARY 
                                        Reflecting concern within the European Union (EU) that the U.S. 
revival of the Super 301 trade law provision could eventually 
have a negative effect on Europe and that U.S. bilateral deals 
with Japan could hurt European business, EU leaders reacted 
sharply to the U.S. move and its threat of sanctions against 
Japan.  Apparently anxious not to be left out of any deals, 
however, EU leaders, as well as French and German officials, have 
tempered their criticism and urged a "trilateral" U.S.-EU- 
Japanese approach to efforts to remove barriers in Japan.  French 
and German media likewise criticized U.S. trade policy measures 
but have revealed a strong current of sympathy for U.S. efforts 
to open Japan's markets. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   EU Commissioner Leon Brittan, along with French and German 
leaders, have criticized the U.S. reinstatement of its Super 301 
trade law and the U.S. threat of sanctions against Japan, 
charging that the measures run counter to multilateral agreements 
and that they border on "managed trade" because they aim at 
setting numerical market share targets: 
   --EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan charged that the U.S. 
strategy of negotiating market shares with Japan posed a risk for 
Europe, suggesting that if the Japanese complied it would be at 
Europe's expense (AFP, Reuter, 17 February).  Saying that the 
U.S. threat to impose sanctions amounted to "managed trade," he 
called the U.S. decision to  reinstate Super 301 "disappointing" 
and said the EU would be studying the move carefully to see if it 
violated U.S. trade commitments (AFP, 4 March).  On 10 March, 
Brittan charged that the United States was pursuing 
"counterproductive and discriminatory tactics" in the trade 
policy dispute with Japan (Reuter, 10 March). 
   --EU foreign ministers meeting on 7 March issued a statement 
saying Super 301 was "contrary to the spirit" of the GATT and 
calling on the EU Commission to "thoroughly investigate" whether 
the U.S. trade sanctions against Japan are a violation of GATT 
(AFP, 7 March). 
   French and German Reactions 
   As has charactistically occurred in recent trade differences 
between the United States and its European allies, the official 
French reaction to the reinstatement of Super 301 was more blunt 
and direct than the German response: 
   --French Prime Minister Balladur, tying Super 301 to U.S. threats 
to impose sanctions on French goods in retaliation for France's 
blocking of U.S. fish exports, accused the United States of "not 
playing by the rules" of international trade, but he also hoped a 
"reasonable" solution could be found (AFP, 5 March). 
   --In an interview with Le Figaro following his 9-12 March trip to 
Japan, French Trade and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said 
France "condemns any kind of unilateralism" such as the U.S. 
reinstatement of the "Super 301," calling instead for "dialogue." 
He also said Europe would take care to ensure that settlement of 
the U.S.-Japan trade dispute did not have "adverse effects" on 
European exports (15 March). 
   --In contrast, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's 
opposition to U.S. trade measures has been very muted.  He told 
an interviewer on 15 February that he "opposed numerical targets" 
because they were "clearly against GATT" and free trade (Reuter, 
15 February).  Similarly, on 4 March, he said Germany wanted 
"better access" to Asian markets but rejected "unilateral action" 
such as introducing sanctions because they "cannot be reconciled" 
with the Uruguay Round (DPA, Reuter 4 March). 
   Seeking Cooperation 
   In spite of their critical remarks, EU leaders have also 
indicated a desire to defuse the trade conflicts and to join with 
the United States in opening up Japan's markets, stressing that 
they prefer a nonconfrontational approach that focuses on ways to 
make European products attractive to the Japanese market rather 
than merely on gaining market shares: 
   --On 4 March, Brittan repeated an EU proposal he had made on 17 
February for a "trilateral" EU-U.S.-Japan approach to opening 
Japan's markets that would identify and remove specific Japanese 
barriers and would accept global targets, but not quotas or 
targets for individual sectors.  Such an approach would be in 
line with the EU's approach exemplified by its "Gateway to Japan" 
initiative, aimed at making European goods more attractive to the 
Japanese and using diplomatic pressure to overcome market access 
difficulties (AFP, 4 March, 17 February). 
   --Longuet seemed to adopt a more conciliatory posture toward the 
U.S. in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses on 9 March. 
Justifying the EU foreign ministers' "rather sof t condemnation" 
of the Super 301 action at their 7 March meeting, he also 
remarked that Kantor had "let us know" that the U.S. decision on 
Super 301 had been made to avoid more radical measures, given the 
views of the U.S. Congress.  Longuet reportedly also had 
expressed some sympathy for the U.S. threat of sanctions against 
Japan, telling Reuter on 3 March that the United States was 
"right to remind the Japanese that trade is not a one-way 
business" (Reuter, 4 March). 
   --Rexrodt also said that Germany was "alongside" the United 
States in pressing Japan to open its markets and was doing its 
best to convince the Japanese that they need "to restructure 
their society and their business structures."  Germany would 
discuss "every measure and every pressure" on the Japanese, 
insisting that they must not just "bow and promise" but must also 
make "commitments," he said.  Nevertheless, he added, "numerical 
targets" were "clearly against GATT" and free trade (Reuter, 15 
February). 
   French Media Reaction 
   French media reaction reflected concern that U.S. trade measures 
could also be aimed at Europe but media commentary also indicated 
some sympathy for, and even approval of, U.S. pressure on Japan. 
   --The influential Liberation of 4 March said President Clinton 
had pulled out the "heaviest weapon" from his "arsenal," Super 
301, following pressure from industrial lobbies and Congress to 
force the Japanese to reduce their trade surplus.  It also noted 
that while EU countries are publicly criticizing the unilateral 
U.S. approach, some leaders "in private understand the American 
anger." 
   --The business daily Les Echos of 7 March voiced concern that 
U.S. Super 301 could be "aimed at Europe or any other country" 
and said it was "unlikely" the United States would give up any of 
its "bilateral defense weapons in international trade.  A 
commentary in the 16 February issue, on the other hand, viewed 
the U.S. threat of sanctions against Japan as a "sign of 
moderation" because it provided time "to find a compromise" and 
expressed the hope that it would serve as a "warning shot" to 
Japan without opening "excessive hostilities." 
   German Media Reaction 
   Although the leading German press criticized U.S. reinstatement 
of Super 301 as being contrary to the spirit of GATT and as a 
possible threat to European trade with Japan, some papers also 
expressed sympathy for the U.S. moves to break down Japanese 
trade barriers: 
   --The influential German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine called U.S. 
concern about the "horrendous" Japanese trade surpluses 
"understandable" but said that minimum import quotas are a "bad 
relapse" into "state-regulated foreign trade" (7 March).  It is 
"clear and natural," the daily said,  that Washington is urging 
the Japanese to remove their barriers to import competition, but 
the United States is trying to "forcibly" clear a path for U.S. 
firms and "manipulate trade," taking measures that "ignore" GATT 
principles (14 March). 
   --The business daily Handelsblatt noted that U.S. patience was 
"apparently exhausted" because of the lack of progress in 
reducing Japanese trade surpluses.  Nevertheless, it called such 
"unilateral measures," incompatible with the "complexities" of 
world trade, saying that the "dangerous aspect" is that Super 301 
can be used not only against Japan but also against other trading 
partners (7 March). 
   --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau of 19 February said 
Europe "should not be fooled."  The U.S. "first and foremost" 
wants access to the Japanese consumers for itself and not for 
everybody, it charged, saying that President Clinton "spoke for 
the United States and not for GATT."

SUMMARY 

                               Despite persistent Jordanian efforts to repair relations with 
Saudi Arabia--seriously strained since the Gulf crisis--King 
Husayn's religious pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina on 8 March 
yielded a sharp rebuff when King Fahd pointedly failed to receive 
Husayn and his top-level delegation.  Indicating official 
Jordanian embarrassment over the Saudi snub, subsequent Jordanian 
media treatment of the visit suggests an effort to limit the 
political fallout by putting the best face possible on the visit. 

                           END SUMMARY 

   Although King Husayn officially traveled to Saudi Arabia to 
perform the 'umra, or minor pilgrimage, he evidently hoped to 
effect a public reconciliation with Fahd and overcome Saudi anger 
over Husayn's alleged sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf crisis. 
Indicative of the trip's political dimension, a large delegation 
accompanied the king on his first visit to Saudi Arabia following 
a four-year hiatus. In addition to Princes 'Abdallah, Talal, and 
Ghazi; the prime minister; the chief of the Royal Court; the 
king's adviser; the chief chamberlain; and the king's private 
secretary, the delegation included the chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and "a number of top state and military 
officials" (Amman radio, 8 March). 
   Moreover, in the months prior to King Husayn's arrival in Saudi 
Arabia on 8 March, the Jordanian leadership made many flattering 
and conciliatory references to Saudi Arabia, revealing Amman's 
strong desire for a rapid reconciliation and laying the 
groundwork for the king's visit. 
   --During a news conference in Washington in January, the king 
said he hoped Amman-Riyadh relations would "return to their 
warmth."  Although he has always stopped short of an official, 
public apology for Jordan's refusal to join the international 
coalition against Iraq--something Riyadh evidently expects as a 
condition for restoring ties--Husayn said that he hoped "our 
brethren in Saudi Arabia will realize that we never meant them 
any harm, nor did we cause them any harm at all" (Amman TV, 27 
January). 
   --In a departure from previous Jordanian criticism of Saudi 
sponsorship of renovation projects for Islamic shrines in 
Jerusalem (See Note 1), Crown Prince Hassan welcomed Saudi 
Arabia's announced campaign to raise funds for the renovation of 
the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosques, lavishing praise on 
the "initiative" by King Fahd, which "clearly contributes to 
realizing Arab solidarity" (Amman radio, 22 February).  Hassan's 
remarks were echoed by the daily Al-Dustur, which hailed the 
"well-timed Saudi step" (23 February). 
   (Note 1) In May 1992, Jordan's information minister responded to 
news of a Saudi donation to UNESCO on behalf of Jerusalem's 
Islamic shrines with a warning against "any attempt to weaken the 
legitimacy of the Jordanian role in Jerusalem" (Amman radio, 20 
May 92).  Likewise, the English-language weekly The Star 
criticized the Saudi move as "myopic and rash" (21-27 May 92), 
while the weekly Shihan denounced Riyadh's contribution to the 
shrines as "a direct threat to Jerusalem and its Arab character" 
(16 May 92). 
   At the time of the trip itself, monitored reports on Husayn's 
pilgrimage broadcast by Jordan's state-run radio and television 
refrained from discussing the political potential of the visit, 
focusing instead on factual accounts of the king's religious 
activities.  However, articles appearing in the semi-independent 
press during the king's pilgrimage undoubtedly fueled speculation 
about a Saudi-Jordanian reconciliation. 
   --A column in the daily Sawt al-Sha'b indicated optimistic 
expectations, stating that "there is no denying we entertain high 
hopes" for a reconciliation, and that "we fervently hope to see 
Amman and Riyadh embrace in a long hug after a long 
estrangement."   The column also suggested that Arabs would 
suffer "further ignominy, humiliation, and division" without 
moves toward reconciliation (9 March). 
   --On the day of King Husayn's departure for Jeddah, the weekly 
Al-'Ahd, organ of the conservative al-'Ahd political party, 
speculated about "the meetings that will be held" during the 
king's visit, adding that Jordanian "nationalists" had "hope and 
confidence in our ability to put the Gulf crisis behind us."  The 
article underscored "the big role the Saudi brothers can play" in 
giving Arab-Israeli peace negotiations added impetus (8 March). 
   --An editorial in the daily Al-Ra'y on 9 March--evidently 
published prior to the news that Fahd did not meet Husayn- 
-optimistically opined that the king's minor pilgrimage would not 
be "limited to the religious aspect in terms of its importance," 
and anticipated that the Jordanian and Saudi "brothers" would 
find the "right moment to meet, settle differences, and reaffirm 
that they have absorbed the lessons of past stages and the 
dangers of each upcoming stage." 

   Damage Control 

   Smarting from the Saudi snub and sensitive to possible public 
disappointment, the Jordanian government has not been observed to 
comment officially on the trip.  Media reports on the visit have 
been meager, although this was partially because of the non- 
publication of most Jordanian newspapers over the 'Id al-Fitr 
holiday.  Those reports that disclosed official disappointment 
with the trip cited only unnamed government sources, while other 
articles evidently sought to mask the negative outcome by playing 
up the religious nature of the king's sojourn.  Still other 
reports claimed favorable results from the trip, giving King 
Husayn credit for his initiative and indicating that the ball was 
now in the Saudi court. 
   --The English-language daily Jordan Times cited a source "close 
to the palace" as expressing disappointment that "the king was 
reaching out in reconciliation, but King Fahd did not respond." 
Although there was no monitored official confirmation of a 
planned Fahd-Husayn meeting, the Times cited official sources as 
having told the paper "privately" that the two kings had been 
slated to meet on 8 March for the first time since the outbreak 
of the Gulf crisis.  Another anonymous "well-placed source" cited 
by the Times said the king was aware his trip to Saudi Arabia 
would be a "purely spiritual visit."  Nonetheless, the same 
official credited the king with having broken "a psychological 
barrier" with Saudi Arabia by making the trip after four years of 
staying away (10 March). 
   --The weekly Akhbar Al-Usbu' published an unsigned article 
playing down the disappointing outcome of Husayn's visit, and 
giving the king credit for his effort.  Jordan, it said, had 
chosen to rise "above the pan-Arab wounds to heal the rift which 
afflicted the Arab homeland after the Gulf war, for the sake of 
restoring Arab solidarity and reactivating joint Arab action that 
can confront the serious challenges threatening the Arab and 
Islamic nation."  The king's "gesture," it noted, was "not new," 
but stemmed from "the continuous role the Hashemites have played 
in unifying the Arabs and Muslims throughout the ages" (10 
March). 

   Saudi Media Response 

   In line with the government's silence, official Saudi media were 
not observed to report or comment on King Husayn's arrival, 
pilgrimage activities, or departure.  Domestic Saudi newspapers 
were similarly observed to contain no mention of the king's 
visit.  Curiously, two London-based Saudi-owned papers--which 
exercise somewhat more editorial flexibility than their domestic 
counterparts--evidently anticipated that a Fahd-Husayn meeting 
would occur, perhaps influenced by speculation on the matter 
within the diplomatic community.  Al-Sharq Al-Awsat on 8 March 
quoted King Husayn's alleged "personal apologies to King Fahd" 
for their adversarial Gulf war relationship,  while Al-Hayah on 9 
March actually reported that King Fahd had "received the 
Jordanian monarch" the previous evening "in holy Mecca." 

   Implications 

   The public optimism regarding hopes for a reconciliation with 
Saudi Arabia appears to have embarrassed the government in the 
wake of the king's return to Jordan without having met with King 
Fahd.  Although prospects for a reconciliation were never 
officially confirmed, the widespread media speculation clearly 
indicated that a Fahd-Husayn meeting had been expected by the 
government--particularly since Fahd had received former Gulf war 
adversary PLO Chairman 'Arafat during the latter's minor 
pilgrimage in January.  Nevertheless, Fahd's decision not to 
receive Husayn, as well as the complete silence of Saudi Arabia's 
official media, suggest that Saudi Arabia will expect further 
measures--such as a more explicit public expression of Jordanian 
contrition for its stance during the Gulf war--if the 
longstanding impasse is to be broken.  Following this episode, 
any further attempts by King Husayn to mend fences with Saudi 
Arabia will likely be through private and diplomatic channels, 
and will carry a low media profile--at least until the prospects 
for success are guaranteed by Riyadh.

SUMMARY 

                               President Boris Yeltsin continues to face serious opposition from 
certain regions in his efforts to define a division of central 
and local authority.  Several republics failed to approve the 
federal constitution in the 12 December referendum and have since 
taken fresh steps toward enacting republic constitutions that 
claim greater powers for local authorities.  In the case of 
Tatarstan, Moscow has dealt with the conflict by signing a 
bilateral treaty after prolonged negotiations, but it is not yet 
clear if Moscow is willing to conclude such treaties with other 
republics. 

                           END SUMMARY 

   Rejection of the federal constitution by voters in several 
republics in the 12 December referendum and recent moves to 
approve republic constitutions that assert regional authority in 
ways incompatible with the Federation constitution demonstrate 
that the republics' constitutional conflict with Moscow remains a 
serious issue: 

   -- The Tuvan republic held a referendum to approve the republic's 
constitution on 12 December, the same day as the referendum on 
the federal constitution.  While the Tuvan constitution, approved 
by 53.9 percent of the voters in the referendum, formally 
acknowledges the republic to be part of the Russian Federation 
(Ostankino TV, 27 October 1993), it also "envisages the right to 
self-determination" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993).  It provides 
for a 32-member republic parliament, the Supreme Hural, whose 
membership was also elected on 12 December. The republic's 
constitution gives parliament authority to decide "problems of 
war and peace, borders," and to suspend Russian Federation 
legislative acts which "go beyond the powers envisaged by the 
constitution of the Russian Federation, the federal treaty or 
other agreements" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993).  Only 30.5 
percent of Tuvan voters approved the federal constitution on 12 
December. 

   -- The constitution of the republic of Bashkortostan, adopted on 
24 December 1993 by 206 out of 227 republic Supreme Soviet 
deputies (Segodnya, 28 December 1993; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 
December 1993), claims precedence over the federal constitution, 
at least in some provisions.  The Bashkortostan constitution 
provides that the republic will voluntarily yield to Moscow 
certain powers pertaining to interstate relations under terms of 
an as yet to be negotiated treaty with the Russian Federation but 
retain authority over its judicial system and prosecutor's 
office, independent foreign economic and foreign policy affairs, 
and entrance into interstate associations (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 
28 December 1993).  The republic's constitution also asserts "the 
land, its contents, natural wealth, and other natural resources 
on its territory" to be "the property of its multinational 
people" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 December 1993).  Fifty-three 
percent of the Bashkortostan electorate voted against the federal 
constitution in the 12 December referendum (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 
16 December). 

   -- Tatarstan also rejected the federal constitution on 12 
December as fewer than fourteen percent of the republic's 
electorate participated in the referendum (Izvestiya, 14 December 
1993).  In November 1992, the republic Supreme Soviet approved a 
republic constitution that states that Tatarstan's laws "take 
precedence throughout its territory, unless they conflict with 
international commitments of the republic," and that the republic 
constitution "is an act of the highest legal force of direct 
effect" and declares the republic a "sovereign state" and 
"subject of international law" (Sovetskaya Tatariya, 13 December 
1992).  The constitution associates the republic with the Russian 
Federation only within the parameters of a bilateral treaty that 
divides Federation and republic authority (see box) (Interfax, 6 
November 1992). 

   Moscow is also engaged in a constitutional conflict with 
Sverdlovsk oblast over the oblast's bid to claim republic status. 
Under the leadership of former oblast Governor Eduard Rossel, 
residents of the Sverdlovsk region are seeking formal recognition 
for the Urals republic, favored by 83 percent of voters (with a 
55 percent voter turnout) in a 25 April 1993 non-binding 
referendum (Interfax, 1 July 1993) and proclaimed by a decision 
of the oblast soviet (Izvestiya, 3 July 1993).  Despite being 
fired by Yeltsin for backing the move to claim republic status, 
Rossel was given a vote of confidence as 61.87 percent of the 
Sverdlovsk Oblast electorate endorsed him for a seat in the 
Federation Council (Interfax, 13 December 1993).  Rossel has 
succeeded in getting a debate on approval of the constitution of 
the Urals Republic on the Federation Council's agenda (Izvestiya, 
10 February).  Claiming that the establishment of the Urals 
Republic and adoption of its constitution were made "in full 
conformity" with the federal constitution, Rossel asserted he is 
"ready" to appeal to the Constitutional Court to approve the 
republic constitution (ITAR-TASS, 17 January). 

   Tatarstan Negotiations 

   Moscow's response to the conflict with Tatarstan has been to 
engage in protracted negotiations with the republic, talks which 
have ended in mutual agreement on a treaty.  Culminating three 
years of negotiations with Kazan, Moscow's future relations with 
the republic will be based on the bilateral "Treaty on the Mutual 
Delegation of Authority and Terms of Reference," signed on 15 
February by Yeltsin and Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev 
(ITAR-TASS, 15 February) (See Box). 

   The Moscow-Kazan bilateral treaty is supplemented by twelve 
intergovernmental agreements.  According to Kommersant-Daily, the 
agreements concern oil production, ownership matters, defense 
industries, customs, transportation of oil products, 
environmental cooperation, education, the budget, banking system, 
foreign economic activity, crime, and military organization (5 
February). 
   Treaty as a Model 

   Since the signing of the Russia-Tatarstan bilateral treaty, 
Yeltsin and Shakhray have hailed the treaty as a "precedent" for 
negotiating similar agreements with other components: 

   -- Following the treaty signing, Yeltsin stressed that "treaties 
of this kind are, basically, the sole constitutional way of 
removing contradictions between the Russian Federation 
constitution and republic constitutions in a civilized way, 
without twisting anyone's arm" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February). 

   -- Shakhray was quoted as saying that "there is a legal and 
economic possibility of the conclusion of treaties similar to 
that with Tataria with each component of the Russian Federation," 
based on "Article 11 of the Constitution . . . clause 3 of which 
says that the terms of reference shall be delineated "by this 
constitution and the Federal and other treaties" (Segodnya, 25 
February).  According to a 15 February Interfax report, Shakhray 
would like to see Federal Assembly adoption of a law on power- 
sharing as a way of regulating the process. 

   Detractors characterize the Russia-Tatarstan treaty as a threat 
to federalism, saying it will complicate future center-regional 
relations and unacceptably weaken the center: 

   -- Sergey Baburin, State Duma deputy and leader of the 
unregistered "Russian Way" faction, viewed the treaty as a threat 
to federalism and submitted a Duma proposal "On Guarantees of the 
Federal System and Provision for Territorial Integrity of the 
Russian Federation On Account of the Signing of the Treaty with 
Tatarstan," which apparently failed for lack of votes. 
Explaining his proposal, Baburin was quoted as saying that "for 
the first time the state signed a treaty with a part of itself" 
and that the treaty presents "a great danger because it means the 
state's transition to a confederative system" (Interfax, 16 
February). 

   -- In a 16 February article, Segodnya commentator Vladimir Todres 
suggested that pursuing separate treaties for each region would 
produce gridlock and confusion.  He wrote, "Russia has a further 
87 regions, not counting Chechnya.  The question "If the Tatars 
can do it, why can't we?" is quite natural.  Why should the other 
regional leaders swallow this treaty in silence?" 

   Other Republics 

   While Moscow and Kazan were putting the finishing touches on the 
treaty, Moscow still appeared to be pressing the other republics 
to revise their constitutions, remaining noncommital on a 
willingness to conclude other treaties. 

   In the case of at least one republic, Bashkortostan, Moscow 
appears to have opened negotiations on a set of agreements 
similar to those it signed with Tatarstan.  According to republic 
Prime Minister Anatoliy Kopsov, the signing of the treaty with 
Tatarstan "gave the latest impetus" to the resumption of talks 
between Moscow and Bashkortostan.  He said that the negotiators 
were working on a treaty and a package of bilateral economic, 
social, and cultural agreements, some of which are "practically 
ready for signing" (Interfax, 17 March).  Moscow officials have 
not been observed to comment on these negotiations. 

   Before the Moscow-Kazan treaty signing, Moscow urged 
constitutional reform in a unilateral effort to rein in the 
regions.  Members of the Council of Heads of Administrations 
under President Yeltsin had reportedly advised the formation of a 
commission that would bring the constitutions of republics "in 
line" with the federal constitution.  The Council cited "a number 
of norms" in which component constitutions "contradict" the 
federation's.  Nikolay Medvedev, head of the presidential 
Administration's Directorate for Work with the Territories, 
placed "special emphasis" on twelve republics that still have 
"old" constitutions (See Note 1), and five newly established 
republics, Adygey, Altai, Ingushetia, Karachayevo-Cherkessia, and 
Khakassiya, which do not yet have their own constitutions 
(Interfax, 6 January; Russian Television, 6 January). 

   (Note 1)  To illustrate his point, Medvedev reportedly cited the 
republic of Mordovia, which "by its constitution is still a 
soviet socialist republic" (Interfax, 6 January).  The Mordovian 
SSR has since been renamed the Republic of Mordovia (Ostankino 
TV, 26 January). 

   Republics' Response 

   To date, only a few republics have signaled willingness to amend 
their draft constitutions in response to Moscow's objections and 
the criticism from the Council of Heads of Administrations: 

   -- In its 11 January issue, Izvestiya reported that the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic's parliament approved a package of 
proposals from republic President Valeriy Kokov to "alter" and 
"supplement" the republic constitution so that it complies with 
the federal constitution. 

   -- According to a 19 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta article, the 
Komi Republic constitution "corresponds" with the federal 
constitution.  Adopted on 17 February by a majority vote of the 
republic Supreme Soviet, the republic constitution proclaims Komi 
as a sovereign formation within the Russian Federation (Radio 
Rossii, 17 February).  According to Russian TV, even before its 
adoption the draft constitution for the Komi Republic was 
recognized as an attempt to incorporate "the principles of 
territorial sovereignty on the basis of Russian federalism" (24 
January). 

   -- In a 27 February referendum, 97.6 percent of voters approved 
the constitution of Ingushetia, which declares the republic a 
"democratic, rule-of-law state, part of the Russian Federation on 
a treaty basis" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 2 March).  Employees of the 
republic Justice Ministry had underscored the need to put the 
Ingush constitution in line with the federal constitution before 
the scheduled referendum (ITAR-TASS, 23 January).  Ingushetia's 
conciliatory response may be linked to the federation 
government's mediating role in an Ingush-North Ossetian 
territorial dispute as an attempt to gain the federation 
government's favor. 

   -- The republic of Buryatia reportedly passed a new constitution 
that appears to follow the model set by Tatarstan.  Having 
received a unanimous vote of confidence by the republic Supreme 
Soviet, Buryatia's constitution reportedly states that the 
republic is a "sovereign, democratic, law-governed state within 
the Russian Federation," and that its relations with Moscow will 
be "built on a constitutional, treaty-based foundation" 
(Ostankino TV, 22 February). 

   -- According to republic Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman 
Bagaudin Akhmedov, the new constitution of Dagestan calls for 
"the building of a single, sovereign, democratic state within the 
Russian Federation (Segodnya, 1 March). 
   Implications 

   Despite Yeltsin's and Shakhray's endorsements of the Moscow-Kazan 
bilateral treaty as a model, it is not clear that Moscow is 
actually prepared to conclude similar treaties with the other 
republics.  Although Shakhray has reemerged as a player in 
nationality affairs after a period of relative eclipse, his 
position within the government remains clouded, somewhat diluting 
the value of his endorsement.  The other republics, probably 
viewing the treaty as a success for Kazan, will likely press 
Moscow to give them a similar deal. 

Box 

                    The Moscow-Kazan Treaty: 
                       Who won? Who lost? 

   Officials have made conflicting statements on the specifics on 
the bilateral treaty, but media reportage suggests that both 
Russia and Tatarstan made concessions in the treaty's final 
draft: 

   -- Although Tatarstan may now "take part in international 
relations and foreign economic activity" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February) 
and--according to republic President Mintimer Shaymiyev--the 
treaty "recognizes the right to self-determination . . . and 
defense of sovereignty" (ITAR-TASS, 16 February), the words 
sovereign state" and "subject of international law" were 
reportedly removed from the treaty draft (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17 
February). 

   -- The treaty reportedly gives Tatarstan "exclusive" ownership 
and use of the land on its territory and its contents, and all 
property (ITAR-TASS, 16 February). 

   -- According to a 17 February Krasnaya Zvezda article, Tatarstan 
reportedly had to abandon its plans to establish a "single- 
channel" taxation system in favor of the "general federal 
scheme." 

   -- Although Shaymiyev has reportedly described the outcome of the 
negotiations as "a change in [Tatarstan's] status . . . within 
Russia" (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17 February), Minister of Nationality 
Affairs and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray has countered that 
the treaty "provides neither for upgrading nor for downgrading 
the status of Tatarstan" (Interfax, 18 February). 

   Shaymiyev stated that the Moscow-Kazan treaty will not have to be 
ratified, as the federal and Tatarstan constitutions only require 
parliamentary ratification of international treaties (Kazanskiye 
Vedomosti, 22 February).

<TEXT>
SUMMARY 
                              Clearly alarmed by the swiftness with which the IAEA is calling a 
Board of Governors meeting, Pyongyang has made a public effort to 
explain its differences with the IAEA on resolution of the 
nuclear inspection issue, an effort apparently motivated by 
concern over the need to salvage high-level talks with Washington 
and head off possible UN sanctions. 
                          END SUMMARY 
   Pyongyang's latest authoritative pronouncement on the nuclear 
inspection issue, which came in an 18 March Atomic Energy General 
Department(SEE NOTE) spokesman's press statement, seemed to 
carefully avoid foreclosing the possibility of a negotiated 
settlement (Pyongyang radio, 18 March).  Although the statement 
carried the standard warning against applying pressure on 
Pyongyang and charges of Western plans to "crush" the DPRK, its 
major complaint seemed to be that the IAEA is convening a Board 
of Governors meeting--reportedly for 21 March (Yonhap, 17 March)- 
-"even before" analyzing the results of the just concluded 
inspections, having "hastily" reached the "unjust" conclusion 
that "it cannot guarantee" non-diversion of nuclear materials. 
   (NOTE: The department was previously known as the Ministry of 
Atomic Energy Industry.  Pyongyang media have not been observed 
to report on the apparent reorganization.) 
   The statement, which made it clear that Pyongyang had allowed the 
IAEA inspection this time solely to facilitate DPRK-U.S. high- 
level talks,(SEE NOTE) noted areas of basic disagreement with the 
IAEA.  This disagreement is due, the statement claimed, to the 
inspection team's attempts to go beyond the contents of a 15 
March bilateral agreement reached in Vienna with the IAEA. 
According to Pyongyang: 
   + The IAEA inspection team unfairly maintained that the 
inspections were being conducted under Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) safeguards.  The North Korean statement claimed that 
Pyongyang had agreed only to allow inspections "purely" to ensure 
continuity of the safeguards, reiterating Pyongyang's contention 
that its "special status" of having only "temporarily suspended" 
withdrawal from the NPT exempts it from normal safeguards 
obligations. 
   + The IAEA's insistence on 1) extracting samples in sealed-off 
areas where the seals remained intact; 2) gamma radiation mapping 
at all points, instead of selected points; and 3) examining "the 
cooling system,"  went beyond what is needed to merely ensure 
continuity of the safeguards.  Such inspections, the statement 
maintained, would have made the inspections "equivalent" to 
routine and ad hoc inspections required under the safeguards. 
   (NOTE: Underscoring Pyongyang's eagerness to resume high-level 
bilateral talks with Washington, North Korean Ambassador to 
Moscow Son Song-pil has reiterated Pyongyang's contention that 
the DPRK-U.S. talks, once held, will serve as "an important 
occasion" to solve the nuclear issue and will also lead to "easy 
resolution" of pending inter-Korean issues (Pyongyang radio, 18 
March).) 
   Charges of "Pressure" Tactics     The statement complained that 
the IAEA had sent three messages to Pyongyang during the 
inspection, "threatening" to "report to the Board of Governors 
that the agency is not in a position to verify non-diversion of 
nuclear materials" unless its demands were met.  However, in 
warning against such "pressure" tactics, the North Korean 
statement said that any attempts at pressuring the DPRK "would 
lead to a situation in which we would have no choice but to take 
a decisive measure to counter them."  The statement went on to 
pledge that Pyongyang will watch to see if the IAEA "intends to 
resolve our nuclear issue fairly or attempts to use it for 
political aims"--a relatively circumspect formulation that would 
appear to allow Pyongyang a certain range of latitude in judging 
IAEA action on the inspection issue. 
   Implications     Although the statement seemed to leave little 
room for compromise, it did stop short of an ultimatum, adopting 
instead a wait-and-see attitude toward future IAEA action.  These 
caveats suggests that Pyongyang is trying to protect the 
possibility of engaging in bilateral talks with Washington by 
somehow preventing referral of the nuclear issue to the UN 
Security Council.

<H3> <TI>      Saddam Threatens Confrontation To Split Coalition </TI></H3>

</HEADER>


<TEXT>
SUMMARY 
                            Seeking to exploit what he perceives to be a rift in the 
coalition that liberated Kuwait, President Saddam Husayn has 
presented the UN Security Council with a virtual ultimatum, 
threatening implicitly that if it fails to take significant steps in 
coming weeks toward lifting the sanctions, Iraq may cease to 
cooperate with the UN Special Commission and adopt a confrontational 
posture.  Coming amid signs that the sanctions are causing 
increasing economic difficulties in Iraq, Saddam's move reflects his 
impatience with the Security Council's failure to lift the sanctions 
in response to Baghdad's diplomacy and selective compliance, his 
desire to frustrate effective future monitoring of Iraqi weapons 
programs, and his unwillingness to make further concessions in 
compliance with UN resolutions -- such as recognizing the border 
with Kuwait. 
                       END SUMMARY 
   In a 13 March speech, which Iraqi media played up as an ultimatum 
threatening confrontation if a date for lifting the sanctions is not 
set, Saddam demanded that the Security Council implement Paragraph 
22 of Resolution 687 -- allowing Iraq to resume its oil sales -- 
"immediately and without any conditions."  He warned that if Deputy 
Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz returns from the UN Security Council 
session without the Council's agreement to activate Paragraph 22, 
then Iraq's people and leadership would have "no choice but to 
decide what they believe will give them hope . . . in the direction 
they believe is sound" (Baghdad radio). 
   Media Highlight Speech 
   Tightly controlled Iraqi media immediately began to portray 
Saddam's speech as an ultimatum and to prepare the Iraqi public for 
confrontation.  For example: 
   -- The daily Babil, owned by Saddam's son 'Udayy, said that 
Saddam's speech "defined the contents of the decisive Iraqi 
confrontation with the enemies" (Iraqi News Agency [INA], 17 March). 
   -- The daily Al-Qadisiyah (See Note 1) claimed Saddam's speech 
gave the Security Council "the last chance . . . to lift the 
sanctions without delay or conditions" (INA, 15 March). 
   (Note 1) Around mid-September 1993, Al-Qadisiyah was removed 
from the supervision of the Defense Ministry and affiliated with the 
Information Ministry, which now controls this paper as well as Al- 
Jumhuriyah (Al-'Iraq, 18 September 1993).  Probably more than an 
economy measure, this change, made by a Revolution Command Council 
decree, may have been designed to limit the political power of the 
Defense Ministry. 
   -- Interpreting Saddam's speech as threatening an end to or 
reduction in Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations, the Ba'th 
Party daily Al-Thawrah said that if the Security Council does not 
lift the sanctions, Iraq will choose "a new road, different . . . in 
terms of its approach to [UN] resolutions and committees," a road 
that will prove Iraq has "other options" aside from cooperating with 
"colonialist interpretations of UN resolutions" (INA, 15 March). 
   Earlier Signs 
   Saddam had already foreshadowed a possible change of policy in 
his 16 January Gulf war anniversary speech, in which he pledged that 
"we will not relinquish our people in the northern part of the 
homeland, nor will we stand idle toward the continuation of the 
blockade and the violation of our sovereignty in southern Iraq."  In 
that speech, he also warned "all evildoers, masters and satellites" 
- and especially "some evildoers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait" -- 
not to "miscalculate" because "the punishment of the criminals is an 
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" (Baghdad radio). 
   Explaining the Shift 
   In his 13 March speech, Saddam explained that a shift from 
diplomacy to confrontation may prove necessary because Iraqis who 
advocated concessions seem to have been wrong while Iraqi hardliners 
seem to have been right.  He said Iraq had "thus far" employed 
"diplomatic efforts" to achieve "a better level of understanding by 
the Security Council" because "many people in our country" had 
"expected" that this policy "would make some people, whose hearts 
have no feeling, show a flexible position and open the doors again 
to the Iraqi people." 
   Saddam contrasted Iraqis who favored the diplomatic policy with 
other Iraqis who were "quite convinced that the criminal level of 
aggression and the way sanctions were implemented . . . came from 
minds without any conscience."  He said these Iraqis, evidently now 
including himself, believed that "despite Iraq's offers and 
responses," its diplomats would discover that "there is nothing 
being given in return" and that the Security Council's Paragraph 22 
is being used merely as a "tactical cover to make Iraq fulfill its 
obligations" while the Security Council fails to fulfill its own 
obligations. 
   Minimum Demands 
   Indicating his minimum demands, Saddam castigated UN Special 
Commission Chairman Rolf Ekeus for failing to provide a timetable 
stating when the probationary period for monitoring Iraqi weapons 
production would begin and end.  Saddam insisted that the Iraqis 
must know when they can start selling oil so that they "will be able 
to make their plans, see what they can do, and prepare themselves 
psychologically and economically for the required duration." 
   Saddam also revealed his resentment that Ekeus was working to 
turn UN Security Council Resolution 715 into an effective monitoring 
instrument.  He claimed Ekeus had said that as soon as Iraq approved 
of 715, he would write a report to the Security Council, but when 
Iraq approved it, Ekeus said, in Saddam's words, "we must first 
start monitoring and make sure that Iraq is implementing 715 the way 
we want -- the way Ekeus wants  -- in order to make sure Iraq is 
committed."  Saddam claimed that the probationary monitoring period 
should have started as soon as the two cameras to monitor missile 
testing were installed and turned on. 
   'Aziz Letter 
   In a letter to the UN Security Council president on 16 March, 
'Aziz reiterated that Iraq "demands" that the Council apply 
Paragraph 22 "immediately and without any additional restrictions or 
conditions" and that it "reject the tendentious political 
interpretations of its resolutions that some states are seeking to 
impose on the Council."  Rejection of Iraq's demand, he said, would 
"certainly lead to a reassessment of the situation and to an action 
[tasarruf] that will protect the Iraqi people from the harm to which 
they are being exposed." 
   Indicating that at least for now Iraq will not recognize Kuwait 
and the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, as required by UN Security Council 
Resolution 833, 'Aziz said that if the sanctions and the no-fly 
zones are lifted, the issue of Kuwait "could then be discussed in 
accordance with the rules regulating relations among states" 
(Baghdad radio, 17 March). (See Box 1) 
   Perceived Rift 
   Baghdad appears to believe that now is an opportune moment to 
exploit what it perceives as a serious rift within the alliance that 
liberated Kuwait.  For example, the Information Ministry's 
mouthpiece Al-Jumhuriyah has claimed that the United States has 
become "virtually isolated in its calls for the continued 
enforcement of sanctions against Iraq, particularly since it has 
seen with its own eyes the disintegration of its international 
coalition" (INA, 6 March).  Iraqi media have recently listed France, 
Russia, and China as among the countries showing understanding for 
Baghdad's position.  In a recent article, Saddam's press secretary 
'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin advocated using a policy of "intimidation" and 
"temptation," denying trade benefits, priority in debt payments, and 
other benefits to "any country not currently adopting a just and 
equitable stand" and offering corresponding benefits to countries 
now helping Iraq to lift the sanctions (Babil, 24 February). 
   Information Ministry First Under Secretary Nuri Najm al-Marsumi 
argued in Al-'Iraq -- the daily of the pro-Saddam Kurds -- that 
Iraqi diplomacy and U.S. mistakes had helped create "a serious 
fissure within the anti-Iraq alliance" and that "current 
international and regional circumstances" provide Iraq with "a 
serious and true opportunity for lifting the unfair embargo." 
Therefore, he said, Iraq must "draw the world's attention" to its 
determination and capability "not to remain idle" if the sanctions 
continue and to its current "rallying" around Saddam "to thwart the 
aggression once and for all and to achieve the decisive victory" (8 
March). (See Box 2) 
   Implications 
   Saddam clearly is unwilling to recognize Kuwait, as required by 
UN Security Council Resolution 833, unable to stay in power without 
repressing his people, as required by Resolution 688, and surprised 
by Ekeus' determination to treat Resolution 715 as an effective 
means of monitoring Iraqi weapons.  Nevertheless, he seems to 
believe that to protect his proclaimed status as "Iraq's historic 
leader" and to avoid being perceived as weak, he needs to manipulate 
the Security Council into setting a date for Iraq to resume selling 
its oil.  He is therefore hoping that his threat to adopt a new, 
presumably more confrontational policy will break up the U.S.-led 
coalition and erode the sanctions. 
   If his ultimatum is rejected, Saddam will almost certainly feel 
compelled to do something to carry out his threat.  He may be 
content with an intensified propaganda campaign, directed in 
particular to Arab and Islamic countries, and with repeatedly 
threatening and then carrying out a gradual reduction or sudden 
cessation in Iraq's present degree of cooperation with the United 
Nations.  However, one cannot rule out Saddam's giving up on efforts 
to lift sanctions and therefore seeking a victory in another area, 
such as a move to regain control of Iraqi Kurdistan. 
                 Box 1:  Denying Kuwaiti Legitimacy 
   Saddam's consideration of a change of policy is based partly on 
his unwillingness to go any further to comply with UN resolutions. 
For example, Iraqi leaders and media have signaled their continuing 
intention not to recognize the legitimacy of Kuwait, its government, 
or its border with Iraq. 
   -- In an address to pro-Saddam foreign visitors on 18 January, 
Saddam personally denied the legitimacy of the Kuwaiti rulers, 
claiming that by their own actions they had lost the right to rule. 
After accusing them of lying in 1990 in order to make the U.S. 
public "accept the idea of war" against Iraq, he said that "when a 
Muslim ruler lies, then he has lost every legitimate right to be a 
ruler" (INA). 
   -- Commenting on Saddam's statement in his 16 January Gulf war 
anniversary speech that "we will not turn wisdom into a prelude for 
weakness and despair," Information Ministry First Under Secretary 
al-Marsumi explained that, while "wisdom and necessity" have led 
Iraq 
to accept UN Security Council resolutions, Iraq will not simply 
agree to "whatever it is asked for."  In particular, it will not 
"guarantee the security of the bandits, the rulers of the Kuwait 
governorate and Saudi Arabia" despite the fact that this is what 
"the Americans want" (Babil, 2O January). 
   -- The practice of referring to Kuwait as the [Iraqi] 
"governorate of Kuwait" has continued (for example, Al-Jumhuriyah 
editor Salah al-Mukhtar in an article in Babil, 3O January; Babil, 
1O and 12 February).  More recently, Saddam's press secretary 'Abd 
al-Jabbar Muhsin has repeatedly referred to Kuwait as "Kazimah," the 
Iraqi-imposed name for Kuwait City under the occupation (Babil, 10 
March). 
                   End of Box 1 
               Box 2: Economic Deterioration 
   Official efforts to prepare the public for a change in policy 
have come amid signs of increasing economic deterioration that 
Baghdad perceives as a threat to Iraqi steadfastness and morale. 
For example: 
   --  A Babil editorial under a pseudonym used by Saddam's son 
'Udayy castigated the Cabinet for decisions that allegedly caused 
the dinar's exchange rate to plummet between September 1993 and 
January 1994, thereby allowing Iraq's "enemy" to make "some gains in 
the arena of the economic battle."  The editorial, citing a UN 
statement that called for deferring any discussion of lifting the 
embargo until Iraq's good will had been tested for a year, implied 
that Iraq could not last another year unless the dinar's slide is 
reversed.  It therefore suggested that the success or failure of a 
ministry should be judged by its contribution to the strength or 
weakness of the dinar (2O January). 
   -- Saddam's press secretary 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin attacked "a 
handful of misled Iraqis" who "raise prices whenever the enemy 
escalates its onslaught and its conspiracies" and who have become a 
danger to Iraqi "morale and steadfastness" (Al-Qadisiyah, 22 
February). 
   -- The 1994 budget and investment plan was 25 percent below the 
1993 figures (Baghdad radio, 29 December).

SUMMARY 

                          In a string of confrontational actions and pronouncements, 
Pyongyang has raised the stakes further in its high-stakes 
nuclear issues game by threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).  Although apparently unwilling to 
publicly concede that its own recent actions have damaged the 
chances for resumption of high-level U.S.-North Korea dialogue, 
Pyongyang appears to be trying to somehow salvage bilateral talks 
with Washington. 

                        END SUMMARY 

  Pyongyang Threatens NPT Withdrawal, Calls for U.S. Talks 


Pyongyang's threat to withdraw from the NPT came in an 
authoritative Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement issued on 21 
March (Pyongyang radio, 21 March).  In the statement Pyongyang 
said it will "carry into practice" its declaration of NPT 
withdrawal announced on 12 March 1993 under certain conditions: 

+ If the United States refuses bilateral talks with North Korea 
and resumes Team Spirit, thereby "increasing its nuclear threat" 
against the DPRK. 

+ If the IAEA "further expands it unfairness" by "distorting" the 
results of its recent inspections in North Korea and resorts to 
"forcible measures and pressures." 

The 21 March statement, which for the first time acknowledged 
that the DPRK-U.S. talks scheduled for the same day in Geneva did 
not take place, also repeated familiar North Korean charges of 
U.S. violations of previous agreements with North Korea and 
declared that Pyongyang will "no longer" be duty-bound to ensure 
continuity of NPT safeguards. 

Hint of Moderation     Possibly seeking to soften its threat--and 
thus somehow leave the door ajar for dialogue with Washington- 
-the statement seemed to imply that as long as there is any hope 
of resuming bilateral talks with Washington, Pyongyang may 
refrain from taking the final step of NPT withdrawal.  North 
Korean withdrawal from the NPT, the statement said, would occur 
only if the United States "persists in avoiding" bilateral talks 
"to the end."  Underscoring Pyongyang's reluctance to 
definitively rule out future talks, the statement asserted that 
the DPRK is "in no hurry at all"--presumably, to foreclose 
avenues of dialogue with Washington--"even if the DPRK-U.S. talks 
are not held."  In addition, in contrast to North Korean 
pronouncements on the inter-Korean talks (see following article), 
the statement, like previous pronouncements on Washington's 
policy, refrained from extreme polemical attacks on Washington. 

Pyongyang media also appeared to react with similar 
circumspection to recent statements by high U.S. officials 
criticizing the North.  For example, monitored North Korean media 
so far have not reported or commented on CIA Director Woolsey's 
charges that Pyongyang has been exporting weapons of mass 
destruction, is supporting terrorism, and may already possess 
nuclear weapons (Yonhap, 18 March). 

Implications     Pyongyang clearly prefers to deal only with 
Washington on the nuclear issue.  However, it seems unwilling or 
unable to acknowledge that its own dilatory and confrontational 
tactics are damaging the prospects for the dialogue it is 
seeking. 

  Pyongyang Breaks Off Talks With Seoul, Threatens War 

                             SUMMARY 

Accusing Seoul of engaging in pressure tactics, Pyongyang has 
abruptly broken off bilateral talks and issued threats of war- 
-threats that it subsequently appeared to moderate.  North Korea 
apparently hopes to gain from what it sees as differences within 
the ROK Government and between Seoul and Washington on the 
nuclear issue. 

                            END SUMMARY 

The North came to Panmunjom on 19 March clearly prepared to break 
off the ongoing negotiations with the South on the exchange of 
presidential envoys.  The North Korean chief delegate--identified 
in Seoul media as Pak Yong-su--not only reinstated demands that 
he had previously indicated would be retracted, but also insisted 
that the ROK Government "apologize" to all Koreans--a formulation 
Pyongyang had typically used in the past to signal its 
noninterest in dialogue with Seoul and Tokyo--this time for 
allegedly obstructing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks (Pyongyang 
radio, 19 March). 

The North's main complaint against the South focused on what Pak 
described as Seoul's "sudden change of attitude" toward adoption 
of "tough measures" against Pyongyang.  In particular, Pak said 
that North Korea's pique was based on reports of the 17 March 
"high-level strategic meeting" in Seoul, which had reportedly 
discussed holding Team Spirit, the deployment of Patriot 
missiles, and international sanctions.  Pak equated this alleged 
change in the South's attitude to "a grave crime" and claimed 
that it necessitated the reimposition of the four demands made 
earlier by the North--demands that Pak had previously admitted 
were "barriers" to envoy exchanges erected by Pyongyang itself. 
(The North had demanded that the South refrain from 1) staging 
large-scale nuclear exercises, 2) introducing new weapons, 
including the Patriot missile, and 3) using threats of 
international sanctions.  The North had also demanded previously 
that 4) the South retract ROK President Kim Yong-nam's remarks 
about not shaking hands with North Korean officials.) 

Demand for Apology     Signaling that Pyongyang is no longer 
interested in continuing dialogue with Seoul, Pak accused the 
South of having used the envoy exchange talks "solely" for the 
purpose of derailing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks.  He went on to 
"strongly insist" that the South "frankly admit" this "dark 
intention" and "apologize before the nation."  Attempting to 
place the onus of any breakdown of dialogue on the South, Pak 
further accused Seoul of having in effect adopted "a declaration 
of abandonment of the special envoys exchange, a declaration of 
an all-out confrontation with us, and a declaration of war." 

Pyongyang radio on 19 March depicted Pak as making his most 
provocative remarks only in response to remarks the South made at 
the 19 March session.  According to the radio, the South side had 
said that should the envoy exchange talks be discontinued, "there 
is no knowing what danger would materialize."  To this Pak 
reportedly replied, "Don't worry about it.  What do you think the 
South is?  If the North suffers damage, do you think the South 
will go unscathed?"  Pak went on to pledge unspecified "immediate 
and decisive countermeasures of self-defense" in case "some 
powers impose sanctions on us or otherwise provoke us."  The 
radio said Pak coupled his pledge with a "stern warning" not to 
take the North Korean threats lightly, quoting him as saying, "we 
do not know how to engage in idle talk. "(SEE NOTE) 

(NOTE: Seoul's government-run KBS-1 television on 19 March 
broadcast video recording of even more inflammatory remarks by 
Pak that were captured by closed-circuit television coverage of 
the meeting.  In the video, Pak told his Southern counterpart, 
Song Yong-tae, to "give a careful consideration to the 
consequences of a war," and warned that "Seoul is not far from 
here.  If war breaks out, it will turn into a sea of fire.  Mr. 
Song, it will probably difficult for you, too, to survive." 
Pyongyang media have not been observed to report on this portion 
of Pak's remarks.) 

Moderation of Threats     Pyongyang subsequently appeared to 
backpedal a bit on its threats of war.  In a 21 March statement 
issued in the name of the North Korean delegation to the inter- 
Korean contacts, which again chastised the South for "suddenly" 
assuming what it described as a hardline stance, the North made 
only passing references to the possibility of war, implying 
instead that the downfall of the ROK government will come from 
revolt within the South (Pyongyang radio, 21 March).  The 
statement warned the ROK to realize that "no dictators" in the 
South had "survived committing the antinational act of betraying 
fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces" and that 
"these flunkeyist, nation-sellers have met a bitter end." 
North Korean Motives     Pyongyang may calculate that its 
brinksmanship will sufficiently split opinions within the South 
Korean government to make a firm stand against the North 
difficult.  For the past few months, Seoul media reporting on 
relations with the North has indicated that there are serious 
divisions within the Seoul government over how to deal with 
Pyongyang.  The latest of these indications came shortly after a 
12 March inter-Korean meeting.  The Seoul daily Hanguk Ilbo on 13 
March cited an unnamed ROK "government official" as saying that 
the South and the United States "believe" that by failing to 
agree to the exchange of envoys with Seoul, Pyongyang had 
"unilaterally invalidated" an agreement reached with Washington 
on resuming high-level talks in Geneva later in the month. 
Apparently alarmed by the possible effects such remarks could 
have on the inter-Korean talks, other "government officials" were 
cited the next day by the South Korean news agency Yonhap as 
advocating a different approach (14 March).  One of them was 
quoted as saying that Seoul should not consider it "a violation 
of the North Korea-U.S. agreement" even if North Korea "refused" 
the envoy exchange outright.  All that would happen, he 
reportedly said, would be that "the date of the third round 
[U.S.-North Korea] meeting would be delayed" until the envoy 
exchange was realized. 

In addition, there has been intermittent South Korean reporting 
of a division of views between Seoul and Washington that could 
have emboldened Pyongyang.  Most recently, for instance, Yonhap 
on 16 March cited Kim Tae-chung, a "retired" opposition leader 
and former presidential candidate, as "lashing out" at U.S. 
"hardliners" for allegedly jeopardizing lives of Koreans in their 
pursuit of confrontation with North Korea on the nuclear issue. 
Similarly, in an article datelined Washington, the Seoul daily 
Choson Ilbo on 13 March claimed that the U.S. Congress has 
concluded that differences between Washington and Seoul over how 
to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue are serving as a 
"stumbling block" in the U.S. Government's formulation of its 
policy toward Pyongyang--reporting that could have encouraged 
Pyongyang to reinforce its constant attempt to drive a wedge 
between Washington and Seoul. 

Outlook     Pyongyang media treatment of the 19 March meeting 
seems aimed at portraying the North Korean leadership as fully 
prepared to face the worst case scenario.  By declaring 
Pyongyang's willingness to destroy Seoul in a conflict, the North 
Korean leadership may hope to frighten officials in the South 
into advocating concessions and thus further aggravate a 
perceived division between the United States and South Korea.
