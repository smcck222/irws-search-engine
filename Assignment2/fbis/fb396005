  [Text] The ninth extraordinary summit of the Economic and 
Monetary Union of West Africa [UEMOA] took off this morning in 
our capital. A little before 1000, President Nicephore Soglo of 
Benin, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, Abdou Diouf of Senegal, Alpha 
Oumar Konare of Mali met on the ninth floor of the Central Bank 
of West African States building around the current chairman of 
the Union, Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore. Cote d'Ivoire 
is represented at the summit by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan 
Duncan, and Togo is represented by Economic and Finance Minister 
Doh Franck Fianyo. 
  Since mid-morning, the heads of state of the UEMOA are 
discussing the new body which will be charged with channeling 
the aspirations for integrated development of the seven member 
countries. Two months after the CFA franc devaluation, it is 
necessary to merge the experiences of all the states and to 
establish some general code of conduct. The tension strongly 
expressed by various parties must be interpreted as the natural 
expression of the general disarray which followed the Dakar 
measure. 
  According to Nicephore Soglo, in a memorandum making the 
rounds in the corridors of the conference, to cope with this 
measure each state must be ready to give the full measure of its 
national intellect, its work, its courage, its self-denial, and 
its high sense of sacrifice. 
  The combination of efforts at the national level goes 
hand-in-hand with the contribution of development partners. 
This explains the presence of French Cooperation Minister 
Michel Roussin, the representatives of the World Bank, and the 
IMF. The issues relating to backup measures will be reviewed. 
UEMOA states will ask their Western partners to accelerate the 
release of funds under the structural adjustment facility. From 
Paris, in particular, the UEMOA states would like to know to 
what extent the promised annulation of the debt will be 
effective. Today, it is difficult to prejudge the results of 
the Ouagadougou meeting but a collective option will be 
affirmed: the need to work individually and collectively to 
reinforce the economic fabric. This is how the interministerial 
council sees the light at end of the tunnel for the member 
states. Soumaila Cisse, the Malian minister of finance and 
economy, spoke about the devaluation. 
  [Begin Cisse recording] Our heads of state have signed in an 
absolutely responsible manner and the finance ministers must 
assume responsibility for the devaluation and take the 
corrective measures required. We have a duty to communicate and 
explain to our workers and all the social strata of the 
population so that things turn out well. This is what I refer 
to as assuming responsibility. Assuming responsiblity means 
having all the people behind the leaders of the African states 
in order to take up the challenge that has been given to us. At 
the time when other zones are meeting -- the European Community, 
the North American Free Trade Area, bringing together the United 
States, Canada and Mexico -- we must unite and reinforce our 
cohesion, or else there will be no future. This is what I mean 
by assuming responsibility for our situation. [end recording]

  [Text] In Benin, an unprecedented event has led to an 
unprecedented decision. The government of President Soglo 
yesterday announced that it was offering a huge financial reward 
in exchange for information leading to the recovery of military 
weapons stolen from an Army base near the main city, Cotonou. 
From there, our reporter Karim Okanla takes up the story. 
  [Begin recording] In an interview broadcast on the national 
radio, the minister of defense, Mr. Desire Vieyra, said that the 
government was offering a 2.5-million-CFA-franc reward to anyone 
who will provide information on last week's theft of weapons 
from the military base in Ouidah, located about 40 km north of 
Cotonou. Seven rocket launchers, assault rifles, and a large 
quantity of ammunition went missing from the base, and so far 
security forces have failed to track down the thieves. 
  The minister of defense says that a special phone line is 
being made available at the Ministry of Interior so as to allow 
people to call in. This is an unusual situation and it requires 
a special solution, the minister of defense added. Mr. Vieyra 
also disclosed that a French military delegation is expected in 
Cotonou today to discuss security matters. 
  For four years now, the Soglo government has had to cope 
with 
apparently unsurmountable security problems. Weapons have been 
stolen several times from different ammunition depots across the 
country, and according to Mr. Florentin Feliho, a former 
minister of defense, the Soglo government lacks the authority to 
enforce the law. Reliable reports also indicate that there is 
growing discontent within the Army ranks since the reshuffle of 
the military hierarchy last year. Now (?groups) like the 
military here are about to undergo a major reform program. [end

  [Text] The second extraordinary session of the National 
Assembly which started on 1 March adopted six draft bills 
relating to the 1994 budget bill. Amadou Diakite has more 
details: 
  [Diakite] The first draft bill provides for the removal of 
crisis tax on rice and sugar. The measure is designed to 
mitigate the effects of the devaluation on consumers. The 
second bill institutes a Single Tax on Petroleum Products [TUPP] 
and modifies the classification of import duty rates. The TUPP 
will enable the public treasury to (?collect) all taxes on 
petroleum products. The third bill takes into account the needs 
and concerns of consumers with regard to (?increases in the 
prices) of strategic products such as kerosene, heavy-duty fuel, 
and [word indistinct]. 
  The fourth bill deals with the import duties on drugs with 
the view to stabilizing the price of pharmaceuticals at an 
acceptable level for consumers. The fifth law provides for the 
removal of taxes and import duties on (?specific) essential 
drugs. The last bill supplements the law on value-added taxes 
on water and electricity. The bill is designed to reduce fiscal 
burden on the households by removing the value-added tax on 
water and electricity bills. 
  Deliberations resume at the National Assembly tomorrow 
morning at 0900. The assemblymen will essentially examine the 
amended 1994 budget bill.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson 
Mandela has received a tumultuous welcome in Bophuthatswana. It 
was his first visit to Bophuthatswana since the violent clashes 
and looting there last week, as well as his first ever visit to 
the capital Mmabatho. Caro Kriel reports that if the ANC leader 
had any doubts about his popularity in Bophuthatswana they would 
have been dispelled by the huge and enthusiastic turnout of his 
supporters. 
  [Begin recording] [Kriel] Mr. Mandela chose the Independence 
Stadium in Mmabatho for his historic first rally in 
Bophuthatswana, a stadium built for the now ousted Bop 
[Bophuthatswana] leader, Mr. Lucas Mangope. Today it belonged to 
Mr. Mandela. 
  [Mandela] My mere presence here is proof that in 
Bophuthatswana there is now free political activity in this area. 
  [Kriel] Mr. Mandela praised the people (?who ousted) Mr. 
Mangope, but condemned those who took part in looting sprees 
last week. 
  [Mandela] That is not how decent people behave. That is the 
behavior of animals. 
  [Kriel] But he also slammed the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement]. 
  [Mandela] It is a lesson they will never forget. They were 
chased out and humiliated. That is what is going to happen in 
future. 
  [Kriel] Earlier, Mr. Mandela visited the family of a woman 
who was allegedly killed by the AWB. He also spent time at the 
home of a woman whose husband died in the violence. Mr. Mandela 
said he wanted to come to Bophuthatswana to speak to the people 
and find out for himself what had happened. Mr. Mandela was 
well received wherever he went, telling this crowd of civil 
servants what they wanted to hear. 
  [Mandela] You are all going to get your pensions. All of you 
are going to get your jobs without exception. 
  [Kriel] Pensions, jobs, and similar problems are now in the 
hands of Bop's two coadministrators. Mr. Mandela met interim 
administrator, Mr. Tjaart van der Walt, and with him Mr. Job 
Mokgoro. At parliament today where a defiant Mr. Mangope said 
he was going to have a cabinet meeting, the only sign of him was 
a statue. The doors of parliament were locked and guarded by 
SADF [South African Defense Force] troops. [end recording]

  [Text] The 29th summit of the Customs and Economic Union of 
Central Africa [UDEAC] has just ended. Our special 
correspondent, Guy-Bertrand Mapangou, is on line. Guy Bertrand, 
what are the main resolutions? 
  [Mapangou] The curtains have just been drawn at the 15 
January Palace here in Ndjamena on the 29th summit of UDEAC 
heads of state. The major outcome of the meeting was the signing 
by the heads of state of the act establishing the Central 
African Economic and Monetary Community [CEMAC] similar to the 
West African Economic and Monetary Union [UEMOA]. 
  A new act has just been enacted in the subregion, a new 
forum 
for reflection and a new economic framework. UDEAC heads of 
state are determined to transform their monetary zone into a 
veritable monetary and economic union. France, [words 
indistinct], CEMAC, and UEMOA have big integration projects 
concerning for instance insurance, provident fund, business 
management rights, the creation of regional centers for economic 
training, [words indistinct] and economic studies. 
  Concerning the conventions of the monetary and economic 
union 
which were not finalized, the heads of state have decided to set 
up a committee of plenipotentiaries consisting of ministers of 
economy, finance, external relations, and justice, as well as 
the governor of the Bank of Central African States, and the 
UDEAC secretary general. This committee is expected to finalize 
these conventions before the next UDEAC summit slated for 
Yaounde in December under the chairmanship of President Paul 
Biya. 
  The council of heads of states also decided to convene a 
meeting of the CEMAC and donors to study the means of mitigating 
the negative effects of the devaluation in the countries of the 
subregion. An act approving the restructuring of UDEAC was 
signed by the heads of state. Gabon is expected to apply for 
the post of deputy UDEAC secretary general which was declared 
vacant during the summit. Other decisions were also made 
especially in the air, land, and river transport sectors. The 
heads of state decided to reactivate these sectors by reopening 
the river route between Bangui and Brazzaville. The European 
Union has granted 7 billion CFA francs for the reconstitution of 
this waterway.

  [Excerpts] The 29th summit of heads of state of the Customs 
and Economic Union of Central Africa [UDEAC] ended this morning 
at the 15 January Palace in Ndjamena. Before putting an end to 
their deliberations, the heads of state and of delegations of 
UDEAC member countries signed the act instituting the Economic 
and Monetary Community of Central Africa, CEMAC. Those who 
signed the document were the Gabonese head of state, El Hadj 
Omar Bongo, that of Congo, Pascal Lissouba, followed by Central 
African Republic President Ange Felix Patasse, as well as the 
Chadian head of state, Idriss Deby, who is also chairman of this 
29th UDEAC summit that saw the birth of CEMAC. It will be 
pointed out the representative of the Equatorial Guinean 
president, Mr. Do Anatolio Ndong Mba, also signed this document. 
Only the Cameroonian representative, Mr. (Luc Ayan), president 
of Cameroon's Economic and Social Council, did not sign the 
document instituting CEMAC. After the signing of this document, 
it was time for the reading of the summit's communique issued at 
the end of this 29th UDEAC summit of heads of state. It was 
read by UDEAC Secretary General Thomas Dakayi Kamga: 
  [Begin Kamga recording] The 29th regular summit of UDEAC 
heads of state, as scheduled in December 1993 was held in 
Ndjamena, capital of the Republic of Chad, on 15 and 16 March 
1994, under the chairmanship of His Excellency Colonel Idriss 
Deby, president of the Republic of Chad, current chairman of 
UDEAC Council of Heads of State. Those who participated in the 
summit were: His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, president of the 
Gabonese Republic; His Excellency Professor Pascal Lissouba, 
president of the Republic of Congo; His Excellency Ange Felix 
Patasse, president of the Central African Republic; His 
Excellency Anatolio Ndong Mba, deputy prime minister, 
representing the president of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea; 
and His Excellency (Luc Ayan), president of the Economic and 
Social Council, representing the president of the Republic of 
Cameroon. 
  Following their informal Libreville summit relating to the 
setting up of an economic and monetary community of Central 
Africa, with a view to giving a new impetus to the subregional 
integration process, the UDEAC Council of Heads of State has 
decided to officially launch CEMAC by signing today the treaty 
instituting this organization. The main mission of this 
organization is to promote the harmonious development of member 
states, within the framework of the establishment of two unions, 
namely the Economic Union of Central Africa, in abbreviation 
UEAC, and the Monetary Union of Central Africa, UMAC. In each of 
the two fields, member states intend to promote the already 
existing cooperation between them to the status of a union to 
achieve the process for economic and monetary integration. 
  Concerning agreements on UEAC and UMAC, the heads of state 
decided to set up a committee of plenipotentiaries composed of 
the ministers in charge of economic development problems, 
finance, external relations, justice, the UDEAC secretary 
general, and the governor of the Central Bank of Central African 
States [BEAC], both of whom will be rapporteurs to the committee 
of plenipotentiaries. This committee is assisted by a group of 
experts to be named by it. It can call on, at any time, any 
external person, in view of the competence of that person. 
While awaiting the establishment of these new bodies, the heads 
of state decided to settle all or part of arrears owed the UDEAC 
general secretariat. They called on the staff to resume work 
immediately. 
  The heads of state exchanged views on the economic situation 
of the subregion since the devaluation of the CFA franc and 
reaffirmed their desire to make coherent their economic 
policies. For this purpose, they reviewed a number of projects 
on integration, in the areas of land, river, and air transport, 
and with the aim of easing the landlocked conditions of some 
member states. They also reviewed projects in the areas of 
electric power, fishery, and animal breeding, strengthening 
trade exchange between UDEAC member states, in particular, the 
assessment and management of human resources, the handling of 
science and technology in order to introduce innovation as a 
dynamic factor of development, as well as the fight against 
desertification. To this end, they authorized the secretary 
general and BEAC governor to expand studies as soon as possible. 
  The heads of state have decided to summon a top-level 
meeting 
of the CEMAC after all member countries must have concluded 
their programs with the IMF. This meeting, to be attended by 
all financial backers, will assess the compensation measures 
following the devaluation and ways of revamping the economies of 
the subregion. [passage omitted] 
  The term of office of the UDEAC deputy secretary general 
having come to its end, the president of the Gabonese Republic 
will propose another candidate for this post. The Council of 
Heads of State congratulated Mr. Ambroise Ndoyi Bongo for the 
work done during nine years in the service of the Union and 
wishes him courage in his future duties. [passage omitted] 
  The heads of state made it a point to thank warmly their 
peer, President Idriss Deby, the Government of Chad, the Chadian 
people in general, and the people of Ndjamena in particular, for 
the brotherly welcome and the African hospitality given them and 
their delegations during their stay. For 1994, the chairmanship 
of the UDEAC Council of States 1994 will be assumed by His 
Excellency Paul Biya, president of the Republic of Cameroon. 
The next regular meeting of the Council of Heads of State will 
be held in Yaounde in December 1994. 
  Issued in Ndjamena on 16 March 1994. Thank you. [end

  [Text] Dakar, 16 Mar (PANA) -- The decision Tuesday [15 
March] by the heads of states of the West African Economic 
Community (CEAO) to abolish the organisation was no surprise, 
according to political observers. The summit held in the 
Burkinabe capital, seat of the community, ended there "to deal 
the final blow to a dying organisation", an official of the 
Senegalese Ministry of Economy and Finance told PANA. 
  Set up on 2 June 1972 in Bamako, Mali by Burkina Faso, Cote 
d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Senegal, and broadened 
with Benin joining in 1984, CEAO was a community of 51 million 
people spread over nearly five million square kilometres. 
  During its 22 years of existence, the community has endured 
difficulties such as the non-payment of five months of salaries 
(October 1993-February 1994) to its 450 personnel. Lately, 
telephone lines and electricity were cut in its headquarters. 
  However, the problems were predictable following the theft 
in 
1985 of 6.5 billion CFA (1 U.S. dollar; 575 F CFA at today's 
rate) in what has become know as the "Diawara affair." The 
theft was from the Solidarity and Intervention Fund for the 
Development of the Community, a specialised unit of the CEAO. 
Of the 6.5 billion CFA said to have been embezzled by Moussa 
Ngom (former CEAO secretary general), Moussa Diakite (Fosidec 
director general) and Mohamed Diawara (businessman and former 
Ivorian minister), only 400 million F CFA have been recovered to 
date. 
  Even though the "Diawara affair" was the starting point of 
the community's difficulties, its financial problems were 
worsened when the member states failed to meet their financial 
contributions. This led to arrears of some 65.5 billion CFA as 
at 30 June 1993. Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, the two major 
contributors, owe the defunct community 50 billion CFA. Of this 
amount, Cote d'Ivoire owes 34 billion CFA. Only Benin was up to 
date with its contributions. 
  However, CEAO, whose mission was to foster the development 
of 
economic activities in member states, had all the assets to 
succeed, according to some experts interviewed by PANA. In 
fact, with a gross domestic product of 4.3 billion dollars and 
10 billion dollars in foreign trade (coffee, cocoa, timber, 
uranium, iron, oil, cotton, peanuts, water, cattle, tourism and 
cereals), the community was a real economic force the experts 
said. 
  CEAO was strengthened in 1977 with the adoption in Abidjan 
of 
a nonaggression and defence assistance agreement. This was 
aimed at guaranteeing the security for the community. 
  In order to achieve its task, the CEAO set up several 
specialised institutions such as the Community Development Fund, 
the School of Mining and Geology in Niamey, the Regional Center 
of Solar Energy in Bamako, the Center for Higher Management 
Studies in Dakar, the School of Fishing in Nouadhibou, 
Mauritania. 
  However, hit by an economic crisis compounded by the 50 per 
cent devaluation of the CFA, decided on 11 January in Dakar, the 
member states preferred to sacrifice [words indistinct] and for 
the West African Economic and Monetary Union, set up three 
months ago and whose deadline for ratification is 30 April 1994.

  [Text] We come to the crisis between Cameroon and Nigeria. 
The Yaounde authorities say they have not been informed about 
the holding of a summit between Abacha and Biya although 
unofficial sources report that a summit will be held between 
President Paul Biya of Cameroon and General Sani Abacha of 
Nigeria and that the two leaders will meet in a few weeks time 
with their Egyptian counterpart, Husni Mubarak, the current OAU 
chairman, in Abuja. Nigerian Foreign Minister Babagana Kingibe 
has expressed surprise at this news and in Yaounde, the minister 
of communication and government spokesman says he has not been 
notified of this meeting which is rather expected to take place 
in Togo. Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, Cameroon's minister and 
government spokesman, speaks to Raphael Badinga: 
  [Begin Kouomegni recording] We in Cameroon believe that 
normally the host country should be Togo since the Togolese 
leader came to Cameroon and went to Nigeria in connection with 
the dispute, and his foreign minister went to Cameroon and 
Nigeria. The Nigerian minister also came here for three days 
and we worked on the assumption that Togo is offering mediation. 
We are, therefore, surprised to learn that somehow Nigeria has 
chosen Cairo because Nigeria has not informed us of any such 
development and Egypt has not notified us of any invitation to 
Cairo. Normally, we should be informed, even discreetly, by 
Nigeria or Egypt. We should negotiate the date, procedure, and 
subject of discussion together and then we should announce this 
simultaneously in Yaounde and Lagos or simultaneously in 
Yaounde, Lagos, and Cairo. That is the procedure in 
international relations. [end recording]

  [Text] Libreville, 15 Mar (AFP) -- The Equatorial Guinean 
Government has adopted the national budget for 1994 that amounts 
to 29.4 billion CFA francs (FF294 million [French francs]) 
against 13.21 billion in 1993, an official source disclosed 
today. 
  The debt department represents about 50 percent of the 
estimated expenditures in the new budget, the same source added. 
  According to Minister Delegate of Finance Enrique King Somo, 
in a telephone conversation with AFP today from Libreville, the 
state's current expenses amount to 14.94 billion CFA francs and 
the debt department's to 14.46 billion. 
  As for the receipts, the budget estimates show that the 
state's receipts amount to 15.63 billion CFA francs, the 
minister added. The budget deficit should therefore amount to 
about 14 billion CFA francs. 
  This budget, which has more than doubled compared with the 
previous exercise following the devaluation of the CFA franc by 
50 percent, provides for a 14-percent salary increase for civil 
servants, the Equatorial Guinean radio said. 
  The average monthly salary in Equatorial Guinea amounts to 
14,000 CFA francs. 
  The new budget should be submitted for approval to the 
National Assembly before it is implemented, the radio added.

  [Text] Nakuru, 16 Mar (KNA) -- The Rift Valley provincial 
commissioner [PC], Mr. Ishmael Chelang'a, has strongly refuted a 
story appearing in today's THE STANDARD newspaper that nine 
people died and hundreds others were displaced in fresh clashes 
in Molo Division of Nakuru District and vowed that the 
government will not rest until the motive of the perpetrators of 
the falsehood is unearthed. 
  Terming the story as total lies, Mr. Chelang'a expressed 
shock that anyone in their right mind could engage himself in 
disinformation campaign with the aim of inciting people into 
chaos. He said the government will deal with the authors firmly 
and ruthlessly. 
  Mr. Chelang'a, who was addressing members of the press in 
his 
office, lamented that similar disinformation campaigns 
responsible for the clashes which hit parts of the province last 
year, aimed at setting the country on the war path, which could 
not be allowed [sentence as received]. He called on the 
security officers in the province to be on the lookout, noting 
that the story had given a clear indication that last year's 
instigators of the clashes had embarked on new campaign, which 
he explained had made a "ritual" towards every end of school 
term, in order to create tension and fear among residents. 
  The PC said in last year's clashes similar rumours were 
peddled by the same people which caused people of different 
tribes to react, and he urged the people of Molo not overreact 
to the false story and disrupt the peace they were currently 
enjoying. At the same time, Mr. Chelang'a challenged the 
editorial of THE STANDARD to send an independent group to Kamara 
area, where the incident was alleged to have occurred, and 
witness for themselves how people from different tribes resident 
in the area were peacefully coexisting. 
  Mr. Chelang'a called on journalists to always countercheck 
their stories with those on the ground for purposes of 
authenticity, noting that if THE STANDARD newspaper had bothered 
to countercheck the story they would have confirmed that it was 
a fabrication.

  [Text] Nairobi, 16 March (AFP) -- Two Kenyan journalists 
were arrested by security forces after publication here on 
Wednesday [16 March] of a report saying nine people had died and 
hundreds had been displaced in a new flare-up of ethnic fighting 
in the country's Rift Valley Province. 
  The journalists -- Ngumo wa Kuria and Peter Makori -- both 
working for the Lonrho-owned STANDARD newspapers, were expected 
to appear in court in the Rift Valley town of Nakuru on 
Thursday, probably on charges of "false reporting to create 
alarm". 
  Ngumo wa Kuria was picked up in Nakuru, while Makori was 
picked up from the western Kenyan town of Kisii and brought to 
Nakuru to face charges for the report, published on Wednesday by 
THE STANDARD, but which police authorities have strongly denied. 
  The report quoted 200 ethnic Kisiis who arrived back home on 
Monday night and told how an unidentified group terrorised 
people last Friday in Mau Summit of Molo area, killing some 
people and forcing the rest out of their homes. The area was 
badly affected at the height of ethnic violence which left more 
than 1,000 people dead and tens of thousands more displaced last 
year, until the government stepped in and declared it a security 
zone in an effort to end the fighting between the majority 
Kikuyu and President Daniel arap Moi's Kalenjin tribesmen.

<F P=106> [By Emman Omari] </F>
  [Excerpts] Eighteen Catholic bishops called for a revision 
of the Constitution yesterday, saying the political situation in 
Kenya had not changed since single-party rule. They urged the 
president to lead the country to democracy and said they would 
be willing to meet with him. 
  "The main responsibility is, in a particular way, on the 
president of the Republic who is also the commander in chief of 
the Armed Forces and therefore, can change the situation," they 
said. 
  Quoting a previous statement, they declared: "As president, 
he cannot escape his responsibility. He cannot escape the 
judgement of history." 
  The bishops made their remarks in a pastoral letter, "On the 
Road to Democracy," which will be read in all churches serving 
the seven million strong Catholic population on Sunday [20 
March]. Seven prelates, including Cardinal Maurice Otunga, 
presented the letter at the Catholic Secretariat's headquarters 
in Nairobi. Parts of the document quoted or repeated previous 
statements by the bishops or Pope John Paul II or bodies such as 
the Justice and Peace Commission. 
  Taking turns to read the letter, the bishops also criticised 
opposition parties for internal divisions, struggles for 
personal power and visible orientation towards tribal 
membership. All this, they said, was "a source of confusion and 
disappointment" to the people. 
  The bishops called for the rewriting of the Constitution "to 
fit our political circumstances." This should be done not by a 
group of politicians but by an enlarged independent constituent 
body. "Our constitution was composed when there was a de facto 
one-party system and was suitable to the situation of that time. 
"A complete revision has to be entrusted to a large constituent 
body of experienced competent citizens representing all trends 
of society and not just to a reduced group of politicians," the 
bishops said. The Constitution should be endorsed by popular 
consent. 
  The bishops complained that KANU [Kenya African National 
Union] ignored other political parties and interpreted not being 
a member of KANU as being against the government. This could be 
seen from utterances of senior ministers that only KANU zones 
would benefit from government development programmes. National 
resources, they said, were a right and not a gift from KANU. 
They said that if KANU could not serve all Kenyans equally then 
it was breaking the contract of service and had no business 
being in power "because ipso facto it loses the moral right to 
govern." 
  The bishops reiterated that multipartyism was not synonymous 
with discord but it did not mean democracy had arrived in Kenya. 
  The letter said the situation in the public universities was 
chaotic. "No matter how the government would wish the public to 
forget the university problem, that is just not going to happen. 
A problem which is postponed is not solved," they said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Referring to government efforts to convince people that 
tribal violence was started by the opposition, the letter said 
Kenyans had come to believe that the authorities passively 
watched or collaborated in the clashes. They said it was well 
known who ordered the demolition of Maela camp and Nakuru kiosks 
and who sent bulldozers to Buru Thessalia holding ground to 
evict people who had lived there for more than 50 years. 
  "Should we believe the words about national unity pronounced 
by our president during the celebration of Kenyatta Day or the 
words inciting to tribal revenge pronounced in Parliament by one 
of his ministers with total impunity and even support of many 
KANU members of parliament?" the bishops asked. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Text] Nairobi, March 16 (AFP) -- Factional leader Mohamed 
Farah Aidid on Wednesday [16 March] urged his former foes to 
join him in forming an interim administration and drafting a new 
constitution for war-ravaged Somalia. "Conflicts between clans 
and selfish interest goups must end," General Aidid said in the 
latest of a series of increasingly dovish statements. 
  But he blasted his arch-enemy, self-styled interim president 
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and his allies for calling for the formation 
of a new government after meetings in Cairo this month which 
Aidid did not attend. "We all now face a transitional period of 
two to three years, during which the foundations of a new 
decentralised Third Republic and its cooperation with our 
neighbours will be agreed upon and set out in a national 
charter," Aidid said in a statement in the Kenyan capital 
Nairobi. 
  He has held a series of meetings with regional and Somali 
leaders in Nairobi since he left Mogadishu in December to attend 
peace talks brokered by neighbouring African countries. 
  Aidid said he would return to Mogadishu soon and urged all 
parties "to come together and form an interim administration and 
secure our future." 
  Most key Somali faction leaders and political figures are 
currently in Nairobi for informal peace talks. 
  One set of UN-mediated negotiations has brought together 
Aidid's ally Omar Jays and his rival, warlord Mohamed Said 
Hersi, known as General Morgan. Their struggle for control of 
the southern port city of Kismaayo sparked factional fighting 
that killed nine people last month. 
  The adversaries will meet at the United Nations complex 
outside Nairobi this week to agree a date and venue for a peace 
conference to end the bloodshed in Kismaayo, UN spokesman George 
Bennett said. "There seems to be a greater willingness on all 
sides to make concessions," Bennett said. 
  Aidid's newly conciliatory tone has raised hopes of peace in 
Somalia after US and other Western troops withdraw this month, 
leaving a smaller UN operation manned mainly by Pakistani, 
Indian and other Third World troops. 
  But diplomats and aid workers remain cautious. Many are 
convinced that low-level guerrilla warfare among the clans will 
engulf the country after the Western pullout, welcomed by Aidid 
whose rag-tag militia humiliated the UN and forced the United 
States to abandon Somalia after sending thousands of troops to 
end a famine that killed at least 300,000 people. 
  The famine was triggered by anarchic clan-based fighting 
that 
erupted after Aidid and other rebel leaders ousted former ruler 
Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. 
  "Aidid has switched roles. Now he's cultivating the image of 
a statesman, and he's playing clan politics with some skill, but 
he's still on a collision course with Ali Mahdi," said an 
African diplomat involved in the Somali peace process. 
  "Many other disputes will have to be settled before Somalia 
returns to genuine peace. It's bound to be a slow process," the 
diplomat told AFP.

  [Text] A spokesman for the United Somali Congress [USC] 
said today that the killing of nine Somali bandits by Indian 
troops serving with UN forces as reported by the BBC Somali 
Service on 15 March was a complete and malicious fabrication 
that is far from the actual truth. There was no confrontation 
between the Indian forces and Somali criminals who allegedly 
intended to attack the food convoy. 
  The spokesman said the area where the incident occurred is 
near the experimental station of [word indistinct] in Wanlaweyn 
District, Shabeellaha Hoose. He said no criminals attacked the 
Indian soldiers, but there was fighting going on between two 
communities who live in the area. It was at this point that the 
Indian troops, who were passing through, came across the 
fighting and, without ascertaining what was happening, opened 
fire, causing deaths and injuries. 
  Investigations into the incident are currently under way. 
The USC spokesman called on the communities living in the area 
and involved in the conflict to end the shameful fighting 
immediately and assured them that the USC leadership would 
consult Indian military officials over the shooting incident, 
with a view to identifying those who committed the criminal act.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joe Mwinga in Lusaka on the "Focus </F>

  [Excerpt] The UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] delegation at the Lusaka peace talks 
returned today apparently more willing to compromise. UNITA 
spokesman Jorge Valentim told reporters that the rebel movement 
no longer considered power sharing central to the issue of the 
talks. He said that UNITA did not want to gamble everything 
away by insisting on a few ministerial positions which the 
government were not prepared to give. The most important issue, 
he said, from UNITA's point of view, were guarantees that the 
opposition would be able to participate freely in the country's 
politics. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The issue of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola's [UNITA] participation in the country's 
government has not been resolved because UNITA has not yet 
responded to the government's offer. Last night, a source close 
to UNITA described as interesting the government's offer, adding 
however that UNITA was going to propose some amendments. The 
source declined to comment on the nature of such amendments, 
saying only that UNITA will today continue its meetings with the 
mediators and the observers to discuss the matter. 
  Meanwhile, another source has said that UNITA continues to 
avoid a definitive settlement to the problem and is only making 
general considerations concerning the government's offer. It is 
believed, though, that the mediators and observers want concrete 
answers from UNITA and will likely exert pressure on it today to 
obtain them. We will have to wait and see.

  [Excerpts] In New York, the UN Security Council has 
approved the continuation of the UN Angola Verification 
Mission's mandate until 31 May of this year. Though it did not 
approve a new sanctions package against the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], the UN Security 
Council meeting, which wound up after midnight, could yet 
approve such sanctions at a meeting to be held two weeks from 
now, should UNITA insist on war. 
  In the resolution it approved, the UN Security Council urged 
an end to hostilities and condemned all behavior that hinders 
humanitarian work in Angola. [passage omitted] 
  Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, Angolan ambassador to the United 
Nations, has expressed satisfaction about the fact that the UN 
Security Council has told UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to present a report on the evolution of the Lusaka 
peace talks over the next two weeks, after which UNITA could be 
severely punished, should it continue to resort to warmongering 
behavior. 
  [Begin Mbinda recording] We are very happy to know that the 
resolution adopted by the UN Security Council gives a two-week 
deadline for the UN secretary general to present a report on the 
evolution of the Lusaka peace talks. We are also very happy to 
learn that, should UNITA continue to hamper the implementation 
of the peace process, the UN Security Council will again analyze 
the problem and impose whatever sanctions it deems necessary. 
[end recording] 
  Speaking to the press only minutes after the UN Security 
Council meeting, Ambassador Afonso van Dunem Mbinda said the 
Lusaka peace talks are deadlocked all because UNITA is unwilling 
to budge. 
  [Begin Mbinda recording] We can say that the Lusaka peace 
talks have come to a halt. The Angolan Government has just 
advanced a proposal, it has just made an offer, in which it 
proposes that UNITA be given several ministerial posts in the 
central government, the provinces, and other areas where UNITA 
can participate in terms of the peace process. The government 
did so as a gesture to encourage national reconciliation. UNITA 
has not accepted that gesture by the government. UNITA demands, 
needs, or requires more ministerial portfolios. It has demanded 
far more than what it deserves. Our government has already 
noted that it will not make any more such concessions. So, this 
was an offer the government made UNITA and now the government is 
unwilling to negotiate that offer. If we negotiate an offer, we 
will be [words indistinct] of the electoral process which makes 
it clear that it is up to one of the so-called sides, the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, MPLA, to form the 
government and govern. [end recording] 
  The Angolan ambassador to the United Nations also voiced the 
opinion that the international community must exert pressure on 
UNITA to end the war and make greater efforts to reduce the 
Angolan people's suffering. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] [Words indistinct] the Malawi Young Pioneers has 
been disarmed and disgraced, then President Banda himself has 
been proposing their rehabilitation. Opening parliament 
yesterday, he said the act that set them up would be repealed, 
but also suggested that the Young Pioneers who had fled the 
country should be recalled, and their misdeeds of the past 
forgiven and forgotten. He has even suggested that old civil 
servants could be retired and their jobs be given to the Young 
Pioneers. The disbandment of the Young Pioneers was, of course, 
one of the (?crying) demands of the opposition. Aleki Banda, 
first vice president of the opposition United Democratic Front, 
UDF, was himself instrumental years ago in setting up the Young 
Pioneers. On the line, Josephine Hazeley asked him if he was 
happy with the president's decision to repeal the Young Pioneers 
Act. 
  [Begin recording] [Banda] Not quite. You see, the issue of 
the Young Pioneers is a very important issue here. In the 
National Consultative Council what we have insisted on [words 
indistinct] is that first we want a full report of what has been 
done to delink the Malawi Young Pioneers from the MCP [Malawi 
Congress Party]. Secondly, a full report on the disarmament. 
Now, we have not received any report up to now. Therefore, we 
are not satisfied with any statements that are made unilaterally 
by the MCP and the Malawi Government. 
  [Hazeley] But surely, making them illegally, repealing the 
Young Pioneers Act is a step in the right direction, you must 
admit. 
  [Banda] Well, that is certainly a step in the right 
direction, except that, of course, he goes on to say what is 
going to be done about them, and various other matters. Now, 
all these are matters which we are deeply interested in. They 
have not involved us in the formulation of any of the policies 
which he has announced. 
  [Hazeley] The president has said he would like for everybody 
to embrace the Young Pioneers because after all they are your 
children. 
  [Banda] Well, we agree with that. We do agree that they are 
our children, they're our nephews and nieces. We ourselves have 
said that we have no desire to victimize them, except of course 
for those who may have committed crimes for which, of course, 
each individual would answer for. But we would still like to be 
involved in the formulation of policy regarding the future usage 
of these useful resources that we have. 
  [Hazeley] So, you don't find it distasteful to incorporate 
the Young Pioneers into the civil service? 
  [Banda] Well, probably as a general principle no. But it 
can't just be a wholesale incorporation of the Young Pioneers. 
We have to look at the numbers, at the various individuals to 
work out the most appropriate way of solving this problem. 
  [Hazeley] Now, the president has also suggested that as a 
matter of reconciliation, he would like to propose that those 
who are old members of the Young Pioneers should be retired and 
given full, terminal benefits. 
  [Banda] Well, as I say we are prepared to look at all those 
proposals, including retirement of those who are old, but we 
insist -- certainly on behalf of the UDF -- we would insist that 
we should be involved in all these decisions. We should discuss 
them. 
  [Hazeley] Aren't you just simply making a mountain out of a 
molehill as far as the Young Pioneers are concerned. The 
president has [words indistinct] with concrete ideas as to the 
future of these people, and you in the opposition haven't. 
  [Banda] Well, we are certainly not making a mountain out of 
a 
molehill because the Young Pioneers issue is a very sensitive 
transitional issue. The Young Pioneers did many things during 
the referendum process which were unacceptable. Now, this is a 
very important issue which really requires full consultation 
among all interested parties in this country in order to solve 
this problem in the best interests of Malawi. 
  [Hazeley] Some people say you, Aleki Banda, ought to be 
[words indistinct] because after all you had set these people up 
in the first place, the Young Pioneers. 
  [Banda] Oh, definitely. Well, I really understand I was the 
first commander of the Young Pioneers, and was commander for 10 
years. During the 10 years of my commandership, the main 
emphasis for the Young Pioneers was in development. The basic 
principles for which they were formed is still valid up to now, 
except that in later years the Malawi Congress Party misused 
them, or rather abused the movement in order to further their 
ends. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Raul Domingos, head of the Mozambique </F>
National Resistance delegation to the Supervision and Control 
Commission, by Lourenco Jossias at Hotel Cardoso in Maputo; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Jossias] You have just visited the United 
States. Can you tell us what the objective was of your visit and 
your itinerary? 
  [Domingos] My visit had two parts. The first part involved a 
program organized by the U.S. Information Agency. Our group 
included people from different nationalities. We visited 
different institutions, such as the Senate's Center for 
Strategic Affairs, the Carnegie Peace Institute. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Jossias] And what was the second part of your program? 
  [Domingos] As an official of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], I took the opportunity to hold talks with 
U.S. officials. As you are aware, we could not travel to the 
United States during the war to make contacts in favor of Renamo. 
  Once I was in the United States, I could not lose the 
opportunity to establish contacts that would be useful to my 
party. Thus, I again returned to New York and Washington. 
  In New York, I held talks with a number of UN officials. The 
highest contact I had was with James Jonah, UN assistant 
secretary general for political affairs. In Washington, I had 
contacts at the level of the State Department, and the highest 
contact I had was with George Moose's assistant because Moose 
was out of the country. 
  I held very important meetings with people in charge of 
African affairs. 
  I was very fortunate in my contacts because they were held 
at 
a time when independent voices spoke well of the progress of the 
Mozambican peace process and the troops' confinement. 
  People always thought it would not be possible to reach a 
peace agreement with Renamo. They thought Renamo had no control 
over its troops. One year has passed and our troops have not 
carried out one unusual movement. We were able to show that we 
can order an effective cease-fire, that we are able to confine 
our men in a disciplined manner. We were able to demonstrate 
that there is command within Renamo and this gave us a certain 
credibility with the U.S. public and the State Department. 
  When all this information is received by the United States, 
it gives us a certain credibility that we did not enjoy before. 
  I had the opportunity to speak to people who in the past 
were 
Renamo's critics, like Chester Crocker. It could not be 
expected that he would receive someone from Renamo. Herman 
Cohen, with whom I met on many occasions in Rome, was also very 
amenable. 
  I was also fortunate because of other reasons: My visit to 
the United States took place at a time when the Electoral Law 
had already been approved, the electoral commissions and the 
Elections Administration Technical Secretariat are already 
functioning. There is significant progress in the troops' 
confinement process, particularly considering that Renamo is 
confining larger percentages of troops compared with the 
government. 
  I also had contacts with the International Center for 
Strategic Studies, the Republican Institute, and the National 
Democratic Institute. They were all very positive meetings. 
  [Jossias] What was the reason for all these contacts? 
  [Domingos] Most of my meetings were aimed at briefing the 
officials there about the present situation in Mozambique and to 
prepare the visit of my president to the United States. 
  [Jossias] When is he visiting the United States? 
  [Domingos] Well, at first, we thought the visit would take 
place in April, but we have now realized that that is not the 
best time. First, there will be Easter celebrations during the 
month of April and many people go on holidays. Second, in 
April, there will be elections in South Africa which will 
attract the attention of both the U.S. people and Mozambicans. 
There is a very short period between Easter celebrations and 
the elections. That is why we set President Dhlakama's visit to 
the United States for May. 
  [Jossias] Does the choice of the date depend entirely on you 
or does it also depend on the United States? 
  [Domingos] We made the last alterations together. First, 
President Dhlakama will visit the United Nations at the 
invitation of the UN general secretary. Then he is thinking of 
going to Washington for contacts with the State Department. 
  [Jossias] Mr. Raul Domingos, do you think you have been able 
to change the image that the United States had of Renamo, that 
it was a terrorist movement? 
  [Domingos] Well, at least I, myself, was not received as a 
terrorist. I cannot say that I was the one who changed the 
situation because that cannot be done in a few days. A series 
of actions that we have been carrying out contributed toward the 
change of image. 
  The image that people had of Renamo in Washington, United 
States, is no longer the image of Chester Crocker's Renamo and 
the Gerson Report. 
  The image that Renamo had as a result of the Gerson Report 
disappeared following my visit, the progress registered here 
with the approval of the Electoral Law, the beginning of the 
confinement process, and the behavior of our forces in assembly 
areas. All this helped to change the image. 
  What I did in the United States was to give the true picture 
of Renamo. I can therefore safely say that the present Renamo's 
image is not the Gerson Report's image. It is the image of the 
Rome Accord. 
  [Jossias] And what about the coincidence between your 
departure for the United States and the publication of the U.S. 
State Department report accusing Renamo of human rights 
abuse...didn't it harm your visit? 
  [Domingos] Not at all. I was at the State Department, and I 
told the officials there that the accusation was false. The 
State Department lamented the report and also agreed that it was 
not true. It said there are people who collect information and 
write and the department has no authority over these people. 
The department officials believe the report was exaggerated. 
  I believe that this is the work of forces hostile to Renamo 
and perhaps it was not just a mere coincidence that the report 
was published when I was leaving for the United States. All 
the same, there were other credible news sources which at the 
time said good things about Renamo. When I arrived in the 
United States, the NEW YORK TIMES had just published a series of 
positive information on Renamo. This established the necessary 
balance, which enabled us to see that our image there was 
positive. 
  [Jossias] Did you meet with Renamo representatives during 
your visit to the United States? 
  [Domingos] Yes, I met with some members. As you are aware, 
they do not live in the same city. Some of them had come here, 
but they were very happy to see me there. As they said, it was 
the first time that a Renamo leader from the bush in Maringue 
had visited the United States. Only Renamo officials living in 
Germany and Portugal had visited the United States. Thus, they 
said I was bringing special warmth because I was coming inside 
the country. 
  During my visit to the United States, I was able to 
introduce 
my colleagues there to officials in the State Department. It 
was not an official introduction because of the formalities 
involved. All the same, I took the opportunity to introduce 
them as our men there and this gave them greater strength. 
  [Jossias] Did you meet with other Mozambicans, apart from 
Renamo members? 
  [Domingos] I was unable to because of my working agenda. 
  [Jossias] What went wrong during your visit to the United 
States? 
  [Domingos] Nothing really. If I had to make an assessment of 
my visit, I would only think of one thing that was bad, the 
weather. It was very cold there.

  [Text] Harare Mar 16 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's Agriculture 
Minister Kumbirai Kangai on Wednesday [16 March] insisted there 
was "nothing wrong" with government action in seizing 
white-owned farms and then leasing them to cabinet ministers, 
MPs and civil servants. 
  Mr Kangai said it was part of government policy to "develop 
indigenous commercial farmers". 
  The minister also confirmed reports that the first farm to 
be 
seized in terms of the controversial Land Acquisition Act was 
initially intended for 33 peasant farmers from an overcrowded 
neighbouring communal land but was instead leased to Minister of 
Education Witness Mangwende. 
  The law allows the government to force white farmers to sell 
their land and denies them the right to sue for unfair 
compensation. 
  Mr Mangwende was the agriculture minister two years ago who 
bulldozed the policy into law, leading President Robert Mugabe's 
"revolutionary" land policy to correct imbalances in land 
distribution. 
  Some 4,000 white farmers own 11 million hectares of land. 
  Mr Kangai who faced the press on the scandal for the first 
time on Wednesday, said the government's resettlement policy was 
"very clear" in securing land not only for peasants, but also 
for people who happened to be senior government officials. 
  The government was in the process of "addressing the 
disparity of the position, and developing the indigenous 
commercial farmer", Mr Kangai said. "Mangwende happened to be 
an individual who had an application on our file," he said. 
  "For that farm, for the people who applied, he was the most 
suitable. There is nothing wrong with that," he added. 
  Mr Kangai insisted Mr Mangwende had met "the right 
criteria". 
  When charged that a similar case in Britain would have 
resulted in the responsible cabinet minister being fired, Mr 
Kangai replied, "I am glad I am not in the UK".

  [Text] Monrovia, March 16 (AFP) -- Two of Liberia's armed 
factions have begun to disarm, while a third has indicated it 
will follow suit, the Economic Community of West African States 
Cease- Fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The State Council, sworn in a week ago, mandated ECOMOG to 
disarm all factions that took part in the four-year civil war, 
including those that did not sign a peace agreement. 
  Detailing for the first time the disarmament underway, 
ECOMOG 
said in a statement that soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia 
(AFL -- the armed branch of the interim government) and the 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) had started to turn 
weapons in at eight special centres around the country. 
  The United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), main rival of the 
NPFL, had given ECOMOG the green light to start disarming its 
fighters, ECOMOG added. Peacekeepers had collected 856 
individual weapons, two artillery pieces, ammunition and hand 
grenades, the statement said. The AFL began disarming March 8, 
while the NPFL did so on March 12. 
  A leadership crisis caused the ULIMO to delay, but ULIMO 
president Alhaji Koromah had now given the green light to begin 
disarming his forces. On Saturday General Roosevelt Johnson, 
ULIMO's top military leader, said he had "reconciled" with 
Koromah after a crisis sparked by political and ethnic rivalry 
within the organisation. 
  Johnson afterwards urged all the movement's fighters to 
cooperate with the disarmament process.

  [Text] Moves to settle the border dispute between Nigeria 
and Cameroon have been initiated by the Organization of African 
Unity, OAU. Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Alhaji Babagana 
Kingibe, stated this in Accra after delivering a message from 
Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha, to Ghana's 
President Jerry Rawlings. He said the OAU conflict prevention 
mechanism, under the chairmanship of President Husni Mubarak, 
has invited Nigeria to a meeting today to discuss the conflict. 
  Alhaji Babagana reaffirmed that Nigeria stood for a peaceful 
resolution of the conflict but was disgusted when France sent 
troops and armament to support Cameroon. The minister said the 
OAU had already held several meetings in Addis Ababa and the 
organization's ability to resolve the conflict peacefully will 
be a test for President Mubarak's committee.

the troops deployed to the Nigerian Bakassi Peninsula as a 
condition for peaceful resolution of the conflict with Cameroon. 
The minister of state for foreign affairs, Chief Anthoni Ani, 
stated this in an interview in Harare, Zimbabwe. He said 
Cameroon was insisting Nigeria withdraw from the peninsula and 
revert to its position as at last December, before any dialogue. 
Chief Anthony Ani, who is on a tour of eastern and southern 
Africa, said that Nigeria could not withdraw from her own 
territory. The minister has already met the presidents of 
Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda (?on the matter).

  [Text] New administrative guidelines are being worked out 
to ensure the smooth running of the Ministry of External 
Affairs. The minister of state in the ministry, Chief Anthony 
Ani, made this known yesterday in Harare, Zimbabwe, while 
addressing the diplomatic staff of the Nigerian High Commission. 
Under the new arrangement, noncareer people will no longer be 
appointed as ambassadors while retired officers will not be 
granted contract terms. 
  Chief Ani explained that the move was to ensure that career 
FS [foreign service] officers attained the highest positions 
while still at their prime. The minister of state also 
announced that a number of the staff in outstations will be 
recalled as part of the reorganization and cost saving exercise. 
He appealed to them to cooperate in the restructuring which, he 
said, was to provide a better fate for them.

scheduled to begin tomorrow. The postponement was attributed to 
the closure of the university last Saturday [12 March]. 
  Meanwhile, the vice chancellor of the University of Lagos, 
Professor Nuredeen Alaho, has blamed the media for the present 
closure of the university. He alleged that the media overplayed 
reports of secret societies in the university. Prof. Alaho told 
the Lagos state administrator, Colonel O. Oyinlola, that the 
media did not put into consideration the interest of the nation 
while reporting the cult issues. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lagos, 16 Mar (AFP) -- Some 300 foreign students of 
the University of Lagos, including women, have been in the 
streets of Lagos today because they have nowhere to go following 
the closure of their university indefinitely, some of the 
students told AFP. 
  The university was closed by the authorities on 12 March 
following violent clashes at the university between students and 
members of secret cults on the campus, leaving several dozen 
students seriously wounded. 
  "We thought foreign students would be exempt, but to our 
great surprise we were led out of the campus by the security 
forces," Albert Aboudem Atemkeng (Gambia), stated the secretary 
general of the Association of Foreign Students at the University 
of Lagos. 
  Among the students are Liberians, Egyptians, Mauritanians, 
Indians, Palestinians, Ghanaians, Gambians, Cameroonians, 
Sudanese, Ugandans, Nigerois, Zambians, Kenyans, Beninese, 
Pakistanis, Tanzanians, South Africans, and Equatorial Guineans. 
  Last night, they were all forced to sleep in front of the 
offices of the UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR], a French 
language student reported. A UNHCR source told AFP that the 
humanitarian organization may probably not be able to help the 
students since its mission is limited to refugees. 
  Most of these students now in the streets have modest 
incomes 
and cannot meet the demands of such an unexpected situation with 
their own resources, Joseph Chefu (Cameroon), a law student 
stated. He expressed the view that the university must grant 
them some favor as is done by universities for foreign students 
throughout the world. 
  This is the second time foreign students at the University 
of 
Lagos were expelled at the same time as the nationals following 
the closure of the university. The first time was in May 1992 
during student demonstrations against the government.

  [Text] Since no single party has obtained an absolute 
majority in the country's legislative elections, alliances will 
have to be formed to know which political group will be asked to 
form the new government. As soon as the results were released, 
discussions on alliances began. For his part, the president of 
the Republic, who, according to the Constitution, must appoint 
the prime minister from the parliamentary majority, has begun 
consultations with the main political parties of the country. 
In this regard, delegations of the Togolese People's Rally 
[RPT], the Union for Justice and Democracy [UJD], the Action 
Committee for Renewal [CAR], the Togolese Union for Democracy 
[UTD], and the Coordination of New Forces [CFN] were at the 
presidency in Lome II district this morning where they took 
turns in meeting President Eyadema. Their discussions centered 
on general problems and efforts being made for the country's 
recovery. At the end of the discussions, the heads of 
delegation of the parties concerned gave us their impressions. 
First, the impressions of Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, leader of the 
CFN. 
  [Koffigoh] As prime minister, I usually hold 
discussions with the head of state and report to him on 
government business. We discussed state affairs. You are well 
aware of the principle of continuity in state affairs. It is 
therefore quite normal for me to hold discussions with the 
president at the end of this transition. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] You were also consulted in 
your capacity as CFN chairman. What do you have to say on this 
consultation? 
  [Koffigoh] The CFN philosophy is known since our 
campaign was based on it. We participated in the election 
campaign in a very democratic manner. We are in search of 
national reconciliation, definitive peace in Togo, the recovery 
of the nation's economy, and the consolidation of our democracy. 
That is our philosophy and of course we are holding discussions 
with all political actors who so desire so that these objectives 
can be realized. 
  [Correspondent] How do you see the future of the 
Togolese political scene and what will be the positive 
contribution of the CFN to the nation's political life? 
  [Koffigoh] I shall soon end my term of office as prime 
minister of the transition and a government will soon be formed. 
I believe that the current consultations being held by the head 
of state are aimed at appointing a new prime minister, but we 
shall always be there -- at the disposal of our activists as 
well as the entire Togolese people -- for the realization of the 
four objectives I have just mentioned, namely national 
reconciliation, the restoration and consolidation of civil peace 
in Togo, and the social and economic recovery of our country 
which has been weakened by political conflicts of all kinds, 
conflicts which have affected the upper and lower strata of the 
masses. We shall also be there for the consolidation of our 
democracy, which is like a new-born child. When the new 
government is formed and parliament begins sitting, this young 
democracy must be consolidated. However, particular attention 
must be paid to our country's economic recovery. We shall 
always be present with the people for the accomplishment of this 
task. 
  Let us now follow the statement of RPT Secretary General 
Vigniko Amedegnato. 
  [Amedegnato] It must be said that we have been waiting 
for this moment for three years now. We are now at the 
crossroads and we have understood that the president of the 
Republic does not intend to waste time. We need to help our 
country out of its present difficulties and it is useless to 
waste time in futile bickering. That is why we praise the 
president for his prompt gesture of contacting the political 
parties. Second, the president is ready to consult everyone 
before taking any step whatsoever. We have had the occasion to 
discuss with him and to communicate to him the RPT's proposals 
and suggestions. 
  UJD chairman, (Lal Tankpa Djaki) who was part of the RPT 
delegation, talks of his party's alliance with the RPT. 
  [(Djaki)] As you know very well, the RPT is the first 
Togolese party. UJD was created to support the president of the 
Republic and to help him to establish democracy, something he 
had begun to do long before the social and political strife. 
UJD is conscious that only the president is capable of leading 
the country to the democracy which every Togolese is yearning 
for and this is why we support the president. It is for this 
reason that we have formed an alliance with the RPT, which is 
the main party supporting the president. The RPT and the UJD 
will therefore work together to help the president lead the 
country toward democracy and economic recovery. 
  Yaovi Agboyibor, who led the CAR delegation to Lome II, also 
spoke to us after the discussions with the president. 
  [Agboyibor] The discussions focused essentially on 
general problems, especially the efforts being made to create 
the social and economic conditions needed for the country's 
development. We dwelled at length on this point because we of 
the CAR believe that before discussing the main issues, 
especially the formation of the government, the opposition must 
act in a united manner. The CAR and UTD will first have to take 
well-defined positions before discussing with the presidential 
group. 
  [Correspondent] You told the international media that 
the opposition has the majority. You said that the UTD-CAR 
tandem has absolute majority in the National Assembly. Does 
that mean that an alliance has been formed between the CAR and 
the UTD. If so, on what basis? 
  [Agboyibor] Yes, I would say that an alliance was 
sought by and has almost been imposed by the voters. If we have 
to be true to the will of the people, the UTD and the CAR should 
unite. This alliance is almost natural and no one has the right 
to call it into question. 
  [Correspondent] Is it a wish? Is it a desire? 
  [Agboyibor] Yes, you know, as political leaders we have 
the duty to act in accordance with the will of our voters. 
People have voted either for the RPT and its allies or for the 
opposition. We do not have the right to ignore this 
reality. 
  [Correspondent] Yesterday, the UTD chairman made a 
statement to the media saying he does not want UTD seats to be 
attributed without his opinion. What is your observation about 
this opinion. 
  [Agboyibor] I consider this opinion as Edem Kodjo's and 
not his voters' and even less so that of his party. 
  Finally, UTD chairman Edem Kodjo also gave us his 
impressions. 
  [Kodjo] We reviewed and examined the country's problems 
in general. So far, this is what has been done. 
  [Correspondent] Yesterday, you issued a communique 
underlining the UTD's specific nature, and the determination of 
your party to work for national reconciliation and economic 
recovery. We have heard other statements to the effect that 
this position is only that of the UTD chairman and less that of 
his party and its voters. What observation can you make on that 
statement? 
  [Kodjo] The UTD chairman always speaks on behalf of the 
UTD and the statements made by the chairman are binding on the 
whole party. In regard to speaking on behalf of the Togolese 
people, I believe no one can arrogate to himself that right. It 
is however evident that what we said is in accordance with our 
policy which is to say that we belong to the parliamentary 
majority and we believe our specific nature must be taken into 
account and our views considered. We want our views to be 
considered so that we are not reduced to a rump party. However, 
if decisions are made without consulting us then we will kindly 
make it known that we cannot agree to such methods. That is all 
we wanted to say. We are not declaring war on anyone. We are 
very peace-loving and wish for mutual understanding so that we 
can agree on programs and actions for the future of this country 
within the framework of economic recovery and national 
reconciliation.

  [Excerpts] Following the proclamation of the results of the 
legislative elections on 13 March, General Gnassingbe Eyadema 
yesterday held preliminary consultations with the major 
political parties in the country. [passage omitted] 
  Still on the legislative elections, here is a clarification 
by the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]: The UTD Steering 
Committee expresses satisfaction with the proclamation of the 
results of the 6 and 20 February legislative elections by the 
Supreme Court. The UTD lauds this proclamation which in itself 
constitutes a new victory for the democratic opposition. It 
congratulates and thanks the Togolese people for their courage 
and their determination. Through their unequivocal vote, they 
opted for change. 
  Contrary to the AFP dispatch which appeared on 15 March 1994 
and was signed by Francis Ahouadi, the UTD is and remains a 
party that belongs to the democratic opposition. The UTD has, 
under no circumstance, sold off the victory of the Togolese 
people in the February legislative elections through any 
alliance with the forces that it has fought up until this point. 
However, the UTD wishes to make the following clarification: 
Before the proclamation of the results, it held informal 
discussions with the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR]. During 
the discussions, several proposals were examined by both sides. 
All the same, before any agreement is reached, the CAR 
contacted the presidential side to suggest to it a broad 
alliance within which the post of speaker of the national 
assembly will come to the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. 
But with the refusal of the RPT to negotiate with its party and 
working around the UTD national chairman, the CAR chairman, in a 
second move, suggested the post of the speaker of the National 
Assembly to the UTD secretary general who declined the offer. 
The CAR later refused the alternative proposition for 
settlement made by the UTD. 
  In light of all this, the UTD was forced to assert its 
specificity and demonstrated its determination to place itself 
above the fray. The UTD is ready, in accordance with all the 
components of the new majority in the elections, to assume all 
its responsibilities concerning the future of the country. This 
country is faced with serious political, economic, and social 
challenges and which it must meet. This demands that the UTD be 
treated with respect and dignity in its discussions with the 
CAR. Also consensus must be sought in the fundamental decisions 
concerning, particularly, the government of the country. For 
the UTD, it is very important that the victory of the people be 
absolutely preserved and administered within an atmosphere of 
indispensable harmony. 
  [Signed] Edem Kodjo, for the Steering Committee.

suffer the same fate as Dr. Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana 
should he persist in being an obstructionist in the way of a new 
South Africa. Addressing a rally at Mothibistad near Kuruman, 
Mr. Modise said the target was not homeland government's but the 
government in Pretoria. He said victory would be claimed after 
President F.W. de Klerk had been removed from power. 
  The office of the kwaZulu chief minister says the ANC 
alliance and certain trade unions will not succeed in sowing 
distrust between kwaZulu public servants and the kwaZulu 
government. The kwaZulu government said allegations of misuse 
of pension funds were untrue as it paid the pension 
contributions of kwaZulu public servants to the South African 
Government on a monthly basis for investment.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 17 SAPA -- President F. W. de 
Klerk said he was working on an "Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
initiative" which might signify a breakthrough in the 
constitutional deadlock and the IFP's non-participation in the 
April election. 
  Mr de Klerk did not elaborate on what the initiative 
entailed, but said it raised a "slight hope", adding the 
negotiation remains the responsible route. The IFP missed the 
final deadline to submit its candidates list on Wednesday [16 
March]. 
  Mr de Klerk made these remarks at a breakfast meeting on the 
second of election tour through the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. 
  Mr de Klerk told businessmen attending the breakfast that 
the IFP's abstenance was a "dark cloud", but there was "a crack 
of light ahead". He assured his audience that they had nothing 
to fear under a new dispensation. 
  Mr de Klerk commended the issuing of a pamhlet in kwaZulu, 
which assured kwaZulu government employees the non-participation 
of the IFP would not affect their "career or pension security". 
  He said kwaZulu government employees would become part of 
the 
integration process, when the civil service of the kwaZulu/Natal 
province is structured.

  [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] working group on international mediation has 
reached a tentative agreement on possible names of mediators to 
end the constitutional deadlock. However, agreement could not 
be reached on the terms of reference for the mediators. Dr. 
Frank Mdlalose of the IFP and the ANC's Mr. Jacob Zuma said they 
would not release the names of the mediators before consulting

  [Text] The deadline for the submission of amended 
candidates lists for the election expired today with a blow to 
the Conservative Party [CP]. About 10 of its MP's [member of 
parliament] are on the final candidate list of General Constand 
Viljoen's Freedom Front. Earlier today CP leader Dr. Ferdie 
Hartzenberg said any member who made himself available as a 
candidate for the election would automatically lose his CP 
membership. Veronica van der Westhuizen reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Van der Westhuizen] The Freedom Front did 
not want to disclose the names of the CP candidates and said it 
would do so tomorrow. This move led to a split in the 
Conservative Party. One of the suspended CP members, Dr. Pieter 
Mulder, said he was very disappointed by the move. 
  [Mulder] We are really sorry that it happened this way. We 
had an agreement yesterday that it was possible to have a double 
strategy for people that want to take part in election to prove 
the support for self-determination and the other part, and that 
we can dab it together and that it would be put on Friday to our 
head committees like that, and suddenly there was a change in 
plan on the CP side and they just said we are not in the party 
anymore. 
  [Van der Westhuizen] There were no major changes on the 
amended National Party lists. Earlier, it was expected that 
prominent Inkatha Freedom Party members would be included, also 
the African National Congress had no major changes. The future 
of the Northwest Christian Democratic Party, of which former 
President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana is the leader, is 
hanging in the balance. President Mangope said he could not meet 
with his parliament to discuss participation in the election.

  [Text] Pretoria March 16 SAPA -- Pro-election right-wing 
leader Gen Constand Viljoen is widely believed to head the 
Freedom Front's [FF] candidate list, which includes 10 MPs. 
  At least seven CP [Conservative Party] MPs are inluded on 
the 
list, including the Mulder brothers Pieter and Corne, and CP MP 
Joseph Chiole who are expected to be high up. 
  Mr Chiole said the the Front had "significant" candidates on 
all its lists. Apart from the CP MPs, a former National Party 
MP and prominent Afrikaner Volksunie [National Union -- AVU] 
leaders appeared on the list. 
  He would not give names but it is understood former AVU 
members Chris de Jager and Moolman Mentz were included. The 
CP's Natal exucutive would probably form the core of the FF's 
candidate list in the province with former CP leader Carl Werth 
in a prominent position. 
  Dr Pieter Mulder told SAPA the inclusion of CP MPs on the 
list did not constitute a split in Conservative ranks. He said 
there was no division over the concept of a "volkstaat" 
[Afrikaner homeland] but there were differences over strategy on 
how to obtain it. 
  "I'm not fighting with the CP but against the National Party 
and the African National Congress." 
  The FF candidate list was still subject to change and the 
names would be announced on Thursday [17 March].

Mr Ramodike, also chief minister of Lebowa, made the

  At the same time, kwaNdebele Chief Minister M. J. Mahlangu 
announced his resignation from the UPF. He is also on the ANC's

meant to campaign under the ANC's banner and logo. They said 
they were resigning to avoid violating the standing agreement of 
the Patriotic Front, of which the UPF is a member.

<F P=106> [Report by Editor Mathatha Tsedu] </F>
  [Text] The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania goes 
into this election fully confident that the oppressed masses 
will see through the fraud of the Kempton Park agreements and 
remember that the PAC opposed the deals. But even more, said 
president Clarence Mlamli Makwetu, the PAC hoped that Africans 
would vote for it because of the policies it espouses. 
  Policies such as a "caring economy", land repossession, its 
stand on violence, housing provision, health and on 
privatisation. Plagued by internal dissent over its 
participation in the negotiations, Makwetu says the decision was 
right and the PAC has many gains to show for its participation. 
  The chairing of the deliberations by judges had "given the 
regime an advantage as the judges are not neutral but State 
appointees. We said they should go, and they went", he said. 
To accusations that the PAC was "an also ran", a party that 
went into the talks but fails to get any of its points across, 
he said: 
  "We opposed the division of the country into regions. We 
were against the entire package. We want the return of the land 
and opposed property rights given to settlers. We did what we 
did but they were refused. But we got vote for the African 
people. We fought for it and we got it and that is important," 
Makweti said. 
  While the interim constitution provides for semi autonomous 
regions that are getting more powers through trilateral talks 
with the rightwing, the ANC [African National Congress] and the 
Government, the PAC wanted a centralised country and was asking 
for a mandate to change the interim constitution and bring a 
more people-oriented system. 
  "We rate our chances as very good. Opinion polls are not a 
factor, they do not worry us when they say we have very little 
support because they are never accurate. In Britain they said 
the Labour Party would win the last election and it did not 
happen. In Zimbabwe they said the same thing about ZANU 
[Zimbabwe African National Union] and Mugabe. In Lesotho 
recently, the BNP [Basotho National Party] was given a big lead, 
only for the BCP [Basotho Congress Party] to win all seats. We 
rely on the grassroots and our chances are good. 
  "We do not have money. We are not a rich organisation and we 
shall cut our suit according to our cloth. We are not going to 
rely as much on the media advertisements as other rich parties 
but we will do the canvassing ourselves. And it is in these 
campaigns that we see the support. When the PAC was formed in 
1960, we had only six branches on the Cape Peninsula, and a few 
in Soweto, Natal and Pretoria. But today for example, out of 
the 28 districts in Transkei, we have over 40 branches. We have 
branches all over the Orange Free State, Transvaal and the Cape. 
Our strength is there," he said. 
  Makwetu could not explain in detail what the caring economy 
promised by the PAC was. The PAC was opposed to capitalism and 
favoured socialism as a broad concept. "We want an economy that 
takes care of its people. Socialism itself as a word is 
meaningless and we believe that socialisation of economy, 
through the participation of workers in the process of ownership 
of industry will ensure that workers' interests are protected. 
Workers should be involved in decision making and also carry 
some of the responsibility that goes with that. Those who argue 
that socialism would fail, and that investors would flee should 
look at what is happening in China, where the entire Western 
world is flocking now," Makwetu said. 
  The PAC rejects the cut-off point of 1913 for land claims as 
contained in the interim constitution. "We say 1652 is the 
start of the land dispossession and should be the cut-off point. 
We will not pay for land that was stolen from us when we take 
it back. Compensation will only be considered for improvements 
made to the land," he added. 
  The repossession of the land will however not mean that each 
and every African will be given a piece of land. "Africans will 
have to make up their minds whether they want to be workers or 
farmers. And in the case of the latter, proof of an ability to 
farm will be needed before land is allocated for farming. We 
will also give each squatter a piece of a plot to live on. 
There is enough land in our country to do that and there is no 
need for the congestion that we see in every town." 
  The PAC does not have all the answers to the housing 
problem, 
he said. It foresaw a co-operation between the State -- which 
would provide land and infrastructure -- and the private sector. 
The PAC saw the ongoing violence as a state orchestrated 
phenomenon and rejected the idea that it was black on black. 
The PAC would curb ownership of guns and change laws so that no 
one could own 27 weapons as presently allowed by the law. 
  The violence had nothing to do with the armed struggle as 
the 
revolutionary forces were directing their energies against the 
regime, he said. His organisation cannot be specific about its 
health policy, except to say that one health care system will be 
in place. Whether the service will be free he could not yet 
say, he added. 
  The same applied to privatised national state concerns such 
as Iscor [South African Iron and Steel Corporation], Telkom and 
the Railways. Nationalisation usually benefited the new elite 
and not the people. The PAC however supported affirmative 
action but this would have to be done in a way that did not 
result in the lowering of standards. 
  Doors had to be opened and opportunities created for the 
development of entrepreneurs so that "Africans are not just a 
nation of workers and shop stewards." The playing field was 
presently unequal for political campaigning despite talks of 
this being done. "The international community and big business 
are supporting one party and I am afraid that I may not be able 
to convince my colleagues in the event of losing that the 
process had been free and fair," he said. 
  The PAC was however committed to the process and will honour 
and accept the outcome of the elections as it was convinced that 
despite all the hurdles, the African community would see through 
the process and vote for a party that will truly give them 
freedom and justice.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with deposed Bophuthatswana President </F>
Lucas Mangope by Ken Daniels on the "Channel Africa Report" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] Deposed President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana 
has been placed under house arrest by the South African 
administration in the formerly independent homeland. Mr. 
Mangope is on the line now confirming the arrest, which he says 
is preventing him from taking part in the democratic process in 
South Africa. 
  [Mangope] That's correct, yes. 
  [Daniels] In terms of what provisions or what law have they 
done that? 
  [Mangope] I don't know really. That is what baffles me. My 
own children are not to see me. My own children, my own family, 
immediate family, are not allowed to see me. I just cannot 
accept that. I'm not allowed, my wife is not allowed, my 
children with me here, are not allowed to go to my son's house. 
And I feel that is not right. 
  [Daniels] Have you been specifically told that you are not 
allowed to campaign in the election? 
  [Mangope] Yes, Dr. Tjaart van der Walt said that. 
  [Daniels] Said that you will not be permitted to canvas? 
  [Mangope] Well, he said they are restricting me in the 
interest of free political activity, whatever that means. In 
the interest of free political activity they are imposing this 
house arrest on me. 
  [Daniels] And would you have liked to have taken part in the 
election? Were you planning to do so? 
  [Mangope] My people were meeting today to discuss that. I 
have informed them what the position is, I mean, as it is, it is 
impossible. In any case there are parties who have not 
registered and who are therefore not going to take part in the 
election. I was going to put the matter of registration to my 
parliament yesterday. And if yesterday my parliament had 
adopted the recommendation, I'd definitely take part in the 
elections, but I was denied that.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with deposed Bophuthatswana President </F>
Lucas Mangope by Ken Daniels on the "PM News Wrap" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Former president of Bophuthatswana Lucas Mangope has 
clarified some of the events leading to the chaos in his 
homeland last week. In an interview with Ken Daniels, he 
explained AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene 
Terreblanche's involvement with the events that led to the 
downfall of his government. 
  [Begin recording] [Mangope] He said he spoke to me about 
their helping us and I said: No, I can't say yes; speak to my 
security people. I referred him to Mr. Cronje. 
  [Daniels] He didn't go on with your consent, as it were? 
  [Mangope] No, the people I spoke to and the people I invited 
are the Volksfront [National Front] people of Constand Viljoen. 
  [Daniels] With hindsight now, do you think it was a mistake 
-- Mr. Terreblanche coming into the country? 
  [Mangope] Well, I mean, he was not invited. I think it was a 
mistake that when he was told to leave he didn't leave. The 
people who were in charge -- my people in charge of security 
repeatedly requested him to leave but he, apparently, according 
to what they tell me, he would not leave. 
  [Daniels] Did you think the whole situation could have been 
avoided altogether -- the traumatic events of the past few days? 
  [Mangope] I don't know. I think you should direct that 
question to the African National Congress [ANC], to the 
Communist Party, and to the Nationalist Party who started the 
strikes. It has for a long time been the policy of the African 
National Congress and the Communist Party to destabilize 
Bophuthatswana, to make Bophuthatswana ungovernable, and to 
topple my government. 
  [Daniels] But were you not facing a situation which a large 
section of your people were in fact supporters of the ANC? 
  [Mangope] That has not been proved to me. I don't know if 
you have proof of that, that is the case. In any case even if 
that were the case why not allow me two days to put this matter 
to parliament -- for parliament to adopt a resolution in terms 
of which we would take part and that question that you asked 
would be proved right or wrong -- whether I have support or not, 
and also flowing from that resolution would be free political 
activity for other parties because we would not engage in an 
election campaign and deny others, other parties to do the same. 
We were literally denied the opportunity to prove that in fact 
we have...we have majority support in Bophuthatswana. 
  [Daniels] Could you not have held a referendum? 
  [Mangope] I have said all along that should the results of 
negotiations be satisfactory to us and should we be convinced 
that the constitution such as has been negotiated will bring a 
better life for our people, we'll go back to our people, but you 
know that up to the eleventh hour, which was last week, there 
was an impasse. We have said, therefore, that let there be 
international mediation. We are prepared to abide by whatever 
the mediation ... [pauses] whatever will emerge from the 
mediation, and we then will go to our people. [end recording]

  [Text] Deposed Bophuthatswana [Bop] President Lucas Mangope 
was placed under what was in effect house arrest this morning. 
The interim administration of Bop put him into what it called 
protective custody at his residence in Motswedi as a temporary 
measure, apparently in an effort to stabilize the situation, but 
the measure was lifted this afternoon after Dr. Mangope 
telephoned Inkatha Freedom Party leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and asked him to mediate with State President F.W. de Klerk on 
his behalf. Dr. Mangope had telephoned the Office of the State 
President earlier but was told that Mr. de Klerk was in a 
meeting. In a telephone interview Dr. Mangope's son Eddie told 
TV news what happened. 
  [Begin Eddie Mangope recording] Chief Buthelezi called him 
out of the meeting and posed this simple question: Why do you 
do this to President Mangope, and if it were you would you ... 
[changes thought] How would you feel if you were not allowed to 
be visited by your son, being under house arrest. [end recording] 
  Earlier today Dr. Lucas Mangope said his residence was being 
guarded by South African Defense Force soldiers. He spoke to TV 
news by telephone. 
  [Begin Mangope recording] I was surprised to be told by Dr. 
van der Walt this morning, only when I inquired, that I had been 
placed under house arrest -- well, he called it protective 
custody -- those of my family who are with me -- namely, my 
daughter and son, and my wife -- may not leave our premises and 
that my family ... family members may not come in to see me, 
including my own children. [end recording]

allay fears that general chaos could break out elsewhere in the 
country. [passage omitted] 
  Referring to the Bophuthatswana debacle, Mr. de Klerk said 
the government was considering prosecuting right wingers 
involved in the invasion of the homeland. Possible violations 
of Bophuthatswana and South African laws by AWB [Afrikaner

has predicted that other anti-ANC [African National Congress] 
homeland governments could collapse in the same was as 
Bophuthatswana. He said that what had happened in 
Bophuthatswana was happening in Ciskei today and could happen in 
kwaZulu tomorrow. He said homelands not aligned to the ANC 
could expect the same turmoil that had brought about the demise 
of Bophuthatswana. Meanwhile, hundreds of nurses in Ciskei have 
staged a protest in Bisho to demand that their pensions and 
gratuity payments be paid to them before the end of this month. 
Yesterday, Ciskeian public servants warned that they could turn 
to Bophuthatswana-style civil disobedience if their pensions 
were not paid out.

  [Text] Mmabatho March 16 SAPA -- The joint administrators 
of Bophuthatswana on Wednesday [16 March] issued a decree which 
will effectively hand over control of the former homeland to the 
South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC]. Job Mokgoro and Dr Tjaart van der Walt made the 
announcement at a press conference in Mmabatho. 
  In terms of the decree, yet to be promulgated, the 
co-administrators will take over responsibility for 
Bophuthatswana under the supervision of the South African 
Government and the executive council. 
  The decree, which applies to the whole of the territory, 
suspends part of the constitution. Existing law will apply 
until it is amended, substituted or repealed and all former 
state departments will continue until they are abolished or 
re-organised. 
  The co-administrators will take responsibility for any legal 
matters applicable to the former state president, executive 
council or ministers of state or parliamentary members. 
  Dr van der Walt and Mr Mokgoro's functions will include re- 
establishment of good government in Bophuthatswana, the 
restoration of essential services, suspension of the 
constitution and promotion of free political activity to 
facilitate the holding of free and fair elections. 
  They will have the power to make laws for peace, order and 
good government and may amend, substitute or repeal any such law. 
  The Independent Electoral Commission Act, the Transitional 
Executive Council Act, the Independent Broadcasting Authority 
Act and the Electoral Act of the Republic of South Africa will 
apply in Bophuthatswana. 
  The joint administrators will take responsibility for all 
liabilities and obligations incurred by the Bophuthatswana 
government before March 12. 
  They will also be liable for any legal action against the 
former homeland before the decree. 
  Public property in possession of anyone who held office 
under 
the former government will be recovered.

<F P=106> [Report by Clive Govender] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 17 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela's statements at an election rally 
in Chatsworth, Durban on Wednesday night were reckless and 
irresponsible, National Party [NP] MP Dr Johan Steenkamp said on 
Thursday [17 March]. 
  At the rally, Mr Mandela told thousands of supporters that 
senior state officials were perpetrating violence. The ANC 
leader also charged that the NP was fomenting violence. "I hope 
that before April 27 there will be sufficient evidence to show 
that there is a `third force'," said Mr Mandela. Dr Steenkamp 
said the ANC president's statement was an "insult to the 
intelligence of the public". 
  The Goldstone Commission had conducted a thorough 
investigation and found no proof of the existence of a "third 
force". 
  "It is common knowledge that the ANC itself is involved in 
by 
far the majority of cases of violence and intimidation 
throughout the country." 
  Dr Steenkamp said if Mr Mandela was serious about 
intimidation he would acknowledge his own party as the "main 
culprit, and do something about it". Mr Mandela's hard-hitting 
statement also undermined his stature as a Nobel peace laureate, 
Dr Steenkamp concluded.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with ANC Youth League President Lulu </F>
Johnson by Deon Lamprecht; place and date not given: "Lulu Wants 
To Fight for Freedom for All; Mokaba Successor Is No Dove"] 
  [Text] Lulu Johnson, new president of the African National 
Congress (ANC) Youth League, is not a dove. Political observers 
and journalists quickly began to compare Mr. Johnson to his 
controversial predecessor, Mr. Peter Mokaba, but he is a 
diplomat and not a fighter--the right choice to lead the youth 
in this time of reconciliation. Or so they say. 
  It is easy to come to such a conclusion. Where Mr. Mokaba's 
speeches are full of passion and fire, Mr. Johnson is cool, 
calculating, and logical. But on Saturday, shortly after Mr. 
Johnson's inauguration at the Youth League's annual convention 
in Soweto, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale, the ANC district leader for the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, warned that the 
young lion's bite should not be underestimated. The enthusiastic 
singing and dancing with which the approximately 1,500 delegates 
greeted his inaugural address attested to his popularity among 
the militant youth. 
  When you sit in his office high above Plein Street in 
Johannesburg, his eyes keep you riveted to your seat. He is not 
put off by a joke, and he does not smile during the interview. 
As is the case with most of the offices in Shell House, the 
ANC's headquarters, there is a long line of people outside his 
door. The furniture is sparse and Mr. Johnson's sports shirt is 
not suited to the warm summer day. 
  Lulu is actually short for Mlungisi, he says. He often leans 
forward over his lectern when he wishes to emphasize his words. 
About his fiery predecessor, Johnson says: "Mokaba's bully image 
was created by the media. There are other leaders who make 
bellicose talk, but the media singled him out. Peter is a 
dedicated fighter for freedom and human rights. But like many 
other people who were leaders under apartheid, he is no stranger 
to rage." 
  Johnson (29) has few pleasant memories of Keiskammahoek, the 
place where he was born in Ciskei: "I will always remember how a 
policeman forced me to strip naked so that he could search me." 
He had his baptism of fire during the tumultuous 1980s in the 
burning townships of Port Elizabeth: "In those years everything 
was simply consumed by the struggle. We had to fight to survive. 
I was born in the struggle. It is my mission to fight for 
freedom for all the people in this country," he says. 
  Johnson does not like to answer the question as to whether 
he 
is a Christian, but it was his involvement in a Christian youth 
organization that led him to start judging the system of 
apartheid by the Scriptures and he rejected it. His political 
career then accelerated. He joined the Congress of South African 
Students (COSAS) in 1980 and he was the national president of 
that organization in 1983 (Mokaba was also a COSAS man). Shortly 
after COSAS was outlawed by the government in 1985, Johnson was 
arrested for his political activities. After his release in 
1989, he found himself once again in the trenches and around 
December he advanced to become vice president of the ANC Youth 
League--the office he occupied until he was elected its 
president last week. 
  What course are the ANC youth going to take? "The Youth 
League is a militant organization and we will always remain so. 
The struggle is by no means over--we will continue to fight," he 
said. "Until there is peace and democracy for everyone in South 
Africa, the youth will continue to have to defend their 
townships at night with AK-47 rifles. The illusion of a `lost 
youth' is rubbish. We were never lost--we were at the forefront 
of the struggle and we will always be there." 
  He believes that the youth have a role to play in national 
reconstruction and development: "We cannot, however, bury the 
bitter fruit of 300 years of apartheid overnight; we are looking 
rather at a period of at least 10 years. That is why the Youth 
League is looking at five-year programs for reconstruction and 
development in all areas." 
  COSAS' cause still remains near and dear to his heart. 
"Black 
matriculation examination results were pathetic, but the roots 
of the problem lie in apartheid. The education crisis is going 
to get worse next year--thousands of students are going to be 
turned away because of unfair admission requirements and because 
they do not have the money." 
  Johnson rejects the rumors that the ANC leadership is afraid 
of its youth and is modifying its policy to appease young 
people. "As Youth League president I am also a member of the 
ANC's National Executive Committee. Our working relationship 
with the ANC is excellent--I can walk into Mandela's office at 
any time. Although we are a part of the ANC, we do not play 
second fiddle to it--we make our own decisions." He does foresee 
that the Youth League will always be a pressure group within the 
ANC. "It is for that reason that I am a proponent of a youth 
parliament that would see to the interests of youth at the 
highest level." 
  And are the more militant members of the ANC Youth League 
attracted by the bellicose talk of the Pan-Africanist Congress 
(PAC)? "I personally investigated the situation when those 
rumors began to circulate, primarily in the Vaal River Triangle 
and Soweto. I and my people on the scene kept a watchful eye on 
the situation and I do not know of any member of the Youth 
League who joined the PAC. 
  Regarding the contributions of the DP [Democratic Party] and 
other South African and foreign organizations to the freedom 
struggle he says: "There are those who claim to be experts on 
freedom and democracy. But the same DP that now claims to be a 
champion of democracy regarded the ANC's freedom fighters as 
terrorists until recently. P.W. Botha and Van Zyl Slabbert were 
in collusion." 
  This young lion has a warning for right-wingers: "Those 
organizations that are pursuing only violence should be aware 
that time is running out for them. They had better not come 
looking for rapprochement at the last minute." But, after all, 
the olive branch is there as well. "Even then we will be ready 
to accept them. We offer a home for youth across the entire 
political spectrum. We fight for peace and democracy for all 
South Africans." 
  Sexwale said at Johnson's inauguration that he spoke like a 
future president. Perhaps he is right. After all, Nelson Mandela 
had his baptism of fire decades ago as the leader of the ANC 
Youth League.

destabilize the country. At a news conference in Pretoria, de 
Klerk referred to right-wingers who regard the 31 March as 
so-called D-day. Linda van Tilburg reports: 
  At the end of the weekly cabinet meeting de Klerk said 
tonight that the right-wing is apparently planning to declare a 
homeland in several parts of the country on the last day in 
March. He said there is talk of the occupation of towns and 
sabotage. De Klerk also said plans are being made by the 
government, the Independent Electoral Commission, and the 
Transitional Executive Council to ensure that the election does 
take place in kwaZulu-Natal. Referring to confusion among civil 
servants in places like Ciskei, concerning their jobs and 
pensions, De Klerk gave the assurance tonight that the interim 
constitution guarantees these rights.

<F P=106> [Report on a lecture by Dirk Viljoen of the Afrikaner </F>
Freedom Foundation by Nols Nieman; place and date not given: 
"Problems Legion in That Afrikaner Refuge"] 
  [Text] A growing number of Afrikaners regard the 
Northern Cape region as their homeland and are quietly moving 
there, says Professor Carel Boshoff, chairman of the Afrikaner 
Freedom Foundation (Avstig). He himself has just moved there. 
But how viable is that region as an ethnic state? Dirk Viljoen, 
a municipal and regional planner from Pretoria, recently 
delivered a lecture on the viability of the region as a 
homeland. 
  An ethnic Afrikaner state can only succeed, according to 
Avstig's definition, in a region like the Northern Cape where 
the number of other peoples and groups is low, said Viljoen. 
Problems, however, are going to be legion. "Success will depend 
on whether enough Afrikaners will support it. I do not believe 
that this is currently the case. That will probably happen only 
long after a black government has come to power." Because whites 
only constitute 15.6 percent of the region's population while 
coloreds and blacks make up 58.5 and 25.7 percent, respectively, 
it will be some decades before Afrikaners become a majority or a 
significant element in the region. 
  Cooperation with other peoples and groups is therefore 
necessary at the outset. This must be based on principles that 
have to be given thought in advance and that must never give 
rise to doubts among the Afrikaners and the other groups. "It 
must be clearly set forth that, after a period of time, 
Afrikaners are to reach an agreement with the other groups in 
regard to a geographic partitioning. Development must have 
partition between Afrikaners and coloreds as an important goal 
in the medium and long term. Absolute clarity must also exist 
from the outset in regard to autonomous activity." 
  One of the greatest problems is the Northern Cape's very 
limited economic base. With the exception of Kimberley, 
Uppington, and De Aar, the economy is still in a primary phase 
where agriculture and mining predominate. Another problem is the 
very small populace of about 700,000 people. Rural population 
growth is low and only moderate urban growth is occurring. The 
"penetration" of blacks into the eastern subregion as a result 
of its proximity to Transkei, Qwaqwa, and Lesotho also threatens 
the ethnic state because these factors will exist in the future 
as well. The level of education is also very low. It will take a 
very long time to train the work force, of which 70 percent have 
completed the eighth form or less or have never attended school 
at all. 
  The Northern Cape gets little rainfall and water is scarce. 
Its geographic situation and its climate will always restrict 
development. Some of these disadvantages can be overcome by 
proper development policy and strategies. The two most important 
river systems--the Orange and Olifants Rivers--flow only through 
the western subregion and the northern parts of the central and 
eastern subregions. The region has an extensive primary road 
network but the other road networks are only poorly developed. 
The northwestern part's major highway connections to the more 
developed eastern areas are limited. 
  The system of major railway lines also has serious 
shortcomings. The rail line from Cape Town to the north and the 
one from Kimberley to Postmasburg, Sishen, and Hotazel are not 
interconnected and they are not operated as such. Few scheduled 
airline flights land in the region--even Kimberley does not have 
very regular service. A good deep sea port is lacking as well. 
The established urban concentrations are relatively small and do 
not constitute a strong base for development. It will cost a lot 
of money to develop the inadequate major infrastructure. The 
private sector can contribute, but the greatest responsibility 
will rest with the central and regional authorities. 
  Viljoen said that more favorable geographical and physical 
conditions for development, such as exist in other parts of 
South Africa, would have resulted in more trained workers and 
entrepreneurs. In the Northern Cape, such migration will occur 
primarily due to other factors. "One such factor is, of course, 
the desire of Afrikaners to experience their freedom in an 
ethnic state. The question, of course, is at what pace will 
Afrikaners seek refuge in the region after the election of a 
majority government." It will probably take longer than a decade 
for Afrikaners to establish themselves in the Northern Cape. 
This will greatly affect the pace of development and it is for 
that reason that the region will have to be systematically 
marketed among Afrikaners. 
  Success will depend greatly on the management of development 
efforts. A future regional government will not be able to 
accomplish that alone. The private sector, SABRA [South African 
Bureau of Racial Affairs], and other organizations with the same 
goals will have to actively participate. Organizations that 
represent ethnic state Afrikaners will have to become 
involved--politically and in other ways--in the regional 
government.

  [Text] George--Right-wing fraud syndicates are stealing 
money from, among others, the African National Congress (ANC) 
and are electronically transferring it to AWB [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] accounts, according to a white medicine 
man. Rumors of transactions of up to 40 million rands [R] came 
to light here in an urgent bail hearing for a white medicine man 
who claimed to have involved with these syndicates as a member 
of the AWB. 
  David Julius Myburg (30) of Myl Avenue, Wildernishoogte, the 
herbal medicine doctor, was taken into custody Friday in 
connection with a fraud case involving R2.7 million from the 
sale of the Gold Reef City Hotel. The court was told that the 
money was illegally transferred last year from the account of 
Liberty Life at the First National Bank in the Braamfontein 
suburb of Johannesburg. In the urgent hearing that lasted until 
late Friday night in Magistrate H. Buhr's court, bail in the 
amount of R20,000 was granted to Myburg, who last week opened a 
practice and store here on Sandkraal Road, Thembalethu. 
Myburg's passport was seized, and the case remanded to the 
Johannesburg District Court and scheduled for 18 February. 
  Myburg, a married man with two daughters, testified that 
until about eight months ago he had been engaged in obtaining 
money for the AWB from Gold Reef City. The former owner of the 
hotel, who sold it last month, had paid all of his expenses 
while he was acting as an intermediary among the various fraud 
syndicates and had no income. He testified that he accompanied a 
Gerhard Anderson, who had been responsible for the transactions 
because the AWB did not trust him. Anderson had allegedly 
claimed that the sale and transfer of the hotel was an 
authorized transaction, but he subsequently fled. Myburg 
received a commission of R150,000 from the owner of the hotel 
for his part in its sale as well as for the sale of another 
hotel. 
  According to him, the bank stopped payment on a second check 
for the same amount and some of those involved fled with the 
money. Because things went awry and he was being held 
responsible for the missing money, he fled here. He called up 
John Vorster Square [police headquarters] about the conspiracy 
to defraud. "We were convinced that the money was coming from 
leftists but we only discovered where the money was coming from 
after the banks stopped payment on the checks," he maintained, 
referring to the electronic transfer of funds from Liberty 
Life's account. 
  "There was a long list of transactions involving money 
transfers that I knew about. Up to R40 million were supposedly 
transferred from the ANC's account. This went on after I had 
already left. I am now giving second-hand information," he said 
in response to questioning. 
  Since he and his family established themselves here, Myburg 
has been making money from Thembalethu's people by "telling 
their fortune." Previously, he had earned as much as R60,000 per 
month as a medicine man at The Wheel in Durban. His inventory 
consists of, among other things, ivory valued at R40,000.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Weakening of the Right Wing -- "There are those who will say 
that the weakening of the Right is a good thing, because any 
split will make it more receptive to the changes taking place," 
notes the page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in 
English on 15 March. "Not so. A strong Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] gives the White Right a vehicle for 
presenting its volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] aspirations. If 
that vehicle breaks down, the Rights cause is harmed, and that 
can spell trouble, since a frustrated people will turn to 
violence as the only means of achieving their objectives. 
Besides, General Viljoen [leader of the Freedom Front], though 
he blew hot and cold over armed resistance, was able to keep the 
extreme Right in check, and this is no longer possible." 
  Call for Freedom Front To Outline Party Platform -- 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 16 March in its page-6 
editorial notes that the Freedom Front is "gearing itself for 
the election." But, "other than being against the National 
Party [NP] and against the ANC [African National Congress], for 
a volkstaat but against violence, except as a last resort, to 
achieve one, for taking part in the election and against sitting 
on the sidelines, Gen Viljoen has not expressed one political 
idea that could be regarded as the basis of a party platform." 
"The sooner the front outlines its platform, the better it will 
fare at the polls." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  TEC Must Address Civil Servants Concerns -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 17 March in a page-18 editorial commends the 
Transitional Executive Council (TEC) for the speed with which 
they moved "to allay the fears and concerns of civil servants, 
especially those employed by the various homeland 
administrations." The TEC has resolved to establish a task 
force "to defuse the crisis which is building up in the 
homelands." The TEC must ensure that its task force "does not 
become a forum for political point-scoring, and that it works 
speedily to address the concerns of all civil servants, 
including those working in the rest of South Africa. There is a 
real threat of widespread civil service turmoil, which could 
harm the transition process and even the election itself." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Complications in Planned Mandela-Zwelithini Meeting -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 17 March in a page-8 
editorial refers to the meeting between Nelson Mandela and Zulu 
King Zwelithini scheduled for 18 March, saying two things 
complicate it: "the imbizo, that is the call to the king's 
subjects to accompany him to the meeting, as well as the venue, 
the grounds of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. When the king 
met State President F.W. de Klerk in Durban recently, he was 
accompanied by an estimated 60,000 subjects. More can be 
expected in the heart of KwaZulu." "The wrong word or the wrong 
gesture could cost this country dearly." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  SACP Influential Role in Power-Sharing Government Unlikely 
-- 
On page 6 of Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 14 March, Colin 
Legum comments in his "Election Notebook" column on the National 
Party's "relentless warning that a future ANC government will, 
in fact, be masterminded by communists." But Legum believes 
that the South African Communist Party (SACP) "is unlikely to 
play an influential role in a power-sharing government between 
itself, the ANC, NP and one or two smaller parties." "For the 
foreseeable future, it is the ANC that will wag its communist 
appendage rather than the other way around. The differences 
between the ANC and SACP are likely to increase, not to 
diminish. The ANC's future preoccupation in retaining the 
support of the black youth is going to be with the 
Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) which has a history of hostility 
to the communists. Sadly, a more sophisticated analysis of the 
relationship between the ANC and SACP finds no place in the 
emotional climate engendered by the NP's `red scare' propaganda." 
<H6>  BEELD </H6>
  Bophuthatswana Unrest Brought Necessary Change -- 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 14 March argues in a page-8 
editorial: "A shocking event is sometimes necessary to bring 
necessary change. A few dramatic days in Bophuthatswana made 
sure of that. Many things changed irrevocably. First, the rule 
of Lucas Mangope came to an end. South Africa is again in 
control of this teritory, which at one stage was the leading 
light among the national states. Bophuthatswana is part of South 
Africa again, but it could have happened with less trauma and 
loss of life..." "Second, it was demonstrated clearly that the 
AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] cannot be anyone's knight in 
shining armor. The organization carried its racism and 
indiscipline into an explosive situation and made matters worse. 
If their members believed they were going to be received as 
heroes, they suffered a rude awakening when they saw how 
unwelcome they were. Eventually they had to leave in disgrace. 
We can only hope that the AWB invasion represents the final 
kicks of the era of mercenaries and white armed interference in 
black affairs." "The events in Bophuthatswana also served as an 
election catalyst. The on-going row in the Conservative Party 
[CP] and the Afrikaner National Front has suddenly been 
resolved: General Constand Viljoen and a group of moderates 
decided participation is a much more constructive option than 
boycotts and armed protest." "The position of Dr. Ferdi 
Hartzenberg is on the line. Since he became leader of the CP, 
he has led his party deeper into the desert. He and the AWB 
leader are the ones who started the war talk. Does he realize, 
after the events in Bophuthatswana, just what war is? Surely 
the right wing cannot have such a death wish that they prefer 
war above honorable negotiation. The people in the CP and other 
organizations must urgently reconsider and decide whether they 
need a change of leaders and policies. We have not the 
slightest doubt what the answer ought to be."

  [Text] The former Burundi Army officers accused of 
involvement in a coup attempt five months ago have left Uganda 
for Zaire. A Ugandan daily newspaper the NEW VISION said today 
that a former major, Mr. (Bernard Busokoza) and a lieutenant, 
Mr. (Paul Kamana), had secretly crossed the border from Uganda 
to Zaire between late February and early March. It said the two 
were suspected by authorities in Burundi of masterminding a coup 
attempt last October in which President Melchior Ndadaye was 
killed by renegade troops. About 100,000 people died in the 
ensuing ethnic bloodletting. 
  Burundi had said in December that the two men had fled to 
Uganda and President Yoweri Museveni ordered their arrest but 
said they could not be extradited, as the two countries have no 
extradition agreement.

  [Text] A Luanda military source says a National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] battalion attacked a 
government armed forces position in Dange ia Menha region of 
Cuanza Norte Province. In retaliation, government forces killed 
five of Savimbi's men and took three others prisoner. Assorted 
war materiel was captured. 
  In the central region, UNITA raided the Diogo and Kiangolo 
Wards, 6 km from the capital of Ebo District, Cuanza Sul 
Province. In retaliation, government forces stormed a UNITA 
position, freeing 35 civilians held captive by Savimbi's men. 
  The source added that UNITA used its artillery to shell 
Chivulo Mission in Huila Province. Savimbi's men stole heads of 
cattle from private farmers, 6 km from the capital of Quilengues 
District. 
  In Namibe Province, Jonas Savimbi's men raided Cassimbas, 41 
km from the capital of Camacuio District.

  [Summary From Poor Reception] Finance Ministry workers 
staged a sit-in strike in front of the ministry buildings this 
afternoon in protest against the arrest of one of their 
colleagues, Louis Fadognon, in connection with the publication 
of administrative documents on the 10-million-CFA franc 
diversion case involving Mrs. Rosine Soglo. The slogan for this 
afternoon's sit-in was the "immediate and unconditional release 
of our colleague." In a motion read during the sit-in, the 
finance workers said they will pursue their action until they 
obtain the "unconditional release" of their colleague. 
  A Finance Ministry workers' union executive committee member 
spoke to the media about the conditions of arrest of their 
colleague, noting in particular that "he was transferred from 
Kalavi to the Territorial Brigade Department and was not allowed 
any contacts." The brigade approached the human rights 
committee, which confirmed that the accused "was notably 
arrested in connection with the 10-million-CFA franc case" and 
that the committee was working on the case. The union leader 
further said: "We are mainly fighting for the security of 
workers."

<F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Ulundi March 17 SAPA -- Friday's meeting between 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela appears to be off. 
  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] National Chairman Frank Mdlalose 
told the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA] on Thursday that the 
ANC had objected to the Ulundi venue and had requested it be 
changed to Durban. Dr Mdlalose however said King Zwelithini 
wanted to meet in the kwaZulu capital. He said the ANC's Natal 
premier Jacob Zuma had expressed fear for Mr Mandela's safety in 
Ulundi. 
  Dr Mdlalose said the ANC had expressed fears of an 
assassination attempt on Mr Mandela in Ulundi. He relayed 
details of telephonic contacts between himself and Mr Zuma on 
Wednesday night and Thursday morning in which Mr Zuma said his 
headquarters had received reports of "disturbances of the 
meeting and the assassination of Mr Mandela". 
  Dr Mdlalose said he had assured Mr Zuma of the ANC 
president's safety, and had invited security personnel to the 
kwaZulu capital before and during Friday's planned meeting. 
  He added that Mr Zuma had also expressed reservations about 
a 
planned gathering of Zulus outside the meeting venue and had 
suggested it be moved to Durban. "I indicated I did not know 
where in Durban a spot would be where Zulus couldn't get to," he 
said. Dr Mdlalose said Mr Zuma had told him that unless the 
meeting could take place in Durban it should be postponed. 
  Meanwhile, addressing the KLA later, Inkatha Freedom Party 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had arranged for extra 
South African Police in Ulundi on Friday, saying "only an insane 
person" would try to assassinate the ANC leader. 
  He said Friday's meeting would go ahead with or without the 
ANC president, adding that the king would address his subjects 
on elections and the constitution at a mass gathering in Ulundi.

  [Text] Ulundi March 17 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi has warned of unparalleled 
resistance should action be taken against opposition to the 
April election. 
  "If the current election does actually run its course, and 
is 
finally declared a free and fair election, it will be because 
democratic opposition has been stifled by the might of the 
state," he said at the opening of the kwaZulu legislative 
assembly [KLA] in Ulundi on Thursday [17 March] morning. 
  Mr Buthelezi said opposition to the interim constitution and 
the elections which met with "draconian or Bophuthatswana-type 
action" would spawn a struggle for liberation from African 
National Congress [ANC]/National Party oppression, "which will 
have no parallel in Africa". 
  There would no peace or democratic settlement until there 
was 
a settlement of kwaZulu issues. Mr Buthelezi said it appeared 
to him that a free and fair election under the current 
circumstances was impossible. 
  Speaking as kwaZulu's chief minister, Mr Buthelezi said the 
SA Government and the ANC were producing a highly explosive 
situation in the territory. He warned of an "uncontrolled and 
unorchestrated internal political spontaneous combustion" in 
kwaZulu. 
  "I'm talking about a Bophuthatswana-type explosion, but 
unlike it as a result that it has not been orchestrated." He 
charged the SA Government was party to the violence which ousted 
Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope, and questioned whether 
it was the government's intention to do the same in kwaZulu. 
  Mr Buthelezi said the country was poised "on the very brink 
of disaster...Let us join hands to ensure international 
mediation runs its course as soon as possible in the interests 
of peace, stability and justice". 
  He repeated that the IFP and kwaZulu government would 
participate in the April poll if: mediation could take place 
swiftly; certain amendments could to be made to the 
constitution; and the party registration deadline and election 
date could be reconsidered. 
  Mr Buthelezi reiterated that his constitutional demands 
remained those proposed in the Freedom Alliance's yellow paper 
of December last year.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The framework of the negotiating round is once again 
complicated. By yesterday not all details of the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] response had been 
released to the public. Today it is said that besides the three 
provinces offered by the government, UNITA also wants to have 
full governing authority over Benguela, Huambo and Bie 
Provinces. This is not all, Jonas Savimbi's organization wants 
more than 20 districts and about 50 communes in other provinces. 
A source has said what UNITA wants is to create a good support 
base to fulfill its former aim of taking over power. 
  On the government portfolios, yesterday it was said that 
UNITA had retracted its position and today the contrary has been 
said: Jonas Savimbi's organization wants the leadership of five 
or six key portfolios as ministers or deputy ministers. 
Analysts say this is an indirect way of demanding 
power-sharing. The government has assessed UNITA's stand, and 
today it did not even reply in writing. It only reminded the 
mediators and UNITA itself that its offer is not negotiable. 
Either UNITA accepts and the talks continue, or it refuses and 
everything is over. In other words, the government does not 
agree with UNITA's stand. Now, the mediators and observers are 
once again in the midst of a crossfire.

  [Text] Reports from Lusaka, where the peace talks are being 
held, say that the atmosphere is already better than it was 
before UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye's recent 
visits to the cities of Huambo and Luanda. The National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and Luanda teams 
have not had any direct meeting yet but they are scheduled to 
hold one today. Meanwhile, Angola's real opposition has 
expressed satisfaction with UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro 
Savimbi's call for a greater participation in the country's 
political life. 
  Moreover, the UN Security Council met on 16 March and 
decided 
to extend the UN Angola Verification Mission's mandate until 31 
May. Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party ambassador to the United 
Nations, made some rather contradictory remarks on that 
occasion, this at a time when the two sides are working to 
restore peace to Angola as soon as possible. Dr. Marcos 
Samondo, UNITA ambassador to the United Nations, had this to say 
about Mbinda's remarks. 
  [Begin recording] [Samondo] The way he spoke, Mbinda was 
using again the language of (?cold war), thereby giving people 
the wrong idea. What is happening is that the two sides really 
want to wind up the Lusaka peace talks as soon as possible so 
that we can enter a new stage of national reconciliation and 
unity. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Through Dr. Jonas Savimbi, its 
leader, UNITA had said last week that peace and national 
reconciliation would happen and that the Lusaka peace talks 
would be fruitful. Such a statement surely takes into account 
the government's position, too. However, the position conveyed 
by the government in New York yesterday seems to suggest that 
the government may be following a different path. 
  [Samondo] On one hand, there is the hope that something is 
going to happen. On the other hand, what you see is that some 
official makes a statement, like the one made by Mbinda at the 
United Nations yesterday [words indistinct] and then there is 
the military question: at this stage, there are major movements 
under way by the government forces in northern Angola in 
general, and in Bengo Province in particular. Government forces 
have also been moving in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul Provinces, in 
northeastern Angola, as well as in the center and south of the 
country. In view of that, what message are we giving the 
international community now? 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. Marcos Samondo: 
neither side appears to be really interested in bringing peace 
to Angola in the near future. Each side appears to continue to 
believe in military victory (?even though) they affirm no 
military victory is possible. 
  [Samondo] I disagree. With all respect, I would like to 
convey my disagreement because [words indistinct] UNITA [words 
indistinct] it is UNITA that is making the greater concessions. 
We have made concessions in the military sphere, we have made 
concessions concerning the police force, and now [words 
indistinct] discussing issues pertaining to central and 
provincial government [words indistinct] (? to give us two) 
ministries, but it did not (?accept) [words indistinct] at the 
hotel. When we talk about the provinces [words indistinct] the 
government is not even willing to give us those provinces [words 
indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] The Council of Ministers began a meeting in Luanda 
today to assess the socioeconomic, political and military 
situation of the country. The meeting is being chaired by 
President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The Council 
of Ministers was briefed on the peace process and political and 
military situation. The legal decree establishing the Planning 
and Economic Coordination Ministry, as well as the decree that 
alters the function and composition of the Council of Ministers 
Standing Commission were assessed. Other points discussed were 
the decree drafts and the respective salary tables of the 
adjustment of salaries of civil servants and parallel entities, 
as well as salary adjustment of the personnel from the military 
administration organs. Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos 
Feijo had this to say at the end of the meeting. 
  [Begin Feijo recording] A session of the Council of 
Ministers 
which consisted essentially of three parts has just ended. In 
the first part the council assessed the military situation and 
the peace process whose negotiations are underway in Lusaka. We 
assessed the negotiations. In the second part we assessed a 
draft document creating the Ministry of Planning and Economic 
Coordination as an organ which will be charged with drafting 
medium and long term policies, and will coordinate the 
implementation of the socioeconomic plan, and will necessarily 
be related to the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank with a 
view to considering the plan as an indicative element, and not 
as an imperative one, as has been the case in our planning law. 
The third part dealt with the approval of the government's 
program in which it is stipulated that in March there would be 
salary increases, and this is what was done. The salary 
adjustment of the civil servants and personnel from the military 
administration organs, as well as internal order was approved.

  [Excerpt] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama yesterday once again called on the international 
organizations to assist Maringue residents who are experiencing 
famine because of the shortage of rains and an outbreak of 
rodents. Dhlakama said Maringue residents are experiencing a bad 
period and if there is no urgent assistance, many people will 
die. 
  The Renamo leader was speaking to reporters after landing at 
the Maputo International Airport, coming from Maringue, his 
movement's general headquarters. Afonso Dhlakama said the World 
Food Program [WFP] will stop assisting Maringue residents as of 
next month. 
  This morning Radio Mozambique contacted the WFP to hear its 
stand in view of the statement made by the Renamo president. 
WFP Director Philip Clark has denied the allegations and says 
that civilians in areas under Renamo control have been receiving 
assistance without restrictions. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Following the report presented 
by the minister of civil service and administrative reform on 
the ongoing negotiations with labor unions, in particular, 
concerning the two demands submitted by the unions to the 
government delegation, namely: 1. The coupling of promotions 
and an upward review of the cost of a living allowance and; 2. 
An increase in family allowances; the cabinet reaffirmed the 
government's position, which had already been communicated to 
union leaders on 15 March. First, the government intends to meet 
the above-mentioned two union demands within the limits of an 
increase in the wage bill, to the tune of 9,225,328,610 CFA 
francs. Second, the government will proceed with the necessary 
calculations for the breakdown and distribution of this wage 
bill, with the participation of union representatives designated 
by the unions themselves. The cabinet calls on all unions which 
are to participate in the calculations to get in touch with the 
paymaster general's office at the Ministry of Finance first 
thing tomorrow, 17 March. Moreover, the cabinet has decided to 
submit an enabling bill to the National Assembly as soon as 
possible to permit the government to pay immediately to workers

measures, and to hold payment of those relating to the payment 
of the actual [words indistinct] pending the passing of the 1994

  [Text] Ouagadougou, 17 March (PANA) -- The resignation of 
the Burkinabe prime minister, Youssouf Ouedraogo, was caused by 
the failure of negotiations with workers following the 
devaluation of the CFA franc in January, observers said Thursday 
[17 March] in Ouagadougou. They point out that even if he was 
supported by President Blaise Compaore, he was not able to meet 
the demands of the trade unions. 
  The workers were demanding better living conditions, a 
substantial salary increase and maintaining prices at a 
reasonable level. In spite of the signing on Saturday of a 
joint communique between the government and the unions which 
increased salaries, the trade unions are still threatening to 
strike because they consider the salary increases insufficient. 
Some of the trade union leaders who signed the accord later 
rejected it saying that concessions made by the government were 
not enough. 
  Youssouf Ouedraogo, who resigned on Wednesday night, is 
portrayed in his country as a brilliant technocrat, with a solid 
academic, administrative and political experience in Burkina 
Faso. Nominated prime minister on 16 June 1992, Ouedraogo, an 
economist, has been a lecturer at the Economic Sciences 
Institute of the University of Ouagadougou. A member of the 
People's Assembly (ADP- Parliament) since the last general 
elections of 1992, Ouedraogo was planning and popular 
development minister (September 1984-August 1987), cooperation 
and planning minister (November 1987-April 1989) and president 
of the Economic and Social Council (April 1989-May 1992). 
  During the general convention of the Organisation for 
Popular 
Democracy Labour Movement (ODP/MT), which has majority in 
Parliament with 79 seats Ouedraogo who was not an active 
political leader, was elected senior vice president of the 
party, on 19 April 1993. His nomination as prime minister 
raised many controversies in the ODP/MT. He reshuffled his 
government two times during his two year term. The first was on 
3 September 1993 and the second on 19 January 1994.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan returned from 
Ouagadougou yesterday, where he participated in an economic 
summit devoted to the devaluation and the West African Economic 
and Monetary Union [UEMOA]. Pascal Amani Kouadio was at the 
airport yesterday and reports the following: 
  [Begin recording] [Kouadio] The prime minister arrived at 
Port-Bouet airport at 2100 on board the presidential plane from 
Ouagadougou, where he attended the UEMOA summit. He was 
welcomed at the airport by government officials. The prime 
minister spoke about the Ouagadougou summit: 
  [Duncan] The Ouagadougou meeting examined three issues: 
first, the devaluation; second, UEMOA; and third, the West 
African Economic Community [CEAO]. Concerning the devaluation, 
two months after this measure it was needful for the heads of 
state and the governments of the UEMOA area to review issues 
relating to this measure, to find out about the various measures 
being taken by each state regarding the devaluation, to find out 
how negotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF, 
and the World Bank are progressing, and how our cooperation with 
France on this matter is proceeding. 
  On this matter, I can say that generally things are 
progressing well. With the exception of only one state, all 
arrangements with the Bretton Woods institutions will be 
finalized by the end of this month. It is important to stress 
this. I would also like to state that inflation has been 
relatively well controlled and in line with projections. 
Nevertheless, the heads of state present at the meeting 
expressed the desire for a number of actions to be carried out. 
First, communication must be intensified among the populations 
to explain the devaluation better and to indicate -- and this is 
important -- that it is an opportunity for our countries to 
forge ahead. We would like to underline here that this is the 
final devaluation. There is no question of a second 
devaluation, because no indicators point to this. It is 
important to state this and I believe all the heads of state and 
participants, including the Bretton Woods institutions and 
certainly France, have taken good note of this. 
  Also, the backup measures announced during the signing of 
the 
various agreements are proceeding on schedule in all the states. 
It was therefore agreed to have regular meetings of this kind 
so that UEMOA partners can coordinate their actions. It was 
also decided to hold a meeting at the latest in June with 
members of the Bank of Central African States, so that all the 
members of the franc zone countries can coordinate their 
positions. It is also important to stress that trade in goods 
and services within the UEMOA must be developed, and this 
permits me to go to the second point, which is the issue of the 
UEMOA. 
  As you are aware, the UEMOA agreement was signed at Dakar on 
11 January, but due to the devaluation the signing of the UEMOA 
agreement was somewhat relegated to the background. At the 
Ouagadougou meeting, the heads of state have, so to say, very 
much insisted on the need to proceed with integration, and it 
was therefore advocated that all the member states, except one 
-- for reasons peculiar to this state -- ratify the UEMOA 
agreement by 30 April. With regard to the state concerned, 
because of internal reasons that ratification is expected to 
take place before 30 June, so that we can have a basic legal 
instrument which would permit us to forge ahead toward 
integration. This is an important chance we can seize, and as 
we have made considerable progress on West African issues, we 
intend to move quickly to reinforce solidarity within the UEMOA 
member states. 
  The last issue examined concerned the West African Economic 
Community. It was difficult for two economic bodies to coexist 
in the area. The CEAO heads of state conference has therefore 
decided to dissolve the CEAO and has instructed the council of 
ministers to see to the liquidation of this body and take 
measures to settle issues relating to its personnel. [passage

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The peace process in Liberia seems more chaotic than 
ever. The transitional government has still not been seated, 
with continuing squabbles over who should have what job in the 
government. Yesterday, in Monrovia, Charles Taylor's NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] tried to force the pace 
and get its nominees installed in their ministries. The 
operation failed, and the nominees have now left Monrovia and 
gone back to NPFL headquarters at Gbarnga. The whole thing was 
apparently based on a letter from ECOWAS [Economic Community of 
West African States] chairman, President Soglo of Benin, passed 
through UN Special Representative Trevor-Gordon Somers, urging 
the Transitional Council to give the NPFL the Ministries of 
Justice and Foreign Affairs, but there have been claims that the 
letter was, in fact, a fake. On the line to Gbarnga, Robin 
White asked Momolu Sirleaf, who would have taken the foreign 
affairs ministry, if the Soglo letter was a forgery: 
  [Begin recording] [Sirleaf, laughing] I think that you ought 
to talk to Gordon-Somers, you know, because he sent the letter 
to everybody, including the Council of State. You should ask 
him whether he forged it, and, if he did, why did he do it? (?I 
am saying) this goes to the very credibility of Gordon-Somers, 
the UN, and ECOWAS. You ought to talk to Gordon-Somers and to 
President Soglo because they can't play with the Liberian 
people's lives like this. We want the government to be seated. 
We want the Cotonou Accord to be implemented. We hope that 
people would stop all of this tomfoolery and let the Liberian 
people have peace. 
  [White] Why are you in such a rush? Why are you trying to 
force the pace? 
  [Sirleaf] Am I in a rush, Robin? The Liberian people have 
been at war for four years. Please, I believe they are tired. 
I am not in a rush. I think the Liberian people want to put 
their lives together, and each time they try to do this 
politicians come out with all sorts of lies and dash their hopes. 
  [White] Couldn't you hang on just a couple of days, instead 
of just storming out in a huff, while you settle this matter. 
  [Sirleaf] No, no, no. We haven't stormed out in a huff. I 
told you our delegation is there. It is not safe, but our 
delegation is there. We have a team that is remaining there, 
and we intend to stay in the process. We will never pull out. 
In fact, we know that this is what they want to happen, but we 
are not going to pull out. 
  [White] Mr. Sirleaf. 
  [Sirleaf] Yeah. 
  [White] Mr. Sirleaf, sir, you think you should be the 
foreign minister, that is right? 
  [Sirleaf] Well, I mean, it is not whether I think I should 
be the foreign minister. I am the foreign minister, and I am 
going to work to make sure that democracy is established in my 
country. 
  [White] Yes, but would you be prepared to give up that claim 
in the interest of peace? 
  [Sirleaf, laughing] But why would I want to give up 
something in the interest of peace? I am a man of war? Have 
you known me to be a man of war? 
  [White] Yes, but if it would solve the problem for you to 
step down, would you do that? 
  [Sirleaf] But why would I be a problem? 
  [White] Well, because other people don't want you there as 
the foreign minister. They'd rather have their own man in. 
Would you be prepared to step down in the interest of peace? 
  [Sirleaf] I wonder who doesn't want me there. You mean the 
people that have tried to install a puppet government? Now, 
listen to me. All along we've been saying ECOWAS, you know, 
we've been talking about ECOWAS. ECOWAS has written and said 
that they have no objection, and the Liberian people have not 
elected any government. So who is the one that is going to 
object? [end recording]

<F P=106> [Government communique issued on 16 March; place not given; </F>
read by government spokesman Moctar Bello] 
  [Text] Rebels intercepted a seven-vehicle convoy on the 
Agadez-Tahoua road in 14 March, subjected the passengers to 
torture and undignified treatment, and robbed them of all their 
property. During the same period, similar crimes were 
perpetrated on the Agadez-Arlit road. The unfortunate result of 
these latest attacks are as follows: one dead, four seriously 
wounded, more than 1 million CFA francs extorted from the 
victims, and various goods worth several million CFA francs 
stolen. Vehicles were seriously damaged and peaceful citizens 
were harassed and humiliated. Taking stock of this situation, 
one realizes the numerous crimes perpetrated by the rebels 
against the people of Tillabery, Tahoua, and Agadez. 
  The ignominious acts the rebels are continuously 
perpetrating 
are in line with the objectives of their rebellion which include 
the revival of ethnic hatred in order to divide Niger our 
beloved motherland. Though determined to solve this issue 
through dialogue, the Government of the Republic of Niger will 
not tolerate these deliberate attacks on goods and on the 
physical and moral integrity of people. In any case, it will 
not accept the antinationalist objective that is being pursued. 
  The government hereby calls on all patriotic and active 
forces of the nation to mobilize themselves so that through 
cohesion, efforts, and sacrifices the Niger people, in unity, 
will be able to impede and foil the rebels' attempts at 
secession.

  [Text] The Federal Government has asked the public not to 
panic because of the intervention of France in the border 
dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon. The minister of 
information and culture, Professor Jerry Gana, gave this advice 
at a news conference in Abuja. Gbenga Onoiga was there: 
  [Begin recording] [Onoiga] Recounting efforts made by the 
Federal Government to resolve the dispute amicably, Prof. Gana 
reiterated the readiness of government to protect the lives and 
property of Nigerians. He urged the people, particularly those 
living in eastern states and the border areas with Cameroon, to 
be security conscious and be ready in the event of any problem 
arising from the Bakassi conflict. Prof. Gana also advise the 
public to ignore some pamphlets now in circulation aimed at 
misinforming them about the dispute. 
  [Gana] We appeal especially for Nigerians living in the 
eastern states and the border areas with Cameroon, to be 
particularly security conscious. It is therefore my 
responsibility to plead with the Nigerians to ignore a number of 
assaults which we have reason to believe are [words indistinct] 
people outside Nigeria who are trying to confuse Nigerians and 
knock their heads together in order to provoke internal division 
at this very critical time. 
  [Onoiga] The minister said the pamphlets, which tended to 
[word indistinct] to tribalize our religious sentiments, were 
completely false. He said the minister of foreign affairs was 
to prepare a document concerning a full historical record on the 
Bakassi issue. The document, Prof. Gana explained, will be used 
by his ministry to educate the public on the facts of the 
matter. He maintained that the present administration will not 
make the mistake of the past by abandoning Nigerians to 
molestation and humiliation by neighboring countries, 
particularly Cameroon. In the words of the minister, since 
Nigerians live in Bakassi, they must be protected by the 
Nigerian State. [end recording]

  [Text] Nigeria has pledged to support any move by the 
United Nations Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed on 
Iraq. The chief of general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo

  [Text] Lome, March 17 (AFP) -- Togo's opposition parties 
which fell out over power-sharing after winning a majority in 
the first free general election in 30 years have patched up 
their quarrel, they said here Thursday [17 March]. The Action 
Committee for Renewal (CAR), 36 seats, and the Union for 
Democracy (UTD), seven seats, said in a joint statement that 
they expected to form a new government, given that they held an 
absolute majority of parliament's 81 seats. 
  Under the Constitution, military ruler General Gnassingbe 
Eyadema, in power since 1967, has to pick a prime minister from 
the parliamentary majority. He began consultations with all 
party chiefs Tuesday. The Togolese People's Rally, Eyadema's 
mainstay for a quarter of a century as the only legal party, won 
35 seats in last month's two-round poll. 
  UTD leader Edem Kodjo, once a close associate of Eyadema 
until they fell out in the 1980s, caused consternation in 
opposition ranks when the Supreme Court issued the official 
results Monday. He repudiated a mid-election pact with the CAR, 
suspicious that the bigger movement intended turning his group 
into a mere appendage. Nobody could claim the 41-seat majority 
in Parliament without his party, which had a "pivotal" role and 
intended exercising it, Kodjo insisted. 
  CAR chief Yao Agboyibor had hailed the election results as a 
victory for the people and said he was sure Eyadema's 
consultations on the appointment of new government leaders "will 
lead to choices in line with the voting. Any other outcome 
would be a scandal." Agboyibor, 51, a lawyer, is widely expected 
to be named as new premier.

  [Excerpts] Ayite Gachin Mivedor, chairman for the Rally of 
the Togolese People [RPT] electoral campaign, met the media this 
morning to shed some light on revelations made yesterday by the 
Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]. According to these reports, 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] lawyer Yaovi Agboyibor 
allegedly offered the post of National Assembly speaker to the 
presidential group. Let us listen to Mr. Mivedor: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Chairman, 
in a clarification note to the media, the UTD disclosed that the 
CAR and RPT had allegedly held contacts. Thus, we learned that 
after the publication of the results by the Supreme Court, the 
CAR proposed the National Assembly speakership to the 
presidential group. Can you tell us what actually happened? 
  [Mivedor] Yes, that is true. The CAR has made us that 
proposal, and we thank it for taking such an initiative, but as 
far as our group is concerned, we consider that by arrogating 
the post of prime minister to itself and allocating the other 
posts to other political parties, the CAR has implemented a 
policy which reminds us of what is called politicking, and this 
takes us many years back into the past. This is why the RPT has 
rejected this spontaneous proposal by the CAR concerning the 
National Assembly speaker's post. It rather hopes that new 
orientations for the political and economic reconstruction of 
the country will spring out of discussions among the various 
political parties who were involved in the elections. The RPT 
calls on everyone for moderation, so that a serene dialogue can 
be established among the various political parties. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Does the RPT have certain demands to make 
concerning the formation of the new government? 
  [Midevor] The RPT is not making any demands. It adhered to 
the proposal made by the head of state a long time ago to form a 
broad-based union government. As far as the type of democracy 
that we know in our African countries is concerned, the RPT is 
for a participatory democracy, as opposed to an exclusionary 
democracy, that is, you lose and I win. The RPT is for the 
joint management of public property, which helps ensure national 
unity and the country's development. That is why the RPT is for 
a broad-based national union government. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  Concerning the new political situation in the country, the 
RPT issued the following statement: 
  The RPT received from Mr. Agboyibor himself proposals 
relating to the distribution of responsibilities within the 
future government. The RPT thanks Mr. Agboyibor for his 
initiative, but wants all political parties participate in the 
negotiations. 
  [Signed] For the RPT secretary general: Daouko Pere, RPT 
deputy general secretary. 
  For its part, the CAR denies it has proposed the National 
Assembly speaker's post to the RPT, contrary to what was said. 
However, the party is happy about the fact that in a statement 
published on 16 March the CAR and the UTD reaffirmed that they 
constitute an absolute majority within the National Assembly and 
intend to jointly handle, along with the other democratic 
forces, the victory of the Togolese people for the actual advent 
of the change so called for by the people.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Yaovi Agboyibor, Action Committee for </F>
Renewal chairman, in Lome on 17 March; read by CAR Secretary 
General Dodji Apevo] 
  [Text] In a statement broadcast yesterday the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD] announced that the Action Committee 
for Renewal [CAR] has offered the role of National Assembly 
speaker to the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. 
  At a meeting held yesterday, the eight opposition political 
parties which took part in the February legislative elections 
deplored the fact that such a statement had been made at a time 
when the democratic forces are closing their ranks. The UTD 
chairman, therefore called on the radio and television officials 
to suspend the rebroadcast of the statement and the CAR agreed 
to withdraw the denial it prepared in reaction to the UTD's 
statement. 
  However, in the national radio's 1900 newscast, the RPT 
mentioned the UTD's statement, so the CAR deems it necessary to 
inform the public that at no moment has it proposed the role of 
National Assembly speaker to the RPT. It is hard to believe 
that the CAR, which is striving to safeguard the cohesion of the 
two political parties to which the people granted the absolute 
majority during the recent legislative elections, would offer 
such a crucial post as that of National Assembly speaker to the 
RPT. 
  The CAR expresses satisfaction with the statement published 
yesterday by the CAR and the UTD reaffirming that the two 
parties constitute the absolute majority within the National 
Assembly and that they intend to work alongside the other 
democratic forces to manage the Togolese people's victory in 
order to bring about the change that is so much desired by the 
Togolese. 
  The CAR strongly reiterates its appeal to the forces of 
change to be extra vigilant to avoid falling victim to the 
divisive maneuvers of the advocates of the past order.

  [Excerpt] Nakuru, 17 March (KNA) -- Two journalists with 
THE STANDARD newspaper were today charged before a Nakuru court 
with writing a subversive report prejudicial to state security. 
Mr. James Ngumo, who is THE STANDARD bureau chief in Nakuru, 
and Peter Rianga, the paper's correspondent based in Kisii, 
appeared before the senior principal magistrate, Mr. William 
Tuiyot, but were not allowed to plead to the charge as consent 
to prosecute them has not been given by the attorney general. 
The court remanded them in custody until 31st March when they 
will renew their application for bail. 
  They were accused that with subversive intention they 
published a report in THE STANDARD Wednesday [16 March] edition 
alleging that tribal clashes had erupted in Molo division, 
during which nine people were killed and hundreds displaced, a 
report calculated to promote hatred and enemity between 
different communities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Twenty-three Filipino crewmen of a Taiwanese trawler 
are now detained in northwestern Somalia. Somali militia forces 
threatened to kill them unless the Philippine Government pays 
ransom amounting to millions of pesos. Reports reaching the 
Foreign Office said the Filipino seamen were intercepted by the 
Somali militia while fishing illegally in northwestern Somalia. 
No names of the Filipinos are immediately available. 
  In his report to the Department of Foreign Affairs, 
Philippine Ambassador to Kenya Edmundo Libid said he sought the 
assistance of the United Nations observers in Mogadishu and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Nairobi for the 
release of the Filipinos, but this did not push through. The 
Philippines said no members in the UN peacekeeping forces in 
Somalia. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] Let's now turn to Cameroon-Nigerian relations and 
the territorial dispute over the Bakassi peninsula. The 
Nigerian foreign minister was in Cairo yesterday. The Egyptian 
news agency MENA announced that a summit meeting between the 
Cameroon and Nigerian heads of state will be held in the 
Egyptian capital before the end of this month. This information 
provoked the amazement if not the anger of the Cameroon 
authorities. Listen to what the Cameroon information minister, 
Augustin Kontchou, said yesterday evening to Dominique de 
Courcelles: 
  [Begin recording] [Kontchou] Cameroon agrees and has already 
agreed to meet the Nigerian president in a neutral country, a 
meeting that will obviously have to be planned by the two 
countries. Cameroon initially thought of Togo, whose president, 
His Excellency Eyadema, visited Cameroon and Nigeria, and whose 
foreign minister also visited Cameroon and Nigeria. The door 
was not shut. Before announcing a meeting in such-and-such 
country, the two heads of state should first agree. 
  [Courcelles] Do you know if Husni Mubarak has agreed to 
mediate? 
  [Kontchou] We have been approached neither by President 
Mubarak nor by any other Egyptian official, nor by any Nigerian 
official. Neither President Abacha nor any Nigerian minister 
approached us. We don't know the origin of this announcement of 
a meeting between His Excellency President Paul Biya and his 
excellency the Nigerian president. [end recording]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 14 Mar (AFP) -- France has just granted 
Congo an aid of 1 billion CFA francs (Fr 10 million) as a backup 
measure for the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc on 11 
January, the French Embassy in Brazzaville announced today. 
  This aid, which comes from the Special Development Fund, 
created by Paris following the devaluation, will help to fund 
sanitary, educational, and food projects and is capable of 
creating employment. The cost of each of these projects must 
not exceed 200 million CFA francs. 
  This financing is the first batch of an aid package to be 
given to Congo under the special fund. It will be jointly 
managed by the Congolese Government, the French cooperation 
mission, and representatives of various funds who will also give 
their financial assistance. 
  Similarly, France has granted another aid worth 17.55 
million 
CFA francs (Fr175.47) to the Inspector General' Office to enable 
it to acquire equipment for the counting of civil servants as 
decided by the government in its bid to "control the work force 
of the civil service" which has 80,000 workers. On 10 March, 
government announced the expulsion of 8,050 state workers who 
were "in irregular situations."

  [Text] The opposition Union for Democracy and Social 
Development of Equatorial Guinea [UDDS] has once again expressed 
itself in very strong terms. It has called on the Spanish, 
French, and U.S. Governments, and all democratic governments not 
to receive the delegation which the Equatorial Guinean president 
sent out on a lengthy tour of Western capitals yesterday. It 
also called on them not to trust the demagogic speeches of the 
delegation as President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo continues 
to stifle the democratic process and daily violates human rights. 
  The opposition cited the closure two weeks ago of all 
opposition party offices, the multiple arrests and torture of 
opposition activists and members, and last week's assassination 
of Gendarmerie Corporal Eliza Ngomove Abata. Furthermore, UDDS 
appealed to the international community and Amnesty 
International for urgent intervention in Equatorial Guinea on 
behalf of political prisoners and for the respect of human 
rights.

  [Text] Paul Mba Abessole, the Gabonese opposition leader, 
broke his long silence this morning. He has been in Paris since 
9 March and it is in Paris that he has given a news conference. 
As you know, Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba is 
currently trying to form a national unity government. Monique 
Mas asked Father Paul Mba Abessole if he or his friends are 
ready to participate. His answer was clear, to say the least: 
  [Begin recording] [Abessole] No, no, and no. Mr. Bongo is 
holding out a hand but he has no hand. Mr. Bongo is the head of 
state by force. We don't expect anything from the government 
that will be formed. We mobilize people to explain to them what 
democracy means. We explain to them respect for human rights. 
We are no longer bothered by what Mr. Bongo and his armed gang 
are doing with the government. We are no longer interested. 
All this is in the past, as far as we are concerned; we will 
continue our work and take the risk. We will not back off. 
  [Mas] What are your next political steps? 
  [Abessole] The steps will be determined by the people. I 
have said that the people will soon feel hungry. How do you 
think hungry people can be restrained? They cannot. [end 
recording] 
  During his news conference, Father Mba Abessole said he is 
basically turning toward France. Monique Mas asked why he made 
such a statement. 
  [Begin Abessole recording] I had to say it this time because 
when the French mercenaries attacked my home, I started to doubt 
the idea that France was my friend; some people said look what 
your friends are doing to you. I said these people are 
individuals, they are not my friends. This does not mean that I 
would do anything to harm France or that I would accept that 
France does anything to harm me. We are just, correct, and 
fair. I am not asking France to help the opposition. France 
can help Gabon, particularly during its current impasse. The 
future of Gabon -- France should understand and I think it has 
already understood this -- resides with those who are fighting 
to attain power. [end recording] 
  Father Mba Abessole stressed that he has not taken refuge in 
France and that he will return to Gabon when he wishes to do so, 
despite the arrest warrant issued against him by the Libreville 
authorities.

  [Excerpts] You have undoubtedly heard of the deaths of five 
people during the night of 15 March as they were driving to 
Kigali from Kinihira subprefecture, deaths that some circles are 
trying to describe from a certain perspective, notably the 
National Revolutionary Movement for Development [MRND] party 
through a communique broadcast yesterday on (RTLM) radio and 
today on Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique 
Rwandaise. These reports strong and inflammatory language. 
[passage omitted] 
  Given this sudden reaction on the part of the MRND party and 
its political bureau, a few questions easily emerge. Why this 
swift condemnation of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] by the 
MRND -- without providing a shred of evidence? Remember the 
Kirambo Massacre of December 1993, which the MRND attributed to 
the RPF even before investigators had been informed of the 
incident. How else can one interpret a reaction which emerges 
before information [words indistinct] more or less [words 
indistinct] the truth? Is it not a [word indistinct] which 
consists in trying to look for an alibi in order to carry out 
long-term objectives and which would not miss the slightest 
opportunity to reveal itself in broad daylight? Let us leave to 
Rwandans the task of analyzing this, in the same way I did.

  [Text] Ulundi March 18 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini on Friday [18 March] expressed regret that he was 
unable to meet Nelson Mandela to clear the air between himself 
and the African National Congress [ANC] leadership. 
  The Zulu monarch said he hoped there was no substance to 
rumours of an attempt on Mr Mandela's life: "It would be rank 
foolishness for anyone to attempt to do such a thing. A thing 
like that would literally burn this country to ashes". 
  Friday's meeting between the two leaders was called off 
after 
the ANC said there were "firm reports" of a planned 
assassination attempt on Mr Mandela. "I hope that is no more 
than a scare story," said King Zwelithini. 
  "I would have liked to know from the president of the ANC 
what he knows about the Zulu monarchy, Zulu sovereignty and the 
kingdom of kwaZulu." 
  Addressing several thousand Zulu subjects in the kwaZulu 
capital of Ulundi, King Zwelithini dismissed the ANC's 
contention that the proposed meeting was initially arranged 
intended to be closed. 
  He said kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi had 
indicated in correspondence with the ANC's Jacob Zuma that the 
meeting would be a "public discussion". 
  The king said he saw no reason why the meeting should have 
been private. "I am sorry that Mr Mandela was unable to attend 
today's meeting. I would have been grateful to know from him 
why members of his organisation have insulted me almost daily in 
radio programmes, speeches, and press statements." 
  King Zwelithini said he felt slighted by statements from Mr 
Mandela and other ANC members that he was being prevented by Mr 
Buthelezi from seeing Mr Mandela. 
  He said Mr Buthelezi had gone out of his way to ensure the 
meeting went ahead, "even by breaking protocol in giving 
unlisted telephone numbers to Mr Mandela". 
  The king said he had also been offended by the ANC's 
attitude 
to the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA]: "There can be no 
action against the KLA without it being action against me as 
reigning king". 
  Claims that Mr Buthelezi was his paymaster were offensive, 
said the king, who referred to monarchies worldwide which were 
supported by state funds. "What should be so exceptional about 
the Zulu monarchy in this respect. Why does the ANC hurl these 
insults at me?" 
  He said statements by ANC spokesmen that he supported the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] were lies, saying he had not 
attended a single Inkatha rally. Cultural gatherings which he 
attended with Mr Buthelezi were alleged by the ANC and the media 
to be IFP rallies, the Zulu monarch argued. 
  "I am sorry that the opportunity for the ANC to clarify 
these 
things in order to clear the air between me and its leadership 
was lost because of the Mandela assassination scare."

  [Text] Ulundi March 18 SAPA -- Thousands of Zulus, many in 
traditional regalia, streamed into the kwaZulu capital Ulundi on 
Friday [18 March] morning for an address by their king, Goodwill 
Zwelithini. The gathering was to be a show of support for the 
Zulu monarch at his planned meeting with African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela. 
  On Thursday, the ANC cancelled the meeting, following claims 
of an assassination attempt on the ANC leader's life in the 
Inkatha stronghold of Ulundi. The ANC has requested the meeting 
be postponed to a later date. 
  Meanwhile, the kwaZulu government said on Thursday that 
Friday's meeting would go ahead "with or without Mr Mandela". 
  The Zulu king is expected to address thousands of his 
subjects outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building later 
Friday.

  [Text] Ulundi March 18 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini on Friday [18 March] called on all Zulus to unite and 
defend their freedom, saying elections under the present 
constitution would deny the Zulu nation its claim to sovereignty 
and self-determination. 
  Addressing several thousand Zulus in Ulundi, he reiterated 
he 
could not recommend to his loyal subjects that they vote in the 
April poll. "I call on all Zulus to unite in the name of the 
kingdom of kwaZulu. I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred 
duty to defend our freedom and sovereignty to anyone in southern 
Africa who dares to challenge it." 
  He alleged State President F.W. de Klerk's "contingency 
plans" for the Natal/kwaZulu region entailed the deployment of 
security forces "to clamp down on my people should they choose 
not to participate in the elections". 
  Elections under the interim constitution were "an immediate 
denial of our claim for sovereignty and self-determination". 
  "I find it quite impossible to recommend that any of my 
subjects who are loyal to the throne should participate in the 
forthcoming election, unless this matter (a sovereign Zulu 
kingdom) is settled." 
  The king said Zulus had gathered in Ulundi on Friday to 
proclaim before the world their freedom and sovereignty, and 
their unwavering will to defend these at all costs. He revealed 
that recent discussions between himself and Mr de Klerk on the 
Zulu king's claims had made little progress, adding the 
government had denied sovereignty to the Zulu nation and would 
not restore a sovereign kwaZulu kingdom. 
  "Under the terms of a final proposal of the South African 
Government, the Zulu nation and the kingdom of kwaZulu are left 
at the mercy of the unitary state established by the 1993 
constitution. We have reached the end of a road and we are faced 
with the harsh reality that the SA Government cannot and will 
not facilitate the restoration of the sovereign kingdom of 
kwaZulu." 
  Zulus were faced with an historical dilemma of either 
succumbing and forever relinquishing their sovereignty or to 
take it upon themselves "and bring into existence what is ours, 
what belongs to our fathers and what belonged to our children". 
  The king alleged Mr de Klerk had threatened to deploy his 
security forces if Zulus did not vote in the April poll. "I 
protest for the betrayals that the Zulu nation have suffered 
from President de Klerk again and again."

  [Text] Ulundi March 18 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini on Friday [18 March] proclaimed a sovereign kingdom 
in kwaZulu/Natal and said his subjects would defend it at all 
costs. "We are here today to proclaim before the world, our 
freedom and sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at 
all costs," he told several thousand Zulus at a gathering in 
Ulundi. 
  The king's proclamation follows the opening of the 1994 
session of the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA]. Speculation 
was rife in Ulundi that the KLA would formally proclaim an 
independent sovereign Zulu kingdom encompassing the entire 
kwaZulu/Natal region during the current session. 
  A senior kwaZulu government source said the king's 
announcement on Friday could be interpreted as a forerunner to 
an official proclamation. 
  King Zwelithini warned State President F. W. de Klerk 
earlier 
this year that he was preparing to promulgate a constitution for 
kwaZulu/Natal, unless his demands for recognition of his 
kingdom's sovereignty were met. KwaZulu Chief Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi usually delivers a lengthy policy speech 
during the KLA session and the source said a formal proclamation 
could emerge during this speech, which begins on Monday. 
  In his address outside the KLA building, the king called on 
all Zulus to unite and defend their freedom, saying elections 
under the present constitution would deny the Zulu nation its 
claim to sovereignty and self-determination. He reiterated he 
could not recommend to his loyal subjects that they vote in the 
April election. 
  "I call on all Zulus to unite in the name of the kingdom of 
kwaZulu. I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty to 
defend our freedom and sovereignty to anyone in southern Africa 
who dares to challenge it." 
  He alleged Mr de Klerk's "contingency plans" for the 
Natal/kwaZulu region entailed the deployment of security forces 
"to clamp down on my people should they choose not to 
participate in the elections". 
  Elections under the interim constitution were "an immediate 
denial of our claim for sovereignty and self-determination". "I 
find it quite impossible to recommend that any of my subjects 
who are loyal to the throne should participate in the 
forthcoming election, unless this matter (a sovereign Zulu 
kingdom) is settled." 
  He revealed that recent discussions between himself and Mr

nation and would not restore a sovereign kwaZulu kingdom.

  [Text] Ulundi March 17 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini said on Thursday [17 March] he would not encourage 
his people to vote in the April elections under the current 
constitution, but stopped short of calling for a poll boycott. 
  Speaking in Ulundi at a luncheon after the opening of the 
kwaZulu Legislative Assembly, King Zwelithini said it was 
"foolishness" to believe there could be a free and fair election 
in kwaZulu "when the election is being foisted on people without 
their approval". "If anyone believes that the vast majority of 
blacks in the kwaZulu/Natal region want an election, they can 
only be right to the extent that those people have not heard 
their king and their traditional prime minister (Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi) say `no' to their participation in the election." 
  The Zulu monarch said he had never attempted to dissuade any 
Zulu from belonging to the political party of their choice. 
However, if he called an imbizo (traditional gathering) at 
which Zulus heard him admonish parties which approved the 
interim constitution, "they will not vote in the elections". 
"The word will spread rapidly that this election is death to 
`Zulu-ness' and that it must be resisted at all costs." 
  He added that Zulu nationalism, irrespective of party 
politics, would gather in strength through "rolling Zulu mass 
action". 
  Although stopping short of calling for a poll boycott the 
king said: "I will not encourage my people to enter the 
elections, enter the polling booths, and destroy the kingdom." 
  On his demands for a sovereign monarchy, King Zwelithini 
expressed his frustration at "tedious discussions, as though the 
South African Government had some kind of proprietary right to 
the soul of the Zulu people". 
  The king insisted his demands be dealt with immediately, 
saying he was not prepared to leave the future of the Zulu 
kingdom in the hands of a nationally-elected government. "The 
present constitution is totally unacceptable to me," he 
repeated, saying it would lead to the demise of the Zulu nation. 
  He commended Mr Buthelezi's initiative on international 
mediation in the constitutional impasse, but added: "As far as 
I am concerned, mediation must be pinned to the question of 
entry into elections."

  [Text] Reacting to the developments in the kwaZulu 
Legislative Assembly, State President F.W. de Klerk said he was 
worried about the volatile situation in the area, but that the 
government was prepared. He said he found Dr. Buthelezi's 
remarks upsetting. This report from Ronel van Zyl and cameraman 
Faan van Zyl. 
  [Begin recording] [Ronel Van Zyl] Speaking at a news 
conference in Randfontein, Mr. de Klerk rejected allegations 
that an uprising, similar to that which occurred in 
Bophuthatswana last week, was being planned for kwaZulu. 
  [De Klerk] We did not work together with the ANC [African 
National Congress] to topple ex-President Myngope. The de facto 
situation was that President Mangope lost control. We went in 
there to stabilize the situation. 
  [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk gave the assurance that contingency 
plans had already been drawn up in the event of problems arising. 
  [De Klerk] I am happy that we have basically in place what 
we 
think might be needed to keep the situation under control should 
something erupt there, but it is a potentially dangerous 
situation. 
  [Van Zyl] Meanwhile, Mr. de Klerk, as leader of the National 
Party [NP], paid an historic visit to South Africa's biggest 
black township, Soweto. Residents and street vendors of Dube 
and Kwezi were caught unawares by the NP convoy. Mr. de Klerk 
made two spontaneous stops to canvass votes. No vivas, no NP 
posters, but also no sign of intimidation. An inquisitive crowd 
gave Mr. de Klerk a friendly welcome. He was evidently pleased 
by his reception. 
  [De Klerk] A kind lady gave me this apple. That is the 
spirit that we need in South Africa. I've been overwhelmed with 
your friendship. 
  [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk said the NP would fare much better in 
black townships than generally expected. He said he was 
jubilant about the results of a recent telephone canvassing 
campaign. He wrapped up his Soweto visit with a private lunch 
for NP candidates. Other stops were a breakfast meeting with 
business people and a visit to the Rand Afrikaans University. 
Students gave him a huge cake for his 58th birthday tomorrow. 
Another stop was soft selling the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, 
where he offered this advice. 
  [De Klerk] Think deeply and carefully and look very intently 
at the economic policy of the various parties. 
  [Van Zyl] Showing his concern for smaller businessmen Mr. de 
Klerk stopped at a the local shoe shiner, a necessity on the 
long and dusty road to election day. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria March 17 SAPA -- The Freedom Front's [FF] 
participation in the elections was a last resort to avoid 
conflict and ensure a peaceful solution in the quest for a 
"volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland], CP [Conservative Party] MP 
Pieter Mulder said on Thursday [17 March]. 
  The Front's final participation in the polls depended on an 
accord with the African National Congress [ANC] which involved 
that the recommendations of the so-called Volkstaat Council, 
provided for in Constitutional Principle 34, would be 
guaranteed, Dr Mulder said. Talks with the ANC on this matter 
would continue next week, he said. 
  Dr Mulder was addressing a press conference in Pretoria 
where 
the Front's candidates list, headed by FF leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen and containing 31 national legislature candidates and 
219 for the provinces, was announced. 
  Dr Mulder conceded there was tension in right-wing ranks 
over 
participation in the elections. "We don't want to actually take 
part in the African National Congress elections but 
Constitutional Principle 34 (providing for a volkstaat council) 
gives us the opportunity to prove our support for an Afrikaner 
homeland." 
  Research had shown a large number of CP supporters would 
vote 
in spite of the CP executive's decision to boycott the polls, he 
said. On the split in CP ranks, Dr Mulder said Gen Viljoen and 
CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg held talks on Thursday, but he did 
not know the outcome. This follows Dr Hartzenberg's earlier 
announcement that any CP member belonging to another party and 
standing for the elections would automatically be suspended from 
the party. 
  The Front viewed participation in the polls as a plebiscite, 
said Dr Mulder. The Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] had 
earlier been demanding a white plebiscite or a referendum to 
determine support for the volkstaat and which people wanted to 
be included in the homeland. 
  A Freedom Front candidates' conference would be held on 
Saturday to work out a strategy. Gen Viljoen, as leader of the 
Front, would be the backbone of the campaign. 
  The Natal and Orange Free State CP leaders, Carl Werth (in 
position no 8) and Abrie Oosthuizen (no 10), and Transvaal 
deputy-leader Dr Pieter Mulder (no 2) and CP Cape deputy leader 
Mr W. A. Botha (no 4) appear on the national list. Dr Pieter 
Mulder's brother Corne is no 3 on the list, followed by CP MP 
Willie Botha (no 5) and CP MP Joseph Chiole (no 6). 
  Although the former Afrikaner Volksfront directorate of 
generals is understood to back the front, apart from Gen Viljoen 
only Gen Kobus Visser appears on the list at no 19. Gen Tienie 
Groenewald had decided not to make himself available as a 
candidate, Dr Mulder said. 
  Also on the list is South Africa's head of mission in Berlin 
Mr J. C. Landman, who is to resign from the post, and a former 
National Party MP for Springs, W. S. J. Grobler. 
  For the provincial legislatures Mr Werth heads the list in 
Natal, with Mr Abrie Oosthuizen (Orange Free State), Dr Pieter 
Mulder (Northern Cape), Mr P.W. Grobbelaar (Western Cape), Dr 
Willie Botha (Northern Transvaal), Mr Pieter Groenewald (North 
West Region), Dr W. J. van Niekerk (Eastern Transvaal) and Mr 
W.A. Botha (Eastern Cape).

  [Text] A war of words has developed between right-wingers 
opposed to, and those in favor of, participation in the 
election. The general secretary of the Conservative Party [CP], 
Dr. Lem Theron, has accused the MP for Schweizer-Reneke, Dr. 
Pieter Mulder, of seeking cheap publicity for the Freedom Front. 
He said those in favor of participation in the election had 
chosen a soft option and had entered the election in the hope of 
personal financial gain in what he called a communistic system 
of government. Earlier, the Freedom Front accused the CP of 
unilateral action, saying that certain individuals in the party 
had apparently found it necessary to put pressure on Dr. Ferdie 
Hartzenberg. According to reports up to 10 CP parliamentarians 
could be standing in the election for the Freedom Front.

  [Text] The North-Western Christian Democrats have decided 
not to contest the election because of intimidation of 
prospective candidates. The party had been granted an extension 
until eight this morning to submit its adjusted list of 
candidates to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] but 
failed to do so. 
  The chairman of the party, Mr. Sampie Styger, said he'd 
received a telephone call from the party leader, Dr. Lucas 
Mangope, informing that it was not possible to draw up the list 
of candidates as people were afraid to stand because of 
intimidation. A spokesman for the IEC said the commission was 
still awaiting official communication from the party. Until 
then their initial registration would stand. If advised of the 
intimidation the IEC would ask their monitors to investigate and 
report to the commission.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 17 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] was faced with a security nightmare in the 
election, ANC Spokesman Carl Niehaus said on Thursday. 
  Not only are up to 3,000 foreign journalists expected in 
South Africa to cover the story, but the ANC had to contend with 
the generalised threat presented by the right wing. 
  Mr Niehaus said the ANC was especially concerned about 
safety 
on the election roadshows of ANC President Nelson Mandela. 
Reports of Mr Mandela being conveyed from rally to rally at 
high speed had also caused concern. He denied that Mr Mandela's 
drivers were driving too fast and said journalists were creating 
problems by trying to beat Mr Mandela to his destinations. 
  He said speeds were dictated by traffic authorities seeing 
convoys through their areas. Journalists thronging around Mr 
Mandela to get off-the-cuff comments also created problems. 
  Mr Niehaus said the ANC would have press marshals in all the 
regions.

<F P=106> [Report by Dirk van Zyl] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town March 17 SAPA -- From being written off by 
opinion polls and many analysts as complete no-hopers a few 
weeks ago, the Democratic Party [DP] has received something of a 
morale- booster with sorties into the Boland and Southern Cape 
in the past five days. 
  DP leader Dr Zach de Beer and Western Cape premiership 
candidate Hennie Bester led the charge. The party faced the 
perception in these areas that the April elections contest was 
between the African National Congress [ANC] and the National 
Party [NP] only. 
  Mr Bester and his team of strategists devised a simple 
first-phase approach: Make the DP visible. 
  Dr de Beer, Mr Bester and other leaders boarded kombis 
[minibuses] and bakkies [pickup trucks] and slowly drove through 
countless suburbs, towns and hamlets with loudspeakers blaring 
"vote for the DP, the party of peace" and the party jingle "one 
nation, one future, one South Africa; DP will fight for your 
rights". 
  Pamphlets were dished out as widely as possible along the 
way 
and informal and formal meetings and gatherings were addressed. 
  On the whole the DP received a friendly -- if at times 
bemused -- reception, with its central peace and human rights 
message reciprocally acknowledged with two-fingered peace 
salutes. 
  The occasional bystander flashed an "up yours" and mouthed 
an 
accompanying expletive, and in the JCC squatter camp at Mossel 
Bay a man was restrained from throwing a stone at the 
procession. But in the final analysis, at least the party was 
"there" in hitherto largely virgin territory. 
  An ANC worker in George said the DP had blown away the 
previous well-ordered ANC/NP scenario. As a bonus, the DP 
received good television, radio and press coverage. 
  Outeniqua MP Chris April summed up the organisational 
dilemma 
by saying that under the previous constituency-based, 
winner-takes- all electoral system, the DP and its progressive 
predecessors were largely confined to privileged urban enclaves 
where there was no pressing need to build up organisational 
structures. Now, under proportional representation, every vote 
counted equally, even that of the solitary democrat in the 
tiniest hamlet. 
  But the organisational infrastructure is lacking and begs 
the 
question whether the next phase of the strategy can be 
effectively implemented before April 26. 
  The second phase is for party representatives and canvassers 
to move from street to street and door to door with more 
personalised messages and pamphlets. Coupled with this is the 
DP's comparative paucity of funds. 
  A top DP strategist sums it up best: "All we can really do 
is make as much noise as possible and hope for the best."

  [Text] Johannesburg March 17 SAPA -- A cash-strapped Pan 
Africanist Congress [PAC] was living a hand-to-mouth existence 
that would hamper its election campaign, PAC President Clarence 
Makwetu said on Thursday [17 March]. He accused Western 
governments and big business of withholding funding to the PAC 
to ensure an African National Congress [ANC] election victory. 
  Mr Makwetu said PAC officials from the president down had 
not 
been paid for nine months. "We are living from hand to mouth. 
Nobody from the president down has been paid. We need 
everything we can get," Mr Makwetu told a media conference. 
  He said arrangements had been made to restore the PAC's 
telecommunications -- disconnected this week after a R94,000 
[rand] bill went unpaid -- but that "we must live up to these 
arrangements". "If we don't find the funds we might find 
ourselves in trouble," he said. 
  "Our members...are donating amounts of between R5 to R50, 
with a few giving us a few hundreds," Mr Makwetu said. "Big 
business and the overseas community is determined to ensure that 
these are one-sided elections. The unholy alliance between the 
international community and big business will deny this country 
the multiparty democracy overseas countries claim they enjoy." 
  He said the United States had given at least US10 million to 
the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party. "The PAC and other 
organisations have been ignored and our efforts to get the same 
kind of assistance has fallen on deaf ears," he said. 
  The Scandinavian countries had donated R25 million to the 
ANC. The French had also donated to the ANC. "However, despite 
this, we are not pulling out of the elections. We are not 
throwing in the towel and already creating excuses in case we 
lose. Despite our poverty, for this is what the struggle is 
about, we will make the necessary sacrifices for victory. Some 
of our posters are handwritten on cheap paper and done in 
townships and squatter camps for this is where the struggle 
starts in the first place."

  "Consequently the region is still divided on whether it 
should be divided into two -- Border/Kei and Eastern Cape." 
  He said it also remained a sensitive issue whether the East 
Griqualand-Mount Currie-Umzimkulu area should be part of his 
region or kwaZulu-Natal.

  [Text] Deposed Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope has 
claimed that the South African Government and the ANC [African 
National Congress] don't want him to participate in the 
elections. He was speaking at a news conference outside Mmabatho 
today. 
  [Begin Mangope recording] Freedom to participate in the 
electoral process may not be granted to me given discussions 
I've had with Mr. Botha and Mr. Maharaj, who informed me that my 
participation at this stage would perhaps not be possible. [end 
recording] 
  A short while ago a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman, who 
was present when the ANC's [African National Congress] Mr. Mac 
Maharaj and Foreign Minister Pik Botha held discussions with Mr. 
Mangope, said this was not the case. He said the message 
conveyed by both men to the former Bophuthatswana president was 
that if he wished to contest the election he was perfectly 
welcome to do so.

  [Text] Transkei leader General Bantu Holomisa said he is 
waiting for a report from the Goldstone Commission on the supply 
of weapons to the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and alleged drug 
trafficking by high-ranking South African security officers. 
The report, which was to have been tabled with the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council], has apparently been withheld 
by the commission pending further investigations. 
  [Begin recoding] [Correspondent Ami Nanackchand] The 
disclosures were made at a Natal University forum in Durban 
where General Holomisa said information implicating six generals 
of the security establishment had been supplied to the 
commission towards the end of last year. The classified 
information was obtained from General Holomisa's tested 
intelligence and sources. He said that Judge Goldstone had 
briefed President F.W. de Klerk at the end of February of the 
commission's findings confirming the allegations. Mr. de Klerk 
allegedly refused to release the information. General Holomisa 
said he was told on Tuesday [15 March] that Judge Goldstone 
would release the report to the TEC within 48 hours. However, 
the next day the judge apparently said he was making further 
inquiries. 
  [Holomisa] According to the latest information, or 
intelligence information, a classified one, he has briefed 
President de Klerk towards end of February and they have 
confirmed to him that indeed, your number two in one of your 
security forces and other generals are involved in drug 
trafficking as well as supplying weapons to Natal, to the IFP. 
  [Nanackchand] General Holomisa also denied claims by the 
National Party that he was hindering free political activity in 
the Transkei. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer and Paul Stober] </F>
  [Text] South African Police [SAP] deputy commissioner 
Lieutenant-General Basie Smit is at the heart of an 
investigation by the Goldstone Commission into a major 
gun-running operation to "one of the parties to the conflict in 
Natal". 
  The commission's report -- which was due to be handed to 
President F.W. de Klerk on Wednesday, but was delayed at the 
last minute -- could contain the hardest evidence to date of an 
organised third force within the security forces. The 
Goldstone report could blow the police general staff right out 
of the water, said sources inside the SAP. Several other police 
generals are understood to have been under scrutiny in the case, 
which has been under investigation by the commission since 
mid-February. 
  Sources close to the investigation expect De Klerk to move 
against Smit within days. 
  Smit is widely believed to have survived an attempt by De 
Klerk to purge the SAP of conservative generals in August 1992, 
because it was felt that Smit's previous positions on the 
highest state security councils had given him access to 
information which would be damaging to the government and SAP if 
released. 
  Smit is the former head of the 12,000-strong Crime Combating 
and Investigation Unit, which amalgamated the Special Branch 
with other detective branches of the SAP. As senior 
deputy-commissioner he is the number two policeman in South 
Africa after SAP Commissioner General Johan van de Merwe. He 
is currently in charge of staff functions in the SAP which 
include all administrative and auxiliary services. The other 
deputy commissioner, Lieutenant-General Johan Swart, heads the 
executive branch in charge of police on the ground. 
  Smit has headed the security police in the Northern 
Transvaal 
and was chief of the SAP Special Branch. He has been described 
as "harsh" and as having "political ambitions". Judge Richard 
Goldstone said on Wednesday the report into gun-running by 
senior figures within the security forces had been delayed 
because "the commission has been conducting further related 
inquiries." 
  But the delay may also have been the result of threatened 
legal action by some of the generals the commission was 
planning to finger, said one source. Revelations of a 
high-level gun-running operation and a plan to instigate 
political violence could help explain violent incidents which 
have cost thousands of lives in recent months. 
  Van der Merwe was in emergency meetings with members of 
general staff this week. Smit was said by his secretary to be 
"in very urgent meetings until Monday. He is in the 
commissioner's office." Swart was on annual leave for three 
weeks, according to his office. The Goldstone Commission is 
believed to have delayed its report in order to give De Klerk 
time to fire the SAP generals involved. "That would allow De 
Klerk to seize the initiative in time for the election," said 
one senior source. 
  ANC [African National Congress] intelligence is understood 
to 
have co-operated with the Goldstone Commission's investigation. 
A senior ANC source said: "This involves very high-level police 
officers, including generals." The investigation was made 
public early this week by Transkei leader Major General Bantu 
Holomisa, who is number 13 on the ANC's list of candidates for 
the national assembly. Judge Goldstone confirmed an 
investigation had been underway since mid-February, saying he 
had kept both De Klerk and Nelson Mandela informed throughout. 
  A highly placed source described one of the generals 
involved 
in the gun-running operation as "the second-in-command of one of 
the security forces", but refused to name him. The number two 
slot in the South African Defence Force, chief of Defence Force 
Staff, is currently unoccupied after the departure late last 
year of Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn. It is understood 
Holomisa forced the commission's hand over the results of the 
investigation because of continuing ANC suspicion that Goldstone 
is vulnerable to pressure from De Klerk.

  [Text] Pretoria March 18 SAPA -- South African Police [SAP] 
Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe on Friday [18 March] said 
he had "no reason whatsoever" to believe that any senior member 
of the SAP was involved in gun-running activities. He was 
commenting on a report in the latest issue of the WEEKLY MAIL 
&amp; 
GUARDIAN that Deputy Police Commissioner Lt-Gen Basie Smit was 
at the heart of an investigation by the Goldstone Commission 
into a major gun-running operation by senior SAP officers. 
  According to the newspaper, the commission's report could 
contain the hardest evidence to date of an organised third force 
within the security forces. Gen van der Merwe said in a 
statement: "I am aware that Judge Goldstone is conducting an 
investigation into allegations that senior members of the SAP 
are involved in acts of violence and gun-running. However, 
according to my knowledge, these allegations are not in any way 
related to drug-trafficking. 
  "Personally I have no reason whatsoever to believe that any 
senior member of the SAP is involved in such illegal activities." 
  He said although he was aware of certain allegations being 
investigated by the Goldstone Commission against Gen Smit, he 
was convinced any proper investigation would clear him and that 
his honour and professional reputation would "emerge unblemished 
from this episode". 
  "I have already urgently requested the Goldstone Commission 
in writing to hold a comprehensive public inquiry into this 
matter. It is a matter of the greatest possible importance to 
both the SA Police and the future of the judicial system that 
this matter be dealt with in such a manner that justice is seen 
to be done and that the basic principles of justice are strictly 
adhered to," Gen van der Merwe said.

<F P=106> [Report by J Rees] </F>
  [Text] Springfield, Orange Free State March 17 SAPA -- 
South Africans aiding the Angolan Army in its war against the 
rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] movement were doing so without the support, assistance 
or approval of the South African Government or defence force, 
Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee said on Thursday [17 March]. 
"We do not tolerate dogs of war," he told reporters during an 
election campaign swing through the southern Orange Free State. 
  Mr Coetsee was reacting to earlier radio reports which 
quoted 
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi as saying thousands of South African 
troops were aiding Angolan Government troops in the north-east 
of the country. Mr Coetsee said any SADF [South African Defense 
Force] members tendering their services to Angolan Armed Forces 
were in contravention of the Defence Act for showing allegiance 
to a foreign army.

<F P=106> [Report by Kaizer Nyatsumba, politcal correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The South African Defence Force [SADF] has again 
postponed its meeting with the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress] 
Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA], whose top leaders are 
already in the country for the talks. 
  In a statement yesterday, the SADF said the meeting, 
scheduled for this week, would now take place next week, almost 
a month before the country's first all-inclusive election. 
  Sources said the PAC and APLA leadership was angry with the 
latest postponement of the talks, which were to have taken place 
as early as December, had it not been for a series of 
postponements. 
  The sources said this would put a severe strain on the 
organisation's suspension of its armed struggle and 
unnecessarily delay important discussions on the formation of a 
new army. 
  In its statement yesterday, the SADF said the meeting "will 
be exploratory in nature, aimed at determining whether there is 
scope and potential for further discussions." 
  The meeting, over whose venue there was still some haggling 
earlier this week, was to have been the first face-to-face 
encounter to take place in the country between the two old foes. 
  Both previous meetings were held outside the country. 
  THE STAR understands that the SADF wanted the meeting to 
take 
place in Pretoria, while APLA leaders -- some of whom arrived in 
the country on Sunday -- insisted on Johannesburg as a venue. 
  The top APLA leadership -- including Dan "Romero Daniels" 
Mofokeng -- have been in the country since APLA commander Sabelo 
Phama's funeral in Transkei last month. 
  Those APLA leaders who arrived in the country on Sunday are 
Mopedi Ntabeni, Willie Nkonyeni and Andile Motlhabane. 
  They have been granted limited indemnity. 
  However, THE STAR understands that they will soon be given 
complete indemnity.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Freedom Front Beneficiary of Conservative Party Votes -- 
"The emergence, replete with lists of national and regional 
candidates, of Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front [FF] as a 
contesting party in the April election is a positive 
development," says a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR 
in English on 18 March. "It means that a substantial proportion 
of Afrikaner conservatives will pursue the establishment of a 
volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] within legal parameters and, 
sensibly, seek to make use of the Volks [people] Council to 
advance their objective." However, the FF's participation in 
the election is "bad news" for F. W. de Klerk's National Party 
(NP). "Had the FF stayed out, many CP [Conservative Party] 
voters might have voted for the NP as the next best bulwark 
against ANC [African national Congress domination. Similarly, 
in the absence of the FF, the NP is the most likely beneficiary 
of IFP voters who defy an Inkatha boycott call. The NP's loss 
will, however, be South Africa's gain. The more inclusive the 
election and settlement, the better." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Inkatha Leadership Not Searching for Solutions -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 18 March in a page-8 
editorial warns that if President de Klerk is working on a new 
initiative with the IFP which might lead to some kind of 
breakthrough, "he had better work skillfully, because the 
signals from Ulundi tell a different story." "The Inkatha 
leadership is not behaving in a manner suggesting it is 
searching for solutions and for a way to contest the April 
elections." It has "sabotaged" the meeting planned for 18 March 
between Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Nelson Mandela. The 
speeches at the opening of the kwaZulu legislative assembly on 
17 March "were aggressive and threatening, despite the calls for 
peace. King Goodwill Zwelithini's words were in a similar vein." 
BUSINESS DAY says it seems Inkatha President Buthelezi "fears 
allowing the king to be exposed to Mandela's powers of 
persuasion." Buthelezi invited "all and sundry" to the 
Zwelithini-Mandela meeting, and "switched the venue from inside 
the legislative assembly buildings to the grounds outside, so 
that it would become an Inkatha jamboree of royals, chiefs and 
subjects, with Mandela uncomfortably at the centre." "Inkatha 
has made valid objections to the interim constitution, and its 
obduracy has won concessions. It could still win more through 
international mediation. But this does not mean it can continue 
holding the country to ransom." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Parties Must Heed Bophuthatswana Warning -- Johannesburg 
RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 13 March says in a page-20 editorial: 
"In the hurly-burly of events in Bophuthatswana this past week 
the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] stormed in with a 
performance which, tragic ending and all, caused much harm not 
only to themselves, but also to others who do not associate with 
them but whose cause they claim to serve." "The far-right must 
give serious thought to this and several other issues; they will 
realize that the old South Africa is gone for ever." "But the 
finger of the Bophuthatswana mess also points accusingly at the 
ANC, its leaders, and its unbridled followers. In Cape Town 
Major General Bantu Holomisa declared gleefully that 
Bophuthaswana had received a stiff dose of `Vitamin ANC', and 
that kwaZulu was next in line. His statement at an election 
event let the cat out of the bag. Worried South Africans now 
have reason to expect that the ANC `vitamins' form part of its 
election plan for the rest of the country." "It is time," warns 
RAPPORT, "that ANC leaders get it into their heads that South 
Africa needs no revolution but an orderly transition to a new 
constitutional dispensation, managed under strict Western 
democratic standards. But the ANC leadership does not concern 
itself with the brain drain or the millions of rands fleeing the 
country. All one hears is the old refrain that whites need nor 
fear the ANC." "If the AWB is guilty of hot-headed stupidity, 
the ANC's plundering hordes are just as guilty. Mr. Nelson 
Mandela is not doing nearly enough to curb his party's lust for 
power and its arrogance." "If a firm grip is not forthcoming, 
there will be no escaping the violence of the past few days. 
Would that all political parties read what the warning finger 
of Mmabatho has written, and take it to heart."

<F P=106> ["Address to the nation" by UNITA President Jonas Malheiro </F>
Savimbi in Huambo on 16 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear Angolan people, compatriots, friends, and 
proven militants of our National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] party: 
  As divulged in our communique of 13 March, it was not 
possible to make this address on the occasion of the 28th 
anniversary of the creation of the UNITA Party. That was 
because the party leadership and the UNITA team to the Lusaka 
peace talks were in intensive consultation at the time [words 
indistinct] to make this address. 
  Before anything else, I would like to express our 
satisfaction with the visit to Huambo on 12 March by Alioune 
Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general 
in Angola. His first visit here was on 8 July of last year. 
His presence in Huambo has allowed the UNITA Party leadership 
to delve deeper into problems that are yet to be settled, clear 
some doubts, and help create a climate of greater trust. After 
three days of intensive work, the UNITA negotiating team 
returned to Lusaka with more open views and a wider mandate. 
This was so that those frameworks which have not been defined 
yet can be expanded and to help search for lasting peace for 
Angola as a whole. Such lasting peace must be based on accords 
to be signed and which must be respected, thereby ensuring that 
the specter of war does not return to darken the lives of the 
Angolan people. 
  In this message [words indistinct] UNITA militants inside 
and 
outside the country, I would like to reaffirm the spirit of 
(?Mangai), who created (?his) own space within the national 
context. UNITA represents the interests and aspirations of the 
poorer sections of the population. 
  After 28 years of resistance, which took on the [words 
indistinct] in different times and circumstances, we have been 
able to gather experience and trust. We have never stopped 
believing that some day our country would be totally free and 
that the Angolan people would be able to take their country's 
fate in their own hands. We have had to make immense sacrifices 
over the course of these 28 years. We have been in detention at 
times. We were detained and killed during the colonial period. 
We were detained and killed during the Russian-Cuban invasion 
of our country. As I make this address, I remember many of the 
martyrs of those times. Most important and most missed among 
them were UNITA Vice President Jeremias Kalandula Chitunda, 
UNITA Secretary General Mango Alicerces, and Engineer Elias 
Salupeto, UNITA representative in the Joint Political and 
Military Commission, CCPM. 
  There have also been traitors and treacherous ploys over the 
course of these 28 years. Nonetheless, UNITA remained calm, 
confident, and united. I would like to congratulate the party's 
militants and encourage them to continue our resistance, 
wherever they may be doing their duties, whether they be in the 
diplomatic, administrative, military, or political sectors. No 
one thought that our party would still be standing after the 
events of October and November 1992. Not only has it done so, 
it has also [words indistinct] confident, serene, and following 
its program for real democracy in the country that will allow 
all Angolans to participate in, contest, and criticize the 
regime in a constructive manner. 
  We have defeated the skepticism that had spread into our 
ranks at the time. Furthermore, we have built the determination 
and trust to continue our work with a view to occupying the 
place that is rightfully ours in history and in the world. It 
has always been the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola's [MPLA] goal to destroy UNITA. In that way, over the 
years the MPLA has tried to create divisions, a so-called 
democratic UNITA, and parallel organizations. All those efforts 
have been in vain. The (?efforts) (?made) in Luanda to create 
another UNITA leadership instill no fear in us. They have 
happened before, they happen today, and they will happen 
tomorrow. Nonetheless, there is only one UNITA that can 
implement the program drawn up 28 years ago and which has not 
been [word indistinct] yet. 
  Our people are scattered throughout the country. Our roads 
are full of holes. Our homes have been destroyed. Civic sense 
has been destroyed. The black market [words indistinct] a lack 
of responsibility in the [words indistinct] and the salaries 
themselves. All this allows us to say that the goals we have 
set ourselves are very far from attainment. We still have 
fields to till and seeds to plant. 
  I would also like to take this opportunity to say that, 
within the general framework of the resolution of the Angolan 
problem, the UNITA leadership could never agree to independent 
UNITA deputies in the National Assembly. No UNITA deputy to the 
National Assembly today was elected on his or her own merit. 
All UNITA deputies were elected on a single list under the flag 
of the Black Cockerel. 
  Once the current conflict has been resolved, UNITA will turn 
up at the National Assembly with its 70 deputies intact. 
Obviously, there will be contacts with the government, with the 
leadership of the National Assembly, and with the courts in 
Luanda. UNITA will not agree to have dissidents as its deputies 
in the National Assembly. Whoever speaks out against the UNITA 
leadership and its program is promptly expelled from the party 
and is not entitled to talk on its behalf. 
  For a long time now, we have heard shouts, stupid remarks, 
talk of connivance, and hasty compromises, so we have arrived at 
the conclusion that the Portuguese proverb that dogs may bark, 
but the caravan will continue on its way, applies here. There 
can only be one program, one leadership, and one ideology within 
that party and they must represent, in the first analysis of the 
party's creation, in the context of the frustrations experienced 
by millions of Angolan people who also aspire to a dignified way 
of life. They, too, want the right to (?education), health 
care, work, and dignity. They want access to political posts on 
the basis of their capacity and competence. 
  There is not and there will not be in our country -- unless 
we want to imperil social equilibrium--castes and strata, so 
that some are eternally in power and others must eternally obey. 
We have an inclusive and global concept of our condition as 
Angolans. We do not look at race, ethnic background, or 
religious affiliation. We must make joint efforts to overcome 
the backwardness legated us by Portuguese colonialism. With our 
efforts and with international cooperation, we must strive to 
overcome the nefarious effects of this war that has been going 
on for more than 30 years. 
  Whatever the version put out by the regime, whatever the 
version of the international observers, ultimately God and men 
will correctly judge the real reasons which prompted the 
eruption of an even bloodier war after Angola had had its first 
multiparty elections. It is not enough for the regime to hold 
on to legality. It is not enough for the international community 
to hold on to the declaration of Madam Anstee. Facts are 
emerging daily and they prove that there were irregularities in 
Angola's first democratic multiparty elections. 
  However, in order to overcome a situation created by 
foreigners, and because Angolans are joined by the same feelings 
of unity and desire to work together, UNITA has decided to move 
beyond that critical stage. We must look to the future with 
hope because the current conflict can be resolved. It can come 
to an end. The tragedy that has beset the nation can be 
overcome. 
  I would also like to take this opportunity to say that UNITA 
has been deliberately misunderstood because what was intended 
then is what has become a fact in this country today. The press 
and the international community were ready to award victory to 
those they felt could serve alien interests best. God and the 
people know that this is not what the Angolan people feel. It 
takes years--perhaps five, perhaps 10, perhaps 20, perhaps 50. 
As I deliver this declaration to the Angolan people, I am moved 
by the profound conviction that the truth is bound to come out 
some day. The truth will emerge from Angola itself. It will 
come out of the mouths of the Angolan people. It will come out 
of the mouths of those who have lied. The matter belongs in the 
past now, but it has not been forgotten and that is because the 
UNITA leadership has decided to take a step forward. We [words 
indistinct] waiting for Angola, we do not want to be responsible 
for those who have connived in acts of historic irresponsibility 
that will lead to foreign intervention in our country, thereby 
permitting an even more ingrained neocolonization within the 
context of neodemocracy. 
  We want to assure all Angolan patriots, whether they be 
inside or outside the country, that all will be done to ensure 
that the Lusaka peace talks will be fruitful. It is no 
exaggeration to say that certain Portuguese Government officials 
were accomplices in the Bicesse Accord conspiracy and that today 
they are already voicing their skepticism and making 
discouraging remarks so that the Lusaka peace talks may not 
succeed. (?We, in) UNITA, will do everything to ensure that the 
Lusaka peace talks are successful. In addition to the pressing 
reasons of the need for peace in Angola and of the need for the 
Angolan family to come together again, there are two other 
weighty reasons in terms of our African philosophy for us to do 
so: the talks are being held in an African country, and the 
representative of the UN secretary general is also an African. 
We want to show the world that Africans can settle their 
problems without placing themselves in the hands of alien 
mediators. 
  Some Portuguese Government officials are already saying that 
the Lusaka peace talks are destined to fail. They continue to 
wage an intense campaign for other countries to sell weapons to 
the MPLA so that it can destroy UNITA militarily. We have 
always taken the care and followed the moral obligation to 
distinguish between Portuguese Government officials and the 
Portuguese people. We know that the Portuguese people have 
lately participated in a campaign to collect humanitarian aid 
for Angola. We want to thank that gesture because it is typical 
of the Portuguese people. They show solidarity with other 
peoples, notably with the Angolan people, with whom they share 
(?historic), cultural, linguistic, and (?blood) ties. 
  Nonetheless, we must say that there are those here and there 
who are trying to score political dividends out of that 
humanitarian gesture. It is no secret to anyone today that the 
current Portuguese Government is trying to encourage rivalries 
between the Portuguese people and Angolans of different skin 
hues living in that country. Such behavior is completely 
atypical of the Portuguese people. Once the scars of 
colonialism had dried, the Portuguese people were always able to 
enjoy open relations with the people of the Lusophone African 
countries. Neither did they look at race, religious faith, or 
background. 
  Today, though, doctors, engineers, and other skilled cadres 
who have not been able to fit in with the present order of witch 
hunts, detentions without trial, and other problems, and have 
sought refuge in Portugal, now see themselves reduced to working 
as manual laborers. They are shown no respect whatever for 
their studies, often done at Portuguese universities. Such 
feelings are alien to Portuguese culture and to Portuguese 
history and they can only stain those government officials who 
endorse such behavior. 
  There are still important organs of Portuguese sovereignty, 
with enough love for Portugal and for people of other countries, 
that can act against such behavior, which we regard as 
irrational and reprehensible. We place our trust with them. 
The great non-colonial Portugal of the past can then [words 
indistinct] to relate with Angolans of all opposition political 
parties, first and foremost among which is UNITA. 
  We would like to convey our gratitude to all organizations 
like the Portuguese Forum for Freedom and Democracy in Angola, 
the Portuguese Forum, and other organizations that have always 
sought balanced relations between the Portuguese people and the 
Angolan people. We are confident that all [word indistinct] 
schemes to make business, some of which is dirty business, will 
end up failing and the good Portuguese people will see them for 
what they are. 
  I would also like to take this opportunity to say that there 
is no link whatever between the South African and Angolan 
problems. As it is, in a not too distant past many used to link 
Namibian independence to the problems that UNITA would have, to 
survive. Namibia has achieved its independence and it has been 
encouraged to show hostility, but UNITA has continued its 
resistance regardless. What is more, it has done so without 
showing hostility toward Namibia and without needing Namibia. 
  South African Government officials are well aware that the 
only thing they are doing for Angola is to send thousands upon 
thousands of South African mercenaries to fight Angolan 
patriots. That is what is happening in Lunda Norte Province at 
this stage. Those South African mercenaries will be put on the 
run in Lunda Norte. Those who are able to do so will have to 
return to their fatherland [words indistinct] the areas 
controlled by UNITA. 
  Within the framework of the Lusaka Accords, the country will 
voluntarily be returned to government structures and 
institutions. This will happen in terms of accords, but never in 
the wake of the use of force, even if such force is used by 
mercenaries. 
  It is very fallacious of a Portuguese Government official to 
say that UNITA will disappear once the South African problem is 
settled. Instead, I am convinced that the ministerial posts 
occupied by such officials are going to disappear. No foreign 
affairs ministers can stay on in their posts forever. There 
have already been so many and there are bound to be others. 
UNITA will continue to exist, though, because it represents the 
Angolan people's aspirations. May it be so. 
  I would also like to comment on the calls that are 
constantly 
being made to UNITA and the government that we must reach an 
agreement as soon as possible. We want to thank the Angolan and 
Sao Tomean Catholic bishops for their recent peace call. Such 
calls are [word indistinct] and they carry profound moral 
values. We, in UNITA, are sensitive to such calls. Neither the 
Catholic Church nor other churches in Angola, nor civilian 
society, nor anybody else should ignore the tragedy that is 
destroying our country today. Everyone should look for peace 
[words indistinct] concerning the Lusaka peace talks, we have 
wished success to the UNITA team. 
  It must show a spirit of openness. It must try to clarify 
doubts and, above all, it must work to help clarify the legal 
and political framework in terms of which the Angolan opposition 
can claim its rights. To be in the opposition does not mean 
connivance with the regime, or the legitimacy of the party as an 
opposition party will be lost, nor does it mean that the 
opposition must have a consistently destructive approach. We 
believe that, given the conditions in which it was born, 
democracy in Angola needs the cooperation and help of all so 
that there can be a balance. If we fail to do so, we will be 
(?paving the way) for a one-party democracy. 
  Before anything else, we want to ask the representatives of 
the government to understand that democracy can only happen 
within a framework of tolerance. Police hunts, detentions 
without trial, encouraging cadres in other parties to rebel 
against their own leaders, and the illegal use of the media to 
depict people as the regime wishes, are actions that neither 
strengthen democracy nor can [words indistinct] whoever may have 
won, however that victory may have been achieved, should show 
generosity. Whoever has lost, never mind how, should show 
resignation and look for other ways to continue the struggle so 
that Angola can one day reemerge united in its desire to work, 
to have dignity, and to command respect among its people and 
from the international community. 
  We would also like to thank the international community for 
having taken note of the shortages facing the Angolan people. 
It has made extraordinary efforts to bring food, medicines, 
clothing, and comfort to the Angolan people. The Angolan people 
will never forget such gestures of great solidarity. 
  On behalf of the UNITA leadership, I would also like to 
reiterate our complete trust in UN Special Representative 
Alioune Blondin Beye, as an African, as an international 
official, and as a mediator. May our message convey to him our 
profound respect and our desire to cooperate. We would also 
like to reiterate our trust in the observers in Lusaka -- 
namely, the representatives of the United States, Portugal, and 
the Russian Federation. 
  The Portuguese ambassador has shown extraordinarily good 
manners and the kind of understanding that is typical of a true 
Portuguese citizen who defends, in addition to the institutions 
he represents, the need for peace in Angola and for good general 
coexistence among all people, so that Angola as a whole can 
cooperate with Portugal. 
  We would also like to convey our gratitude toward the 
government of President Frederick Chiluba. Over the course of 
the months that the Lusaka peace talks have been held, his 
participation in the process has been discreet but incisive. He 
has not been giving advice to all and sundry. 
  UNITA hereby undertakes that, once a clearer and more 
comprehensive framework has been found, we will not be leaving 
Lusaka without an accord. That will not be just for us to show 
our respect for that independent African nation. It is also for 
us to show that Zambia has played an important role in restoring 
harmony to life in Angola. The peace talks are to enter their 
most critical stage and it is very important that there should 
be more direct contacts between the negotiating teams of the 
government and UNITA. Though we are very grateful for the active 
roles that have been played by the mediator and the observers, 
ultimately it is with the MPLA that UNITA will have to coexist. 
It is inside Angola that we will have to coexist. The Angolan 
people will need to show (?much courage) to help our efforts. 
It is important that we create [word indistinct] lose fear. It 
is important that we devise formulas that strengthen pardon 
rather than amnesty. 
  Within this framework, I think it is absolutely 
contradictory 
that the government should still be holding the bodies of former 
UNITA officials, as well as women and children in its jails. 
Even if it all had to do with human and patriotic feelings, 
still you could not explain why the bodies of UNITA Vice 
President Jeremias Kalandula Chitunda and Engineer Elias 
Salupeto Pena should still be held by the government at a time 
when the peace talks are about to reach their end. 
  Furthermore, the media in Luanda and the world must help 
create a climate of understanding so that we can work to 
strengthen feelings of national solidarity. We have always 
backed Angola. Personally, I have on several occasions told 
UNITA militants, our armed forces, our sympathizers, and the 
Angolan people at large that I shall never leave Angola. I 
shall never go into exile. I shall never run away. I shall do 
my best to fulfill the tasks that the party's militants award me 
inside the country that saw my birth. Should God so desire and 
should God grant me life to do so, I shall do everything in my 
power to give my very best contribution. 
  I also deeply believe that man's destiny is in the hands of 
God. Let God make of me and of us all what He pleases. However, 
I shall never run away from Angola. Let the UNITA militants 
learn from these words that I shall stay because I have to stay. 
Let my opponents also detect in my words a profound conviction 
that any ploy to take me abroad will be useless. I shall never 
leave this land that has seen the deaths of my parents, my 
grandparents, and my nephews, often in tragic circumstances. I 
shall stay because it is my duty to do so. 
  I would also like to sincerely greet my colleagues in the 
movement's leadership, who have stayed put in their posts 
despite enticements, threats, uncertainties, obstacles, and 
shortcomings. All those who believe in the Black Cockerel flag 
-- whether they live under very precarious conditions like those 
in Jamba or under slightly better conditions -- should take it 
for granted that there will be a day when our party will finds 
itself in a better position. Then, we will all reflect about 
what we have gone through. Moreover, with an open mind, 
absolute understanding, and pardoning we will be able to look 
into the future with confidence. Nothing has been lost. Let us 
accept the prevailing conditions with the same [words 
indistinct] attitude that we have followed over the past 28 
years. We have said in the past that personal resentment 
hinders our sight because the finishing line is looming on the 
horizon. 
  Likewise, I wish to send my heartfelt condolences to all 
those who have lost their beloved ones over the past years and 
those who have been left homeless. Whenever possible, we will 
make their worries our own. We will share with them the little 
we have. Until peace is restored in our land once and for all, 
and until such time when men may live freely and safely, [words 
indistinct] with intelligence and capacity fulfill the tasks 
that have been assigned to them. 
  Now I wish to address the Angolan opposition political 
parties in general. UNITA acknowledges that it has made 
mistakes in dealing with the question of opposition. UNITA 
acknowledges that when the president of the Republic, who is the 
chairman of the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola], created a forum to meet the opposition parties, UNITA 
could have taken part provided that the atmosphere prevailing 
then did not make us feel suspicious and distrustful. Now that 
all that has been overcome, we are in a position to share 
experiences, instead of frustrations, knowledge, instead of 
resentment so that there should be in Angola a genuine 
opposition that could serve as a yardstick to balance the [words 
indistinct]. 
  There is no democracy at all when the regime tries to bribe 
opposition members. There can only be a future to the 
opposition if at this final juncture the regime clearly defines 
the framework within which we can evolve, and give our 
contribution so that there is real democracy and a state of law 
in Angola. 
  Many of you were prey to the regime's arbitrary attitude. 
Let us not repeat the same mistakes. UNITA is willing to make 
a concerted effort and to enter into full-fledged consultations 
so that Angola may one day experience an atmosphere of trust and 
freedom in a country that we love so much, and in which we can 
move in and out at will. This applies for those who wish to 
move in and out. For those like myself who want to stay [words 
indistinct] our mountains, valleys, rivers [words indistinct] so 
that Angola may be a fatherland that embraces all its sons. 
  Rulers ought to be sufficiently wise to avoid being selfish 
on matters of public interest. Only Angolans who have been 
reunited can make Angola a meaningful country at home and 
abroad. Once we respect each other at home, and are united when 
it comes to mutual respect, pardoning, and trust, we will also 
be respected by the outside world because there will be no 
factions or divisions, and because our domestic problems will be 
resolved by ourselves. 
  It could be that the few years since we have been 
independent 
are not long enough for us to be able to be fully experienced in 
political and administrative matters. Like I said in my last 
address to the nation, the Portuguese Government never allowed 
Angolans to actively participate in our country's political 
affairs [words indistinct] colonial past. Yet, [words 
indistinct] an atrocious suffering, we have been forced to 
create [words indistinct] to accept dialogue [words indistinct] 
as the only way of resolving our differences which should not 
have been the reason for us to take up arms. The current 
generation of rulers have a major responsibility of not creating 
a culture of violence. Instead, they should create a culture of 
tolerance through which we will all find our own place. 
Accordingly, UNITA is ready to cooperate. 
  Angolan men and women, patriots and friends, and tested 
militants in our party, the future is possible, peace is in 
sight, and it is our duty to understand each other. Only thus 
will we be able to speak of a wealthy Angola. May God bless you 
all and protect our land.

  [Text] Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos's spokesman, 
Aldomiro da Conceicao, has reacted to Jonas Savimbi's address on 
the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
radio station, VORGAN, by remarking that UNITA's deeds do not 
match its words: 
  [Begin recording] [Conceicao] As far as UNITA -- and, in 
particular, its leader -- are concerned, we have learned to pay 
more attention to what is done than to what is said. Savimbi 
has accustomed us to bombastic statements designed to impress 
public opinion, and his actions after such statements are 
totally at odds with them. Naturally we cannot agree with many 
of his opinions on the present political situation in Angola and 
also with regard to Portugal. At any rate his speech did not 
impress us, and did not even have any bearing on the 
negotiations, because we are less concerned with words than with 
deeds and with the stances adopted by UNITA both at the Lusaka 
negotiations and very especially on the battleground. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Dr. Aldomiro da Conceicao. 
Regarding Lusaka, Dr. Savimbi has expressed confidence and the 
belief that a lasting peace agreement will be struck soon. Do 
you share Dr Savimbi's optimism? 
  [Conceicao] We have always described ourselves as being 
moderately optimistic. We have some hope that Lusaka may indeed 
bring a peace agreement to Angola. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There have been some political upheavals in Burkina 
Faso. The country's leader, Captain Blaise Compaore, has 
dissolved the government and the prime minister, Youssouf 
Ouedraogo, has resigned. The prime minister has been on the job 
since June 1992, but it seems he might have been giving jobs to 
people that ruling party militants did not approve of. On the 
line to Ouagadougou, Dan Isaacs asked our correspondent, Pierre 
Kazoni, if any reasons have been given for the prime minister's 
resignation: 
  [Begin recording] [Kazoni] Well, no official reasons have 
been given, but according to the general public it is said that 
the pressure put on him to resign came from the militants of the 
majority party, the ODP-MT [Organization for Popular 
Democracy-Labor Movement], which is also President Compaore's 
party. He is also accused of not being [word indistinct] with 
conviction, and that he does not appoint the militants of the 
ODP to top positions. Well, these are the unofficial reasons, 
according to the people here, that have motivated his 
resignation. 
  [Isaacs] So is it simply that the prime minister has been 
appointing ministers who are not from the majority party, the 
ODP- MT, he has been giving posts to other people? 
  [Kazoni] Yes. I think the ODP-MT, which is the majority 
party, they want everything for themselves. It was said clearly 
during the National Assembly, in the National Assembly's session 
here that the majority in the government should rule and those 
who are not in the government should oppose. This was said 
clearly by a member of parliament who is a militant of the 
ODP-MT. But this is not the vision that Youssouf Ouedraogo has. 
He is a technocrat and he believes in the right man on the 
right job. 
  [Isaacs] From what you are saying the prime minister, Mr. 
Ouedraogo, sounds less like a technocrat and more like somebody 
who really is his own man and wanted good men in good positions. 
Was he a popular prime minister? 
  [Kazoni] You may say that he was popular in a sense, in a 
sense that he achieved something during his during his term of 
office, and the World Bank and the IMF have openly declared 
their satisfaction with the way Mr. Ouedraogo handles the SAP, 
the Structural Adjustment Program. 
  [Isaacs] So will the new government, when it has been 
announced, be totally dominated by dominated by the majority 
party, the ODP-MT? Is that what we can look forward to now? 
  [Kazoni] Very much, because since it is the outcry of the 
majority. I think Compaore may probably listen to them. But it 
does not really rule out completely that Compaore will put in 
somebody who is not probably a member of the majority party. 
This is possible. We can always expect something like that.

  [Text] The negotiating process in Lusaka, Zambia, continues 
at an impasse. According to our correspondent Pedro Manuel in 
the Zambian capital, although the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] accepted the portfolios offered 
by the government, the Black Cockerel's men want more. The 
government in turn refuses to yield and points out that its 
offer is not negotiable. Pedro Manuel reports. 
  The process continues at an impasse. The parties have not 
yet reached an agreement in the country's administration. 
Although it is being said that UNITA has accepted the 
ministries of health, trade, tourism and hotel industry, a 
source said that this does not change the present situation. 
The government has offered UNITA these posts and although UNITA 
has accepted them, it says they are not enough. UNITA also 
wants to hold other ministries, the so-called [word indistinct] 
ministries. The government continues to say no because its 
offer is nonnegotiable. 
  It also seems as if UNITA wants to hold the Ministry of 
Public Works and Urbanization, instead of the Construction 
Materials Ministry. This issue could find an easy solution, 
because both the Public Works Ministry and the Construction 
Materials Ministry are part of the ministries offered by the 
government. That is not all however [words indistinct]. 
  On provincial governments, the situation continues 
unchanged. 
Apart from Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango which were 
offered by the government, UNITA also demands the provincial 
governments of Benguela, Huambo, and Bie. As if this was not 
enough, UNITA also wants to administer more than 20 districts 
and about 50 communes [words indistinct]. The government has 
answered no. Now, the mediators are [words indistinct]. This 
work began yesterday afternoon and continued this morning, but 
no results have been obtained so far. The talks will be resumed 
on 21 March. 
  Meanwhile, the government negotiating team returned to 
Luanda 
this afternoon for consultations with the president of the 
Republic [words indistinct].

  [Excerpts] The OAU ad hoc committee met in Harare, 
Zimbabwe, yesterday, and it approved yet another resolution that 
could help the Angolan peace process. The resolution was 
adopted after a six-hour meeting of southern African heads of 
state and government. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
was represented by Prime Minister Marcolino Jose Carlos Moco at 
the OAU meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Moco was accompanied by Deputy Defense 
Minister Pedro Sebastiao and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister 
Jorge Chikoti. The summit discussed the war in Angola and the 
current stage of the Lusaka peace talks. The fact that the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
appears to agree to one thing today, only to disagree the next 
day, made the OAU adopt yet another resolution. 
  [Begin Chikoti recording] The meeting found that the 
situation in Angola is extremely serious. In the words of the 
OAU secretary general, this summit could not have wound up 
without a communique conveying some serious concerns. First of 
all, UNITA must participate in the democratic process by 
unambiguously accepting the offer made by the government. 
Furthermore, it was noted that the Angolan Government has made 
extremely important concessions and that the international 
community must now consider Resolutions 864 and 903, because 
what is happening now is dangerous and a firmer approach to the 
problem must be adopted. 
  His Excellency Prime Minister Marcolino Moco asked for His 
Excellency OAU Chairman Husni Mubarak's personal support and 
direct commitment to the Angolan peace process, urging the 
United Nations and the United States to view the Angolan issue 
in a very serious light. 
  Thus, the resolution on Angola carries another important 
implication: We can now use it as a working tool because of the 
OAU ad hoc Committee's concern about the prevailing situation in 
Angola at a time when peace talks are being held and the Angolan 
Government has made extremely important concessions to UNITA. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Moco held a private meeting with 
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano shortly after being 
welcomed at the airport in Harare on 18 March by Zimbabwean 
Foreign Affairs Minister Nathan Shamuyarira. Though the press 
has learned nothing about the meeting with the Mozambican head 
of state, it is thought that the Angolan and Mozambican peace 
processes were discussed. Prime Minister Moco also met Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak yesterday morning. The Angolan official 
briefed him on the Lusaka peace talks and on Angola's political, 
military, economic, and social situation. 
  Prime Minister Moco asked the Egyptian head of state to have 
the OAU take concrete steps to ensure that UNITA abandons the 
path of war and signs a peace accord. The OAU chairman promised 
he would work to find greater support for the Angolan peace 
process from the international community. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] RUNDU: Friday, March 11--A massive Antonov-124 
freighter, the world's second largest cargo plane, is still 
detained at Rundu airfield, where the four engine 
intercontinental aircraft is guarded by the police with no one 
allowed to board her. She arrived at Rundu airfield on Tuesday 
afternoon after loading a consignment of goods in Windhoek. 
More goods were taken into her huge cargo holds at Rundu 
airfield, and shortly afterwards police and custom officials 
arrived. Since then the huge jet has been grounded, seized by 
the Namibian police until clearance is received from Luanda that 
she can proceed. 
  Luanda though will in all likelihood not provide the 
necessary clearance because the government there knows nothing 
about the jet, which is painted snow white and bears no markings 
other than the number 26023. 
  The inspector general of Police, General Andima, confirmed 
this afternoon that Luanda's embassy in Windhoek has officially 
denied a statement by the commander of the Antonov that she was 
outbound for Luanda. The Luanda authorities know nothing about 
the aircraft, and General Andima said that unless the commander 
of the aircraft could now prove that what he had told the 
Namibian police was true, the aircraft would be kept grounded. 
  General Andima was kind enough to give some details about 
the 
mystery at Rundu. He said that on Tuesday, March 9, the huge 
jet landed at Windhoek International. There she took in 
supplies, a cargo which had to be supplemented at Rundu 
airfield. After taking off from Windhoek the aircraft did land 
at Rundu airfield where more goods were loaded. Her holds, 
which can take 90 tons of cargo, are filled. 
  General Andima said that he could confirm officially that 
masses of medicines were included in the cargo, but he would not 
elaborate further. The commander was asked to produce 
documentary proof of his flight instructions, and he did in fact 
hand over to the police and customs officials at Rundu airfield 
a document, which soon proved to be without any value. 
  Investigation and communication with the Angolan 
authoritities revealed that this document was not a legitimate 
one and not issued by Luanda. 
  "You are aware of the restrictions the Angolan authorities 
had placed on their airspace and that no air movements were 
allowed other than those authorised by them. In view of that we 
can not allow the Antonov to take off from Rundu," General 
Andima said. 
  The general did not elaborate on the nature of all the cargo 
on board, and rumours were rife that the aircraft was outbound 
not for Luanda, but Jamba, which has an unsurfaced but very 
high-standard airfield, for only quite recently the ADVERTISER'S 
reporter-in-chief landed there. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The aircraft that have been impounded in Namibia 
were carrying lethal equipment for the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Sebastiao (Dombassi), 
Angola's consul in Namibia, said UNITA used a Russian aircraft 
manned by Russian or South African crews for its logistical 
supplies. 
  [Begin (Dombassi) recording] The Rundu airport is being used 
to refuel aircraft flying from South Africa to areas controlled 
by [words indistinct]. Usually, the aircraft declare a 
fictitious flight plan, stating a return itinerary from South 
Africa to Luanda via Rundu. This is designed to deceive the 
Namibian authorities. In fact, the aircraft have never been 
granted permission by the relevant Angolan authorities to fly 
over Angola. The two aircraft were impounded on 6 March and on 
19 March. [end recording] 
  Sebastiao (Dombassi) said UNITA's lobbies [preceding word in 
English] in South Africa used air corridors [words indistinct] 
to supply Jonas Savimbi's forces in Angola. 
  [Begin (Dombassi) recording] The aircraft flying from South 
Africa to supply UNITA areas left from Lanseria airport. The 
resupply flights used to be carried out by Namibian or South 
African aircraft. Recently, these aircraft were exposed and so 
they have opted to use Russian aircraft. In some instances, the 
aircraft are manned by Russian crews. The Antonov-26 that was 
impounded on 6 March was manned by a Russian crew. The entire 
crew of the Antonov-32 impounded on 19 March was South African.

  [Text] Reports from Cuito say aircraft from Zaire have been 
violating Angolan airspace and landing in Andulo, carrying war 
materiel for the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA]. Hercules C-130s flying from the Republic of 
Zaire and South Africa have been landing regularly in Andulo, 
carrying war materiel and fuel for UNITA rebel forces. This was 
revealed by citizen Domingos Lucas, who abandoned the Black 
Cockerel ranks on 11 March, turning himself over to government 
authorities in Kunje Commune. He said his decision was prompted 
by ill-treatment in the bush. Speaking at a news conference, 
Lucas said once unloaded, the war materiel and fuel are taken to 
Caluapanda and to Huambo Province. He said a light aircraft is 
permanently based in Andulo to carry Jonas Savimbi. Lucas said 
UNITA is transferring civilians and troops from Jamba to Andulo, 
presumably to shift its central base to Bie Province.

  [Excerpt] The president, Sir Ketumile Masire, leaves 
Gaborone this afternoon on a four-day official visit to 
Singapore. Sir Ketumile returned home from Harare last night, 
where he attended a one-day meeting of the OAU ad hoc committee, 
which discussed a number of trouble-spots in Africa, 
particularly South Africa. 
  The Harare meeting was opened by President Robert Mugabe of 
Zimbabwe, who regretted that some black leaders like Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party have allowed 
themselves to be manipulated by ultra-rightists within the white 
community who are opposed to the democratic process in South 
Africa. 
  He urged all parties opposed to next month's multiparty 
election to learn from the recent events in Bophuthatswana, 
which showed that no amount of repression can stand in the way 
of a people hungry for freedom and its right to 
self-determination. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Comoran Government last night issued a 
communique indicating that a resident of (Singani) in central 
Grande Comore had attempted to kill President Said Mohamed 
Djohar on 16 March during a ceremony marking the 24th 
anniversary of the death of Said Mohammed Cheikh [first Comoran 
head of government] in Moroni. 
  The person, who was arrested by the Presidential Guard, was 
in possession of a firearm. He is said to have confessed that 
it was the former governor of Ngazidja [Grande Comore Island], 
(Abdel Mohamed), who reportedly financed the murder attempt. 
Comoran opposition leaders like Ali Mroudjae and Abass Youssouf 
have reportedly been arrested by the police in connection with 
the incident.

  [Text] President Djohar of the Comoros apparently had a 
close call early this week. According to the authorities, he 
narrowly escaped a murder attempt during a religious ceremony. 
The attempt was only revealed last night, and the government is 
using the incident as a stick to beat the opposition with. From 
Moroni, the Comoros capital, Kamardine Mohammed faxed this 
report: 
  According to last night's statement, the attempt was going 
to 
be made by a former presidential guard, who was arrested on the 
spot--armed with a pistol hidden in his jacket. The statement 
was broadcast on Radio Comoros following an emergency meeting of 
the government yesterday afternoon. 
  In a stinging attack, President Djohar's press attache, Ali 
Jei, denounced the opposition. Ali Jei claimed that initial 
investigations showed that the arrested man, Fayar Oumar, was 
hired by the opposition. The press attache claimed that the man 
was promised $3,530 and a ticket to go to the French island of 
Mayotte. 
  The opposition has rejected the accusation, pointing out 
that 
the alleged would-be assassin was a bodyguard for a ruling party 
member of the Federal Assembly. They also say that the man was 
carrying a starter pistol. Abass Youssouf, the leader of the 
opposition umbrella organization, the Forum for National 
Recovery, told me this afternoon that this accusation was just a 
manipulation to discredit the opposition.

  [Text] Bula-Bula [DOMINGO] enters all places armed with 
seven eyes and ears. At Sheik Restaurant recently, it saw South 
African Professor Andre Tomashaussen, legal adviser to UN 
special representative Dr. Aldo Ajello on behalf of the 
Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, and Raul Domingos, who 
is extremely well known as one of principal figures in the 
movement led by Afonso Dhlakama, dining together in rather 
subdued light. 
  They were talking in a friendly manner, like two brothers, 
and at times contented smiles came to their faces. At one 
point, in the heat of their conversation, Tomashaussen either 
forgot -- or perhaps not -- that there were other people in the 
restaurant and off he went, loudly warning Raul Domingos to 
watch out for the Americans. He reminded Domingos of what had 
happened with the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola, UNITA: The Americans had begun with many promises but 
had then dropped the organization led by Jonas Savimbi. 
  We looked around but saw no Americans. There were only some 
opposition party militants who have already lost their 
"emergent" status and are hoping for some financial aid from 
Uncle Sam to get going. 
  Bula-Bula does not like to listen to conversations in which 
it has not been invited to participate, so it withdrew and had a 
meal at the bar. Let politicians heed the following advice, 
though: You should not make loud comments in restaurants. Or 
then, if you wish to, you can talk to the newspapers. 
Otherwise, you may bother those in the vicinity or be heard by 
Bula-Bula, which is becoming ever more omnipresent.

  [Text] Tanzania has strongly denied statements issued by 
opponents of the ruling party in Mozambique, Frelimo [Mozambique 
Liberation Front], that Tanzania is preparing a force to invade 
that country if Frelimo is defeated in the forthcoming 
multiparty election. The deputy premier and minister of home 
affairs, the Honorable Augustine Mrema, who is visiting 
Mozambique, denied the allegations at a dinner given for him by 
his counterpart, the Mozambican interior minister, Colonel Jorge 
Manuel Antonio. 
  Speaking to Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania Network by 
telephone 
from Maputo, the Honorable Mrema said Mozambique had been led by 
Mozambicans ever since it attained its independence in 1975. 
Tanzania therefore had no reason whatsoever to prepare a force 
to invade the country. The minister said that what the citizens 
of Mozambique now wanted was peace to rebuild their country, and 
that Tanzania supported all efforts being made in Mozambique to 
bring that peace about. The Honorable Mrema also assured 
Mozambique that Tanzania would continue to condemn any intrigues 
aimed at bringing about war and disrupting peace in Mozambique.

  [Text] Harare March 20 SAPA -- Charges that President 
Robert Mugabe's government is out of touch are being given added 
weight by the national telephone company that is cutting off 
scores of government telephones, faxes and telexes because of 
unpaid bills. Unnamed officials of the state-owned Posts and 
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) were quoted in Sunday's [20 
March] edition of the independent SUNDAY GAZETTE as saying about 
200 government telephone lines had been disconnected in the last 
two months. 
  Last week alone 80 lines were cut, including Mugabe's hot 
lines. The latter were quickly reconnected "after a directive 
from government", the newspaper added. 
  Other victims last week were 23 lines from the Immigration 
Department which owes R45,000 [rand], 36 from the Zimbabwe 
Institute of Public Administration and Management for 
non-payment of its R35,000 bill while the Ministry of Mines' was 
completely cut off for an outstanding bill of R68,000. 
  The switchboard at Jongwe Printers, the printing company 
owned by the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National 
Union-Patriotic Front] party, went dead after a cheque meant to 
pay for its bill of R5,500 was bounced by the bank. 
  In January the Foreign Ministry lost its 70 lines, including 
direct lines, fax and telex services used by Mugabe's office 
when its bill went unpaid. 
  Sources said that the PTC was one client among hundreds of 
creditors that is owed money by the government. 
  Under World Bank economic austerity programmes, the Ministry 
of Finance has issued ironclad instructions that it will not 
bail out government departments that overspend their budgets, 
with the result that millions of dollars of bills go unpaid.

  [Text] Lagos, March 19 (AFP) -- The Nigerian Government 
said Saturday [19 March] it would welcome a referendum on a 
border zone which has become the subject of a bitter dispute 
with neighbouring Cameroon. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Anthony Ani told the official NEWS 
AGENCY OF NIGERIA, NAN, that his government was eager to canvas 
the views of the inhabitants of the disputed Bakassi Peninsula. 
  He said Nigeria had nothing to fear if a referendum was 
conducted in the area because he said more than 90 percent of 
the population of the peninsula was made up of Efik-speaking 
Nigerians. 
  Efik is spoken by the population of two Nigerian states 
sharing a border with the disputed territory of 1,000 square 
kilometres (390 square miles), which Nigeria has always claimed. 
  The two countries, while trying to resolve the conflict 
through diplomatic channels, have stationed troops in the border 
area. 
  Ani has just returned from a visit to some five countries in 
central, southern and eastern Africa to brief authorities there 
on the Nigerian position on the dispute. 
  He said that although his government had yet not considered 
a 
referendum as an option, it "may give it a thought" if it would 
help resolve the dispute peacefully. 
  He reiterated his government's belief that the conflict can 
still be resolved through dialogue, rather than seeking a 
solution at the International Court of Justice at The Hague. 
  Nigeria has accused Cameroon of "internationalising" the 
dispute by taking it to the court and to the United Nations 
Security Council.

  [Text] Nigeria says it does not consider a referendum as an 
option for the resolution of her dispute with Cameroon over the 
Bakassi Peninsula. The minister of state for foreign affairs, 
Chief Anthony Ani, said in an interview in Abuja that if it 
became necessary as part of a peaceful resolution of the 
dispute, Nigeria might give it a thought. He, however, added 
that a referendum was not necessary to establish the citizenship 
of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The minister emphasized 
that 90 percent of them were Efik-speaking Nigerians.

  [Text] Senegal's two main opposition leaders, who were 
arrested on 24 February, have finally been brought before court. 
Abdoulaye Wade and Landing Savane were interrogated in Dakar 
yesterday in connection with the 16 February riots that led to 
the death of eight persons including six policemen. Nothing 
filtered out of the hearing conducted by three examining 
magistrates as lawyers took refuge behind the confidentiality of 
judicial inquiry. 
  Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party [PDS] and 
Landing Savane, secretary general of the African Party for 
Democracy and Socialism were marched back to their prison cells 
after the hearing. They were charged with breach of internal 
state security. Four other accused persons, Boka Kane, PDS 
deputy and Pap Malik Sy, second in command of the banned Dayira 
Moustarchidine Wal Moustarchidate Muslim youth organization were 
also heard and kept in detention. 
  The Senegalese Government believes Wade and Landing Savane's 
responsibility is clearly established. This was stated by 
Abdoulaye Elimane Kane, Senegal's communication minister and 
government spokesman, who is currently visiting Paris where our 
Paris correspondent, Mohamed Issoufou Saliou, met him. 
  [Begin Kane recording] Since the docket is already before 
court, the public prosecutor will have the task of proving their 
responsibility and the defense counselors will have to prove the 
contrary if they can. However, the Senegalese Government is 
convinced today that the incidents occurred during a protest 
march that was indeed unauthorized and that they resulted in 
frightful killings, material damage, and demonstrated a clear 
intention to endanger the Republican institutions. There is no 
doubt about this viewpoint because one can verify from all 
newspapers published after the incidents, including private 
independent newspapers, that it was the organizers who gave the 
order for the protest march to begin, and it is quite clear that 
they did not take any measures to forestall the consequences of 
the protest march. The rest is purely technical. I tell you 
that the state attorney general upholds the view that they were 
effectively caught in the act. [end recording]

  [Text] Lome, 18 Mar (AFP) -- The Supreme Court officially 
announced today in Lome that the Rally of Togolese People [RPT] 
had officially filed suit at the Supreme Court for an annulment 
of the results of the second round of legislative elections. 
The results were taken from seven constituencies where the 
opposition won in the 20 February elections. 
  The RPT, which obtained 35 seats (out of 81), accuses the 
opposition of having organized "massive fraud" and "preventing 
voters from casting their votes" in seven constituencies out of 
the 24 concerned in the second round of legislative elections. 
  According to the official election results, proclaimed by 
the 
Supreme Court on 14 March, the Togolese opposition won an 
absolute majority at the National Assembly, with 43 seats out of 
81. 
  In his statement during the proclamation of the results, 
Supreme Court President Emmanuel Apedoh said that the election 
"went smoothly in line with the established procedure and in a 
satisfactory manner." 
  That opinion was shared by France, Germany, and the United 
States (three of the five member countries of the International 
Monitoring Committee on the Togolese elections) and the European 
Union. 
  According to the electoral code, the Supreme Court has, as 
of 
today, has 10 days to rule on the appeal.

  [Excerpts] Head of state General Gnassingbe Eyadema 
received five of the country's political parties this morning at 
his Lome II private residence. This is the second time such 
discussions have been held, less than a week after the 
proclamation of the final results of the second round of 
legislative elections. It was an occasion for the head of 
state to analyze the country's political situation with the said 
political parties prior to the formation of a new government 
team. 
  The five political parties, received in turn by President 
Eyadema, are the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT], the Union 
for Justice and Democracy [UJD], led by Lal Takpandjan; the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] led by Yaovi Agboyibor; Edem 
Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]; the Union of Liberal 
Independents [ULI] led by Jacques Amouzou; and the Coordination 
of New Forces led by Prime Minister Koffigoh. After the 
audience Mr. Koffigoh said he discussed the formation of a new 
government with President Eyadema. 
  [Koffigoh] What I can tell you is that the president 
continues with his consultations with a view to forming a new 
government. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did you discuss the 
criteria for choosing a new prime minister? 
  [Koffigoh] You know, the post of prime minister is not 
a monarchy. It is not the duty of the outgoing prime minister 
to define the criteria for choosing his successor. This problem 
must be resolved according to the Constitution. First, we have 
the prerogatives of the president of the Republic, who has the 
power to designate the prime minister from within the 
parliamentary majority. This parliamentary majority also must 
stand out and make concrete proposals. 
  RPT Secretary General Vigniko Amedegnato gave a profile for 
the new head of government against the background of the 
country's new political landscape. He must be a man of 
dialogue, a very experienced economist with perfect knowledge of 
the country's economic problems, and capable of redressing the 
national economy. 
  [Amedegnato] We have considered the current political 
situation and, as the recent elections indicated, we have some 
majority political parties, and so, we are not dealing with the 
case of a single political party. The RPT has already 
recommended that the next government be a national union 
government. This is why the RPT holds the view that next prime 
minister must first be a man of dialogue. He must be somebody 
capable of conducting a dialogue with all political parties -- 
irrespective of their leanings. In short, he should, as his 
predecessor said, be the prime minister of all Togolese. This 
is why we insist on this second aspect of the issue. 
  The third issue we raised with the president of the 
Republic is solidity and cohesiveness within the government, 
which also depends on the existing cohesion between the 
president and the government. So, we of the RPT want the future 
prime minister to be somebody who is capable of conducting a 
dialogue with the president of the Republic, and who can be on 
good terms with him. So, we think that once this prerequisite 
is met, it will guarantee peace in our country and at the same 
time enable us to come out of the critical economic situation, 
which is harmful to all and from which everybody is suffering. 
Therefore, it is essential that the prime minister be a dynamic 
person, a very enlightened economically, and a person capable of 
bailing the country out of the current economic situation. At 
the same time he must be somebody who can have dialogue with all 
the political parties to try and ensure an effective group 
leadership, and lead a consensus government, and we think he 
should be someone capable of maintaining a dialogue with the 
president of the Republic to ensure to greater cohesion within 
the country's leadership. [passage omitted] 
  UTD leader Edem Kodjo said it is necessary to both consider 
the political realities and socio-economic constraints as 
determining factors for the appointment of the head of the 
future government. 
  [Kodjo] The head of state, in line with Article 66 
relating to the designation of a prime minister, has again held 
consultations with us. I can assure you that the consultations 
went smoothly. 
  [Correspondent] Did you discuss the criteria to serve 
as guidelines for the selection of the prime minister? 
  [Kodjo] We tried to develop these criteria a little, 
and I think what was agreed upon is quite suitable for us. But 
for the moment we cannot give any details. 
  [Correspondent] In view of the problems facing your 
country, what in your view are the criteria that can presently 
enable Togo to resolve these problems? 
  [Kodjo] Well, I am not here to open a debate on this 
issue, but I think one has to consider both the political 
equation and the socio-economic constraints. 
  Finally, like those who preceded him, ULI leader Jacques 
Amouzou hinted that his discussions with President Eyadema were 
in line with preliminary consultations to nominate a prime 
minister. 
  [Amouzou] I met the head of state in line with the 
current consultations he is holding with all and sundry, the 
leaders of all the political parties including the UDR, and our 
discussions centered only on this issue. 
  [Correspondent] Did you talk about the criteria that 
might come into play in the choice of a new prime minister? 
  [Amouzou] Instead of speaking about criteria for 
individual appointments, I rather think that we should discuss 
the criteria for the formation of the government which will 
govern the country. As I have already said about the criteria, 
I think one must put in place a government which will be open to 
all sides. For me, this is the lesson that we should draw from 
the legislative elections we just participated in. One should 
avoid anything that looks like a policy of exclusion. This is 
what I just explained to the head of state. I did not discuss 
individual problems. 
  [Correspondent] There is, all the same, the need for a 
man who is capable of rallying together all these forces to lead 
them as a team after the elections. 
  [Amouzou] If this is what you mean, here is my answer. 
Since you are talking about the prime minister, I think he 
should be the prime minister of all the Togolese people and not 
the prime minister of certain parties, factions, or regions. We 
need a prime minister who pledges security and assurance for 
everybody, regardless of tribal or regional origin or political 
leaning. I think these are the basic criteria for the prime 
minister, who will be called upon to govern the country together 
with the head of state.

  [Text] Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, speaker of the 
Transitional National Assembly and leader of Sudan's delegation 
at the Nairobi negotiations, met with Major General Mohamed 
Farah Aidid, the leader of the Somali National Alliance. The 
meeting touched on the efforts to provide stability and peace in 
Somalia and to reach a peaceful settlement to end the civil war 
there. 
  Major General Aidid praised Sudan for its solid stand and 
for 
its unlimited support, which the Somali people have been 
receiving throughout their ordeal. 
  Mr. Khalifah expressed Sudan's readiness to continue 
supporting the Somali brothers in the implementation of the 
resolutions of the reconciliation conference currently being 
held in Nairobi, in which all the Somali factions are 
participating, by means of the provision of technical and moral 
assistance, by placing Sudan's resources at the disposal of the 
Somali brothers and hosting any meetings which they deemed 
appropriate to hold in Sudan. 
  It is worth mentioning that Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah 
will this evening meet Mr. Ali Mahdi, the provisional Somali 
president, for talks on ways of supporting the Somali 
reconciliation, and to confirm Sudan's stand on the side of the 
Somali people and all its factions.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with interim President Ali Mahdi </F>
Mohamed by correspondent Inas Nur; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The framework agreement reached in Cairo by 12 
Somali factions gives a glimpse of hope; that is, if it is 
approved by General Aidid, who has been outside Somalia since 
last March. 
  Consultations in Cairo among the Somali factions 
representing 
the Salvation Alliance were held at the invitation of Egypt, 
which currently chairs the OAU. Commenting on that, interim 
President Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who lived in Cairo in 1960 as a 
researcher at the Malaria Institute, said: President Mubarak's 
invitation to us reflected the strong fraternal relations and 
the historic ties that link our countries. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-AHRAM, Mahdi said that the 
Somali people are eager to see peace prevail in their country. 
This desire was enhanced with the arrival of international 
forces. Mahdi warned against overoptimism, in view of another 
development that calls for concern; namely, the withdrawal of a 
considerable part of the international forces by the end of this 
month before all factions are disarmed, the establishment of 
state institutions is completed, the police force is 
reorganized, and peace is restored. This constitutes a threat 
because fighting might resume after the forces withdraw, he said. 
  Speaking about the obstacles hindering reconciliation, Mahdi 
said: Although we reached an agreement in Addis Ababa last 
March, a small group is working to separate the northern part of 
Somalia. Mahdi denied that Aidid is in control of a wide area of 
Somalia. He pointed out that the image of Aidid drawn in the 
media is not true and distorts the facts. He explained that 
Somalia has 18 regions, 16 of which are under the control of the 
12 factions of the Salvation Alliance, while two regions are 
controlled by the National Movement in the north. 
  Asked whether there is dialogue between the 12 factions and 
the National Movement in the north, Mahdi said: There is no 
official contact between us, but there are personal contacts 
with figures from the north. We hope the situation will develop 
in the future into an expanded Somali dialogue, he said. 
  Mahdi was asked about the agreement reached in Cairo between 
the factions and the prospects for its success in the absence of 
Aidid, who was invited to the meeting but failed to attend. He 
said: We are eager to meet with him to solve the problem. We 
have not ignored him; we will invite him to take part in 
implementing the agreement. 
  Mahdi believes that several parties are encouraging Aidid to 
take negative stands and they provide him with what he needs to 
maintain the present situation. Mahdi, however, refrained to 
name these parties. 
  On the reason for and significance of Aidid's presence 
outside Somalia and the acceptance of Aliyow, one of the leaders 
of the factions allied with Aidid, of Egypt's invitation to 
attend and participate in the Somali discussions, Mahdi said: 
Aidid took part in the political consultations that took place 
in Addis Ababa last March. Ever since then, he has been 
traveling on tours outside the country. As regards Aliyow, he 
came here in response to Egypt's invitation. His presence here 
manifests the differences in viewpoint with Aidid, who is allied 
with two other factions. The total number of Somali factions is 
15. 
  On Aidid's earlier comments that the Somali factions were 
about to reach agreement had Egypt not intervened, Mahdi said: 
Egypt invited us all without distinction. What Egypt is doing 
does not target any specific party and does not give or withhold 
privileges to any. All the rumors Aidid is spreading against 
Egypt are not true. 
  As regards differences between the group of 12 that 
constitute the Salvation Alliance, Mahdi said: I confirm that 
there are no differences among the 12 factions and that all 
reports about divisions are not true. We have defined a 
specific and united policy and a fixed defense, which will grow 
from whatever conclusions we reach through our democratic 
discussions. 
  On Aidid's accusation that the United Nations is the reason 
behind the suffering in Somalia, Mahdi said: It is unfortunate 
for us to hear accusations, which are not in line with the true 
interests of our people, leveled against the role of the United 
Nations. The truth is very different. The United Nations 
intervened at a time when our people were going through a very 
bad crises. The average daily number of deaths was about 2,000. 
Chaos prevailed everywhere. These problems were eliminated, and 
stability and peace were restored. He added: We should not 
forget that the role of the United Nations contributed toward 
constructing administrative institutions in various regions of 
Somalia. Had the United Nations not intervened, the catastrophe 
would have been much greater. On the role of the forces 
remaining in Somalia after the end of the current month, the 
number of which will be 22,000, Mahdi said: Actually, we are 
not satisfied with the new duties specified for these forces in 
accordance with the Security Council resolution. The resolution 
stipulates that these forces should stay in their barracks, 
maintain public facilities such as airports and ports, and 
protect aid convoys, without actually participating in 
disarmament operations, spreading public security, and 
contributing toward reconciliation. We deduce from this that 
the role of international forces in Somalia will shrink.

  [Text] The situation in Mogadishu following the deaths of 
our two colleagues is extremely tense. General Fiore, the 
commander of our contingent in the country, who, as you will 
recall, is stationed on the aircraft carrier Garibaldi, has 
given a precise order to all journalists to leave Mogadishu 
immediately in order to board the carrier, where, as I will 
remind you, the bodies of our two colleagues have been taken. 
Filippo Gaudenzi spoke on the telephone to Gen Fiore. Let's 
hear what he had to say. 
  [Begin recording] [Gaudenzi] What is the situation like at 
present in Mogadishu? 
  [Fiore] The situation is always difficult, and anything can 
happen from one moment to the next. For all intents and 
purposes, we no longer have any information sources on the 
ground because we are now stationed only at the port area and 
the airport. The last 90 soldiers will board the aircraft 
carrier this evening, and, in this way, our mission is over. 
  [Gaudenzi] In other words, does this mean that none of our 
fellow nationals will remain in Somalia? 
  [Fiore] From this evening, when the last group will board 
the 
ship, none of the contingent will remain on land. Only the 
diplomatic delegation, the ambassador, some administrators from 
the embassy and a group of carabinieri to escort the ambassador 
will remain. 
  [Gaudenzi] What is the morale like of the men following the 
end of a mission whose balance sheet has yet to be added up? 
  [Fiore] This event has hit us hard because we were used to 
living with these journalists. They almost seemed to belong to 
us. We are very sad. The journalists had been with us for a 
week, and the irony is that this evening they would have boarded 
the Garibaldi to return to Italy with us. 
  [Gaudenzi] Do you think it significant that the two 
journalists were Italian? Did they want to kill Italians? 
  [Fiore] Not just Italians. They wanted to kill Westerners. 
There are very few Westerners remaining in Somalia, and Italians 
are Westerners. Unfortunately, this is the way it goes. 
  [Gaudenzi] When do you expect to return to Italy? 
  [Fiore] We should have left this evening, but our schedule 
has been altered slightly because tomorrow morning a [word 
indistinct] 122 will arrive from Mombassa. We will load the 
bodies of the two journalists on the 122 (?plane), which will 
then leave for Italy. I believe that we will finally leave on 
23 March. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Council of Ministers yesterday held an 
extraordinary meeting under the chairmanship of the head of 
state, His Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira. Three items were on 
the meeting's agenda. Here is a report on the meeting by the 
minister of communication and spokesman of the government, 
Cyriaque Simbizi. 
  [Begin Simbizi recording] Three items were on the agenda of 
the meeting, first, the draft decree on the organization of the 
services at the Presidency of the Republic; second, the draft 
decree on the creation and organization of the General 
Administration of State Security; and third, the draft decree on 
the organization of the Ministry of National Defense. [passage 
omitted] 
  The ministers discussed setting up a General Administration 
of State Security charged with all the problems relating to the 
security of the head of state, the other state institutions, and 
senior political personalities. The main reason for this draft 
decree originates in the unfortunate events that our country has 
been through since the night of 20 to 21 October 1993. The 
serious consequences of destabilizing the institutions, notably 
the Presidency, justifies the establishment of a body 
technically and morally trained to efficiently ensure the 
protection of national democratic institutions, irrespective of 
the party or people in power, today or tomorrow. 
  It is within this framework that we have proposed the 
creation of a General Administration of State Security which 
comprises a security unit for the institutions and the Central 
Investigation Office. The unit is military and made up of about 
1,000 men, whose recruitment will be carried out from existing 
units of the Armed Forces or through military channels. The 
unit will have to reflect the image of a truly national army in 
its composition, discipline, and technical, moral, and patriotic 
training. 
  The members of the council unanimously recognized the 
appropriateness of such a structure given the circumstances our 
country has just experienced. They recognized that this was, in 
fact, a formalization of its existence, since there has always 
been a Presidential Guard Unit, though without a regular 
function. This unit did not deal with the protection of the 
president of the republic alone. It was often drawn from a 
military barracks and dealt with other tasks. 
  Under the new project, the same body will also deal with the 
protection of other senior political personalities and strategic 
points. 
  It is worth noting that the project was conceived jointly 
with the services concerned, notably the Army and the 
Gendarmerie headquarters, as well as the National Documentation 
Services. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Musaga Estate was the site yesterday of 
certain incidents that increased tension in the area, after an 
Otracom [Office of Transport and Communication] bus was attacked 
with a grenade. We managed to telephone the head of the Musaga 
zone, who first of all briefed us on the security situation in 
the zone in an interview with our colleague, Antoine Kaburahe. 
[passage omitted] 
  We have not managed to link up with the head of the 
Nyakabiga 
zone, but there is trouble there, as well, which reportedly has 
caused between 20 and 40 deaths since yesterday afternoon. The 
killings are still going on up to this moment, despite the 
presence of security forces on the spot.

  [Text] In the Nigeria-Cameroon dispute over the Bakassi 
Peninsula, Lagos has said it is ready to organize a referendum 
in the region, which is coveted by both countries. The Nigerian 
deputy foreign minister told the Nigerian press agency NAN that 
he is confident on the issue of holding such a referendum, 
since, he said, 90 percent of the population of this peninsula 
is made up of Efik-speaking Nigerians. How do the Cameroon 
authorities react to this proposal? We asked Augustin Kontchou, 
information minister and spokesman for the Cameroon Government: 
  [Begin Kontchou recording] We are surprised by such a 
declaration. It shows quite clearly that the Nigerians do not 
consider the Bakassi Peninsula to be Nigerian territory. 
Cameroon cannot of course accept that a referendum should be 
held in order to determine that part of its territory should go 
elsewhere. I would like, nevertheless, to thank the Nigerian 
deputy foreign minister for showing the international community 
with this declaration that the Bakassi Peninsula is indeed 
Cameroonian territory. 
  I would, however, like to know what the Nigerians really 
want. We have been negotiating with them in Togo. They have not 
told us that they are abandoning this mediation, but they now 
seem to be following another path: The Nigerian foreign 
minister announced in Cairo that there would soon be a summit 
between the Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state, but we have 
not been told anything about this. And now they announce a 
referendum. We conclude that this is some sort of diplomatic 
and media agitation in order to sow confusion. Cameroon cannot 
take this agitation very seriously. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Faustin Twagiramungu, the prime minister of the 
broad-based transitional government, announced that the 
transitional government is due to be put in place before 21 
March, that is to say next Monday. In a statement, the prime 
minister-designate listed of the ministers chosen from all the 
parties due to take part in this government and stressed the 
reason for the current deadlock. Let us listen to Prime 
Minister-designate Faustin Twagiramungu: 
  [Begin Twagiramungu recording] [passage omitted] Rwandans, 
the Arusha Peace Accord provides for responsibilities to be 
given to each of the political actors in its implementation, in 
this case the president of the Republic, the Rwandan Government, 
the political parties, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the 
prime minister of the broad-based transitional government. I 
now wish to seize this opportunity to announce to the Rwandan 
people that, as far as I am concerned, in my capacity of prime 
minister-designate and by virtue of Article 52 of the protocol 
of the accord on power-sharing, I have already completed all 
necessary consultations. [passage omitted] 
  After the consultations I held with the various political 
parties and with the RPF, I am happy to present to the Rwandan 
people a list of the people chosen to hold ministerial 
portfolios in the broad-based transitional governemnt. They 
must be--or rather, are due to be--sworn in before the president 
of the Republic and the Transitional National Assembly at a date 
to be fixed by the Rwandan Government and the RPF. This date 
should be 21 March at the latest. The people on this list are: 
  For the National Revolutionary Movement for Development: 
Augustin Bizimana, Ferdinand Nahimana, Prosper Mugiraneza, Andre 
Ntagerura, and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko; 
  For the RPF: Pasteur Bizimungu, Dr. (Natire) Kayumba, 
Colonel 
Dr. Joseph Karemera, Seth Sendashonga, and Dr. Jacques 
Bihozagara, who is also vice prime minister; 
  For the Republican Democratic Movement: Dismas Nsegiyaremye, 
Boniface Ngulinzira, [Agathe] Uwilingiyimana; 
  For the Social Democratic Party: Augustin Iyamuremye, 
Frederic Nzamurambaho, Marc Regenera; 
  For the Liberal Party: Justin Mugenzi, Landouald Ndasingwa, 
(Aloys Nyuhita); 
  And for the Christian Democratic Party: Jean-Neponucene 
(Nayinzira). [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph Rwegasira left 
Kigali yesterday afternoon after a weeklong visit to our 
country. The mission came within the framework of the 
implementation of the Arusha peace agreements and met the 
requests for President Mwinyi's intervention made by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] and the president of the Republic. 
  During his visit, Minister Rwegasira held talks with the 
main 
political forces of the country, forces which are to take part 
in the transitional institutions. He met the president of the 
Republic, the two prime ministers, RPF officials, and 
representatives of the Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development [MRND], the Republican Democratic 
Movement, the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic 
Party, and the two Liberal Party [PL] factions. 
  Rwegasira said before his departure that the only remaining 
obstacle to setting up the transitional institutions lay with 
the PL party, especially in the lack of coordination by the two 
factions on how to distribute their ministerial portfolios. 
  On behalf of the facilitator, President Mwinyi, Minister 
Rwegasira urged all the parties involved to assume their 
responsibilities in the implementation of the Arusha peace 
accord. Before leaving Kigali, Rwegasira met with the political 
parties due to take part in the broad-based transitional 
government, as well as diplomats accredited in Kigali. The 
Office of the President, the MRND, and the Mugenzi faction of 
the PL were not represented [words indistinct] at that meeting.

Husni Mubarak to the OAU Southern Africa Committee in Harare on 
19 March] 
  [Text] Harare, 19 Mar (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak, who is the current OAU chairman, delivered a speech at 
the opening session of the OAU's Southern Africa Committee in 
Harare today. Here is the text of the speech: 
  Brothers, presidents and heads of delegations, secretary 
general, representative of the African National Congress, 
representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress, ladies and 
gentlemen: Once again we meet in this ancient African city to 
ponder the recent developments in the southern part of our 
glorious continent and discuss the moves that we should make in 
the coming months. We need to ensure that we remain on the 
course that will bring us nearer to our righteous goals and 
reward the bitter struggle in which we all have taken part for 
the principles of freedom and justice. The fraternal people in 
South Africa have taken the heavier share in this struggle, but 
all African nations and peace-loving forces in the world have 
come to their support. 
  To begin, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to 
my brother and dear friend, President Robert Mugabe, and the 
brotherly Zimbabwean people for hosting this momentous meeting 
that comes at a crucial juncture in the history of African 
struggle for liberation and progress. It is propitious that we 
meet today in a capital that has witnessed many of Africa's 
historic achievements. 
  I recall that our committee met in 21 August 1989. I and 
many of you had the honor to participate in that meeting in 
which we discussed ways of providing support to the South 
African people who were fighting a ferocious battle against 
apartheid and struggling for a just and safe society, one that 
is free from the shackles constricting the majority of this 
great people. 
  At that time, my brother and friend Nelson Mandela was in 
prison and many looked upon the abolition of apartheid as a 
distant dream. The daunting obstacles were there all right, but 
the will of the people triumphed in the end. Our great people 
in South Africa, braving the difficulties, faithful to their 
ideals, made a sizable contribution to the history of struggle 
for justice and freedom. We are now only a few steps away from 
the establishment of a democratic state in this precious part of 
this tenacious continent. 
  We are fully aware of the challenges we will have to face in 
the months and years ahead as we seek to build a strong and 
cohesive society capable of shaking off the painful legacy of 
the past and exploring the vast potential of its new horizons. 
  We have no other recourse but to accept these challenges and 
plunge into the battle of building a democratic state with the 
same grit that marked our struggle against the unjust system of 
apartheid. 
  It may be fitting here to point out the establishment of the 
Transitional Executive Council, which is working tirelessly to 
accelerate the march of democracy, create a pluralistic system, 
and supervise the holding of general elections within the next 
few weeks. 
  We are confident that all the forces supporting legitimacy 
and progress will unite their ranks and come up with a formula 
for comprehensive national reconciliation that would spur and 
guide the current process. For this to happen, all national 
forces should take part in the elections, for the latter 
represents a first but crucial step in this historic 
transformation and the light that guides our hopes. 
  We, for our part, will not hesitate to engage in every 
necessary effort to protect this process. We see our task, 
within this committee, as one that will continue until the fruit 
of this struggle, which we launched side by side, is harvested. 
We will remain prepared to get in touch with all parties and 
urge them to participate in a positive way so that a democratic 
state in South Africa will come into being on schedule and take 
its place within the larger African community. 
  Long live the unity of African struggle. Long live the 
struggle of African nations for a new dawn of prosperity and 
construction, an end to hatred and grudges, and a deeper 
commitment to freedom, democracy, and justice. May God guide 
our efforts to achieve this goal. Peace and the mercy of God be 
upon you.

  [Text] Harare, 19 Mar (MENA)-The African leaders taking 
part in the 10th session of the Southern African Committee, 
which concluded its meetings this evening in Harare under OAU 
Chairman Husni Mubarak, have welcomed the great progress made in 
the multilateral negotiations in South Africa, which culminated 
in the conclusion of the historic agreements to hold the first 
democratic and nonracial elections in the country in April. 
  The committee, in a statement issued at the end of its 
session, praised all parties to the peace process in South 
Africa for the spirit of tolerance they showed, which 
contributed to achieving this accomplishment. 
  In its final statement, the South African Committee 
emphasized its overwhelming support for democratic process in 
South Africa, which serves the great interests of whoever is 
living there, regardless of any ethnic considerations. The 
committee voiced its regret for the recent acts of violence in 
South Africa and called on all parties to show tolerance and a 
sincere spirit of reconciliation to put an end to the chaotic 
massacres and provide the appropriate atmosphere for holding the 
elections in the country. The committee paid tribute to the 
urgent efforts exerted by the transitional executive council and 
the Government of South Africa to contain the explosive 
situation in Bophuthatswana. 
  The committee called on all political leaders in South 
Africa 
to take the necessary measures to safeguard and guarantee the 
unity and territorial integrity of South Africa. It called on 
the international community to continue its backing for the 
process of democratic change in South Africa and reject any 
attempt to partition the country. 
  On behalf of the OAU leaders, the committee expressed its 
hope to welcome a "new South Africa" as a member in the 
organization following the April elections and the formation of 
a democratic government. 
  The following is the text of the statement: 
  The 10th session of the OAU's South African Committee of 
heads of states and governments met in Harare, the capital of 
Zimbabwe, on 19 March 1994 to review the developments in South 
Africa on the eve of the first democratic and nonracial 
elections in that country. Participating in the meeting were 
Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the current chairman 
of OAU; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, president of the 
host country and head of the front-line states; Botswana's 
President Ketumile Masire, Cape Verde's President Antonio 
Mascarenhas, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, Mozambique's 
President Chissano, Namibian President Dr. Sam Nujoma, Tanzanian 
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, and Zambian President Frederick 
Chiluba. 
  Also present at the meeting were Angolan Prime Minister 
Marcolino Moco; Lieutenant General D. O. Diya, Nigerian Chief of 
the General Staff and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive 
Council; Benjamin Bounkoulou, Congolese minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation; Ahmed Djebbar, Algerian 
minister of national education; Osman Kamaza, Senegalese 
ambassador to Zimbabwe [name and title as received]; OAU 
Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim; Johnson Mlambo, chairman of 
the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania; Alfred Nzo, member 
of the African National Congress [ANC] Executive Council [name 
and title as received]; and in the capacity of observer, Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's representative in South 
Africa. 
  The committee examined a report prepared by the OAU 
secretary 
general following his visit to South Africa and his extensive 
discussions with all concerned leaders there. 
  The committee listened to reports on the current situation 
in 
South Africa presented by the leaders of the PAC and ANC 
delegations. 
  The committee referred to the Harare Declaration, which it 
adopted on 21 August 1989 during its third regular session and 
which included the principles and directions for the negotiating 
process, and the program for ending apartheid and establishing a 
united, democratic, and nonracial state in South Africa. 
  The committee welcomed the considerable progress achieved 
since its last meeting and the splendid success achieved by the 
multilateral negotiations, which produced historic agreements 
providing for democratic elections in South Africa on 26, 27, 
and 28 April 1994 and the establishment of transitional 
structures to hold those elections. 
  The committee praised the spirit of tolerance shown by all 
parties involved in the peace process and the flexible attitudes 
which made the above achievement possible. 
  The committee voiced regret at the escalating violence in 
the 
country and grave concern at recent reports about the 
involvement of senior officers in South Africa's security forces 
in the continuing violence. The committee urged all parties in 
South Africa to show tolerance and sincerely seek reconciliation 
to put an end to the reckless massacres and prepare a suitable 
climate to hold peaceful elections. 
  The committee welcomed the PAC's decision to halt armed 
struggle unilaterally as of 16 April 1994. The committee termed 
this decision a contribution toward free and honest elections. 
  The committee applauded South Africa's Transitional 
Executive 
Council and Government for their prompt efforts to contain the 
explosive situation in Bophuthatswana and urged them to continue 
their task of maintaining order, security, and law and 
guaranteeing free political action throughout the country so 
that the April elections can be held in an atmosphere free from 
violence and threats. 
  The committee voiced support for the efforts to bring about 
national accord within the framework of an all-embracing 
process. Thanking all the leaders and parties involved in the 
electoral process, including those who joined it recently, for 
their sense of responsibility and perseverance, the committee 
regrets the decision by some parties to boycott the upcoming 
elections. 
  The committee commended the Transitional Executive Council, 
which took firm measures to involve Bophuthatswana in the 
electoral process. 
  The committee welcomed the meeting held recently between ANC 
Chairman Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi and urged both leaders to continue the 
course of dialogue and cooperation, not just between themselves, 
but also with all the other political figures to end the 
devastating wave of violence and to pave the way for elections 
in a secure and peaceful atmosphere to build a new, democratic 
South Africa. 
  The committee categorically rejected and candidly condemned 
recent threats and acts of violence by those who deliberately 
wish to wear down the people and prevent the majority of South 
Africans from exercising their lawful right to choose their 
leaders and turn the page on the tragic chapters of the past for 
the first time. It appealed to the patriotic spirit of party 
leaders boycotting the elections and threatening to obstruct and 
dismantle the electoral process to reconsider their position and 
refrain from depriving their people of the right to partake of 
the biggest and most serious change in the history of South 
Africa. It also appealed to them to do their utmost to 
guarantee freedom of political activity all over the country and 
to hold the elections in a safe, peaceful atmosphere. 
  In this context, the committee expressed its deep concern 
over recent statements by kwaZulu leaders, statements that seek 
to destroy the country's unity. The OAU had rejected all 
attempts to partition the country, since they dramatically 
threaten peace and stability in the southern part of the 
continent and the entire region, and viewed these attempts as 
absolutely unacceptable. 
  The committee invited the South African Government and all 
political leaders in South Africa to take the necessary measures 
to protect and guarantee South African territorial integrity. 
The OAU called on the international community to maintain its 
support for the democratic process in South Africa and to reject 
any attempt to divide the country. 
  The committee reiterated its firm support for the democratic 
process in and the unity of South Africa, the process that 
serves and protects the greater interests of those living in the 
country, regardless of ethnic, cultural, or religious 
considerations. The committee is eager to see a new, democratic 
South Africa join the OAU house to enhance the organization and 
play its natural role in the greater international community. 
  It welcomed the participation of the international 
community, 
including the United Nations, the European Union, and the 
British Commonwealth, in monitoring the elections. It urged all 
South African parties to cooperate fully with the international 
observers in their mission. In this context, the committee 
expressed its appreciation of the OAU member states that pledged 
to send observers to monitor the elections and urged those that

<F P=106> [Report by Dirk Van Eeden] </F>
  [Text] General Basie Smit, the SAP's [South African Police] 
second in command and alleged commander of the "Third Force", 
yesterday denied any involvement in criminal activity and said 
he was outraged at being put on mandatory leave by President 
F.W. de Klerk. "In all my years as a detective, even while 
working in the drug squad, I have never treated anybody in this 
manner, not even a prostitute," he said. 
  Flanked by two legal representatives at his Pretoria home 
yesterday, General Smit said he had a good idea of the identity 
of the mysterious Mr Q, the key witness who gave evidence to the 
Goldstone commission against three top generals. 
  The generals were waiting for a senior advocate to come back 
to them before taking legal action. 
  General Smit, one of a number of officers suspended 
yesterday, denied claims before the Goldstone commission that he 
had overseen the manufacture and distribution of weapons to 
Inkatha. "Not in a million years would it be possible, 
practical or true that I would get involved in deliberately 
destabilising my country. It is utter nonsense," he said. "I 
am not a man who deals in allegations. I deal in facts. The 
Goldstone report refers to `information', but `information' is 
not proof. No court will convict a man on the strength of 
`information'". 
  This is exactly what is upsetting him: he was put on 
mandatory leave and a shadow was cast over his career, without 
him being able to respond to the allegations made against him. 
He went through his copy of the report paragraph by paragraph. 
Notes in the margins say: "Nonsense", "no proof", "hearsay 
allegations". 
  The only allegation put to him when he and generals Johan le 
Roux and Krappies Englebrecht went to see the Goldstone 
commission on Wednesday was that he had been involved in 
smuggling guns to the IFP. He went to the commission without 
legal representation and answered all question openly. "It was 
only later that I learned from General Englebrecht that I was 
also accused of manufacturing weapons and training IFP members 
in the handling of guns," he said. "Until this day, I am not 
sure of the commands I was supposed to have given or what 
exactly I am accused of." 
  General Smit also denied he had been involved in giving 
golden handshakes to former members of the notorious Vlakplaas 
unit to buy their silence. Retirement packages were a political 
decision, and he had offered to provide the commission with a 
memorandum to prove his innocence. The document was written by 
General le Roux and General Engelbrecht, and approved by the 
commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, and the 
minister. 
  General Smit was shocked to learn of the drastic measures Mr 
de Klerk had taken against him, and the reference that the 
generals would have been arrested if proof could be found was 
difficult to swallow for a policeman who had been in the force 
for almost 40 years. 
  General Smit did not think the president would be influenced 
to such a degree by a mere "skenderstorie" (gossip). 
  General le Roux said in an interview at his office yesterday 
he was completely astonished by the report. When he spoke to 
the commission, no allegations were made to him and he had 
answered all questions openly. An allegation that he had 
ordered the killing of a certain Maponya had been dealt with at 
a judicial inquest and by the Harms commission, without any 
incriminating evidence being found against him.

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Excerpt] A series of inconclusive inquiries into political 
violence overseen by Major-General Krappies Engelbrecht will 
come under fresh scrutiny in the next fortnight by a team of 
international investigators appointed by the President F.W. de 
Klerk. The Goldstone commission, which named General 
Engelbrecht as one of three top generals implicated in "Third 
Force" activity, has a mass of new information to put before the 
investigators. This information is expected to throw the 
spotlight on the remarkable record of failure by the SA [South 
African] Police [SAP] to resolve a series of cased of serious 
political violence. 
  As head of SAP's counter-intelligence department, General 
Engelbrecht is in charge of all investigations dealing with 
violence and subversion -- including train, taxi and hostel 
massacres. Before that, he was involved in two major 
investigations into security force involvement in hit squad 
activities. 
  The sequence begins with the allegations of convicted 
murderer Almond Nofomela in 1989 that he and another police 
officer based at Vlakplaas, Dirk Coetzee, had murdered 
anti-apartheid figures. General Engelbrecht was requested to 
assist the McNally commission of inquiry into the allegations. 
Tim McNally later led evidence before the Harms commission, 
which found there was no proof of a state-sanctioned police hit 
squad at Vlakplaas. 
  Then General Engelbrecht was appointed by former Law and 
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to assist in an investigation of the 
SA Defence Force after claims that the CCB [Civil Cooperation 
Bureau], a covert military organisation, was involved in 
murdering political opponents of the government. He paid 
particular attention to the assassination of Wits academic David 
Webster, allegedly by a CCB hit squad. At the Webster inquest, 
retired police general Jaap Jourbert said General Engelbrecht 
had sent a message to detained murder suspect Ferdi Barnard that 
he should not speak for six or seven months about CCB 
activities. A week before his evidence, the investigating 
officer, Warrant Officer Wessel Rousseau, had told the Rand 
Supreme Court General Engelbrecht had warned two other CCB 
operatives not to talk. They were Calla Botha and Slang van 
Zyl. The inquest court could not make a conclusive finding. The 
Harms commission later found the CCB was not responsible for the 
murder of Dr Webster. 
  General Engelbrecht is one of three generals placed on 
compulsory leave on Friday by Mr de Klerk for allegedly being 
involved in providing arms to Inkatha for hit-squad activities, 
illegally manufacturing weapons, issuing false documents and 
passports, fomenting violence and attempting cover-ups when the 
Goldstone commission began its work. 
  The evidence provided by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone on 
Friday, described as prima facie of criminal action, is only a 
part of the allegations of illegal activities that will be 
provided to a special task team of international policemen. 
Evidence received by the Goldstone commission, but not yet 
disclosed, includes allegations of car theft and corruption in a 
rewards scheme for AK-47 assault rifles and other criminal acts 
by policemen. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Claire Roberston] </F>
  [Text] A Goldstone commission sub-committee has singled out 
South Africa's top policeman, General Johan van der Merwe, for 
scathing criticism. The Wallis sub-committee, set up in 1992 to 
investigate the causes of violence in Natal, charges General van 
der Merwe with having twice blocked bold initiatives by his 
senior officers to root out alleged SAP [South African Police] 
misconduct in Natal in the past. 
  The general yesterday dismissed the charge as "naive and 
stupid". 
  During sittings in Natal, the sub-committee under Mr M.J.D. 
Wallis, SC, was inundated with allegations that police had 
delayed investigations and that members of the force had 
perpetrated acts of violence. Faced with a mountain of unsolved 
cases, many of which had never been processed properly, the 
sub-committee, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC [African 
National Congress] agreed to identify a workable number of 
solvable cases in the Port Shapestone area. All parties would 
cooperate in bringing these cases to trial as a "very small 
first step in restoring community trust in the police force", 
they agreed in February last year. Local police accepted the 
plan, but approval from headquarters has still not been obtained 
more than a year later. General van der Merwe had ignored 
approaches by the Goldstone Commission, the report said. 
  Yesterday the general said he was not aware of the request. 
  In May last year, General van der Merwe assured the 
committee 
of his "sincere desire" to improve relations between the police 
and the community. Three months later, he blocked a bold plan 
to root out police misconduct in the Natal Midlands hours before 
it was to be placed before the committee. The entire Natal SAP 
hierarchy had approved the establishment of a police 
investigation unit to investigate allegations of police 
misconduct in the Natal Midlands. At the time, General van der 
Merwe said he did not object to the proposal in principle, but 
would not sanction the unit because a Security Forces Board of 
Inquiry Act existed to deal with such matters. 
  The Wallis report rejected this response as inadequate, 
saying the board -- yet to be constituted -- would not have the 
powers to investigate many complaints. 
  Yesterday General van der Merwe said he had discussed the 
matter with Judge Richard Goldstone at the time "and he 
supported me". He rejected allegations that he had blocked the 
Natal initiatives.

  [Excerpts] A Goldstone Commission report has linked three 
senior officers of the South African Police and Inkatha Freedom 
Party officials to organized violence in the country. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin De Klerk recording, in English] It is indeed a very 
serious matter when some of the top management of a police force 
are implicated in deeds which obviously militate against the 
interests of the country, which are in direct contrast to what 
should take place. Therefore, I regard this report as--if the 
facts finally are proved to be fully correct -- as shocking. 
And resulting from that, I believe that very, very strong steps 
would then be needed. However, as you would have noted the 
report itself emphasizes the fact that nobody can be regarded as 
guilty, but that it does present strong prima facie evidence. 
  As is customary under such circumstances, the government is 
called upon to take some immediate steps, firstly, in order to 
ensure that further investigations will not be hampered in any 
way and the first recommendation of the report also suggests 
that such steps should be taken. As a first step, I would like 
to announce that all those implicated in the findings of the 
commission, implicated in any unlawful act or aiding or abetting 
any unlawful act, or being involved in the whole plot and the 
activities described by the report, are immediately put on leave. 
  We haven't had time to fully analyze the situation and to 
distinguish whether in some instances further immediate 
disciplinary action, going further than that, is justified. 
There are various options that one can look at. The government 
feels that the best option at this time, and this we will be 
discussing with the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], would 
be to immediately appoint a high-level international police 
investigation team, to simultaneously ask one of the attorney 
generals to work very closely with such a team, and to ask the 
TEC to nominate an expert, a jurist, to also together with the 
attorney general, work very closely with this investigation 
team. They will obviously have the support, inasmuch as they 
require it, of the South African Police. 
  This is the first time where we have evidence through the 
Goldstone Commission, and the Goldstone Commission was inter 
alia created to deal with these allegations about a third force 
-- this is the first time that such prima facie evidence is laid 
before us, and I am now keeping my promise and that is to take 
immediate action. I would also like to highlight the fact that 
the report itself emphasizes that we have....[pauses] We are 
dealing here with the possibility of a relatively small group of 
people, and any conclusion that this means that the South 
African Police force, as a force, is involved in political 
violence would be more than grossly unfair. [end recording] 
  The kwaZulu Police commissioner, Lieutenant General Roy 
During, this afternoon denied that his police force received any 
weapons from General Smit, who has now been placed on compulsory 
leave. 
  [Begin recording] [During, in English] No, I'm afraid not. 
We have spare arms. I'm sure we could use them in kwaZulu, but 
there is most certainly no contact between myself and Basie Smit 
with regard to arms or arms deals at all. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Doesn't kwaZulu basically get 
their arms from South Africa? They work with the South African 
Police, don't they? 
  [During] Well, I'm afraid I'm not going to give away our 
secrets -- where we get our arms from -- but we have our 
suppliers in South Africa, yes. [end recording]

  [Text] Revelations of police involvement in violence and 
weapons supply have met with a denial from kwaZulu chief 
minister, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, on the one hand, while on 
the other the ANC [African National Congress] is convinced that 
this confirms the existence of the so-called third force. The 
revelations came to light at a joint news conference by State 
President F.W. de Klerk and Mr. Justice Richard Goldstone 
yesterday. 
  Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi denied that any members 
of 
his organization were involved in weapons supply. 
  [Begin Buthelezi recording] I am completely unaware that he 
supplied guns to any person, including any member of the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party]. I am just as surprised as anyone else 
about the allegations because I'm not aware which member of the 
IFP he was supplying with guns. [end recording] 
  The 36-page report released to the media yesterday contained 
allegations involving top police officials including deputy 
police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Basie Smit, CID 
[Criminal Investigations Department] Chief Johan le Roux, and 
the head of the police counterintelligence division, Major 
General Krappies Engelbrecht. They and other police officers 
named in the report have been placed on compulsory leave.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in 
the Transvaal, Mr. Hennie Bekker, says the timing of the 
publication of the Goldstone Commission's report has to be 
seriously questioned. Mr. Bekker said in a radio program this 
morning that one could also ask whether the report would have 
seen the light if the IFP was going to participate in the 
election. On the alleged involvement of a prominent Transvaal 
IFP leader, Mr. Thembo Khoza, Mr. Bekker said the IFP believes 
in the legal principle that one is innocent until proven 
otherwise.

  [Text] East London March 19 SAPA -- Policemen involved in 
gun- running and instigating violence should be punished, but it 
was the system itself that had to change, African Nationl 
Congress [ANC] national chairman Thabo Mbeki said on Saturday 
[19 March]. Speaking to about 200 people at an ANC meeting in 
the coloured area of Pefferville, he said the latest Goldstone 
report had made disclosures about the role of various police 
officers in killing people. 
  He was sure that those involved in bringing weapons into the 
country and deliberately sending out groups to attack people on 
trains and at bus stops were bad people. "But I think the reason 
they were able to act like that is because they were products, 
they were representatives of a bad system. 
  "It is the system that we must change. The culprits no doubt 
must be punished, but the system has to change." 
  The ANC wanted a new government not because it wanted new 
faces, but because it wanted a new relationship between 
government and the people. It was important that this new 
government be responsive to what people were saying "and that's 
not what we've experienced in the last 40 years".

  [Text] King William's Town March 20 SAPA -- The ANC 
[African National Congress] would ensure that those guilty of 
fomenting violence were brought to book no matter what political 
positions they held, the organisation's national chairman, Mr 
Thabo Mbeki, said on Sunday [20 March]. Speaking at an ANC 
rally in King William's Town, he said the most recent Goldstone 
report had identified senior police officers as having been 
involved in the campaign of violence and death that had taken 
place in South Africa for many years. 
  "I am certain that the ANC is going to pursue this matter no 
matter how high it reaches," he said. 
  "It doesn't matter how high people are, it does not matter 
how big their titles, it doesn't matter where they are within 
the politics of South Africa. 
  "The terrorists must be punished." 
  This was a responsibility the organisation owed both to the 
democratic process and to its people throughout the country. It 
was a precondition to free and fair elections. 
  Mr Mbeki also said the commission's report gave the lie to 
the belief that what had been happening in South Africa was 
black-on-black violence. "What is Goldstone saying? It's not 
black-on-black violence. It's people who are opposed to change, 
people who like apartheid, people who want to maintain apartheid 
(who were responsible). 
  "It was the violence of the apartheid system against our 
people. It was a violence carried out over many decades to 
ensure that our oppression continued."

  [Text] Cape Town March 20 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela will not make any firm comments 
on Judge Goldstone's allegations of a police "third force" 
operation until an international investigation has been 
completed. He told journalists at the Green Point sports 
stadium on Sunday [20 March] that he believed Mr Justice 
Goldstone had produced prima face evidence of a very serious 
nature. "Close to 20,000 people have been killed and a 
comparatively small number of people have been arrested and very 
few convicted. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that this 
prima face evidence forms the basis of an investigation by an 
international team. Until then I will not make any firm 
statement," he said. "We are investigating here the crimes 
committed by experts who know how to cover up," he said. 
"International experts with equal ability to uncover these 
crimes are needed to investigate the allegations. It is a pity 
(State) President de Klerk has been so dismissive of the 
findings of a judge of the appeal court, which has shown that we 
were right in calling for an international investigation." 
  Mr Mandela started a one day rally tour of the Cape 
Peninsula 
by addressing children at a Lions Club of Camps Bay children's 
day at the stadium.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 20 SAPA -- The South African 
Police Union [SAPU] on Sunday [20 March] called on the 
government and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] to give 
public guarantees for the job security of policemen in a new 
dispensation. The police union also urged that no witch-hunt be 
undertaken against any policemen for past deeds. 
  The TEC should also urgently investigate indemnity for those 
policemen, who formed part of the covert structures of the past, 
SAPU said. 
  SAPU said drastic measures such as the forced leave of 
police 
generals allegedly involved in gun running, uncovered by the 
Goldstone Commission, was demoralising the police force. 
  SAPU said the possibility of policemen bill of rights should 
be urgently investigation in consultation with the police union.

  [Text] Cape Town March 21 SAPA -- State President F W de 
Klerk had lost a lot of white support and was doing something 
dramatic to gain black support, police public relations head 
Maj-Gen Leon Mellet said on Monday [21 March]. 
  He was commenting on a report released by the Goldstone 
Commission implicating South African Police officers, including 
three generals, of being involved in "third force" activities. 
"The way it was made public came as a shock to all of us," Gen 
Mellet said at his farewell function in Cape Town. He is 
retiring. 
  Gen mellet said he disputed the implications. "The whole 
thing is worrying. It's unsettling, because it was done 
unfairly. I am upset about the way it was made public." 
  He said he felt the perception was being created that those 
named in the report were guilty. "They have been found guilty 
before the investigating team has arrived in South Africa." He 
went on: "Do you really think a general would start a third 
force? Whatever the finding about those involved in the 
so-called third force, let it be known very soon with the same 
haste in which the allegations were made public." 
  Gen Mellet said he was asking only for fairness and the 
truth. "Be reasonable and be fair. Don't be overhasty in 
crucifying these men. If they broke the law, it's a different 
story." 
  Gen Mellet called for public support for the police, adding 
that pressure on the force was bound to increase in the run-up 
to the elections. 
  Police would be out in force at polling booths. "We also 
have 5,000 reservists to call up and slightly more than 3,000 
retired policemen." 
  He accused Bophuthatswana policemen of plundering during the 
uprising in the homeland. They had smashed automatic teller 
machines to get at their contents, he said. "Those police will 
be our colleagues in the next couple of weeks. If that is an 
example, then the SAP do not wish to be part of that force."

  [Text] The leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand 
Viljoen, says he's been assured by the leader of the ANC 
[African National Congress], Mr. Nelson Mandela, that an 
Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] is a reality. General Viljoen 
told the Pretoria Press Club that his party wanted to complete 
all the details for an Afrikaner volkstaat before the election 
and to define the self- determination aspect of the Afrikaner as 
soon as possible. However, he said that proof of support for a 
volkstaat was of cardinal importance and could only be done by 
voting in next month's election. According to General Viljoen, 
the establishment of a volkstaat cannot be stopped if there are 
more than a million votes in its favor. However, it would be up 
to the constitutional court to decide whether there was 
sufficient support.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 19 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] on Saturday adopted a 
constitution for implementation in a planned but as yet 
unidentified "volkstaat" [homeland], AVF leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg said. The constitution provides for a republic and 
citizenship for "members of the volk" [people]. 
  Non-citizens' rights would be afforded protection by the law 
between nations (volkereg). There would be a bill of rights and 
responsibilities for citizens and non-citizens. 
  The AVF said it would release next week the results of a 
survey it had conducted among landowners on inclusion in the 
volkstaat as well its claims on land it wanted included in its 
republic. 
  The AVF said it would support any lawful claim on territory 
and that it would respect the wishes of landowners who wanted 
their land to be under "volkstaat" jurisdiction. It said it 
would back its land claims with all means at its disposal. 
  The AVF said its republic would be Christian and would have 
English and Afrikaans as official languages. It would be 
governed by an assembly elected directly by constituencies at 
five-year intervals. There would be a state president and an 
executive council. 
  The assembly would ratify the constitution by a two-thirds 
majority while a 51 per cent majority could force a referendum. 
  Representatives who acted contrary to their mandates could 
be 
disqualified. The "volkstaat" economy would be run on free 
market principles. 
  More details of the constitution would be released soon, Dr 
Hartzenberg said.

  [Text] Vryheid March 19 SAPA -- The government has rejected 
the idea of a sovereign Zulu Kingdom, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported on Saturday [19 
March]. Speaking in Vryheid, Constitutional Development Minister 
Roelf Meyer said there had to be a role for the Zulu king and 
his kingdom in a new dispensation, but not specifically as a 
monarchy. 
  Mr Meyer said the new constitution provided for 
Natal/kwaZulu 
to govern itself but warned that the government would not 
tolerate intimidation against voting in kwaZulu/Natal.

  [Text] KwaZulu spokesman Thembinkosi Mmemelo says Friday's 
[18 March] proclamation by the Zulu king on the sovereignty of 
kwaZulu was not a unilateral declaration of independence. Mr. 
Mmelelo said what King Goodwill Zwelithini had proclaimed was 
the right of the kingdom of kwaZulu to freely determine its 
relationship with the rest of South Africa. 
  He said King Goodwill had demanded that the kingdom be 
recognized as it had existed in 1934. This area included 
kwaZulu, Natal, and parts of the eastern Transvaal, and had 
extended south to the Umzimvubu River. 
  The king would probably decide within the next few days on 
whether kwaZulu would have federal or international relations 
with South Africa. If he chose the latter, it would mean that 
the kingdom would become an independent state.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 19 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] central committee said on Saturday [19 March] it 
rejected President F W de Klerk's suggestion that it take part 
in provincial elections in Natal/kwaZulu. It also rejected a 
suggestion that IFP members be included in the candidate lists 
of the National Party. 
  The central committee said in Ulundi the IFP stood by the 
constitutional demands it made in December, 1993 and that it 
would not enter the elections until its bottom-line 
constitutional demands were met. 
  The IFP also decided to establish a national action 
committee 
to devise programmes to give people constructive ways of 
opposing the interim constitution.

<F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>
  [Text] East London March 19 SAPA -- Any dismemberment of 
South Africa, such as the establishment of a Zulu kingdom, would 
have to be decided by the people of South Africa as a whole, 
African National Congress [ANC] National Chairman Thabo Mbeki 
said on Saturday [19 March]. Speaking at an ANC fundraising 
dinner in East London, he also said neither he nor ANC President 
Nelson Mandela had accepted an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. 
  He said the ANC had been looking forward to the meeting 
which 
was to have been held with the Zulu king this week but was 
cancelled. "As of now we have never received any proposal from 
the Zulu king as to what he wants so we don't know what he wants 
apart from what was reported in the newspapers. We would like 
to engage the king to hear what he wants and to see in what 
manner whatever concerns he expresses can be addressed." 
  Clearly, in legal, political and constitutional terms, and 
in 
ordinary reality there was no such thing as an independent 
kwaZulu/Natal. The question of the secession of any part of 
South Africa could not be decided on except through democratic 
processes. "Any matter that has to do with dismemberment of 
South Africa in any way is a matter that would have to be 
decided by the people of South Africa as a whole." 
  He said the ANC had not agreed to a volkstaat. What it had 
agreed was to continue discussions with what was now called the 
Freedom Front on the idea of a volkstaat. "To continue the 
discussions and possibly conclude them before the elections, 
we've agreed to that." 
  A document agreed to by the ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Union] in September last year stipulated 
that any solution to the volkstaat question would have to be 
consistent with the principles of democracy and non-racialism. 
The two sides had agreed that any further discussion on the 
issue should be guided by these principles. "So the proponents 
of a volkstaat have an obligation to make proposals about a 
(territory) that would be democratic, non-racial, 
anti-apartheid, resulting in peace, absence of conflict and so 
on. If a volkstaat consistent with these principles can be 
proposed, I don't think the ANC will have a problem with it." 
However no such proposal had been made. "So there is no 
volkstaat to be accepted by Nelson Mandela or myself."

  [Text] Bethlehem March 20 SAPA -- A Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] government would expropriate all land without 
compensation, PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence 
Makwetu told about 1,000 supporters in Bethlehem's Bohlokong 
township on Sunday [20 March]. Speaking at the end of a 
three-day election swing through the [Orange] Free State, he 
said the land would be restored to the people or held in trust 
by the state."All people have equal claim to the land," he said. 
  Mr Makwetu told the crowd fears that the PAC's land policy 
spelt economic disaster were unfounded. While no land would be 
for sale between individuals, land allocated to citizens would, 
for surety purposes, carry leasehold title with the same force 
and effect as freehold titles. 
  The PAC president said farmers could continue farming, but 
only on land sufficient for their purposes. The rest would be 
claimed by the state and allocated to other citizens. 
  A vote for any party except the PAC was a vote for disaster 
as other parties promised houses but not land, Mr Makwetu 
said."A vote for them is a vote for a constitution which will 
never give you freedom or justice, and will perpetuate your 
enslavement and misery while entrenching the privileges the 
minority continue to enjoy at your expense." 
  Mr Makwetu said the PAC promised an end to violence and 
repression and would deal efffectively with poverty and the lack 
of houses and jobs. 
  Recent events in Bophuthatswana should be a lesson for those 
still refusing to allow free political activity in any part of 
South Africa, Mr Makwetu said. "It is that there is no amount of 
force which will ever silence the will of the people to be free."

  [Text] Virginia March 20 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] would give priority to its supporters when it 
provides jobs after the April election, the ANC Women's League 
president, Winnie Mandela, said on Sunday [20 March]. "We will 
prioritise for our comrades. We are going to provide employment 
for all of you, starting with the comrades who served in prison 
for our cause." 
  Speaking to several thousand supporters from Meloding 
township outside Virginia and neighbouring Mandela Park sqautter 
camp, Mrs Mandela laid heavy emphasis on the ANC's aim to 
provide houses. "I cannot believe the shacks I saw," she said, 
launching a fierce attack on National Party housing policies and 
its migrant labour system. 
  "It is these inhuman practices that compel us to remove the 
De Klerk fascist regime." 
  Mrs Mandela said the ANC would build decent houses for 
everybody. A better life was planned for all South Africans, 
with priority for the victims of apartheid. 
  "We will provide you with jobs and education facilities, put 
people back to work to create a growing economy, and will 
provide services, health and education," she said. 
  Mrs Mandela said the lack of housing and services had 
reached 
crisis proportions, adding that the ANC's main aim was to focus 
on the 7.5-million squatters and their filthy townships. 
  As at her people's forum meeting in Bloemfontein on 
Saturday, 
Mrs Mandela allowed only five questions from the crowd.

  [Text] The South African Police have arrested 2 more 
suspects on attempted murder charges after part of an 
investigation into German links with South African right-wing 
radicals. 
  One of the two Germans arrested at a smallholding near 
Pretoria is also linked to sabotage activities in Namibia. They 
were found to be in possession of firearms. The arrest follows 
a shootout between two police constables and three German 
nationals east of Pretoria last week. One German was shot dead 
during the encounter and one arrested. Another escaped. 
Several firearms, including a Scorpion machine pistol, was 
found in their car. This led to an investigation into their 
presence in South Africa and their contact with right-wing 
figures in Pretoria. 
  A report also alluded to preeminent South African 
politicians 
having been identified for assassination.

  [Text] There has been an ugly turn of events in 
Bophuthatswana. A former member of parliament and his brother, a 
government official, have been necklaced. 
  The two were murdered by a mob in Mshana near Mmabatho. Eye 
witnesses say the crowd was made up of ANC [African National 
Congress] supporters. Tutu Msomi has the story. 
  [Begin recording] [Msomi] Mr. Johannes Kadi, a member of 
parliament, and his brother, Mr. Petrus Kadi, were necklaced in 
front of this house. The MP's house and shops were burned down. 
Lilian, Mr. Kadi's daughter who witnessed the attack, had a 
narrow escape. She said more than 1,000 people -- some she 
knew -- invaded the house yesterday in the afternoon. 
  [Lilian] There was a meeting between the ANC and the people 
of the village. After the meeting a lot of people came here. 
They were throwing stones at the house, then we went into the 
house. They were burning the house, then we ran away from the 
house as the house was burning. Then they took my father out, 
then they came here. 
  [Msomi] Lilian said they reported the matter to the police 
and no arrests had been made. But Chief Edward Lemeco, an ANC 
member, denied that he had a meeting with ANC supporters. 
  [Lemeco] We discussed our post office that was taken here by 
the president and Mr. Kadi. The community wanted to go and take 
the post [as heard] back by force, and I told them that that 
cannot be allowed. 
  [Msomi] We tried unsuccessfully to get Mr. Lucas Mangope's 
comment on this matter. We were told he was asleep and could 
not be disturbed. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  DP, NP Unable To Penetrate Black Electorate Market -- Paul 
Pereira, who is public affairs manager of the South African 
Institute of Race Relations, writes in an article in the 
"Election Watchdog" column on page 12 of Johannesburg THE STAR 
in English on 21 March, that "the chances of the traditionally 
white National and Democratic parties penetrating the black 
electoral market in any substantial way seem slim." The 
Democratic Party's (DP) attempts this week to hold public 
meetings on western Cape tertiary campuses "were disrupted by 
ANC [African National Congress] supporters, echoing the 
disruptions last year of DP meetings in Khayelitsha and 
Gugulethu as well as the more recent disruptions of NP [National 
Party] road shows." "Natal, in which Africans constitute 81 
percent of the population (including kwaZulu) is another area 
where the traditionally white parties have to contend with 
`no-go' areas." "Amidst all the attention being focused on 
events in Bophuthatswana, East Rand violence, and constitutional 
negotiations, we could lose sight of the predicaments of the 
Democratic and National parties. These two traditionally white 
parties are, in some of South Africa's most populous areas, 
being denied a hearing." 
  Only `Reasonably' Free, Fair Election Expected -- In the 
"One 
in Your Eye" column on the same page, Kaizer Nyatsumba, asks: 
"Will the election be free and fair? I don't think so. Given 
the very high degree of political intolerance in our society, it 
is impossible that we can have a free and fair election. 
Instead, we should now hope for a reasonably free 
and fair election -- and we would be lucky to have even that. 
But, realistically, that is what is within the realm of 
possibility at the moment. Although ANC members have been the 
guiltiest, not many parties have clean hands in this regard." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  De Klerk `Dereliction of Duty' in Third Force Claims -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 21 March in a page-14 
editorial says ANC President Nelson Mandela and his colleagues 
"accuse De Klerk of personal and direct responsibility for the 
deaths of black people" by an alleged "third force". However, 
BUSINESS DAY disagrees, saying "De Klerk's refusal over the 
years to give sufficient attention to the possible existence of 
a third force does not add up to that kind of culpability." 
However, the De Klerk government appears guilty of "a gross 
dereliction of duty." Despite the available evidence "it failed 
to recognise the potential dangers posed by its secret police 
force which, after all, was trained to see opponents of 
apartheid as enemies to be fought ruthlessly." De Klerk has 
also "ignored numerous calls" for the replacement of General 
Johan van der Merwe as commissioner of police "because of doubts 
about his commitment to the political process. The President 
has put in political charge of the police force first Adriaan 
Vlok and then Hernus Kriel -- two hawks unwilling to attempt to 
seek out the rote which now threatens the creadibilit of the 
entire force." 
  ANC's `Selective Conscience' on Controls, Discipline -- A 
second editorial on the same page finds its "encouraging" that 
the ANC "is taking such a tough stance on financial discipline. 
The party has joined in the lambasting of self-governing 
territories for overspending and is pushing for a fiscal control 
mechanism that will apply to central government too." ANC 
deputy head of economics, Tito Mboweni, "wants to make sure `the 
family silver is still there when the new administration takes 
over'." "Let us hope the family silver is treated with the same 
respect once the new administration has taken over," remarks 
BUSINESS DAY. "The ANC has already shown that it has a 
selective conscience on controls and discipline. It had no 
qualms in asking that import duties on election materials be 
waived, and to use finrands to buy a building. Those playing 
watchdog now should be watched in future with equal vigilance." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Enough Evidence of `Third Force' -- "The Goldstone 
Commission 
has uncovered massive SAP [South African Police] and kwaZulu 
police involvement in the arming and training of large numbers 
of men on the Reef and Natal," states a page-8 editorial in 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 21 March. "Even State 
President F.W. de Klerk admitted that there was enough evidence 
of a Third Force being instrumental in the taking of thousands 
of lives during the past four years. It is fortunate that these 
revelations come a few weeks before the elections. Heads must 
roll and De Klerk's previous timid attempts to clean the deadly 
mess must be given teeth."

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] has accepted government posts offered by the 
Angolan Government in the future government. An African 
diplomat who has been following the development of peace talks 
in Lusaka closely revealed that the Angolan Government offered 
UNITA the ministerial posts of health, tourism, commerce, and 
construction materials. 
  UNITA had initially expressed desire to hold the ministries 
of defense, interior, and finance. The source also revealed 
that UNITA wanted to exchange the Construction Materials 
Ministry for the Public Works Ministry. 
  The Angolan Government also offered UNITA the provincal 
governments of Cuando Cubango, Uige, and Lunda Sul.

  [Excerpts] President Ange Felix Patasse returned to Bangui 
this afternoon after taking part in the 29th summit of heads of 
state of the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa 
[UDEAC], held from 15 to 16 March in Ndjamena, Chad. Several 
personalities, in particular Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba, 
the speaker of the National Assembly, members of the government 
and the presidential staff went to welcome him at Bangui 
airport. [passage omitted] 
  Soon after his arrival at the Palais de la Renaissance, the 
president reviewed the Ndjamena summit. He recalled the signing 
of the treaty and agreements establishing the Economic and 
Monetary Community of Central African States [CEMAC], the 
Monetary Union of Central Africa, and the Economic Union of 
Central Africa. The quality of discussions held by the UDEAC 
heads of state was very much appreciated. In fact, they did not 
merely content themselves with approving the reports drawn up by 
experts and ministers. On the contrary, they carried out a 
detailed examination of the documents submitted to them. The 
issues discussed at the summit consisted of economic and 
regional integration, the situation of the Bank of Central 
African States, and a report on the opening up of the region, 
presented by the Central African Republic. 
  President Ange Felix Patasse also appealed for 
reconciliation 
between the Chadian Government and Moise Kette's movement 
operating in southern Chad, the National Awakening Committee for 
Peace and Democracy. Alain-George Ngatoua has given us a full 
report on President Patasse's Ndjamena trip: 
  [Begin Patasse recording] I would like to tell you how happy 
I feel to be among you this 17 March, for, within days, we will 
be marking the anniversary of the tragic death of President 
Barthelemy Boganda. In Ndjamena, we contributed much to the 
success of the UDEAC summit. We have remained faithful to its 
spirit and I am happy to announce that at long last Central 
Africa is coming out of its deep slumber. We have understood 
that our destinies are linked together. Central Africa is 
lagging far behind the others because of national chauvinism. 
At the same time that we held our summit in Ndjamena, West 
Africa was also holding its summit. While all the West African 
heads of state were present at their summit, some leaders in our 
subregion were absent. You will understand the anguish we felt 
some time ago. So if we left Bangui for Ndjamena, it was not 
simply to accept the UDEAC secretary general's report, but 
because we wanted to breathe new life into this institution by 
taking a decisive step. 
  It was a choice between continuing to tread the same 
well-trodden paths or to carry out a radical restructuring. We 
opted for the latter solution. Yes, Central Africa is coming 
out of its long sleep and those who want to remain within this 
general dymamic awakening movement will do so, but those who do 
not want to do so -- and it is a question of state sovereignty 
-- are free not to go along with the others. 
  As far as we are concerned, we have stated that the treaty 
establishing the economic and monetary community in Central 
Africa must be signed at all costs. We have also said that it 
was not obligatory to sign the treaty on the same day and at the 
same place. Each country can do so within the framework of its 
peculiar institutions. On this score, the host country 
submitted the draft treaty for signature. Chad, Congo, and the 
Central African Republic have signed the treaty. The president 
of Equatorial Guinea could not be present at Ndjamena and 
delegated this responsiblity to his deputy prime minister, so 
Equatorial Guinea has also signed. Cameroon sent only the 
president of its Economic and Social Council, who did not even 
have a mandate to initial the document. However, since the 
current chairmanship of the UDEAC has fallen to Cameroon, the 
ball is in that country's court. We have decided to walk hand 
in hand, and that is the determining factor. The community has 
been born. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report summarizing allegations contained in the Goldstone </F>
Commission report on police involvement illegal weapons 
distribution and other activities by correspondents John Perlman 
and Bronwyn Littleton] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Allegations </H5>
  These include gun-running to men involved in hit squads, the 
illegal manufacture of weapons, the issuing of false documents 
and passports and the orchestration of violence to destabilise 
the country. 
  According to a written memorandum from "Q" [former South 
African Police officer who supplied information to the Goldstone 
Commission] generals Basie Smit and Krappies Engelbrecht, 
supported by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members Themba Khoza 
and Victor Ndlovu, initiated the gun-manufacturing project for 
the purpose of orchestrating violence. 
  Until about 18 months ago, the unit was involved in the 
manufacture of homemade weapons on the East Rand and in 
Silverton. Warrant-Officer Snor Vermeulen, Warrant-Officer 
Lionel Snyman and Warrant-Officer Dawid Britz -- all members of 
C10 -- directed this operation. Other weapons from Koevoet 
[former South-West Africa counterinsurgency unit] supplies had 
been transported to Vlakplaas and later to Murrayhill (Mechem). 
The weapons were cleaned in acid and their serial numbers 
removed. The weapons were then placed in black bags and 
distributed to IFP members. Later, weapons were also received 
from Mozambique. When the unit's arms supply ran low, they 
bought weapons from Brooklyn Circle Arms. Five former 
operatives of Vlakplaas testified to the following. 
  A large quantity of weapons from Koevoet was transported to 
Vlakplaas in the late 1980s, including AK-47s, mortars, RPG-7 
rockets and hand grenades. Many of these weapons were supplied 
to Inkatha. Later the arms were transferred to a nearby farm 
and some were stored at the Speskop military installation. 
  Former Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock had arranged for 
the purchase of firearms from a weapons shop in Pretoria, 
including Glock pistols. The weapons were bought in the name of 
Badger Arms, one of several front companies run by De Kock. 
  The men worked extensively with false documents, including 
passports. When Vlakplaas eventually disbanded, Brigadier 
Beukes and Colonel Cronje, both of SAP [South African Police] 
headquarters in Pretoria, arranged false identity documents and 
passports. 
  This information was tested through the Department of Home 
Affairs and the SAP and found to be true. 
<H5>  The Men Involved </H5>
  According to the main informant, known as "Q", Unit C1 at 
Vlakplaas, later known as C10, under the command of Colonel 
Eugene de Kock, had been involved since 1989 in violence aimed 
at the destabilisation of South Africa, including the 
organisation of hostel and train violence. The operations were 
under the command of Lieutenant-General Baise Smit and 
Major-General Krappies Engelbrecht. Lieutenant-General Johan de 
Roux, head of Crime Combating and Investigation Services, had 
full knowledge of, and was involved in, these activities. Dries 
(Brood) van Heerden, a former Vlakplaas man now a senior 
security official at ABSA [Almagamated Banks of South Africa] 
bank, was involved in distributing the weapons, employing only 
Zulus loyal to the IFP. He was assisted by another ABSA 
official, Douglas Crew. 
  Others involved in the project were Eugene de Kock, Brood 
van 
Heerden, Willie Nortje, Charlie Chate, Chappies Klopper, Snor 
Vermeulen, Lionel Synman and Dawid Britz, all from unit C10, 
Vossie de Kock and Koekies Koekemoer of the East Rand Murder and 
Robbery Unit; Larry Hinton, Laurie Wasserman and Andy Taylor of 
the Durban security police; and the then KwaZulu Police 
Commissioner General Jac Buchner. 
  Evidence was that Engelbrecht had at all times been involved 
in the projects and approved payments from the fund. 
<H5>  The Inkatha Connection </H5>
  IFP Transvaal leader Themba Khoza was recruited by Brood van 
Heerden and Victor Ndlovu later joined them. They distributed 
weapons. Khoza was caught at a roadblock with some of these 
arms on September 4 1990. Unit C10 paid his bail and legal 
fees, Khoza concocted a story about the weapons and was 
acquitted. 
  The project also involved crash courses in weapons and 
grenade training for IFP members. 
  Khoza was issued with a car and he and Victor Ndlovu were 
paid as "informers" using false names. They were also supplied 
with firearms. 
  Some of the arms distributed to the IFP were manufactured by 
Vlakplaas members at Mechem, a subsidiary of Denel. 
  The commission further noted that an investigation into 
KwaZulu Police [KZP], hit squads, made public last December, had 
been blocked by a Brigadier E du Preez "in direct contradiction" 
of a decision made after a meeting with President de Klerk. 
  The commission said there was "convincing evidence" that 
"elements in the KZP have been and are still involved in hit 
squad activities in Natal and also in the Transvaal". An 
officer investigating this said there was evidence "indicating 
the involvement of members of the SAP security police in hit 
squad activities". 
  The commission criticized the deputy-commissioner of the 
KZP, 
Major-General Mathe, whose name "over years (has) been linked 
with improper conduct in the course of his official duties". 
<H5>  The Cover-Ups </H5>
  The commission was told that on Engelbrecht's orders, all 
files and correspondence relating to Inkatha were to be 
destroyed. The commission also received information that 
Engelbrecht had instructed C10 members of dig up information 
compromise Goldstone so that he could be "persuaded" to drop the 
inquiry. 
  Lieutenant-Colonel Botha told the commission that 
Engelbrecht 
had requested a Brigadier Schoeman to report that Englebrecht's 
department was not involved in the matters under investigation. 
  The commission also has information that Smit helped to 
quash 
an investigation of motor theft against Lieutenant Piet Botha, 
one of the directors of Intercol. 
  Two police officers, Colonel Roelf Venter and Major Henning 
Brand, approached Major du Plessis and attempted to find out 
how the Goldstone Commission investigation was proceeding. 
Venter later asked Du Plessis to keep Engelbrecht informed on 
who was giving information to the commission and what the 
National Intelligence Service was passing on. 
  At the suggesting of the Commissioner of Police, General 
Johan van der Merwe, and Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel, 
the allegations were put to generals Smit, Engelbrecht and Le 
Roux and colonels De Kock, Venter and Bellingham. Venter said 
Engelbrecht had put a stop to his investigation into alleged 
arms importation by De Kock. 
<H5>  Guns for Money </H5>
  There was testimony that De Kock himself took some of the 
money he received in payment for the arms. De Kock was paid by 
the IFP for the weapons. Although he left the SAP almost a year 
ago with a R[rand]1.2-million "golden handshake" -- with the 
approval of the Cabinet -- he continued with the project. De 
Kock, Vermeulen, and other operatives Paul van Dyk, Jeff Bosigo, 
Joe Mamesela and Lucas Kalino, left the SAP with huge payouts to 
keep them quiet. The Askaris [former African National Congress 
guerrillas working for police] were paid between R200,000 and 
R600,000 each. 
  The commission was supplied with information about two front 
companies, Eastech and Intercol, set up by De Kock was in excess 
of R1 million and was approved by the Cabinet.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>
  Goldstone Commission Report -- "President de Klerk has acted 
properly in suspending from duty all the police officers 
implicated by the Goldstone Commission in a wide variety of evil 
activities, ranging from massacre by hit squads to train and 
hostel violence, gun running, the frustration of criminal 
inquiries, destruction of evidence, and more," an editorial in 
the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 20 March on page 28 
states. "The evidence collected by the Goldstone Commission is 
voluminous and credible" and suggests the AK-47 assault rifles 
"used in many criminal attacks on innocent people may be traced 
back, not to smugglers from Mozambique, but to the SAP [South 
African Police]." Minister of Law and Order Kriel "may have been 
kept in the dark" and Police Commissioner General van der Merwe 
"kept himself in the dark, diligently ignorant of the causes of 
the slaughter that has afflicted this country for years. However 
in both cases it is incomprensible that Mr de Klerk has failed 
to remove them from office, at least until the Goldstone 
investigations and the criminal investigations that must surely 
follow, are complete." The mystery is why Mr de Klerk clings "to 
the old guard under whose dubious supervision the rot set in." 
<H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>
  Delaying Tactics -- The Goldstone Commission report "that 
there is a Third Force that has been perpetrating violence in 
the past four years" is welcome, "however we do not understand 
why the commission's report was not forwarded to the Attorney 
General for the immediate prosecution of those implicated," an 
editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 20 March 
on page 6 notes. "The reluctance to detain the generals is 
likely to allow those implicated to interfere with 
investigations." "We cannot help but charge that De Klerk's 
strategy of ordering investigations instead of detentions is yet 
another delaying tactic in the hope the issue will be 
forgotten." "The ANC [African National Congress], through its 
influence in the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] should 
ensure that the entire command structure of the police be placed 
in neutral hands until a democratic government formally acquires 
the instruments of power. This includes removing Kriel from 
office." 
  King Zwelithini's Proclamation -- "Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini's Friday proclamation of kwaZulu/Natal as a sovereign 
kingdom and calls to his subjects to defend it at all costs, 
have confirmed our suspicions that he is nothing more than a 
puppet for Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi," the second editorial in the SUNDAY NATION on 20 
March on page 6 notes. "To us, it seems the high-profile 
Buthelezi -- under pressure from leading international figures 
to join the national elections -- has opted to push the King 
forward to make pronouncements on his behalf and then claim to 
be supporting the position as a 'servant' of the monarch." 
"Maybe it is time that the King refrained from politics and left 
this to politicians." 
<H6>  WEEKEND STAR </H6>
  "Breathtaking Litany of Shame" -- "The latest accusations 
against rogue policemen take the breath away," the "prima facie 
evidence" comes from "officers of the highest callibre, ranging 
from majors to a general, have been party to to the most damning 
exposure of third force activity so far," an editorial in the 
Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 19-20 March on page 14 
notes. "Only one man has the power to act effectively: President 
de Klerk." "All the police officers named in the report must be 
suspended immediately, not sent on leave, and those men 
implicated who are not members of the SAP must not be allowed to 
skip the country." "De klerk must replace the Commissioner of 
Police General Johan van der Merwe, not only because the general 
bears ultimate responsibility, but because his lack of interest 
in bringing his own men to book is glaringly evident. Law and 
Order Minister Hernus Kriel's performance must also come inder 
scrutiny." 
<H6>  RAPPORT </H6>
  Urgent Action Needed on `Third Force' -- The Johannesburg 
RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 20 March points out in a page-20 
editorial: "In the storm over possible involvement of senior 
policemen in a so-called Third Force which allegedly sowed 
violence, there is at present little more than allegations 
against certain people, and vehement denials." "The independent 
investigating team will have to present evidence which can be 
laid before a court, and on which a court must decide. The 
matter has been raised by the Goldstone Commission critical days 
before an election, and therefore it needs to be dealt with as 
speedily as possible. Those who are guilty must be punished by 
the court without delay, but the innocent must not have to live 
for months under the cloud of untested accusations. Not only 
they but the whole country is feeling a degree of uncertainty 
over the trustworthiness of the upholders of the law. Let us 
not have a repeat of the dismissal of military officers after 
the Goldstsone raid on the offices of Military Intelligence. As 
far as we can remember, not a single one of them has to date 
been convicted in a court of law, and some of them have in fact 
been reappointed to their posts. The question still remains 
over where the mistake lay: with the officers who were accused, 
or with the rash actions of the Goldstone Commission. With the 
election little more than a month away, this case must be 
treated with double the urgency."

  [Text] Today, the president of the Republic, Mr. Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, met Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, the military 
command, and officials of the intelligence service. They 
studied ways and means of restoring security especially in 
Bujumbura in order to stop massacres, balkanization of suburbs, 
looting, and arson. They decided on a number of measures. 
  First, the entire population is asked to keep peace 
throughout the country and not to allow themselves to be 
influenced by the situation in the various zones of the 
Bujumbura mayorship in order to prevent trouble erupting 
upcountry. 
  Second, from now on the Gendarmerie in cooperation with the 
(?administration) must ensure the security in the suburbs, 
markets, on the roads, and in other important public places. 
  Third, the officials of the gendarmerie and the army must 
provide the men and necessary means to apprehend whoever 
perturbs the security and who is in illegal possession of arms. 
  Fourth, the security forces must avail themselves rapidly 
anywhere they hear gunfire and must proceed immediately with the 
arrest of the culprits and the search of houses in the area of 
the disturbance. 
  Finally, any person arrested, no matter what his function 
may 
be, will have to be brought before the judicial organs.

<F P=106> [Address by National Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko to the </F>
National Assembly in Bujumbura on 21 March -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Thank you, president of the 
National Assembly. We are currently experiencing difficult 
times. I am happy to hear the words you deputies spoke on the 
return of peace to Bujumbura and our country. The current 
situation does not concern the military alone; the return of 
peace is the duty of all Burundians from the highest ranking to 
the lowest. Those who were elected by the people should be seen 
to be making efforts to assist them, to prove that we are not 
sitting in offices exchanging ideas which lead us nowhere. 
There is little peace in the country currently. Reports from 
upcountry say that in almost all areas no night passes without 
people dying, without houses being burned down or demolished. 
In Bujumbura, it is worse. When the president of the Republic 
was sworn in we thought that things would cool down but you can 
see how things are. Here in Bujumbura, in all the suburbs, 
people are dying, houses are being burned down, and now they are 
being burned down in the daylight. You have just seen when we 
were outside how they were burning in Nyakabiga. 
  It is shameful that we cannot return peace to the people. 
You asked me how you can help the minister of defense. I liked 
the fact that you thought about helping the security services. 
I also thought about requesting the same from you, but you did 
it before I had the chance. I would like you to examine 
together ways of meeting the people, how we can go to Musaga, 
Cibitoke, and other suburbs to pacify them so that, as you said, 
the culprits are arrested, tried, and jailed. 
  Regarding the question of how to implement this in peace, we 
are going to study this situation so that we see how you can 
visit suburbs in our company without endangering the security of 
deputies. 
  I do not say that all of you can go there, but a few of you 
can represent the rest so that we act quickly and see how we can 
ensure your security. The other thing in which you can help us 
is to support us when talking to the people in your daily 
actions, in your work, because the way things are now, we should 
leave aside the party questions so that people can catch up on 
their sleep and can attend their work. 
  What took place over the weekend is a shame. Guns were fired 
throughout the night, there were explosions throughout the night 
and it is a shame. You can therefore see that in the whole 
country, especially in Bujumbura, there are too many weapons. 
It is excessive. Everyone has weapons -- Tutsis, Hutus, and 
foreigners. 
  [Words indistinct] to return peace as soon as possible, 
today 
or tomorrow so that people can sleep and go to work, you should 
support the idea that people who have weapons should be 
(?disarmed). This question should find a solution with the help 
of the people themselves. Because even if we achieved peace 
today, as long as the weapons are still in circulation they 
would be used later in other ways, for stealing and killing. 
That question should not be left behind among the urgent 
questions. 
  Ministers, deputies, government employees should work 
together, meet the people and speak with one voice about peace 
in these difficult times. People are being kidnapped in broad 
daylight, but we cannot even find their bodies or know where to 
start looking. This is a shame. This cannot continue while 
there are services charged with security and administration. We 
would be useless to the people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Abuja, 21 Mar (AFP) -- Cameroon President Paul Biya 
will probably not attend the eighth summit of the Lake Chad 
Basin Commission that is scheduled to take place on 22 March in 
Abuja, it was learned from diplomatic sources in the Nigerian 
capital. 
  The absence of President Biya at this meeting is linked -- 
it 
is generally believed -- to the border conflict that broke out 
between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula. 
  The points on the agenda of the summit -- to which the heads 
of state of the border states of Lake Chad (Cameroon, Niger, 
Nigeria, and Chad) are invited -- include the launching of a 
campaign "for the safeguarding of Lake Chad" aimed at 
solliciting the aid of the international community to finance 
the necessary works that would prevent the lake from drying up. 
  "Up to now, the name of President Biya does not appear on 
the 
official list of the heads of state who expressed the wish to 
take part in the summit," a source from the Nigerian Foreign 
Affairs Ministry confirmed. 
  Cameroon Ambassador to Nigeria, Samuel Libock Mbei, is 
currently on an official mission to Cameroon, it was learned 
from that country's embassy, with no more details. 
  The Bakassi Peninsula -- with about 1,000 square km in the 
Gulf of Guinea -- is rich in natural resources (primarily fish) 
and is said to contain important hydrocarbon deposits. 
  While seeking a diplomatic solution to that conflict that 
escalated at the beginning of March, Cameroon and Nigeria 
deployed troops on Bakassi and Yaounde regularly reports clashes 
between the two troops.

  [Text] In Chad, 10 opposition parties are calling for a 
12-month extension of the transitional democratic period to 
enable adequate preparation for the presidential and 
parliamentary elections. The elections were originally 
scheduled for this year. The 10 parties, whose names were not 
disclosed, as well as the 15 associations supporting them, have 
formed a group known as Alternative 1994. They are demanding 
the revision of the Transitional Charter, the formation of a new 
government, the holding of roundtable talks among political and 
military groups, as well as the signing of a social pact with 
the unions to put an end to the country's social crisis.

  [Excerpts] The interunion crisis committee and the 
federation of independent unions are maintaining their call for 
a five-day renewable strike from this morning until 25 March to 
protest what they term the government's inflexible position 
toward workers' legitimate demands. The unions pointed out that 
although the government has agreed to the principle of paying 
overdue step increases, it has not earmarked funds for the 
increase in salary indexes. The government is insisting that 
all salary changes should not exceed the allocated 9 billion CFA 
francs. The unions recall that the amount can only cover a 10 
percent increase on the basis of the 1990 salary index. The 
unions, therefore, conclude that the government's decision to 
accept the principle of paying overdue step increases is only 
aimed at curtailing the workers' past gains. Due to the above 
reasons, the unions maintain the strike call and urge all 
workers to give their maximum support to the strike in order 
that, quote, government maneuvers fail, unquote. Furthermore, 
the unions have decided to refer the matter to the appropriate 
legal institutions in the country as well as international 
organizations for what they term government's machinations, 
which infringe on labor rights. 
  Following the resumption of negotiations with the 
government, 
the National Federation of Workers' Union of Benin [UNSTB], also 
a signatory to the strike motion, has just backed out of the 
action. It held an extraordinary session on 19 March during 
which its steering committee reviewed workers' social 
conditions, especially those of its activists. Given that the 
government has accepted the principle of paying overdue step 
increases, increasing the salary index, and increasing family 
allowances to the tune of 9,225,328,610 CFA francs, the UNSTB 
thinks there is a need to continue negotiations with the 
government. It has, therefore, decided to suspend its 
participation in the strike and urges all its activists to 
report for duty as of 0800 this morning. 
  The government has reacted to the strike threat. It has 
reaffirmed that in its 16 March cabinet meeting report, it 
expressed readiness to negotiate by agreeing to meet two of the 
unions' demands. The government communique clearly stressed 
that the cabinet has already confirmed the government position 
and informed the unions. It said the government will also 
proceed with the necessary actions for the payment of the 
28-percent salary increase in conjunction with union 
representatives chosen by the unions. It further stated that 
work on this has been under way since 18 March to enable the 
government to take up the matter quickly at the National 
Assembly for an enabling draft bill. Thus, payment of workers' 
financial benefits, pending the adoption of the 1994 budget, as 
well as their salary readjustments and promotions will be 
effective as of the end of April. [passage omitted] 
  In view of the government's decision, the two reasons given 
for the five-day strike announced on 15 March are no longer 
valid. Moreover, since no strike motion or any other workers' 
demands have been brought before the government, the civil 
service minister urges all workers in all sectors to report for 
duty without fail as of 0800 this morning. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The president of Guinea-Bissau has once more 
postponed the first presidential and legislative elections. 
Nino Vieira revoked the decree providing for the elections to 
be held on 27 March. In a communique issued by the presidency 
of the Council of State, the Guinean president says that his 
decision to postpone the elections again is linked to the note 
from the National Election Commission which states that it is 
not technically possible to hold the elections. Fernando 
Pereira reports from Guinea-Bissau. 
  [Pereira] At this rate, Guinea-Bissau will enter the 
Guinness 
Book of Records as the African country with the longest 
transition process to democracy. In effect, the process started 
in 1991, and this is the third time that the pluralist elections 
have been postponed. This measure has not come as a surprise. 
Since last month, it has been known that it was practically 
impossible to hold elections on the set date, 27 March. The 
delay in the registration process, the main electoral task, is 
one of the reasons for the postponenent. Another reason, given 
recently, was the inadequate functioning of the regional 
election commissions and irregularities in the selection of 
candidates for drawing up the electoral lists. Finally, this 
latest postponment has much to do with the serious economic 
crisis in the country, which could be further aggravated by this 
postponement.

  [Text] Niamey, March 18 (AFP) -- Paramilitary police using 
teargas and university students lobbing firebombs battled in the 
Niger capital on Friday [18 March]. 
  The students set up roadblocks of branches and burning tyres 
at all intersections and blocked off the bridge across the Niger 
River linking the city centre to their campus. 
  About l00 police drove some 200 students back to the campus. 
  The students were calling for the punishment of all those 
involved in the death of a student a week ago, when police 
raided the campus to break up a demonstration of protest against 
arrears in payment of study grants. 
  The student was hit full in the face by a teargas canister 
and died of the wounds next day. 
  Friday's demonstrators demanded in particular the immediate 
sacking of Niamey's Mayor Souleymane Abari, who is also district 
administrator with police powers. 
  Government spokesman Mouctar Diallo set out a timetable for 
paying the missing subsidies late Thursday, but the student 
union said the gesture was a deliberate misreading of their call 
for punishment of the culprits in the campus death. 
  Apart from the paramilitary police contingent, there were no 
policemen in the streets because their national union with 1,700 
members has called a strike in support of the colleagues accused 
by the students.

Tuareg rebellion in Niger. He dismissed widespread allegations 
in Niger that France was supporting the Tuareg rebellion and 
stressed that there were no specific facts to substantiate the

that France has only assumed a mediation role in this matter. 
France has always condemned and will continue to condemn the 
deadly attacks perpetrated by the rebels, the French envoy 
added, and concluded that France will assist Niger during these 
trying times.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Koffigoh] I have just tendered my resignation and 
that of the crisis government to the president of the Republic. 
You know that the mission assigned by the Sovereign National 
Conference to the transitional prime minister is essentially to 
lead the country to democracy. Between the end of 1992 and the 
beginning of 1993, you know that civil peace and the very 
existence of the nation as an entity was seriously threatened. 
It became necessary to initiate greater consultations than in 
the past between the head of state and the prime minister in 
order to save our country. This has been done and a crisis 
government was formed on the basis of seven fundamental 
principles to [words indistinct] which I had negotiated at the 
time and which was accepted by the head of state. 
  The essential mission of the crisis government does not 
differ at all from that of the transitional government. It is 
the same thing; that is, to govern the country until the 
installation of democratic institutions. Today we are on the 
eve of the first meeting of the new National Assembly, and I 
thought my mission and that of the government had ended. It is 
henceforth up to the head of state who has the reigns of power 
to continue his consultations to form a new government. 
  Of course, I am satisfied since Togo is entering into the 
community of the world's democratic nations. I am very 
satisfied with this. Of course, these results were achieved 
without having gone through great pains. We went through 
various ups and downs, including bloody events, and this is my 
only point of regret; we do not have the power to bring the dead 
back to life, those people whom our divisions and dissensions 
killed. But concerning our performance report, we will 
remember, if not this evening then in the days ahead, some of 
the highlights of this transition which has been a long one. 
This birth of our democracy has been long, but, thank God, the 
Togolese democracy has been born all the same. 
  [Correspondent] Considering your experience, what advise do 
you give to your successor? 
  [Koffigoh] I told you before it is not up to the outgoing 
prime minister to define the criteria for his successor. So, 
for the moment, I will limit myself to this. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Koffigoh] But I say that Togo is a nation which must get 
consolidated as a nation and which has to assert itself in the 
regional, subregional, and the international context as well as 
among countries belonging to the United Nations. Togolese have 
real problems that go beyond our petty squabbles and political 
triteness and these problems must be resolved. The best way to 
solve them is that each time difficulties arise ...[pauses] 
there is no country in the world that does not go through 
problems. But those who can contribute should be able to hold 
consultations to find the best solutions. If this spirit guides 
our country's march towards the future, I think we have a good 
chance to emerge victorious. But if we should continue to fight 
among ourselves while we forget the people, then, of course, we 
will have the same difficulties in the future. I think I have 
been clear enough. [end recording]

  [Text] Joseph Kokou Koffigoh has resigned from his prime 
ministerial post but a controversy has begun between the Action 
Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy 
[UTD] over the arrangements expected to lead to the choice of 
the new prime minister. Yesterday, the CAR sent us a statement 
relating to the situation. It was read by Afan Houenoumadje: 
  [Begin Houenoumadje recording] The CAR steering committee 
met 
on 21 March in the presence of its 36 members elected to the 
National Assembly and expressed grave concern over the reasons 
for the present controversy over the choice of the prime 
minister expected to form the first government of the Fourth 
Republic. 
  The CAR recalls that, according to a democratic principle in 
tune with the expression of the people's will and the spirit of 
our Constitution, the choice of a prime minister from a 
parliamentary majority is, first and foremost, left to the party 
that obtained the highest number of seats in the elections, and 
it is up to that party to look within its ranks for the person 
who can occupy that function. 
  Furthermore, the CAR makes it a point to stress that before 
the first round of the legislative polls, the CAR chairman and 
his UTD counterpart agreed, in the presence of a witness, upon 
the way the prime minister would be chosen. Under this 
agreement, it was understood that should the opposition win the 
legislative elections, the party that would obtain the highest 
number of seats would choose candidates for the post of prime 
minister, speaker of the National Assembly, and president of the 
Constitutional Court. The CAR remains convinced that everything 
will be done to ensure that the new institutions that are put in 
place are in line with the will expressed by our citizens during 
the 6 and 20 February legislative elections. 
  Issued in Lome on 21 March 1994 by Yaovi Agboyibor, CAR 
chairman [end recording] 
  After this statement by the CAR, the UTD reacted 
immediately. 
Edem Kodjo, the UTD leader who we contacted by telephone, said 
he had not signed any such agreement with the CAR and demanded 
proof of such an agreement. Let us listen to what he said: 
  [Begin Kodjo recording] I find all this a bit deplorable. 
What I can tell you is that I have never signed any agreement 
with the CAR chairman on this issue. If there exists a signed 
agreement this should be produced. [end recording]

  [Text] In Lusaka, observers have admitted that the peace 
talks might break down should the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] continue to adopt its current 
stance. UNITA has demanded more central and provincial 
government posts. Pedro Manuel, our correspondent in the 
Zambian capital, reports that the mediators and observers want 
the two negotiating teams to meet today in a bid to overcome the 
current stalemate. 
  [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. No 
understanding has been reached yet concerning the issue of 
government for this country. The mediators and observers may 
try to get the two sides to meet today to overcome the deadlock. 
  According to a source, yesterday the mediators gave UNITA 
yet 
another document for it to analyze. That document was drawn up 
on the basis of the offer made by the Angolan Government. UNITA 
promised it would reply some time today. 
  Despite that, observers here in Lusaka have admitted the 
possibility that negotiation may break down should UNITA remain 
steadfast in its current position. The (?peace talks) continue 
to focus on ministerial portfolios and provincial government 
issues. UNITA has accepted what the government has offered but 
it continues to say that it is not enough. It wants more 
so-called key ministerial portfolios and more provinces to 
govern. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The Lusaka peace talks may now be deadlocked, but 
war inside Angola has long been the order of the day. The 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has 
launched a major offensive throughout Angolan territory, but its 
operations are focusing on Benguela, Bengo, and Huila Provinces 
in particular. In Lunda Sul Province, the people experienced 
difficult times yet again when an undetermined number of UNITA 
soldiers attacked the area of Luau. Our correspondent reports: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] According to 
(Sapassa Cabeia), one of the (?leading figures in the area), 
UNITA killed three people and wounded another three. Its forces 
pulled out shortly after the Angolan Armed Forces had come into 
action. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The government is putting the screws on the 
opposition with the arrest of two members accused of crimes 
against the state. They are expected to appear in court within 
days. According to opposition spokesman Abass Youssouf, these 
arrests are a simple maneuver orchestrated by President Said 
Mohamed Dhojar's regime to destabilize the opposition. Here is 
Abass Youssouf speaking to Mohamed Yusufu Saliou. 
  [Begin recording] [Youssouf] One has the impression that 
what 
they really want is to put political leaders under arrest so 
they are looking for an excuse. The very day of the arrests the 
government issued a communique over the radio attacking [words 
indistinct] and myself. So one has the impression that the 
government is panic-stricken and is simply seeking to arrest 
people. 
  [Saliou] In the face of this situation what is the reaction 
of the opposition that you represent? 
  [Youssouf] The opposition [words indistinct] because the 
radio is gagged by the government. There is no (?written 
press), they closed down all the radio stations close to the 
opposition, and we in Moroni have called dignitaries and 
religious leaders to meet on 22 and 23 March to deny the 
allegations. We plan to hold a rally on 23 March, and it will 
be followed up with other rallies in Grande Comore to try to 
explain the situation to the people. We have convened political 
leaders [words indistinct]. 
  [Saliou] So in your opinion, there was no plot, but it is 
rather the state which is trying to arrest opposition leaders 
with flimsy excuses? 
  [Youssouf] Oh yes, that is quite clear to everybody. Even as 
far as the people are concerned, you can be sure. [end recording]

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] leader, has reiterated that his party wants the 
country's multiparty elections to be held in October of this 
year. In an interview he granted Portugal's LUSA news agency, 
the Renamo leader said that there were people interested in 
postponing elections but he noted that was not Renamo's position. 
  The Renamo leader noted that the international community has 
repeatedly warned that it will withdraw its UN-supervised 
peacekeeping mission in Mozambique, should the holding of 
elections be moved to a later stage.

  [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] has (?issued) a 
statement concerning the start of the process of destroying 
ammunition and explosive devices in government and Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] troop assembly areas. 
  At a meeting in Maputo yesterday, the CCF found that the 
pace 
of government and Renamo troop confinement has dropped slightly. 
The United Nations has called on the two sides to replace 
troops as they are demobilized. 
  At a meeting to analyze the evolution of the troop 
confinement and demobilization process, Renamo presented 
complaints that men were allegedly being trained in Goba, in 
Maputo Province, and that Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, soldiers 
were allegedly selling weapons to civilians in Tete Province. 
  The CCF promised to investigate on the ground the 
allegations 
that have been presented by the movement led by Afonso Dhlakama.

<F P=106> [Report by Filipe Mabutana] </F>
  [Text] Under the chairmanship of President Joaquim Alberto 
Chissano, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Central 
Committee has been holding its fourth ordinary session at the 
Frelimo School in Matola since this morning. A total of 144 
party members are attending the session, which should perhaps be 
called Frelimo's triumphal meeting. According to Frelimo 
Chairman Joaquim Chissano, only Frelimo knows how to implement 
democracy in this country. In practice, democracy will perish 
and be a tuneless song in the throats of dictators or disguised 
puppets. [sentence as heard] 
  In his speech to the fourth Frelimo Central Committee 
session, the Mozambican president gave special attention to the 
Mozambican peace process in general, and in particular the troop 
confinement and demobilization processes, as well as the 
formation of the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM. He 
also noted the need for Frelimo militants to mobilize the 
electorate and to gather new members for the party. In fact, 
Frelimo is very happy about its membership. 
  In his speech a few minutes ago, Frelimo Chairman Chissano 
said his party had already been able to get 359,719 new members 
in the 21-month period between March 1992 and December of last 
year. According to him, these figures reflect his party's 
growing credibility among the Mozambican people. Joaquim 
Chissano noted that such findings by Frelimo may serve as a 
catalyst to increase its belief that it can win the upcoming 
first multiparty elections in the country. 
  [Begin Chissano recording] Our party has enjoyed the 
people's 
respect for many years. These perceptions arise from the 
people's knowledge about the aims that have always guided 
Frelimo and the successes we have scored even when we were going 
through rather difficult times. [Words indistinct] the 
difficulties we have faced. This should not wipe away our 
history or the foundations we have established and on which (?we 
hope to build) a happy Mozambique. We must have the courage and 
firmness to face up to the challenges posed by this process. We 
want to win the elections in a climate of reconciliation and 
tolerance. This does not mean, though, that we have to keep 
quiet about all direct and indirect aggression we have been 
dealt. [end recording]

  [Text] If the presidential and parliamentary elections were 
held tomorrow without the participation of Joaquim Chissano and 
Afonso Dhlakama, and Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] and 
Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance], who would vote for the 
other candidates? The question was asked by Gestinform to 1,000 
Maputo residents between 18 February and 4 March. Domingos 
Arouca and Fumo [Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence 
Party] emerged as viable alternatives to run the country. 
  Out of a total of 1,000 people, Arouca received the support 
of 360 people or 36 percent. Maximo Dias came second with 225 
votes (22.5 percent), Padimbe Kamati with 31 votes (3.1 
percent), and Neves Serrano with eight votes (.8 percent). The 
number of voters who did not vote for the candidates was 118 
(11.5 percent), and those undecided represented 25 percent or 
258 voters. 
  If parliamentary elections were held tomorrow without the 
participation of Frelimo and Renamo, Fumo would also enjoyed the 
support of the Maputo electorate with 271 votes or 27 percent. 
Then comes Monamo [Mozambican Nationalist Movement-Mozambican 
Social Democratic Party] with 258 votes (25.8 percent), the PCN 
[National Convention Party] with 247 votes (24.7 percent), 
Pademo [Mozambique Democratic Party] with 25 votes (2.5 
percent), the PPPM [Mozambique People's Progress Party] with 18 
votes (1.8 percent), Sol [Social Democratic and Liberal Party] 
with 14 (1.4 percent), and Palmo [Mozambique Liberal and 
Democratic Party] with 7 (.7 percent). There were 149 undecided 
voters (14.9 percent) and 11 various others (1.1 percent). 
  This is the opinion expressed by people interviewed during 
the opinion poll: 
  Dr. Domingos Arouca: "He is the best among the other 
political leaders." "If the two main contenders do not run for 
the presidency, it would be his turn." "He is the type of man 
that this country needs -- old, cultured, and calm." "He is not 
one of those who has the hands stained red; his are clean." 
  Dr. Maximo Dias: "He is a good political leader, cultured 
and 
mature." "He seems to be the most democratic of the Mozambican 
politicians." "He is an experienced politician." "Many 
politicians could learn from his speeches." 
  Dr. Padimbe Kamate: "He is the eldest of the candidates." 
"He has a lot to teach us." "He seems to be very careful in his 
statements; he does not make senseless accusations." "He is 
very worried about our people, and deserves to be the president 
of the Republic." 
  Dr. Neves Serrano: "Mozambique needs a religious president 
so 
that there is no more war; he is the right person." "He is a 
very simple and respected man, who greets everybody." "He is 
not one of those who drives luxury automobiles; he walks like 
the people." 
  The opinion poll covered residents of the city of Maputo 
older than 18 years, of whom 490 were males and 510 females. 
The margin of error is 3.09 percent with a 95 percent degree of 
certainty.

Hernus Kriel said on Tuesday [22 March] he took the strongest

investigation. 
  Commenting on the report, Gen Mellet said State President 
F.W. de Klerk had lost a lot of white support and was doing 
something dramatic to gain black support. Gen Mellet said the 
matter was unsettling, because it was being done unfairly. "I 
am upset about the way it was made public." 
  Mr Kriel said on Tuesday Gen Mellet did not possess relevant 
information on the matters he commented on. "The comments 
attributed to him are completely inappropriate for a serving SAP 
[South African Police] general and do not reflect my views or 
those of the SA Police as an institution."

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] [monitored in progress]...by senior police officers 
could be the turning point in the already shaky relationship 
between the police and the De Klerk government. Since the 
unbanning of the ANC [African National Congress] the 
revolutionaries' plan to break the power of the police has 
succeeded, assisted to a considerable degree by the De Klerk 
government. 
  The replacement of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan 
Vlok 
by Mr. Hernus Kriel is only one of the demands of the ANC-SACP 
[South African Communist Party] alliance that have been met, and 
one could mention several more examples of a planned strategy to 
undermine the effectiveness and morale of the police. 
  These developments only serve to strengthen the impression 
that Mr. F. W. de Klerk's government has betrayed the police. 
In September 1990, Police Commissioner General Johan van der 
Merwe stated that it is important for a government to be able to 
depend on the absolute loyalty of each member of the police 
force. Loyalty is only possible if the members of the force 
trust the government, he added. 
  He must surely remember those words now that his generals 
are 
being placed under the microscope by Goldstone. Justice 
Goldstone's report this weekend contains allegations which have 
not been tested in a court of law. The judge seems to be making 
a habit of releasing reports critical of the country's security 
forces. His report two years ago about particular South African 
Defense Force actions was first presented to the ANC before he 
took it to the government. 
  Despite Justice Goldstone's public image as a liberal, he 
was 
chosen by the government to carry out a number of investigations 
into the security forces. His findings on the Seboking 
shootings in 1991 dealt largely with greater control over the 
South African Police. As a result of the report nine policemen 
were charged with murder. At present more than 300 policemen 
are in prison for carrying out their duties. Some are in Death 
Row. 
  Hundreds of policemen are murdered every year. In 1991 the 
SAP introduced voluntary psychological support for stressed and 
traumatized policemen. Between 1991 and 1993, 132 policemen 
committed suicide, and the incidence of dismissals due to 
depression and tension has increased by 300 percent. In 1991 a 
law was passed by Parliament barring policemen from membership 
of any political party. This measure was apparently aimed at 
policemen with right- wing sympathies. Yet a mere two years 
later, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union, Popcru, was 
openly allowed to take part in the marches organized by the 
ANC-SACP alliance. 
  AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL stated in 1992 that a purging of 
generals 
in the defense and police forces who were unsympathetic toward 
the new South Africa was imminent. In June of 1993 the ANC 
warned the SAP that a new government would get rid of any 
policeman with, quote, blood on his hands. Last month, at the 
obvious insistence of the ANC, SAP headquarters was asked for a 
list of all policemen who had fired their weapons at least twice 
in the course of duty. Despite the loss of more than 14,000 
policemen in the past two years, more policemen announced their 
intention to resign after this incident. Many of them told the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] that they could no longer 
serve a National Party government, in spite of the increased 
salaries they are being offered in the election campaign. 
  The SAP is in tatters and reeling. While APLA [Azanian 
People's Liberation Army -- military wing of the Pan-Africanist 
Congress] and MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] are 
causing havoc, the police are subjected to strict codes of 
conduct, overseas watchdogs, civilian monitoring councils, 
prosecution, prison sentences, and called to account at the 
World Trade Center and, worst of all, betrayed by their own. 
Thousands of members of the police force worry about their 
future. They know inwardly that they cannot support communism 
in whatever guise. They belong among their own people where 
they can defend their heritage. They are welcome in the 
republic of the Boer Afrikaners.

  [Text] Pretoria March 21 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] on 
Monday [21 March] condemned as despicable State President F W de 
Klerk and Mr Justice Richard Goldstone's "offering of police 
generals as criminals to communist anarchists". The ultra 
right-wing organisation was reacting to the mandatory leave 
imposed on Generals Basie Smit, Krappies Engelbrecht and Johan 
le Roux, who had been implicated in a Goldstone Commission 
report of "third force" activities. 
  In a statement, AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche said: (Mr 
Justice) Goldstone, that Boere-hater and African National 
Congress apologist has now, without corroborating evidence, used 
an anonymous, paid informant to throw our senior police generals 
to the communist wolves." 
  Mr Terreblanche pledged his organisation's support to the 
police force and said his whole force would be made available to 
them to ensure that the country could be a peaceful home to "our 
children". 
  "These generals and their troops, who have under 
life-threatening circumstances dedicated their lives to maintain 
law and order, are now being offered by (Mr Justice) Goldstone 
and Mr F W) de Klerk as criminals to the communist anarchists. 
  "This is typical of the new approach that murderers, 
rapists, 
anarchists and other communist criminals have become heroes, 
while the police is being presented as thugs. How can any police 
force function if its own government turns against them?" 
  Mr Terreblanche accused the government of having handed 
Bophuthatswana over to communist anarchists in the "most 
treacherous and cunning" manner, adding that it had now 
seemingly become kwaZulu's turn to be sacrificed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Inkatha Freedom Party Central Executive </F>
Committee member Dr. Ben Ngubane in the Johannesburg studio and 
African National Congress National Executive Committee member 
Jacob Zuma in the Durban studio by announcer Leslie Mashokwe on 
the "Newsline" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] In this program tonight -- the 
declaration of UDI [unilateral declaration of independence] by 
His Majesty King Zwelithini on Friday in Ulundi and the 
cancellation of Dr. Mandela's visit to Ulundi because of an 
alleged assassination plot. We now welcome Dr. Ben Ngubane of 
the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and a minister in the kwaZulu 
Government. Good evening to you, sir, and welcome. 
  [Ngubane] Good evening. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Ngubane, is this an effective unilateral 
declaration of independence by the Zulus or not? 
  [Ngubane] Well, if His Majesty wanted to do that, he could 
have called us into the Legislative Assembly, sat on his throne, 
and declared us independent. What he was talking about, and it 
is very clear even in the shots that you played just now, that 
he was reaffirming the right of the Zulu nation to its kingdom, 
to its monarchy, to its territory. And this is what he was 
saying, that we will continue to fight for this. We will not 
give up. We will not accept the present constitution because it 
destroys the very essence. 
  [Mashokwe] But then is there intent on the part of the king 
to finally declare UDI? 
  [Ngubane] Well, if there was there would be nothing wrong 
with that either. 
  [Mashokwe] But is there? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I cannot speak for His Majesty. He speaks 
for the nation, but the Zulu people value their sovereignty, 
they value what is God-given to them, in terms of territory, 
political structures, and institutions. They do not want to 
see...[pauses] We do not want to see that swept away and being 
made, the future of the Zulu nation being made to be dependent 
on the decisions of a provincial legislature that is still to be 
elected. 
  [Mashokwe] Who is supposed to decide? South Africans sat 
together in the World Trade Center, sorted out how many regions 
we are going have, spent hours talking about the new South 
Africa. This demand, though belated, seemed to pose a threat in 
that if the Zulu people don't get it, according to His Majesty, 
then they must be prepared to fight for it. 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie you will remember that we had to move 
out of the World Trade Center on the 2 July because when we put 
the argument for the form of state to be decided as a 
preliminary matter we were refused the chance to debate this 
issue. That debate would have clarified all these issues that 
are coming to the fore now. We were refused and steamrolled 
because people did not want to accept that there are realities 
that will have to be taken into account when we write a new 
constitution. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand exactly where we are now 
in South Africa. The Zulu monarch almost declares UDI, or his 
intention to do so if he does not respect the new dispensation 
-- then where are we headed for? 
  [Ngubane] Well, now is crunch time. Now we are facing the 
real truths, the reality of this country, not the euphoria 
created by the press around the World Trade Center happenings, 
not the attempted universalization of the population of this 
country. We are facing the truth that we are composed of 
different nations, different groupings, and all their 
aspirations and wants must be taken into account when we write a 
new constitution. 
  [Mashokwe] Where are we headed for now? 
  [Ngubane] Well, there is still mediation going on. We are 
still carrying on with mediation which will actually restructure 
and help establish proper negotiations. There is still time to 
resolve these issues amicably. His Majesty made it very clear 
that he wishes for a peaceful and negotiated restoration of the 
Zulu kingdom. 
  [Mashokwe] Is that the cardinal point? If you don't get that 
restoration then the Zulus must not take part in the elections 
as he says? 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, let's put it this way. If you do not 
eat, you die. There is no choice in that. If we do not get our 
sovereignty and a proper place within southern Africa, our 
nation will die. I mean, there is no choice in that matter. We 
have to face the issue squarely and.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] It's almost like you saying either 
give it to us or we are not part and parcel of the new 
dispensation. Then what about the consequences that may follow 
from that kind of thing? 
  [Ngubane] Leslie, we are saying -- we are not even asking 
for 
it to be given to us. We are saying -- we are a nation, we have 
a monarchy. Take us as we are and then let us decide how all 
these things will be accommodated in the new South Africa. 
  [Mashokwe] You are almost dictating terms in a situation 
where people are supposed to be negotiating about the future. 
Is that being reasonable? 
  [Ngubane] We tried to negotiate at the World Trade Center; 
we were refused that opportunity. 
  [Mashokwe] No, you walked out there.... 
  [Ngubane, interrupting] Well, because we were not being 
given 
a chance. We were going to be steam-rollered and overwhelmed. 
At the end we would be held responsible as spoilers, and so on. 
We refused that. Now we are saying, South Africa, face up to 
the reality of the situation. Mediation is offered, let 
everyone accept that mediation, and let's find a solution. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you still aware of the fact that there is a 
division within the Zulu peoples themselves? At yesterday's 
meeting, for instance, one of the chiefs there said things like, 
they are not going to obey the king. Is the king not meddling 
in political matters? 
  [Ngubane] His Majesty put it very clearly in his speech on 
Friday. He wants a democratic kwaZulu/Natal region, a 
democratic kingdom where there will be pluralism in politics, in 
economics, and in social life. He has never indicated that he 
will not tolerate different party-political formations within 
the kingdom. We shall be a kingdom like Britain is, or like 
Belgium is. 
  [Mashokwe] But that's not on offer, Dr. Ngubane. At the 
moment we're talking of a dispensation that says the king will 
have a role to play in the new dispensation, and not necessarily 
a monarchy. [Constitutional Development Minister] Roelf Meyer 
made this very clear yesterday. 
  [Ngubane] We don't need Roelf Meyer to offer us our 
sovereignty or our nationhood. All we are saying is that they 
must accommodate this reality. Let's sit around the table and 
see how we'll all work together. 
  [Mashokwe] But not all the people in the Natal area or 
kwaZulu area are in agreement with this. Even the Zulus 
themselves are divided on this issue. Is the king not dividing 
his people here? 
  [Ngubane] No. Listen, we are talking here of a state 
structure, of a state formation that existed before conquest by 
the British and annexation to Natal. This is not dependent on 
the wishes of individuals. It is the state structure of the 
Zulu nation, so some Zulus may differ and have different 
political opinions or belong to different parties. This is not 
the issue. The issue is that we have a king, we have got 
political institutions and structures that characterize the 
kingdom and the monarchy, and those are the things that we stand 
firm on -- their being sovereign, their right to.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] That does not answer the question 
on 
the fact that the Zulu people are divided. There was one very 
senior person from the monarchy who said they are going to defy 
the king. Is the king not meddling in politics, Mr. Ngubane? 
  [Ngubane] Leslie, you surprise me. Look, in any nation there 
will be different political parties, and people will be free to 
choose which party they support. This is not relevant to this 
issue under discussion. 
  [Mashokwe] It is, absolutely, in the sense that, Dr. 
Ngubane, 
you are dealing with Zulu-speaking people in that territory who 
are expressing a view different from what the king is holding -- 
which is said to be Inkatha-inclined, by the way. 
  [Ngubane] By the way, do you mean to tell me that if I form 
a 
party--XYZ party--I have a right then to say the monarchy must 
be abolished? I could never have such a right. I would be 
crazy, unless I was an insurrectionist wanting to wage 
revolution and so on. There's no way I can demand that an 
institution like the monarchy....[pauses] No one has the right 
to do that. It is God-given, it was created by history. 
  [Mashokwe] You have not yet addressed yourself to the 
question I asked you, about the divisions in the Zulu people. 
  [Ngubane] There is a division, because they belong to 
different political parties. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Ngubane, President de Klerk's offer to the 
IFP 
and the kwaZulu government -- could it not be tested to make 
sure that it at least affords you an opportunity to come into 
the fold, as it were? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I'm not sure whether you are aware what the 
details of that offer were, because.... 
  [Mashokwe] Tell me about it, if you want to. 
  [Ngubane] Well, I'm not entitled to do that, but if you 
looked at the details of that offer it would mean that the IFP 
was becoming inconsistent. The reason we are not taking part in 
this election is that we have been opposed, ever since 
negotiations, to a two-phase transition process. We've been 
opposed to allowing a constituent assembly in which the majority 
party determines what the future constitution of the country is 
going to be. This has not changed. Despite the amendments that 
were effected early this year, it has not changed that central 
issue that we'll be going to the polls to elect a majority party 
to write its own constitution. 
  [Mashokwe] Is there still hope, Dr. Ngubane, of the IFP 
coming into the elections? 
  [Ngubane] Well, there's no time for that. It would mean 
substantive changes to the constitution, amendments, and making 
the constitution properly decentralizing in its nature. There 
is no time for that. 
  [Mashokwe] The IFP will not take part in the election? 
  [Ngubane] It cannot take part, because there is no chance 
for 
us to do that. 
  [Mashokwe] What about allowing other people, then, freedom 
of 
political activities in your areas? We've had cases -- last 
week Saturday, for instance, this morning in the Durban area as 
well -- where your people effectively barred the ANC people from 
making use of a stadium. 
  [Ngubane] Well, when you say, your people, I'm not sure 
whether you are talking.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] IFP people. 
  [Ngubane] No, those were Zulu people. They could have been 
any number of Zulu people, not necessarily a political party. 
  [Mashokwe] You're not disowning them, are you? 
  [Ngubane] I'm not disowning them. They are my fellow men, my 
fellow nationals. Sure, they are royalists, they were demanding 
that the king's demands must be respected. Now this is a local 
thing. I mean, you cannot blame my party for that, the IFP for 
that. If people feel strongly about things, they do things. 
Certainly, we would like to avoid anything that disrupts peace 
and free political activity. It has never been our policy to 
bar parties from operating freely. 
  [Mashokwe] But you're barring them from holding their 
meetings in the Durban area. Local or national, the fact of the 
matter is it has happened, Dr. Ngubane. 
  [Ngubane] Leslie, I've just told you. That was not a Central 
Committee decision. It was not a party decision. If people in 
the Durban area feel so strongly about an issue -- and we don't 
even know, I mean, the details of it yet. We still need.... 
  [Mashokwe] You're copping out, Dr. Ngubane. Can we just face 
the fact. All reports have indicated that those people were IFP 
people, and you're saying to me now that I should believe that 
those people were not your people? 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, you know, in this country there have 
been numerous examples where people at the local level have 
taken initiatives. One or two probably may don the uniform or 
an insignia of a party. That does not mean that the party is to 
be held responsible. I mean, we've seen this with ANC members 
getting involved in violence, with other parties getting 
involved in violence. You cannot then go and blame the party. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. Talk to me about the De Klerk offer. There 
is a suggestion that you were of heart to join the national list 
of the NP [National Party]. 
  [Ngubane] Well, what De Klerk offered was something to our 
president and to our party, and we rejected that because.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] What did he offer? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I cannot discuss this. I am not mandated to 
discuss it. 
  [Mashokwe] But could it not have helped you to jump in? 
  [Ngubane] No, it would not have helped. It would have been 
absolutely negative, because we would have been contradicting 
our own principles. 
  [Mashokwe] Does it not in any way suggest to you that the 
king's position would be looked into after the April elections? 
  [Ngubane] But that's not good enough. I mean, how do you 
establish a government and then say, we are offering you a 
chance, when already it's a fait accompli? The king told 
President de Klerk that he hoped that his demands and his 
aspirations will be attended to before elections, so that when 
the elections happen or the final settlement happens everyone is 
at home with what has been agreed. This has not happened. 
  [Mashokwe] You're not saying to me that even with the 
international mediation the IFP will still not see its way clear 
to join the election at a later stage, for that matter? 
  [Ngubane] I cannot see how you can now have results that can 
allow such a process when it is so late in the day. We asked 
for mediation way back, as far back as December. It was never 
taken up. It's only taken up very recently, and even then 
there's been a lot of dilly-dallying. We have not even 
assembled the mediation team. That's still going to have to be 
finalized and wrangled over. So there's just no chance. I 
mean, our president stated very clearly that if the things that 
we proposed in our document of 19 December, the substantive 
changes to the constitution, were accommodated, that would open 
the way to elections. But the whole process has not allowed 
that to happen. 
  [Mashokwe] Talk to me about the third force. You're once 
again in another Inkatha-gate scandal, having been said to have 
received guns from these majors and generals. Would Inkatha 
care to say, yes, we did it? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I've never heard, even on a single occasion 
in the Central Committee, such a plan being discussed. If, as 
happens in this violent country, people resort to their own ways 
of surviving, we cannot be held responsible for that. But as a 
party.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] You're not condoning it, are you? 
  [Ngubane] I'm not condoning it, but I'm talking of a 
reality--that there's violence all over the place. We hear 
horrendous stories about Transkei handling shipments of arms 
from Angola, and supplying them to MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC 
military wing] cadres, training APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army] and other agencies. We hear of all these 
things. There's so much going on, we'll need everything to be 
properly investigated. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, but then already De Klerk has decided to 
suspend the generals because of the seriousness of this matter. 
Here we see a leader of the IFP in Transvaal, Mr. Themba Khoza, 
being implicated. What steps could we expect from you to show 
your concern about this whole matter? 
  [Ngubane] But surely this thing, we expect it to be 
investigated, that evidence will be led, the truth will come 
out, then we'll decide what to do -- I mean, if he is found 
guilty. But you cannot say... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] You can't actually suspend him, Dr. 
Ngubane? 
  [Ngubane] Now? Suspend him on a mere rumor? 
  [Mashokwe] Goldstone investigated this matter. And on the 
basis of the initial submissions, President De Klerk has seen it 
fit to suspend these generals -- an act of statesmanship. 
  [Ngubane] Listen, I'm not saying that the judge should not 
investigate these things. He should investigate all the causes 
of public violence. That is his mandate. What I'm saying is, 
I'm not going to jump on the throat of a colleague because he is 
accused -- which may be false, which may be true -- until I have 
the evidence that it is true. What would our followers say that 
we jump on our colleagues and we say nothing to Goldstone about 
him investigating Transkei, General Holomisa, for instance, and 
all these shenanigans? Why are those things not being 
investigated? After all, Ciskei is going to be a participant in 
the elections. Let Goldstone also investigate those people, let 
us see the whole picture, the holistic picture, then we can all 
trust that fairness is being done. At the moment we are not 
confident that fairness is being done. We think that our party 
is being singled out for smearing, our party is being castigated 
all over the world. This has happened before, and we see it as 
just another follow-up in that typical pattern. 
  [Mashokwe] Rumors of an alleged assassination plot against 
ANC President Nelson Mandela shelved a historic meeting between 
himself and King Goodwill Zwelithini at Ulundi on Friday. The 
turn of events also interrupted proceedings in the kwaZulu 
Legislative Assembly, which began its annual sitting on Friday. 
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi slammed the rumor of the alleged 
assassination plot as an attempt to destabilize kwaZulu. He 
also criticized the government for what he called subversive 
strategy to turn kwaZulu into another Bophuthatswana. 
  To get clarity on this matter, I have on the line from 
Durban 
Mr. Jacob Zuma from the ANC, and still with ne in the studio is 
Dr. Ben Ngubane from the IFP. Good evening to Mr. Zuma, and 
welcome. Could I get your reaction to the discussion we've had 
before, mostly on the issue of free political activity in your 
area? 
  [Zuma] Leslie, we have had a lot of discussions in relation 
to the issue of free political activity at all levels. We have 
been engaged with the peace structures. We have been engaged 
with the IFP bilaterally. We have discussed with the monitors 
who are down here. However, we are quite concerned with the 
recent developments around Durban here, because it does seem 
that that principle is going to be undermined, judging from the 
conduct of the supporters of the IFP in the recent.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Why do you call them supporters of 
the IFP, Mr. Zuma? 
  [Zuma] I have been told they are IFP, and supporters of the 
IFP as well. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Ngubane, you wouldn't agree with the fact 
that 
the IFP is engaged in a set-up of disrupting ANC meetings in 
that area, would you? 
  [Ngubane] Well, that would be contrary to our positions. We 
are engaged with the ANC in very delicate negotiations, even on 
the question of mediation. We would be the last ones to order 
such a thing, I mean. But as I say, it is a problem. It's 
symptomatic of the problem that we are having in this country, 
where a lot of emotions are intensifying and, you know, people 
are taking law and action to themselves without referring to 
their party hierarchy. That I cannot rule out, but I am saying, 
as far as I know, it is certainly not an IFP intention to do 
this. 
  [Mashokwe] But if the IFP people are doing it, does that 
then mean it is not an IFP thing? 
  [Ngubane] No, no. If we were given names -- I mean, you 
know, given names either through the dispute resolution 
committees and such other mechanisms, then there is something to 
work on. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. Mr. Zuma? 
  [Zuma] I would like to clarify this question, in particular 
the incident that took place at Umlazi. Clearly the IFP was 
involved in that one. They were the ones who said they were 
going to occupy the stadium to prevent the ANC supporters and 
ANC members to gather at the stadium in a rally. After that 
incident I happened to have a chat with an IFP member, who 
actually gave me the reasons why they decided to do so. That 
one I cannot doubt, because it was indicated to me quite 
clearly. The incident currently taking place at kwaMashu, it 
was reported to me, these were IFP members. But when I had a 
telephone conversation last night with [IFP National Chairman] 
Dr. Frank Mdlalose, he then informed me it was the people of the 
community, although there would be Inkatha members, but they 
were there as a community. That's why I advisedly at the 
beginning said the supporters and the IFP members. But there 
was this very specific information in regard to the Umlazi 
incident. 
  [Mashokwe] What do you do, Dr. Ngubane, if presented with 
these facts? 
  [Ngubane] Well, certainly it will be discussed in the 
Central 
Committee, because it will be a fairly serious state of affairs 
and a serious allegation. We will look at the individuals 
involved. We will talk to their regional committees or their 
branches where they come from. I mean, there are all sorts of 
processes that will be set in place. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. Mr. Zuma, was Mr. Mandela's safety 
guaranteed, his venue, on Friday when he was supposed to be with 
the king? 
  [Zuma] Certainly, as you'd know, Leslie, we had worked very 
hard for this meeting because we believe it is important that a 
meeting between the president of the ANC, Nelson Mandela, and 
his majesty the king is critical in the circumstances, and we 
made all the agreements and arrangements. As we were preparing 
to proceed to Ulundi, we first heard the announcement that there 
was an invitation to a lot of people to come and join the 
meeting. 
  [Mashokwe] Was that not part of the prearrangement? 
  [Zuma] No, that was not arranged. There was, of course -- I 
must indicate this -- there was an indication which could have 
meant this one, which was in the letter written by the chief 
minister when we were finalizing the arrangement, the letter 
that said the meeting that was to take place on Friday was no 
longer like the old arrangement kind of meeting that was 
supposed to take place between the president of the ANC and His 
Majesty the king. It would now...[pauses] Because of the issues 
that had been raised publicly by the president of the ANC, an 
interest had been generated among the royal family members, the 
amaKhosi, and other subjects of the king. There was that 
indication in the letter. There were no details as to the 
extent of the meeting. My own impression then was that perhaps, 
instead of a meeting with two small delegations, you would have 
a bigger delegation from his majesty the king's side. That's how 
I understood it. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, Mr. Zuma, hold it right there. Dr. Ngubane, 
those AK-wielding people who came to the meeting surely do not 
pose any form of safety for Mandela's visit in Ulundi? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I didn't see them except on the screen. The 
police were there, so, you know, really, it's a matter beyond 
me, beyound, you know, a member of government. Obviously 
anything that may lead to public violence has got to be curbed 
and dealt with. I regret, and President Dr. Buthelezi has 
regretted, the fact that President Mandela couldn't come to 
Ulundi, because it would have been a very important step in the 
further evolution of a negotiated settlement. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, but if you say you didn't see them, Mr. 
Ngubane, then it does give weight to the fact that they could 
even have shot without you having seen them. If you didn't see 
the AKs that everybody saw, what safety could then be guaranteed 
for a Mandela visit in Ulundi? 
  [Ngubane] What I'm getting at is, we have seen occasions 
here, gatherings, be they ANC, be they IFP, where people have 
brought in dangerous weapons. It is the duty of the security 
forces to deal with this. I do not think it was impossible for 
the security forces to handle that situation. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, the SAP [South African Police], kwaZulu 
Police, SADF [South African Defense Force] were invited. Was 
that not enough security then? 
  [Zuma] Yes, there was an indication when we raised the issue 
with the IFP leader, Dr Frank Mdlalose, the national chairperson 
of the IFP, there was an indication that preparations had been 
worked out to ensure that security was handled appropriately. 
But of course there were a number of reports that came to our 
head office from different points and corners, pointing to the 
danger which made our head office feel that it was not advisable 
for the president of the ANC to proceed to the meeting. We then 
proceeded to request a postponement or a change of venue. 
  [Ngubane] Well, you know, a visit by Dr. Mandela to Ulundi 
is 
a historic and momentous event. It is impossible to expect 
people not to take an interest in coming to this. Obviously the 
type of meeting we had has been held before -- in discussions 
with the state president in Pretoria, even in Durban, where 
people go to accompany His Majesty. At the end of the 
discussions His Majesty comes out and addresses them about the 
conclusions reached. This has happened on several occasions, so 
there was nothing strange about that. It is just unfortunate -- 
and I must repeat, we regret very much that the meeting could 
not take place. As for the future, I cannot see how you can 
prescribe to His Majesty that he should tell the Zulu people, 
don't accompany me when I'm going to meet a prominent statesman 
of this country; stay at home. I cannot see that situation. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, the ANC must be smiling to the bank now 
that revelations have been made of the third force. The IFP is 
implicated, of course. What can you tell us? 
  [Zuma] Well, Leslie, you know that for a long time now the 
ANC has made a claim that this violence in this country had a 
third force operating and manipulating it. We have said the 
reason that agreements that are forged at the political level, 
the reason that they are not implementable is because there are 
forces behind the scenes that manipulate the violence. 
Everybody has said to us: You are making false claims. Of 
course, we have said this because we knew and because we had 
information. But, of course, as long as our information was not 
investigated or verified by a respectable judge, it was easy for 
people to dismiss what we were saying. Even when there were 
cases like the Trustfeed case, where police were in fact 
investigated, charged, and convicted--still people undermined 
this particular area. I think it is clear now that what the ANC 
has been saying is actually the truth. 
  [Mashokwe] Right. Let me get Dr. Ngubane to react again to 
this issue, and ask my production team to play in the insert 
which shows that IFP people, Zulu people, were carrying these 
AK-47s, which, we have reason to believe, might have come from 
the very generals. 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, I must object very strenuously to 
your blanket statement that the IFP is involved. Individuals 
may be involved, but not my party. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, IFP members then. 
  [Ngubane] Well, we don't know about that. We must still find 
out about it. But I want to come back to what Mr. Zuma has just 
said. Who has killed more than 400 IFP office bearers? Surely 
someone has killed them, and I'm not sure whether I can just say 
it's the third force and leave it at that. Who started SDU 
[self-defense units] and armed them in the townships? It was 
Msholozi's organization that did that. Who brought the culture 
of violence and people's war? 
  [Mashokwe] Let me get the team to play the insert, Dr. 
Ngubane, while you talk. 
  [Ngubane] No, but I am saying, you know, this is very 
simplistic to then suddenly apportion blame to us as being 
responsible for violence in this country. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's watch that tape. OK, while we wait for the 
tape to roll, we have to go back to you. Mr. Zuma, your people, 
your organization cannot claim to be angels. 
  [Zuma] I haven't said the ANC claims to be angels. I think 
it is a well known fact that there's been a conflict in this 
country, and one of these areas has been the conflict between 
the IFP members and ANC members. Nobody denies that fact. What 
we have persistently said is that there is a third force that 
manipulates, that controls and directs violence, that ensures 
that weapons are supplied, are bought, are circulated. This is 
the point we are making. My statement does not necessarily say 
ANC people have not been involved in violence. 
  [Mashokwe] But have they received these arms from the 
police, 
as Inkatha is said to have received them? 
  [Zuma] The ANC members have not received weapons from the 
police. The police have always seen the ANC as the enemy. 
  [Ngubane] I don't even know how true [it is] that our 
members 
have received weapons. We still need proof of this. But 
nevertheless I am saying, let us not be simplistic. Let's look 
at the violence for what it is, a monster that it is, and deal 
with it not in a way that gains oneupmanship for one party 
against the other. To deal with the matter in this manner makes 
cooperation in stemming the violence impossible. Let is look at 
what it is. If there are people who are guilty of wrongdoing, 
let the law take its course. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. I must mention that we had invited the 
generals together with General Johan van der Merwe of the SAP, 
and the generals who are implicated in this whole third force 
issue, and they have failed to turn up. We have not even heard 
from the minister of police, who was invited to be part and 
parcel of this discussion. Let's continue, gentlemen. The IFP 
is implicated, obviously; Themba Khoza is a leader of the 
Transvaal IFP. Is IFP.... 
  [Ngubane, interrupting] But I am refusing to accept this 
type 
of judgmental statement. It has been alleged. It's not proven 
yet, you know, and really we believe that a man is not guilty 
until proven. Now why are you judging the IFP so harshly? 
  [Mashokwe] I'm not judging it. All I'm saying is in a 
question form: The Goldstone Commission has identified a Mr. 
Khoza as being one of the recipients of these things. 
  [Ngubane] Well, you know, again I must say, until proven I 
cannot go by that statement. Nevertheless, how many other 
people are receiving weapons in this country? 
  [Mashokwe] Two wrongs do not make a right. 
  [Ngubane] I agree, but I'm saying until we address the whole 
thing from a holistic perspective we are going to be fiddling on 
the sides of the problem, at the periphery of the problem. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, your situation down there -- free 
political activity and these guns that we see around. Would you 
be able to be campaigning in that area? 
  [Zuma] Leslie, it is clear that we are faced with a serious 
situation here in Natal, and I think decisions that have been 
taken at the multiparty negotiating forum need to be implemented 
here. I don't think we can delay those decisions any longer. I 
think the events of the past two weekends are an indication of 
this fact. You must know that people here in Natal are 
determined to participate in the election. They want to do so 
free and fair, without intimidation, and I think.... 
  [Mashokwe] Right, let me get back to Dr. Ngubane. I am left 
with one second. Dr. Ngubane, people want to participate. Are 
you going to stop them? 
  [Ngubane] No, we are not going to stop them. We will tell 
them why we are not participating in this poll. 
  [Mashokwe] On that note, Dr. Ngubane, Mr. Zuma, thanks for 
talking to us and giving us your time.

  [Text] Ulundi March 21 SAPA -- KwaZulu Chief Minister and 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said 
on Monday [21 March] he could not imagine the elections being 
conducted smoothly without the participation of kwaZulu's 
people. Addressing the sixth session of the kwaZulu legislative 
assembly, Mr Buthelezi said: "I cannot see that a large number 
of the people of kwaZulu/Natal will be willing participants in 
the elections." 
  Mr Buthelezi accused the government and the African National 
Congress [ANC] of using the power of the state to shake the 
country and seize power at the polls. "They have the laws which 
were made to assist them, and the security forces which they are 
reconstituting to apply the laws in their favour," he said. 
  Mr Buthelezi said kwaZulu took a stand against the interim 
constitution because its grassroots constituency had demanded 
it. "There is a vast Zulu concern about the future governance of 
kwaZulu/Natal, which they see as the kingdom of kwaZulu. 
  "I warn that should the ANC attempt to destabilise the 
kwaZulu government, as it destabilised Bophuthatswana and has 
threatened destabilisation against the Ciskei, a conflict of 
awesome proportions will be unleashed to the tragic detriment of 
South Africa and the democratic process." 
  Mr Buthelezi said his rejection of the interim constitution, 
the Transitional Executive Council and other transitional 
mechanisms carried with it powerful conviction that the Zulu 
people would not be robbed of their right to self-determination.

<F P=106> [Statement by Suzanne Vos, member of the IFP Central </F>
Committee, issued by the office of the chief minister of kwaZulu 
on the SAPA PR wire service on 22 March] 
  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] yesterday provided 
Mr Justice Richard Goldstone with a copy of a document, obtained 
by an informant, outlining ANC [African National Congress]/SACP 
[South African Communist Party] proposals to produce a situation 
of "ungovernability" and "crisis" in kwaZulu through "mass 
action", including the destabilisation of the kwaZulu civil 
service. 
  The central committee of the IFP is in no doubt that this 
document is authentic and has requested Judge Goldstone to 
investigate its contents as a matter of urgency. The informant 
cannot be publicly identified for reasons of his/her safety. 
  The document (attached) reveals sinister ANC/SACP plans to 
secretly orchestrate "emerging instability" in kwaZulu, leading 
to TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and military 
intervention, while publicly downplaying the actual and direct 
involvement of the alliance. 
  The author(s) confirm reports from IFP intelligence sources 
that there are approximately 2,000 members of Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] (MK) deployed in 
so-called "self-defence" units [SDU] throughout Natal, working 
together with members of the Transkei Defence Force and "several 
thousand" informally trained SDU members. 
  Cynical reference is made to "carefully considered" 
approaches to his majesty the king of the Zulu nation, designed 
"as a means to an end -- the destruction of Buthelezi's 
political and social base." We have provided Judge Goldstone 
with official ANC documentation using the same language. 
  The contents of this document go far beyond robust politics 
and we believe the proposals, if implemented, would plunge 
kwaZulu/Natal into full-scale civil war. 
  The IFP and the kwaZulu government have long borne the brunt 
of a sustained campaign of violence and intimidation initiated 
by the ANC/SACP alliance and there is already evidence that the 
steps, as outlined, to attempt to destabilise the kwaZulu civil 
service have begun. The untruthful and insidious propaganda 
about the safety of kwaZulu government pensions (paid, in fact, 
to the South African Government in terms of the South African 
Government Pensions Fund Act of 1956) is but one example. 
  The document is taken seriously and viewed with alarm as the 
tactics and strategies enuniciated merely follow through 
existing and blatant ANC/SACP political machinations ignored, of 
the most part, by what appears to be a national and 
international conspiracy of silence and obfuscation in holding 
the ANC/SACP alliance directly accountable for its overt ANC 
covert actions in kwaZulu/Natal, Bophuthatswana, and elsewhere. 
  March 21, 1994 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone, 
  Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of Public 
Violence and Intimidation, 
  4th Floor, 24 Sandpark Building, 
  Fredman Drive Sandton. (by hand) 
  Dear Sir, 
  With Ref: "Prepare the Anvil for the Coming Hammer Towards a 
Programme of Action in Natal" 
  I have been instructed by the president of Inkatha Freedom 
Party, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to provide you with a copy 
of a document (attached) which was obtained by an informant late 
last week. 
  The informant insists that his/her identity remain a secret 
and that under no circumstances can it be revealed as the person 
fears for his/her life. This informant insists that the 
document is genuine and was produced by a senior member(s) of 
the SACP/ANC alliance. Any further details in this regard would 
jeopardise revealing the identity of the informant. 
  The document was studied by the central committee of the IFP 
at a meeting on Saturday, March 19. It was the view of the 
central committee that the contents warrant your immediate 
attention and urgent investigation. 
  We highlight, in particular, the intention to produce a 
situation of "ungovernability" and "crisis" in kwaZulu through 
"mass action", combined with other strategies as described, 
including the destabilisation of the kwaZulu civil service. 
  The author(s) of the document outline tactics to produce 
"emerging instability" in kwaZulu, secretly orchestrated, noting 
that "direct ANC involvement must be played down." 
  "Immediate proposals" call for (in part) creating 
condition??V??Zich would lead to "future military intervention 
in kwaZulu" and the direct involvement of the TEC. 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone: 
  The IFP equally views as extremely sinister the expressed 
requirement of "restrengthening of an effective MK's (sic) 
presence and more active implementation of people's self-defence 
measures", coupled with the information that there are 
"approximately 2,000 MK members deployed in a self-defence 
capacity throughout Natal, several thousand informally trained 
SDU members, as well as disposition of some members of the TDF 
(Transkei Defence Force)." 
  The author(s) admit "successful and long-term efforts by the 
people's movement to isolate Buthelezi and separate Inkatha from 
its constituency and potential constituencies", which we observe 
is a direct acknowlegement of the tactics of violence and 
intimidation employed against members and supporters of the IFP 
over a considerable period of time. 
  We have every reason to believe that this document is 
authentic and goes far beyond robust politics in its call for 
the creation of conditions "for the fall of kwaZulu" and efforts 
to "win over" his majesty the king of the Zulu nation through 
"carefully considered and assessed approaches" as a "means to an 
end -- the destruction of Buthelezi's political and social base." 
  We therefore formally request that your commission accepts 
the very real concern expressed by the IFP in urging that this 
document and the information as well as the tactics and 
strategies outlined therein be taken extremely seriously. 
  It has been decided that we will release the document to the 
media tomorrow, Tuesday March 22, following your receipt today 
of this communication. 
  [Signed] Yours sincerely, Suzanne Vos Member, Central 
Committee, IFP 
  Copies: Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, President 
  Dr F. T. Mdlalose, National Chairman 
<H3>  Prepare the Anvil for the Coming Hammer Towards a Programme 
of Action in Natal </H3>
  The recent period has seen further-dramatic shifts in the 
balance of power towards the people's camp. The collapse of the 
Mangope regime in the Bophutatswana bantustan is a signal 
achievement in this regard. 
  The demise of the tyrant Mangope represents a serious 
reverse 
for the forces of counter-revolution in our country. It is a 
reverse from which these forces cannot recover. Continuing 
maximum all-round pressure must continue to be exerted against 
remaining, and weakening obstacles to a democratic transition. 
  The most significant outstanding obstacle which confronts 
the 
people's movement is the problem of Buthelezi and the IFP. 
Events in Bop [Bophuthatswana], combined with the deteriorating 
situation in Natal now urge the accelerated implementation of a 
strategy, which though generally accepted within the movement, 
needs to be more fully elaborated. 
  That strategy is the destruction of the kwaZulu bantustan 
and 
its reincorporation within a united, non-racial and non-sexist 
South Africa. Though timing is important, the fact of kwaZulu's 
reincorporation, together with the destruction of Buthelezi's 
power-base cannot be gainsaid. Whether that emerges as a final 
moment, or whether that destruction is process-based, conditions 
for the fall of the kwaZulu bantustan must speedily be created. 
  Bop has served to underline the fatal weakness of all the 
bantustan administrations. That is that they cannot survive for 
long without the financial support from the De Klerk government. 
Combined with the long-standing programme of mass action against 
Mangope, the mere threat that the tap would be tightened, 
combined to create a situation of ungovernability, culminating 
in an effective military coup by South African security forces. 
  Though conditions in kwaZulu and Bop differ materially, and 
the strategy of the people's movement towards the Mangope regime 
cannot be mechanistically applied, our strategy towards kwaZulu 
includes important common elements. 
  There can be no doubt that sufficient consensus now exists 
within the TEC for using maximum firmness for dealing with 
threats to a democratic transition. But we must first create 
conditions, primarily through mass action, heightened public 
awareness and work amongst kwaZulu civil servants, for decisive 
state intervention in that bantustan. In other words, we must 
need to prepare the anvil for the coming hammer. 
  Successful and long-term efforts by the people's movement to 
isolate Buthelezi and separate Inkatha from its constituency and 
potential constituencies have unfortunately been offset by 
serious and unexpected reverses in the Natal region. 
Principally this is evident in the growth of ethnic chauvinism 
under the banner of the Zulu King Zwelethini. Not only has this 
stabilised Buthelezi's support base, but this unprecedented and 
dangerous ethnic mobilisation poses a grave threat to the united 
non-racial South Africa which is the lodestar of the liberation 
movement. 
  This expanding chauvinist mobilisation is combined with 
increasing militarisation or this reactionary constituency, 
assisted by the cynical involvement of former members of the 
apartheid security forces. This militarisation, which has at 
its core the provision of military training to IFP supporters 
has contributed to the dramatic upswing in violence against the 
people's movement in both Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. 
  These dangers counsel for accelerated implementation of a 
strategy which has as its objective the destruction of the 
kwaZulu bantustan. Apart from the burning need to create 
conditions in which free and fair elections can be held, it is 
only the destruction of the kwaZulu bantustan, and its 
reincorporation under a government committed to non-racial 
goals, that the poisonous weed of tribal chauvinism can be 
finally cut down and the violence attached to its obnoxious 
cause effectively suppressed. 
  Immediate proposals for the ending of this state of affairs 
are as follows. 
  --The Natal situation should be more closely monitored by a 
task force of the TEC, and decisive practical steps recommended 
vis-a-vis the Natal situation. All intelligence reports 
generated within state intelligence organisations which relate 
to the Natal situation should therefore be provided to and 
analysed by this task force. 
  --Parts of Natal should be declared disaster areas and 
similar steps taken here as on the East Rand. Principally, 
security force functions presently carried out by the ISD 
[Internal Stability Division] should be assumed by the SADF 
[South African Defense Force] and NPKF [National Peacekeeping 
Force]. 
  In particular, those units which proved themselves most 
reliable in Bophutatswana, should be considered for priority 
deployment in crisis areas of Natal. For its part, the SAP 
[South African Police] in Natal may well prove unreliable in any 
such TEC initiative. With a view to future military 
intervention in kwaZulu, the SAP leadership in Natal must be 
firmly subordinated to the TEC. 
  --The military training and deployment of IFP members in 
Natal also requires restrengthening of an effective MK's 
presence, and more active implementation of people's 
self-defence measures. In any event any security action 
considered by the TEC should be supplemented by informal MK 
deployments. 
  According to intelligence sources approximately 5,000 IFP 
members have been trained in a relatively short space of time. 
Counterpoised to this private army are approximately 2,000 MK 
members deployed in a self-defence capacity throughout Natal, 
several thousand informally trained SDU members, as well as 
disposition of some members of the TDF. 
  The development of what is by all accounts a disciplined IFP 
military capability -- an important factor in political violence 
in the Natal region and beyond -- is deeply disturbing and 
requires urgent TEC attention. This training and the murderous 
activities of its products need to be suppressed as a matter of 
urgency. 
  --The TEC also needs to assume the payment of salaries of 
amakhosi [chiefs] subordinating reactionary institutions to the 
control of the TEC and a new democratic order is necessary not 
only a prelude to their transformation, but it removes an 
important instrument of social control from the hands of 
Buthelezi and the IFP. 
  --The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] needs to assume 
a far more active role in Natal. 
  --This must be combined with the organisation of a broad 
front of forces against any disruption of elections or further 
chauvinist inspired attempts to balkanize the country. This 
organisation could also serve as the basis for further isolation 
of Buthelezi and the IFP. 
  --Most critical of all is work amongst the kwaZulu civil 
service, and efforts to win over the Zulu king. In this regard 
Zuma's diplomacy should be understood as a means to an end -- 
the destruction of Buthelezi's political and social base. Apart 
from Zuma's sympathy for the incarnations and institutions of 
tribal consciousness, he may confuse the means as an end in 
itself. Approaches to the king therefore must be carefully 
considered and assessed and continuously oriented within the 
purposeful strategic framework of the liberation movement. 
  Organisation amongst civil servants must be immediately 
stepped up. Though significant advances have already been made 
in this regard and important sectors of the kwaZulu civil 
service are already organised by the ANC and allied formations, 
continuing efforts must be made to persuade civil servants that 
job security and their pensions can only be secured by a 
people's government and not by tribal despots of Buthelezi's 
mould. One may go so far to say that the kwaZulu civil service 
is the most important base of ANC support north of the Tugela. 
And, even though the KZP [kwaZulu Police] have traditionally 
functioned as Buthelezi's private army, increasingly members of 
the KZP, including command elements, side with the people's 
movement. It is clear that in a situation of crisis Buthelezi 
cannot take the loyalty of the KZP for granted. 
  One of the stabilising pillars of the bantustans under 
apartheid rule was the development of a bureaucratic bourgeoisie 
whose interests were fundamentally bound up with the continued 
existence of these administrations. This pillar has now been 
removed. The class interests of this stratum now lie outside 
the bantustan administrations. Only a new, non-racial 
democratic state can secure its interests. This motivation was 
a principal factor in rendering Bophutatswana ungovernable. 
  Though the kwaZulu administration differs in that it has a 
social base, a vast number of civil servants do not identify 
with this base. Thus, whilst the kwaZulu administration poses a 
challenge to the people's forces, this challenge is hardly 
insurmountable. The role of white civil servants and central 
state appointees should not be overlooked. A common commitment 
between the people's movement enlightened elements of the SAG 
[South African Government] to foreclose upon the powers of the 
kwaZulu bantustan, as in Bop, could lead to further 
disorganisation of efforts by IFP and tribal loyalists within 
the kwaZulu bantustan administration to resist TEC decisions and 
to act against our own organisation within those structures. 
  Combined with mass action, and stepped up organisation 
within 
the sectors of the kwaZulu government, a situation of 
ungovernability could reproduce itself fairly rapidly in the 
areas it administers. Though the consequences will be more 
extensive than in Bop, this should not deter us from the 
political correctness of such a strategy. It is important 
however for this crunch moment to have an appearance of 
spontaneity and popular support. Direct ANC involvement must be 
played down. 
  Emerging instability within kwaZulu, as well as providing an 
increased public profile to acts of violence, particularly when 
directed against the ANC and its allies should provide a 
persuasive argument for TEC intervention in kwaZulu. The tempo 
and extent of that intervention will be conditioned by 
development of these conditions and the degree of resistance 
encountered by the TEC. 
  Comrades within the TEC have made it clear that in 
conditions 
of growing instability or ungovernability, and partial or 
general uprising, or organised resistance to the imperatives of 
a new democratic order, that as in Bop, decisive military steps 
will be taken. In this regard no centre of counter-revolution 
or tribal chauvinism which stands outside the process of popular 
integration should be considered exempt from pre-emptive action.

<F P=106> [Article by Inkatha Freedom Party national spokesman Ziba </F>
Jiyane on the "Opinion" page] 
  [Text] Manufacturing the Bophuthatswana crisis was manna 
from heaven for those believing the best means of dealing with 
political opposition is to crush it. And target number 1 is, of 
course, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and kwaZulu government. 
That this deluded thinking is on the agenda is evident from the 
statement by Congress of South African Trade Unions [COSATU] 
vice-president George Nkadimeng over the weekend. Speaking in 
Durban, he said that if Bophuthatswana could overthrow Mangope: 
"why can't we do it here?" 
  His rhetorical question should not be misunderstood -- ANC 
[African National Congress] hardliners have always displayed a 
callous disregard for the Queensbury rules of politics, and we 
have no doubt there are plenty of likeminded militants in 
kwaZulu/Natal who would welcome the opportunity to "concretise 
their revolutionary fervor" through a repeat of Bophuthatswana. 
  The simple answer to Nkadimeng's question, however, is 
"because it won't work" -- and this is not for want of trying. 
Despite approximately 350 IFP office bearers having been 
assassinated by the ANC, SACP [South African Communist Party] 
and MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation, ANC military 
wing] since they brought violence to the kwaZulu/Natal region; 
despite the ready availability of arms and ammunition stockpiled 
in caches around the region; despite safe havens in and 
logistical support from the Transkei; despite roving MK hit 
squads intimidating communities; despite the training of 
thousands and thousands of cadres -- despite all these, kwaZulu 
and the IFP are still here. 
  One should recall the attempt by the tripartite alliance in 
1990 to have kwaZulu "disbanded." This tragic decision, 
condemned by the Pan Africanist Congress, AZAPO [Azanian 
People's Organization] and others, inevitably resulted in a 
terrible bloodbath from which South Africa has never recovered. 
Since disbanding kwaZulu "was somehow equated with destroying 
the IFP countrywide, the campaign was initiated by calls to "the 
people" to wipe the IFP off the face of the Reef. 
  That the East Rand is what it is today is directly 
attributable to this savage display of intolerance and hunger 
for power through the barrel of the gun. But kwaZulu and the 
IFP are still here. 
  One should recall the alliance again reverting to its old 
tricks, when, having failed to get its way at Codesa [Convention 
for a Democratic South Africa], it embarked upon "mass action" 
from June 1993 to force the government's compliance with the 
ANC's negotiating demands. 
  The euphemism "mass action" included calls to overthrow a 
number of administrations perceived as hostile -- 
Bophuthatswana, Ciskei and kwaZulu in particular. We all know 
what happened at Bisho, but strangely enough, despite repeated 
statements by the kwaZulu/Natal ANC leadership that the campaign 
was still on in this region, in fact it never occurred. The 
reason is that it was never possible, and the ANC was very aware 
of the likely results of attempting it. 
  Where does that leave us now? Despite trying every trick in 
the book to secure a weak and compliant IFP, the ANC is faced 
with a powerful IFP and kwaZulu government sticking resolutely 
to their principles -- which at present include the fact that we 
will not be participating in elections unless certain 
fundamental problems we have with the constitution are addressed. 
  But this presents a problem to the ANC and government which, 
while stating publicly that our participation is essential, 
privately believe there is no need to take our concerns 
seriously enough to facilitate this through amending the 
constitution. 
  Fearing the results of our possible non-participation 
however, they are therefore seeking a means of securing their 
interests while denying us ours by "levelling the playing field" 
in the region in anticipation of our non-participation. 
  Earlier ANC suggestions -- such as that kwaZulu's budget be 
unilaterally suspended -- to force our compliance are now being 
replaced with the notion of TEC [Transitional Executive Council] 
intervention and the deployment of a massive security force 
presence to "minimise violence," despite the IFP having decided 
that non-participation would be strictly peaceful and legal. In 
terms of this scenario, following April 27, the kwaZulu 
government will be replaced and the IFP will quietly get lost in 
the political wilderness while Jacob Zuma and his merry band 
take over. 
  The big question, of course, is whether this scenario is 
realistic. Notwithstanding the avalanche mentality of the 
deal-makers (nothing can stop the inevitable), there are good 
grounds for believing that things will not be quite as simple as 
this, and there would without doubt be a host of difficulties 
associated with the imposition of a constitution and of a 
government elected under it, neither of which reflect the 
region's popular will. 
  It is this central fact that will frustrate any attempted 
repeat of Bophuthatswana here, just as it has frustrated the ANC 
in the past. That is why the overthrow of Ulundi is no more 
than a pipe dream. Not only that, attempts to implement such a 
policy would merely strengthen, rather than weaken the IFP's 
hand, as the anti-democrats will be perceived for what they 
really are -- political bullies of the nastiest type. 
  Our advertisement in last week's Sunday newspapers urged 
people to "vote IFP when the time comes": We hope this is soon, 
and if those parties comprising the Transitional Executive 
Council were to devote more time to finding solutions to the 
crisis rather than trying to ignore them or trying to create a 
new crisis of vast proportions, then we could get on with the 
task at hand -- holding elections for a non-racial and 
democratic South Africa. 
  Bophuthatswana? Let me assure you, it will not happen in 
kwaZulu/Natal.

<F P=106> [By Ben Maclennan] </F>
  [Text] East London March 19 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela is to be inaugurated as 
South Africa's new state president on May 10 in Pretoria, 
according to ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki. He made the 
announcement at an ANC fundraising dinner in East London on 
Saturday [19 March]. "It is planned that the new president, 
Nelson Mandela I think, will be installed, inaugurated on the 
10th May, a big occasion in Pretoria." It had to be in Pretoria 
because Pretoria was the seat of power and government in the 
country. "For years we fought against the Pretoria regime. On 
the 10th May we ought to be (talking of) the Pretoria 
government." 
  He said the ANC had been receiving numerous queries from 
heads of state and of government in other countries asking 
whether there would be victory celebrations after the April 
election, or an inauguration of the new president. "Everybody 
wants to come," he said. The mayor of Pretoria and "all sorts 
of people" were concerned about the prospect of having the 
inauguration in the city. "They are very worried not because 
they don't want change," he said, to laughter from his audience, 
"but because they say Pretoria won't be able to handle the 
volume of visitors that are going to come". 
  Mr Mbeki said if South Africa failed to make the transition 
to a peaceful and successful democracy, it would disappoint 
millions of people across the globe. "And that we can't do. 
Too much has been invested by the rest of the world in ending 
apartheid." 
  There was a picture in many peoples' minds that Africans 
were 
incompetent, always holding out a begging bowl, had no respect 
for democracy, were always at each others' throats and that 
Africa was "generally a disaster". "The rest of the continent 
is expecting this new South Africa will change all that so the 
rest of the world will see an African country that is a success 
in terms of a political system, human rights, an absence of 
conflict and prosperity...so the rest of the world can begin to 
say our understanding of Africa was wrong." 
  These expectations meant that in the end, South Africa had 
to 
make a success of the process of change. Other countries where 
racism had raised its head, such as Sweden, France, Germany and 
England, were hoping South Africa would provide the lessons that 
would enable them to deal with their own problems. "I'm saying 
we've got to solve, we've got to succeed here in the interest of 
making a better world for millions of people." 
  He also said South Africa needed a strong ANC government to 
ensure that the country's millions were all brought into the 
settlement. If the ANC was too weak to do so, other people 
would move into the vacuum. Some of them might preach revenge 
against the whites who had oppressed them for three-and-a-half 
centuries. 
  He said the country would also need a strong National Party 
to bring white civil servants, the police and white business 
into the settlement.

<F P=106> [By Jan Taljaard] </F>
  [Text] Bureaucratic footdragging and nitpicking inside the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF], the 
misguided belief that a volkstaat [homeland] can be sustained 
after being seized by military force and lack of discipline 
within the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement, AWB] are among the key reasons given by General 
Constand Viljoen for quitting the AVF. In a remarkably frank 
"message on AVF developments" faxed to some of his closest 
supporters this week, which has been acquired by the MAIL &amp; 
GUARDIAN, Viljoen attempted to explain his actions. 
  The fax comes against the background of the growing 
fragmentation of the right. Yesterday Viljoen's Freedom Front 
registered a number of breakaway Conservative Party [CP] leaders 
on its 30-strong national and 168-strong regional lists, 
including CP MPs Corne Mulder, Pieter Mulder, Carl Werth (the 
party's Natal leader), Pieter Groenewald and Leon Louw. CP boss 
Ferdi Hartzenburg insisted that CP MPs standing as election 
candidates for another party would be automatically expelled. 
  Viljoen is blunt in his condemnation of the AWB: "It is 
known that I am taking a strong stand against the AWB, 
especially because of the effect of some of their actions on the 
image of the AVF and because of their refusal to obey military 
leadership and orders." 
  Viljoen laid the blame for the military failure of the 
rightwing forces in Bophuthatswana at its doorstep: "It has 
come to my attention the military personnel of the logistics 
base of Bop mutinied when they heard that the AWB was involved 
and the weapons were intended for the AWB. Because of this a 
great number of the Boer forces did not receive weapons and 
could not be deployed." 
  Also taking a beating were AVF supporters who advocate armed 
resistance in order to attain a volkstaat. Viljoen reasoned 
that the rightwing will not be able to hold on to such a 
volkstaat. 
  "Holding on to what you have conquered -- not only on a 
military level, but also on financial and other levels -- is 
something that has to be considered carefully. Many members of 
the controlling structures differed with me ... and were feeling 
the time had come for us to use our military power to gain what 
we could not attain on the political front. 
  "Even though we are strong on the military level, it is 
necessary that this strength be exercised as a last resort and 
that cognisance be taken of the misery that could be the result 
of military violence, as was the case in Bophuthatswana." 
  The fax makes it clear that Viljoen remains a fervent 
advocate of the volkstaat ideal. He nevertheless cautions that 
even if a sovereign volkstaat could be negotiated, it would be 
economically and constitutionally linked to the larger South 
Africa. He gives this as one of the reasons he favours a 
negotiated option and participation in the election. 
  It also becomes apparent that differences on this issue were 
the major bone of contention between himself and other members 
the AVF. "If we were to establish a volkstaat on a legal basis, 
there is a legal requirement: we have to prove our support 
among the Afrikaners. The government refuses a referendum 
before April 27. A referendum after April 27 is unthinkable. 
The only alternative open to us at this stage is to take part 
in the elections and then to use the votes for the AVF as 
indication of this support. 
  "This is a difficult idea to accept, but our critics gave us 
no choice." 
  The frustration felt by the military man of action when 
confronted by the bureaucratic foot-dragging of professional 
politicians becomes apparent: "My sense of urgency, the 
government's speeding up of the process and a heavy workload 
could most certainly have created the impression that I acted on 
my own with the situation always changing, and without always 
meeting with the appropriate committees and governing bodies." 
  Viljoen ends the four-page message on a rather despondent 
note: "Naturally, it is not easy to argue clinically about 
something that was so important to me during the past year. To 
me, achieving our aim is an ideal -- our volkstaat an 
all-consuming obsession. I cannot continue when I feel that 
constraints are rendering me ineffective. 
  "There comes a time when it is best to make a decision. I am 
committed to achieving our ideal, and hope to lead the 
Vryheidsfront [Freedom Front] parallel with the AVF to do that."

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Excerpts] The defection of key members to General Constand 
Viljoen's fledgling Freedom Front this week ripped the guts out 
of the Conservative Party [CP] and the umbrella right-wing 
Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF]. The 
further defection of leading grassroots CP members such as 
mayors and management committee chairmen has laid waste plans by 
the CP and AVF to exploit their control over 80 rural towns to 
hinder change and disrupt the elections. 
  The 36-member CP parliamentary caucus has been decimated by 
the decision by nine of its members to fight an election under 
the Freedom Front banner. Its numbers are likely to dwindle 
further with the resignation from active politics after the 
election of seven members who are getting old or disillusioned 
with politics. [passage omitted] 
  Those likely to retire include frontbench finance spokesman 
Cas Uys, Willie van der Merwe, Piet de la Rey and Daan Du 
Plessis. 
  In addition to the MPs, General Viljoen also persuaded more 
than 150 leading grassroots members of the CP to join him in 
contesting the elections. They include mayors, councillors and 
businessmen who were the backbone of the CP in terms of 
orgnaisation and raising funds. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Johannesburg March 21 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] announced on Monday [21 March] that 
nine political parties registered for the April election have 
received payments from the state electoral fund. 
  The parties are the National Party, Democratic Party, 
African 
National Congress, Pan-Africanist Congress, Freedom Front, 
Minority Front, Dikwankwetla [strong], Worker's List Party and 
Soccer Party. 
  The IEC said in a statement the payments made varied from 
just over R48,000 [rand] to about R1.2 million after the parties 
had submitted either an acceptable opinion poll indicating their 
support or a list of signatures from supporters. It added the 
money was for the exclusive purpose of conducting election 
campaigns, and the parties had complied with section 74 of the 
Electoral Act. 
  "An amount of R11 million, half of the R22 million available 
in the fund, will be distributed among participating parties 
before the election and the balance afterwards," the IEC said. 
  Parties that have not yet applied had been given until 4.30 
PM on Friday, March 25, to submit lists of signatures as 
required by the Electoral Act. "If they supply adequate and 
proper lists, money from the electoral fund will be paid to 
them," the statement said.

  [Text] Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel is to remain in 
his post as the National Party [NP] premiership candidate in the 
Western Cape, despite the uproar over the alleged involvement by 
three police generals in a so-called third force. The uproar 
followed the release of a report by the Goldstone Commission of 
the involvement by the police and the Inkatha Freedom Party in 
violence and arm smuggling. 
  A spokesman from Mr. Kriel's office said the minister 
regarded the Goldstone findings as accusations and is awaiting 
the result of the international investigation team appointed by 
the state president.

<F P=106> [Report by Ray Hartley] </F>
  [Excerpt] The first cracks in the DP's [Democratic Party] 
traditional big-business support base appeared this week when 
Anglo American directors Clem Sunter and Michael O'Dowd placed 
their support for Frances Kendall's Federal Party [FP] on the 
record. Anglo American and De Beers have for years been regarded 
as the DP's most important business backers. Mr O'Dowd is 
chairman of the Anglo and De Beers Chairman's Fund, while Mr 
Sunter is the head of Anglo's Scenario Planning Department. 
  DP leader Zach de Beer said he would not comment on whether 
or not Anglo and De Beers continued to back his party. "That is 
for them to say," he added. And DP Transvaal leader Tony Leon 
dismissed the Federal Party, saying it would have as much effect 
as "a sneeze in a thunderstorm". 
  Mr Sunter, whose "high road, low road" scenario sketch 
largely coincided with the views of the DP and its predecessor, 
the Progressive Federal Party, said he was in favour of the FP's 
policy of decentralisation of power. "I haven't seen the (FP's) 
manifesto, but I'm betting on the lady. Frances is an 
outstanding person with a lot of spunk," he said. 
  In a statement released through the FP, Mr O'Dowd said: "I 
firmly support the constitutional proposals of the new FP. They 
are not wildly idealistic, as their critics will claim, but are 
based on the long experience of some very successful countries. 
Although the FP is obviously not going to form a government, I 
believe it is well worth voting for." 
  Miss Kendal said this week her party was aiming for five 
percent of the April vote. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by E. Oelofse] </F>
  [Text] Mmabatho March 21 SAPA -- The recently-appointed 
joint administrators of Bophuthatswana released a report at the 
weekend detailing their progress in the territory since the 
violence which toppled President Lucas Mangope. Signed by 
administrators Dr Job Mokgoro and Dr Tjaart van der Walt, the 
report states the "administration is now in the process of 
creating interim structures and mechanisms to address grievances 
presented by existing structures". 
  On the heated issue of pension funds, the administrators 
said: "for those who prefer to opt out, the office of the 
administrators has briefed pension experts to advise on the 
feasibility of, and mechanisms of, effecting pay-out." 
  Amid widespread claims of mismanagement and corruption of 
the 
Sefalana Employee Benefits Organisation (SEBO), the 
administrators have authorised an investigation into all SEBO's 
affairs. The investigating structure includes both employer and 
employee representatives. 
  Unfair dismissals under Mr Mangope are also being 
considered. 
The administrators stated they were aware "of a number of 
actions taken against employees, in particular in the public and 
and parastatal sectors, which were based on the so-called 
security laws of the former Bophuthatswana government. There is 
no doubt that in a normal democracy such laws have no place". A 
commitment is made to "reverse all dismissals and suspensions 
motivated by political considerations". 
  On the issue of "expatriate staff" the administrators said 
there were indications that some expatriates "have been 
excessively remunerated and many have allegedly been placed in 
positions for which they lack appropriate qualifications". This 
also would be redressed. 
  On security, the administrators would make "every effort" to 
revamp the security forces and immediately start the process of 
integrating them into appropriate forces within South Africa. 
  Employers in Bophuthatswana are urged to "handle cases of 
absenteeism with the greatest sympathy and sensitivity". 
However, the administrators appealed to all employees to return 
to work as soon as possible.

  [Text] Klerksdorp March 21 SAPA -- The murder of former 
Bophuthatswana MP Shadrack Kadi and his younger brother at 
Motswedi near Zeerust on Thursday [17 March] was on Monday 
condemned by the African National Congress [ANC] Western 
Transvaal branch. Mr Kadi was "necklaced". 
  The ANC said in a statement: "the tribal chief of Motswedi, 
Ramokopane Lentswe, has issued a statement saying that (Mr) Kadi 
was murdered by angry villagers and not members of the ANC. 
  "The ANC Western Transvaal region is categorically 
distancing 
itself from this murder and condemns in no unce?tain terms the 
callous murder of (Mr) Kadi. 
  "Although we understand the anger of the people who have 
been 
enslaved by (former Bophuthatswana President Lucas) Mangope for 
the past 16 years, we won't condone any murder of any kind".

  [Text] Capital outflow from South Africa is taking on 
mega-proportions. The Reserve Bank discloses in its Quarterly 
Bulletin that the net outflow of capital exploded to 
R16.3-billion [rand] last year from R3.7-billion in 1992. The 
cumulative net outflow since 1985 is now R49-billion. 
  The bank warns that the outflow could hurt the revival of 
economic activity and the attainment of financial stability. It 
ascribes the outflows to "political uncertainty, the ongoing 
internal unrest, pressure on the rand and the high cost of 
borrowing overseas." 
  The outflow also caused the net gold and foreign exchange 
reserves to plunge by R10.3-billion last year, forcing the bank 
to seek foreign loans. Figures in the bulletin show that SA 
[South Africa] made drawings of R7.1-billion on foreign credit 
facilities last year, including the R2.8-billion International 
Monetary Fund loan. 
  On a more positive note, the bank notes that the current 
account of the balance of payments improved from R3.9-billion in 
1992 to R5.9-billion last year and that foreigners were net 
buyers of JSE [Johannesburg Stock Exchange] shares worth 
R4.2-billion in 1993.

  [Text] Johannesburg Mar 22 SAPA -- Finance Minister Derek 
Keys expressed optimism Tuesday [22 March] on the economic 
policies of a future government, saying it was likely capital 
outflows would be reversed. 
  Capital outflows of over R16-billion [rand] had reached 
something of a "crescendo" last year due to political 
uncertainty and ongoing unrest, and total almost R50-billion 
since 1985 when the country introduced debt standstill 
arrangements. 
  "1994 looks as though its going to go in the other 
direction," he told a business breakfast in Johannesburg. 
"We've had two good months so far, and march also looks 
alright." 
  Mr Keys said SA's [South Africa] arrangements with its 
international creditor banks, worked out late last year, created 
a good long-term basis for the management of the country's 
capital account. He was confident the economic policies pursued 
by a government of national unity following April's elections 
would not divorce the country from the global economy. The 
country simply could not afford to adopt policies that would 
scare foreign investors as evidenced by SA's foreign exchange 
reserves which amounted to an alarmingly low level of five 
months of imports. 
  The long-term creation of sustainable jobs could not take 
place with the limited amount of capital available. Instead, 
above average economic growth would have to be achieved. 
  He expected the imperative of creating employment would 
drive 
the cabinet ministers responsible for the economy towards 
policies aimed at boosting growth. 
  Mr Keys said the consensual approach towards national 
economic policy determination augured well for a future 
government, as well as the ability of the country's enterprises 
to emerge from one of its worst recessions. "We're in good 
shape now for future growth. A lot of business in the last 
period have become more efficient," he said referring to the 
competitive pressure of the country's re-integration into 
international markets and systems like the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade.

  [Text] Johannesburg Mar 22 SAPA -- The country's first 
budget under the new government was likely to be presented 
before the end of August this year, Finance Minister Derek Keys 
said Tuesday [22 March] in Johannesburg. He told a business 
breakfast that the budget could be released earlier as the 
parties involved thought August was too close to the planning 
cycle needed for the following year's budget. 
  The budget therefore could be presented in July or as early 
as June, following the country's first all-race elections in 
April. 
  Due to the country's transition, a budget was not presented, 
traditionally in mid-March, for the new fiscal year which starts 
at the beginning of April. However, government budgets were 
extended by parliament earlier this year. 
  Mr Keys also revealed Tuesday the head of the finance, and 
state expenditure departments in conjunction with the finance 
sub-council of the Transitional Executive Council would outline 
next week the broad parameters of the first government's budget.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 21 SAPA -- Businessmen seemed to 
be "lulled into a false sense of security with the promises of 
stability and growth by President FW de Klerk" because of their 
impatience for a final political settlement, Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Monday [21 
March]. 
  Speaking at a Johannesburg business breakfast meeting, Mr 
Buthelezi said the interim constitution contained "all the 
unwanted baggage of the past -- the excesses of central 
government, a limited bill of rights and a politically malleable 
constitutional court". 
  The whole system remained top heavy and would continue the 
autocratic and authoritarian characteristics of the present 
government. The new provinces would not have a say on 
provincial matters such as civil service, police, audits, 
budgeting and finance, he said. 
  While the South African business community seemed complacent 
about the interim constitution, Mr Buthelezi said he was 
prepared to accept criticism for not taking part in the coming 
elections. 
  International mediation by constitutional experts would show 
the IFP's demands as fair and its concerns as legitimate, he 
said. 
  Mediation would address the question of Zulu 
self-determination and the status of the Zulu kingdom. It would 
help rationalise the electoral process and timetables so all 
parties could compete on an equal footing.

  [Excerpts] Thousands of public servants are taking early 
retirement ahead of the change in government. The number of 
vacancies in the public sector shot up 60 percent to 79,500 
between September 1992 and September 1993, according to Central 
Statistical Service [CSS]. Many are new jobs in provincial 
administration. Total public-sector employment, excluding the 
independent states, is 1.63-million. Including the independent 
states, the figure is 1.9- million. [passage omitted] 
  The Human Sciences Research Council found a near doubling in 
the number of public servants taking early retirement between 
1987 and 1992. The trend has accelerated in the last year, says 
the CSS. [passage omitted] 
  Total employment in the public sector fell by 3 percent, or 
50,816 jobs, in the year to September 1993. There was a 0.2 
percent decrease in employment in central government departments 
and provincial administrations, a 1.9 percent decrease in local 
authorities, 11.7 percent in public corporations and 20.7 
percent in agricultural boards. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pretoria Mar 21 SAPA -- The South African Defence 
Force [SADF] is calling up a "significant" number of part-time 
force members countrywide to assist the police before, during 
and after the April election. SADF chief General Georg Meiring 
said in a statement on Monday [21 March] the forces' involvement 
in the country's internal situation would be determined by the 
level of unrest or violence prevalent over the election period. 
  "The defence force, however, cannot afford to wait and see 
how the situation develops before making contingency plans to 
provide whatever support may be required. 
  "Therefore, after studying the likely scenarios and seen 
against the background of the present volatile situation, 
especially in certain areas of the country as well as the fact 
that the defence force was obliged to fill the gap left by the 
troops seconded to the NPKF (National Peacekeeping Force), we 
were left with no option other than to call up members of the 
part-time forces for service," Gen Meiring said. 
  He said the presence of the troops would release more 
policemen to concentrate on routine policing and the protection 
of polling stations. 
  The call-up was being conducted on a decentralised basis 
throughout the country and although the majority were members of 
the South African Army, they also included members of the SA Air 
Force, SA Navy and SA Medical Services. 
  "I give the absolute asurance that we will call up only the 
minimum number needed to provide the support the defence force 
has predicted will be required," Gen Meiring said. 
  "The normal channel for applications for exemptions and 
deferments is in operation, but exemptions and deferments will 
only be granted in exceptional circumstances." 
  He appealed to those called up to report for service in the 
interests of stability, peace and an unrest and violence-free 
election. "If ever there was a time for all of us in the defence 
force to put our shoulders to the wheel and to make a personal 
sacrifice in the interests of all the people in our country, it 
is now," Gen Meiring said.

  [Text] Pietermaritzburg Mar 21 SAPA -- About 2,000 inmates 
broke out of the Pietermaritzburg prison building on Monday [21 
March] evening and gathered in the prison's courtyard. 
Correctional Services spokesman Brig Chris Olckers told SAPA 
police and SA Defence Force reinforcements had been called in 
and the courtyard had been cordoned off. 
  Brig Olckers said 120 inmates had been injured after 
prisoners started rioting and destroying prison property, 
including cells, the prison radio room, the prison chapel and 
the archives room, which had been completely gutted. He said the 
inmates had broken out of various prison sections into the 
courtyard using beds to ram down walls. 
  The situation was being monitored closely as was the case at 
the Pretoria prison where extensive damage was caused at "death 
row" on Monday. Inmates had set alight 18 cells and destroyed 
bedding, furniture and computer cables, but the situation was 
under control. 
  Prisoners have embarked on protest actions countrywide, 
demanding the right to vote in the April election.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  Goldstone Unfair to Police Generals in Gun Running Probe -- 
"We would be the first to condemn any police involvement in 
Third Force activities," declares the page-6 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 21 March. "However, we 
do not think that Mr Justice Richard Goldstone has been fair to 
the three police generals who were said to have been involved in 
gun running and other activities. He admitted that the prime 
facie, untested evidence should be subjected to the normal 
judicial processes." Therefore, if any policeman is guilty of 
being involved in Third Force activities, "he deserves to be 
prosecuted and punished. Conversely, if some or all of them, 
including the generals, have been unjustly maligned, then we 
hope their names will be cleared if not by the commission, then 
by the courts." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Call for Security Forces Deployment in Natal -- "For two 
weekends in succession the ANC [African National Congress] has 
been unable to hold planned rallies in townships near Durban," 
notes a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 
22 March. "On the first IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] zealots 
occupied a stadium in Umlazi which had been booked in advance by 
the ANC; on the second `Zulus', suspected of being IFP 
loyalists, again thwarted the ANC by occupying a stadium in 
kwaMashu. Major conflict was avoided but the portents of a 
major disaster are there for all to see." It is "good" that the 
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is "sufficiently 
concerned" to arrange meetings with President de Klerk, Nelson 
Mandela, and the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly. But, "it is not 
enough," and security forces must be "deployed in strength, not 
to overthrow Mangosuthu Buthelezi but to ensure that all parties 
have the right to campaign peacefully and that all voters have 
the right to vote or not to vote. The situation must not be 
allowed to degenerate into chaos." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Call for No Vote for Prisoners -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY 
in English on 22 March in a page-14 editorial remarks that "the 
TEC [Transitional Executive Council] has shown little backbone, 
particularly for anything the ANC does not want. The ANC is 
among the parties wanting to slip a ballot paper under every 
cell door. Prison riots may be all that is needed to persuade 
the council that any perpetrator of any crime, no matter how 
heinous, should have a say in the composition of the next 
government. The answer to that proposition must remain a firm 
no." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  `Unrealistic Expectations' of Prisoners -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 22 March in a page-10 editorial is "aghast 
at the violence that has led to the death of 23 people in prison 
riots." "The Prisons Department, unhappily, is shrouded in 
secrecy forced upon it by apartheid laws. Such laws must 
disappear in the South Africa of the future. Those friends of 
the prisoners, who may be sparking unrealistic expectations, 
should be wary of causing more harm than help to their charges." 
<H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>
  Zwelithini, Buthelezi Conceal True Intentions -- 
Johannesburg 
CITY PRESS in English on 20 March in a page-18 editorial is not 
surprised by the proclamation on 18 March of a sovereign 
kwaZulu/natal kingdom by Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
Zwelithini and Chief Minister Buthelezi "were determined to 
break up this country. However, they concealed their true 
intentions with claims that all they wanted was greater powers 
for the regions. Now, the pretence is over. By this decision 
King Goodwill and Chief Buthelezi and the King must be stopped. 
We cannot allow a coterie of power-hungry potentates to 
dismember the country." "The unpalatable truth is that 
Buthelezi was never keen on testing his popularity at the polls. 
All that he wanted was kwaZulu/Natal. To achieve that he seems 
prepared to go to any lengths."

  [Text] There have been scores of deaths, maybe 100 in 
Burundi. This is the sad result of a weekend of clashes between 
Tutsis and Hutus in the capital, Bujumbura. Burundi has not 
come out of the infernal cycle of violence and reprisals, and 
people are living in fear. Jean-Michel Mostaert reports: 
  [Mostaert] Everything started on Saturday [19 March] morning 
with a grenade attack on a bus in the district of Rusaka, east 
of Bujumbura. Four passengers were killed. All were members of 
the Tutsi community. Immediately, the Tutsis wanted revenge; 
they attacked members of the Hutu community, while Tutsis were 
victims of reprisals in the areas with a Hutu majority. 
  These fresh interethnic clashes are reported to have led to 
scores of deaths, maybe 100. They reveal the tense atmosphere 
which is continuing in Burundi almost five months after the 
abortive military coup of October, when almost 100,000 people 
were killed in interethnic violence. Since then, the 
authorities have not managed to restore a minimum of trust 
between the two communities. On the contrary; in the capital, 
Bujumbura, Tutsis and Hutus now live entrenched in their 
districts. Many are armed and the slightest incident leads to 
bloody reprisals. 
  The government seems to be powerless. It is divided on 
whether to disarm people or not. A UN mission is to arrive in 
Burundi tomorrow. It will investigate the situation in the 
country. It will only be able to see the drift of Burundi, 
which is sinking deeper and deeper into chaos.

  [Text] Cotonou, 21 Mar (AFP) -- Clashes occurred between 
security forces and students this afternoon in Cotonou. About 
3,000 students demanded an audience with President Nicephore 
Soglo to present their grievances, an AFP correspondent said. 
  At least one student was wounded during the clashes and two 
demonstrators were arrested. An earlier demonstration took 
place on 17 March when 3,000 students joined the march in the 
center of Cotonou. 
  Beninese students are demanding the doubling of their 
current 
scholarships in order to cushion the impact of the devaluation 
of the CFA franc that took place on 11 January. They are also 
protesting the expulsion of two of their comrades who are union 
leaders from the university accused of triggering disturbances 
on the Calavi Campus (15 km north-east of Cotonou) at the 
beginning of last month. Since then, the teachers of the 
National University of Benin had embarked on a strike to demand 
the reinforcement of security on the campus.

  [Text] The topic under discussion at the peace talks in 
Lusaka, Zambia, is still national reconciliation. The National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] still insists 
on its way. Our correspondent Joao Ligio reports: 
  [Ligio] The discussion of specific principles for national 
reconciliation entered its fifth week today with the same 
routine of exploratory contacts and no fruitful results. This 
morning, the Black Cockerel's men drafted a new text in which 
they accept the government's proposal, with the condition that 
the following is added: Three more provinces, three ministries, 
and three districts, all in the central plateau. This proposal 
was, however, immediately turned down by the mediator without 
the need to consult the government delegation. 
  This afternoon, the mediator handed the parties the final 
version, which includes all principles, even those on which the 
parties disagree. The parties must present their reactions to 
this document by tomorrow, since the mediator is adopting a time 
limit for consideration.

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] Sharpeville 
celebrations kicked off with a mass rally a the Odi Stadium in 
Mabopane outside Pretoria this morning. ANC President Nelson 
Mandela's address was scheduled to start at nine. It was his 
first visit to the area, and the crowd waited patiently in the 
scorching morning sun. They had come to see Madiba [one who 
joins together] and listen to him, and they were willing to 
wait. Finally he arrived more than two hours later. Recent 
revelations by the Goldstone commission implicating senior 
police generals in third force activities, formed the crux of 
his message. He said indemnity for security force and police 
members was a possibility. 
  [Begin Mandela recording] We must seriously consider the 
question of giving indemnity to the those police and offices of 
the Defence Force who would like to confess about the criminal 
activities of certain offices in the police force. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Sharpeville March 21 SAPA -- A furious African 
National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela on Monday [21 
March] berated party organisers for the chaotic conditions at 
one of the ANC's biggest election rallies yet in Sharpeville on 
Monday. About 75,000 people waited much of the day for the ANC 
president at Miami Beach, a popular picnic resort at the dusty 
Vaal Triangle township where police shot dead 69 protesters 34 
years ago. 
  Just how much has changed in the intervening years was 
demonstrated by the brazen display of weaponry, including AK-47 
rifles, handguns, axes and assegais carried by rallygoers. 
Sporadic gunfire was heard from time to time and stones were 
thrown at people who refused to sit when the ANC president began 
his address. 
  Earlier marshals battled to control the crowd as it thronged 
forward to get a glimpse of Mr Mandela when he arrived. Nobody 
appeared to be injured but several people fainted due to the 
heat. There were anxious moments as mr mandela's motorcade 
inched through the crowd. 
  Mr Mandela, thanking the crowd for their turnout, then 
lashed 
out at the ANC's organisers. "I must condemn in the strongest 
terms their lack of organisation and their inability to 
anticipate the crowds. 
  "It's lucky that nobody has died. I don't want to see this 
again. If I see such a mess I will have to deal with the region 
and the branch," he said. 
  At one stage, Mr Mandela stopped his address to remonstrate 
with some "ruffians" and at another point he complained about 
the rough manner in which marshals handled the crowd. 
  Mr Mandela, referring to the 1960 killings, said there would 
never be a Sharpeville again. 
  He then turned to the election campaign, saying the ANC 
wanted a better life for all. That included houses, education 
and medical care. He said the ANC's opponents said the ANC was 
being over-ambitious. What they meant by this, he said, was that 
providing social services to blacks would be too costly. But the 
ANC was determined to go ahead with its plans whether its 
opponents liked it or not. 
  "The National Party has never cared for the masses of this 
country," he said. 
  Mr Mandela, referring to the interim Goldstone Commission 
report concerning alleged gunrunning said to involve senior 
policemen, he said there were good policemen in the force and 
good soldiers in the South African Defence Force. 
  He then led the crowd through the voting procedure, telling 
them they must look for his face on the ballot paper and put 
their cross alongside that face. 
  The roads of Sharpeville were crowded with buses taking 
supporters home when the rally finished. Sporadic gunfire 
punctuated the din. 
  Earlier, Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] President Clarence 
Makwetu addressed about 3,000 people at the George Thabe stadium 
about three kilometres away. Mr Makwetu said the ANC had not 
wanted to become involved when the PAC launched the pass 
protests that led to the Sharpeville killings. 
  He said only the PAC had stuck to its principles and only 
the 
PAC could ensure real liberation. The PAC's rhetoric at the 
rally, complete with "one settler, one bullet", was more 
militant than the ANC version. But the gathering itself was 
quieter.

  [Excerpts] The situation has not been totally peaceful 
since the adoption of the decisions on security measures. 
However, people in some suburbs have behaved and people have 
been able to sleep, while others continue to shoot and throw 
explosive devices. Our colleague Emmanuel Nzeyimana asked Major 
Bambara in charge of security in Bujumbura town for more details 
on the security situation last night. Here he is: 
  [Begin recording] [Bambara] Things are not as bad as they 
were last night. In Nyakabiga the situation has improved but in 
Cibitoke, Kamenge, and Kinama people continued shooting as 
usual. In fact, yesterday they started the shooting earlier. A 
military vehicle that was transporting food for the soldiers was 
shot at in front of the zonal headquarters at 1700. Three 
soldiers were injured. The shooting continued until this 
morning. They were targeting military positions in particular. 
That is how the security situation looks. There are not enough 
of them to cause a disturbance. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Many measures were taken 
yesterday which are related to restoring security [words 
indistinct]. How far have you gotten? 
  [Bambara] We started yesterday, since we were yesterday 
ordered to put soldiers into position. We brought them in 
yesterday evening. 
  We have already arrested a good number of people, especially 
in the Cibitoke area. We have also seized a few weapons. They 
are still continuing even now, they have been shooting at 
security agents. [passage omitted] There are not many of them. 
They shoot in groups of two to three, then change position, 
moving behind houses so that we also shoot at houses. But we 
are aware of this and that is why we do not respond, we just 
wait. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Today, the Council of Ministers had a very busy 
schedule. It had to interrupt its proceedings because certain 
ministers requested a close examination of security issues. A 
delegation led by the defense minister and including two chiefs 
of staff, the head of the Intelligence Department, and a 
representative of the Justice Ministry has been [words 
indistinct] to the spot and was due to give a detailed report to 
the president of the Republic before the Council's proceedings 
resumed. 
  The Council effectively resumed its proceedings this 
afternoon at 1500 hours, but nothing has yet been disclosed from 
the Council, even though rumors say steps have been taken. 
  Meanwhile, the security situation in Bujumbura town remains 
chaotic, especially in the areas of Kinama, Kamenge, and 
Cibitoke where sporadic firing is still heard. People have been 
panicking in other areas such as (Kanyorka). [passage omitted] 
  We would to add that soldiers and policemen are still 
present 
in almost all the areas of the capital and that public transport 
was at a standstill all day, which, of course, affected 
activities in Bujumbura.

  [Excerpt] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had sent 
a delegation to Burundi to establish real facts following the 
attempted military coup of last October and the subsequent 
massacres. The delegation arrived this morning. It is headed 
by Ambassador Simeon Ake. In his statement upon arrival at the 
international airport of Bujumbura, Ambassador Ake said that his 
delegation will have an exclusively political mission and not a 
judiciary one. 
  Second, the mission will examine in close consultation with 
the Government of Burundi and the UN special representative to 
Burundi, urgent activities to be done by the United Nations 
under the auspices of the UN secretary general, in compliance 
with the statement issued by the chairman of the UN Security 
Council last 25 November. 
  During their two or three-week stay to Burundi, the 
delegation will meet senior government personalities, as well as 
representatives of security forces, together with 
representatives of political parties and local organizations 
which will have expressed the need to meet them. They will also 
meet with the ambassadors of UN member states, representatives 
of specialized institutions within the UN system, and other 
intergovernmental and regional organizations such as the OAU and 
representatives of nongovernmental organizations. [passage

  [Excerpts] According to the communique that has just been 
issued by the Presidency after President Habyarimana's meeting 
with Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, President Habyarimana 
reportedly informed Faustin Twagiramungu of his readiness to 
preside over the swearing-in ceremonies on 24 March. However, 
the communique shows that President Habyarimana has created new 
obstacles. Among them we can mention those related to the 
Liberal Party [PL] ministers and the question of the Islamic 
Democratic Party [PDI] deputies. The other question raised by 
President Habyarimana is that of the Coalition for the Defense 
of the Republic [CDR]. 
  Concerning the PL's minister, President Habyarimana is said 
to have asked Faustin Twagiramungu to continue talks with PL 
officials so that the justice ministerial post goes to the 
faction which has five deputies, namely Mugenzi's [PL chairman 
and Habyarimana ally] faction, claiming that this was agreed at 
the meeting he chaired on 27 February. Now that President 
Habyarimana has given an order to Twagiramungu, why does 
Twagiramungu have to meet PL officials? This clearly means that 
President Habyarimana is denying Faustin Twagiramungu the 
freedom of choice that was bestowed on him by the Arusha peace 
agreement. He is giving him orders on how to select and fill 
posts. It is worth recalling that President Habyarimana 
continues to torpedo the peace agreement. The agreement only 
allows him to preside over the swearing-in ceremonies and not to 
interfere with what does not concern him. Maybe he believes 
agreements are still mere pieces of paper. 
  With regard to deputies, President Habyarimana went too far. 
In the communique issued by the presidency, President 
Habyarimana is said to have asked Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana to ensure that hindrances to the inclusion of the 
CDR in the National Assembly are removed. What can remove these 
obstacles? First, the CDR has not signed the political parties' 
code of ethics. One may recall how the CDR refused to sign that 
code. It does not even qualify to sign the code since it is 
against its contents. 
  Since the signing of the Arusha agreement, the CDR has been 
promoting division and misunderstanding among Rwandans. In fact 
it should be banned. However, it will die a natural death since 
it owes its existence to the dictatorship. Once the 
dictatorship disappears, the CDR will disappear because it will 
have no platform and no audience. Habyarimana, who wants a seat 
for the CDR in the National Assembly, should remember that we do 
not need a transition to destroy the country, we need one to 
build it. He is once again interfering in questions that do not 
concern him. He is not responsible for the issue of deputies. 
  The same thing applies to the PDI. Habyarimana has asked 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana to ensure that the PDI 
deputy has the support of the party. He wants to do the same 
thing he is doing in regard to the PL. The candidate who was 
elected a long time ago [words indistinct] 37 days, would be 
replaced by Habyarimana with one chosen recently with the help 
of a small group of his supporters in the PDI. [passage omitted] 
  President Habyarimana's readiness to preside over the 
swearing-in ceremonies on 24 March is no different from his 
readiness to preside over the swearing-in ceremonies on the 
other dates he suggested. Perhaps he hopes his wishes will be 
respected through terror. These days he uses terrorism. He 
showed it in the communique. He said he expressed his 
dissatisfaction to Faustin Twagiramungu over the bad language 
used in his address announcing the list of ministers. Judging 
from the contents of the communique, one wonders whether 
Habyarimana is really seeking to implement the Arusha agreement 
or whether he just wants Rwandans' problems to remain. It is 
clear that he is capable of this. No one will extricate 
Rwandans from the current situation; they will have to do it 
themselves.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister-designate Faustin </F>
Twagiramungu by Colette Braeckman; place and date not given: 
"Rwanda: A Government at Last?"] 
  [Text] In a serious voice, his eyes fixed on his watch, 
Faustin Twagiramungu, the prime minister-designate by the Arusha 
accords, has announced the list of members of the broader-based 
transitional government that will govern Rwanda for a period of 
two years prior to elections. "I have decided to take the 
initiative, to assume my responsibilities," he tells us. "The 
peace accord must be applied. There has been too much delay. 
This time, everybody has his back to the wall...." 
  After reading his statement, the president of the principal 
opposition party, the Rwandan Democratic Movement, promptly 
returned home. Like all the country's politicians, he fears 
assassination. This weekend Rwanda was torn between hope and 
fear: Hope of finally seeing the country break the political 
deadlock and acquire a responsible government and fear of 
renewed violence that would once again block the transition. 
  This time the countdown will be short: The prime 
minister-designate has requested the president of the Republic 
to set, by 21 March, the date on which he will swear in the new 
government, which will consist of five ministers from the 
Patriotic Front. If he does not receive a positive reply by 
this deadline, Twagiramungu will act to strictly apply the 
Arusha accords, by the terms of which, if the head of state 
fails to fulfill his obligations, the prime minister can himself 
swear in the government with the assistance of the president of 
the Constitutional Court and the agreement of the outgoing prime 
minister. 
  Despite the danger of open and violent confrontation with 
those who are trying to delay the transition indefinitely, a 
number of reasons have encouraged Twagiramungu to assume his 
responsibilities: "I cannot relinquish my rights to found a 
government in favor of a president of the Republic who 
interferes in the internal affairs of the parties and seeks to 
impose those parties which are favorable to him. Also, I have 
reached an agreement with the parties which were preventing the 
new government from taking office, the Rwandan Democratic 
Movement and the Liberal Party." 
  Twagiramungu has in fact made room for an opposition leader 
within his own party, namely the former Prime Minister Dismas 
Nsengiyarenye, and has also acted to settle divisions which were 
tearing apart the Liberal Party, entrusting the Justice Ministry 
to a "third man." Aloys Nyuhita belongs neither to the "Hutu" 
faction, which has close links with the president's party, nor 
to the "Tutsi" faction, which is accused of being an "objective 
ally" of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. The question of whether 
or not the Justice Ministry should be entrusted to a 
representative of the radical opposition or a member of the 
Liberal Party linked to the president's party is a crucial one: 
It is the justice minister who must decide who is responsible 
for the wave of violence, attacks, and assassinations that have 
shaken Rwanda over recent years. 
  After lengthy negotiations, the prime minister-designate 
thus 
believes that, for his part, "everything is ready: I have 
reached an agreement with the different parties, allocated posts 
in accordance with the representativeness of all the parties, 
and none of them may claim to have been excluded. The ball is 
no longer in my court." 
<H5>  Repeated Pressure </H5>
  Mr. Twagiramungu has spoken out after a week of intense 
negotiations conducted with all the political parties, including 
the Patriotic Front, by the Tanzanian foreign minister, who 
returned home without result but who did exert pressure on the 
prime minister-designate to move away from entrenchment. "I 
have the support of the whole international community," 
Twagiramungu said, "of the Tanzanian facilitator, of the UN 
representative, who has constantly repeated that by 5 April the 
Security Council will reconsider the mandate of the blue 
helmets, and of Western observers. If my list is not accepted 
by the head of state, it will be clear for all to see who is 
really responsible for the deadlock." 
  Will President Habyarimana finally agree to swear in a 
transitional government in which he has no blocking minority, or 
will renewed violence, orchestrated by the political militia, 
once again break out during the next few days? Rwanda has 
genuinely reached a crossroads: It will either disintegrate 
into self- destructive violence, as has neighboring Burundi, or 
it will adhere to the Arusha accords and commit itself to 
power-sharing between the Hutu majority and the Patriotic Front. 
"This democratic process, which is facing incredible 
resistance, is, for Rwanda, a revolution more important than in 
1959, because at the end of the road, what we ultimately 
envisage is national reconciliation, and the creation of a state 
founded on the rule of law," concluded Twagiramungu, before 
crossing a capital where, as soon as night falls, the only 
vehicles on the roads are the jeeps of the Belgian blue helmets.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi this 
afternoon opened the third session of the Seventh Parliament 
with a renewed call on parliamentarians to conduct themselves 
honorably both inside and outside Parliament. The president 
told parliamentarians to use parliamentary time to promote the 
welfare of their constituents, adding that this could only be 
done in an atmosphere of tolerance and appreciation of each 
other's point of view without resorting to violence. Stressing 
that true democracy can only thrive in an environment of give 
and take, President Moi urged the members to support each other 
for the prosperity of this nation. 
  The president said he expected Kenya African National Union 
MPs to support motions sponsored by the opposition if they are 
geared towards the common good of Kenyans. He likewise told the 
opposition to support government-sponsored motions rather than 
oppose them for the sake of opposing. 
  President Moi cited the current famine that has hit most 
parts of the country as one of the issues that called for a 
united approach by both the government and the opposition to 
tackle. He said because of the prolonged drought and harsh 
economic conditions that have made it difficult for most farmers 
to purchase required farm inputs, about 5 million Kenyans need 
food assistance. Noting that a hungry Kenyan cares little about 
political affiliations, President Moi expressed gratitude to 
those parliamentarians who had worked with the government to 
reach out to famine-stricken Kenyans. The president at the same 
time thanked Kenyans and friendly nations who have responded 
positively to his appeal for food assistance. 
  President Moi further pointed out that many Kenyans were 
faced with economic hardship resulting from the current 
implementation of the structural adjustment program. He, 
however, assured Kenyans that the government had developed a 
safety program to alleviate their suffering. The president told 
Kenyans that they were free to offer their suggestions aimed at 
improving their socio-economic status. [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, President Moi asked the MP's to stand up and 
observe 
a minute's silence in memory of the late Oginga Odinga and Dr. 
Josephat Karanja. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A ceremony in Nairobi during which Somali's 15 main 
factions were to present a declaration of national 
reconciliation was postponed at the last minute today. 
Announced by a UN spokesman, the postponement, for which no 
explanation was given, put the future of UN-sponsored talks in 
Nairobi into jeopardy. It was the second delay in the meeting, 
which had originally been planned for last Sunday [20 March] 
before this too was canceled at the last moment. On Monday, the 
UN spokesman had high hopes for the planned ceremony, saying it 
represented a major step forward for Somalia and he was certain 
it would go ahead. 
  The faction leaders, including bitter rivals Mohamed Farah 
Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, have been engaged in talks in 
Nairobi for the last eight days.

  [Text] Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid, chairman of the Somali 
National Alliance [SNA] Higher Committee for Internal Affairs, 
today delivered a briefing on the general security situation in 
the SNA-controlled areas. He said security in these areas was 
good by virtue of SNA supporters discharging their 
responsibilities towards the Somali people's unity and love of 
peace. He said: It is important to note the existence of 
bandit gangs taking advantage of the difficult times in the 
country to rob and kill Somalis. He called on the bandits to 
stop causing chaos in Mogadishu, the capital, and in the regions 
and on the people collectively to counter the bandits. 
  Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid also said the United States and 
other forces were about to leave the country at the end of this 
month. It was now time for the Somali people to decide their 
destiny. He said: It is our duty to respect the departing 
forces, as well as other foreigners and foreign journalists, 
while upholding the Somali people's dignity and rights. Somali 
people must stop shooting and killing, which is illegal. 
  He also referred to the formation of SNA district councils 
which was at an advanced stage and complete in some regions, 
such as Shabeellaha Hoose and Benaadir. He said some had been 
illegally formed by UN Operation in Somalia, but most Somalis 
realized that was a mistake. By contrast, the other district 
councils were formed according to the SNA leader's circular of 
28 October 1993. 
  Referring to the confusion at Mogadishu port over taxes, 
Abdi 
Qaybdid said: It is illegal and irrelevant in the absence of 
[words indistinct] that can guarantee the collection of taxes, 
adding that no foreign company had the right to levy taxes at 
Mogadishu port. 
  On the drought in the central regions, he said: Lack of 
water and food combined with ill health is killing five to 10 
people a day. He appealed to the relief organizations, the 
Somali people and the international community to help these 
areas by sending food, water and medicine to save the community 
which is on the verge of death. 
  In conclusion, Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid, the chairman of 
the 
higher committee for internal affairs, called on the Somali 
people to reconcile and unite to achieve progress and justice.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Guinea-Bissau's first ever multiparty elections have 
been postponed. Although no new dates have been set, they 
should happen before the middle of this year. President Vieira 
led a one-party state in Guinea-Bissau for 12 years until 
opposition parties were legalized in 1992. And this morning, he 
summoned foreign diplomats to explain the reasons for the 
postponement. British Honorary Consul Ian Van Manin was there. 
On the line to Bissau, Alice Martin asked him what had caused 
the delay: 
  [Begin recording] [Manin] The reason is that the National 
Election Committee has not been able to organize in time the 
electoral census. The electoral census is a process before the 
actual elections to make sure that all the voters get registered 
and get a card so that on the day of the election people can be 
identified as legal voters. It is the first time they have a 
big operation like this in this country, and I think they sort 
of underestimated the work linked with the preparation of the 
elections. The president announced that there will be elections 
before the rainy season but only after the electoral census has 
been completed, which is, of course, logical. We, ourselves, 
are sort of speculating that the last logical physical moment to 
have the elections will be in the first week of June. 
  [Martin] Do you think that the electoral census can be 
compiled and completed by June? 
  [Manin] I think if everybody is of goodwill the census can 
be 
done in about six weeks, making it even possible to have 
elections at the end of May. I think they can do it. 
  [Martin] Given that international funds are available for 
this electoral census to be done, are there any other reasons 
why they have been delayed? I mean, for instance, is the 
president really willing to go ahead with the elections? 
  [Manin] I am pretty sure he is. He sounded very serious and 
sounded even upset to sort of admit that there have been these 
problems. But, you see, to hold elections is not only a matter 
of money. Money can be made available easily. But, to give an 
example, part of the delay was that there's been a fraud already 
with the application of the recruitment of these people. The 
National Election Committee had a small fee for each application 
form that they issued to possible candidates, and they issued 
6,000 forms. They only needed 1,200 candidates. But fairly 
soon, these forms were available at sort of black-market rate of 
10 or 20 times the price. People applying and buying these 
forms had an idea they already had the job. That, of course, 
wasn't true. They only selected 1,200, and especially those 
people who paid a lot of money for these forms were very angry. 
  [Martin] What is the opposition saying about the delay? 
  [Manin] Well, I haven't seen Joao da Costa recently, but 
yesterday I had a meeting with the leader of the Bafata 
Movement. Well, they sort of accept that there is certain 
incompetence with the National Election Committee. On the other 
hand, they understand what is happening. Of course, I think it 
is the opposition's right to attack the government party on 
this, and say: Well, it is all on purpose and it is all done to 
exhaust our funds. The longer the parties have to wait for the 
election, the more money they spend. But if there are elections 
now, as I said, at the end of May or beginning of June, they 
would have run out of money completely. [end recording]

  [Text] The head of state today held discussions for nearly 
two hours at his private residence in Lome II with opposition 
leaders, Yaovi Agboyibor of the Action Committee for Renewal and 
Edem Kodjo of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]. After the 
audience, the two leaders said they held talks with the head of 
state on the appointment of a new prime minister. The two 
political leaders will be meeting tomorrow with the head of 
state at the latter's residence to continue the discussions. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] The president 
has just received you and Edem Kodjo. What was the purpose of 
your discussions? 
  [Agboyibor] During the last discussion we had with the head 
of state, we expressed the desire to be received together with 
UTD. The opportunity was offered us and we have continued our 
reflections on the choice of a prime minister. The meeting 
lasted for some time, and we decided to meet tomorrow at 1100 to 
discuss the same issue. 
  [Correspondent] Does that mean that you have not yet agreed 
on the choice of a prime minister? 
  [Agboyibor] It simply means that the consultations continue. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency, I put the same question to 
you. 
  [Kodjo] As my colleague has rightly pointed out, the 
discussions continue. They have been very interesting, and we 
will resume the talks tomorrow at 1100. 
  [Correspondent] The people are waiting. They hope to obtain 
a reply at all costs. Are you ready to make concrete proposals 
to put an end to this wait? 
  [Kodjo] That is precisely the purpose of these 
consultations.

  [Text] Slowly but surely, democratic institutions are being 
put in place in Togo. The cohabitation is already under way. 
The new parliament met this afternoon at the Palais de Congres 
under the supervision of their chairman. Adjoa Ayizouwa reports. 
  [Begin Ayizouwa recording] Today, no one contests the fact 
that Togo has become a full member of the community of 
democratic nations. After the democratic presidential election 
of last 25 August, which was won by the candidate of the Rally 
of the Togolese People, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, who assumed 
office a month later, the new National Assembly democratically 
elected in February met this afternoon. The 81 legislators, 
elected for five-year terms, met in accordance with Article 52 
of the Constitution which stipulates that the elected National 
Assembly shall meet on the second Tuesday following the official 
proclamation of the results. 
  The meeting was chaired by Ayetor Yentumi Kouassi, deputy 
for 
Wawa, who had by his side the youngest member of parliament, 
Oyenga Aguta, deputy for Fante. The meeting began with the 
parliamentarians observing a minute's silence in memory of those 
who laid down their lives for the cause of democracy, in 
particular, their colleague Ede Gaston, the slain deputy of the 
Action Committee for Renewal. This was followed by the national 
anthem and then the opening address made by Ayetor Yentumi 
Kouassi. The Wawa deputy seized the opportunity to congratulate 
his colleagues for the trust placed in them by the people. He 
then spoke of the purpose of this afternoon's meeting. He said 
the session was being held in accordance with constitutional 
provisions with a view to enabling the members to become 
familiar with each other. 
  He did not forget to thank all those who in one way or the 
other contributed to this historic work, in particular, the head 
of state, the government as a whole, the International 
Monitoring Committee, the National Electoral Commission, the 
Supreme Court, the military and civilian observers and Force 93. 
Finally, he invited the new members to put themselves at the 
service of the nation. He then introduced the members of 
parliament and the meeting ended after a nine-member commission 
was set up to draw up the draft rules of procedure of the 
National Assembly. It is composed in principle of two members 
of each party represented in Parliament. The next meeting of 
parliament is slated for 29 March. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria March 22 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] on Tuesday [22 March] night decided that Ciskei 
head of state Brig Oupa Gqozo should be replaced by two 
administrators appointed by the TEC and the South African 
Government. African National Congress Secretary General Cyril 
Ramaphosa said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately 
to relieve Brig Gqozo of his post. 
  He was supported by government delegate Roelf Meyer. He said 
the South African Defence Force could become involved in 
restoring law and order in the territory. 
  Ciskei representative Mickey Webb said the homeland had 
requested South African Police and SA Defence Force intervention. 
  Mr Meyer said a South African Government representative, 
Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans, should be 
dispatched to the homeland. 
  Mr Webb said it was not a hostile takeover. He said Brig 
Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he wanted to save 
lives and prevent destruction of property. 
  He said the Ciskei cabinet should draft a decree giving 
effect to the TEC's resolution. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the Ciskei government had lost control in 
the homeland. "There is no way Brig Gzozo can begin to reinstate 
himself as head of the area. It is not out of kindness that he 
is stepping down." 
  TEC Chairman Pravin Gordhan said the TEC acknowledged that 
Brig Gqozo was stepping down. 
  He said a two-member team from the management committee 
would 
be sent to Ciskei. The TEC team would be assisted by Mr Evans as 
well as trade unionist Philip Dexter and Administration minister 
Sam de Beer who have been appointed by the TEC to oversee civil 
service rationalisation. 
  Mr Webb said Brig Gqozo's proposal that he step down was 
tabled to the TEC at lunchtime. 
  Mr Ramaphosa confirmed that the SAP's [South African Police] 
Internal Stability Unit had been deployed in the homeland and 
suggested it be withdrawn as there were indications that they 
would clash with Ciskei government troops.

  [Text] Bisho March 22 SAPA -- Ciskei's military is, along 
with striking members of the homeland's police force, reportedly 
refusing to obey orders. A spokesman for the police strikers, 
Sgt H J Hewana, said on Tuesday [22 March] night that Ciskei 
leader Brig Oupa Gqozo had ordered his troops to cordon off the 
Ciskei police college, comandeered earlier by the strikers, but 
they had refused. He also said soldiers had informed strikers 
they would hand over the commissioner of police, Maj Gen M 
Noqayi. 
  He was apparently in the homeland's state house and the 
military said they would wait until he came out and then take 
him captive. 
  The striking policemen earlier said they wanted to arrest 
Gen 
Noqayi in connection with corruption charges. They have also 
taken 15 Ciskei police officers hostage. 
  At 8pm the strikers sent an armed delegation to fetch Gen 
Noqayi. A member of a delegation that met Brig Gqozo said the 
Ciskei ruler gave the assurance that none of the strikers would 
be arrested. 
  At 7.45PM one of the protest leaders, W/O [Warrant Officer] 
A 
K Mfene, asked his colleagues in the college hall to stand up as 
a token of respect for "all the unnecessary lives" they had 
taken. 
  Sgt Hewana said he had heard second-hand reports that SA 
transitional adminstrators would be appointed to govern Ciskei. 
He said strikers would not believe this until they heard it from 
senior political figures in the Border/Kei region. 
  The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday night 
decided that Brig Gqozo should be replaced by two administrators 
appointed by the TEC and the South African Government. 
  African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa 
said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately to relieve 
Brig Gqozo of his post. 
  Government TEC representative Roelf Meyer said a South 
Africa's Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans should be 
dispatched to the homeland. 
  The Ciskei's Mickey Webb said it was not a hostile takeover. 
He said Brig Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he 
wanted to save lives and prevent destruction of property.

  [Text] Bisho March 22 SAPA--Striking Ciskei policemen have 
been told the territory's leader Brig Oupa Gqozo has stepped 
down -- but have refused to release at 15 police officers they 
took hostage on Tuesday [22 March]. The news was conveyed to 
them shortly after 8PM by South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, 
Mr Piet Goosen. 
  Mr Goosen was escorted to a hall at the Bisho police 
college, 
where the strikers have been for most of the day, by members of 
the Border Regional Peace Committee. 
  He read them a statement issued earlier by Foreign Affairs 
Minister Pik Botha. "The administration of Ciskei shall 
henceforth from tomorrow be by an administrator." He could not 
divulge the name but "I assure you that you know the gentleman 
in question...you will have faith in his ability to ensure a 
clean administration". 
  He said it was in their interests and that of every citizen 
of Ciskei in South Africa that they did their best not to 
contribute to the "very volatile situation that exists". 
  He pleaded for them to go back to work and asked them to 
"please" release two seconded South African policemen they were 
holding hostage. 
  The hall erupted in jeers and boos. 
  The appeal for the release was echoed by co-chairman of the 
peace committee Rev Godfrey Leeuw. 
  Speakers from the floor said angrily that "no-one will leave 
this door until Brig Oupa Gqozo comes to address us". 
  A speaker gave the ambassador the assurance the officers 
would not be harmed. 
  Another speaker said "the ambassador must go put pressure on 
Gqozo to come address us tonight if the hostages are to be 
released here". 
  Mr Goosen then left for nearby King William's Town saying he 
would telephone the Ciskei leader and put the proposal to him. 
  The rest of Bisho was calm. 
  The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday night 
decided that Brig Gqozo should be replaced by two administrators 
appointed by the TEC and the South African Government. 
  African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa 
said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately to relieve 
Brig Gqozo of his post. 
  Government TEC representative Roelf Meyer said a South 
Africa's Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans should be 
dispatched to the homeland. 
  The Ciskei's Mickey Webb said it was not a hostile takeover. 
He said Brig Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he 
wanted to save lives and prevent destruction of property.

  [Text] Pretoria Mar 22 SAPA -- South African Defence Force 
[SADF] troops will be stationed on full alert along the Ciskei 
border with immediate effect, Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee 
announced on Tuesday [22 March] night. Mr Coetsee said: "In view 
of the unrest and prevailing conditions in Ciskei it has been 
decided to place SADF troops on the basis of readiness at the 
Ciskei. 
  "These troops could be deployed swiftly and on short notice 
inside the Ciskei to calm the situation," Mr Coetsee said. 
  Defence Ministry spokesman Das Herbst stressed that the 
troops would only be placed along the border and would not be 
deployed inside the homeland. 
  The move follows requests from former Ciskei military leader 
Brig Oupa Gqozo that the South African Government and the 
Transitional Executive Council take over the administration of 
Ciskei. Brig Gqozo formally stepped down on Tuesday.

  [Text] The former Ciskeian military leader, Brigadier Oupa 
Gqozo, has been placed under house arrest by the Ciskeian 
Defense Force. 
  The homeland's commissioner of police, Major General Manyane 
Noqayi, has been taken hostage by striking policemen and is 
being held along with about 30 of his officers at the police 
college in Bisho. A spokesman for the striking policemen said 
Brigadier Gqozo would be taken to the Bisho Independence Stadium 
this morning to address the armed forces. The estimated 3,000 
policemen who commandeered the police college said earlier that 
they would only accept the fact that Brigadier Gqozo had 
resigned if he informed them in person. The policemen, whose 
ranks were bolstered by Ciskeian soldiers who refused an order 
to surround the college, are sticking to their demands before 
releasing the hostages. The demands include pension payouts and 
an investigation into corruption among senior police officers. 
  Earlier, Brigadier Gqozo resigned and asked that South 
Africa 
take over the administration of Ciskei. South African minister 
of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, said SADF [South African Defense 
Force] troops along the border with Ciskei have been put on 
standby in case they were needed to be deployed in Ciskei. The 
number of hostages being held by the striking policemen has 
grown to 42, and includes five women. A spokesman for the 
striking policemen said they had asked the ANC [African National 
Congress] to send marshals to protect businesses and government 
buildings in Ciskei. He said they did not want a repeat of the 
disruption which had occurred in Bophuthatswana. 
  The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has decided that 
two 
administrators should be appointed to run Ciskei. The council 
would appoint one administrator and the government the other. 
The TEC said that the administrators would be assisted by the 
chief secretary of NEHAWU [National Education, Health and Allied 
Workers Union], the director general of foreign affairs, and the 
minister for administration. 
  The policemen on strike are demanding that their pensions be 
paid out and that steps be taken against administrative 
corruption.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Suzette Pockock] South African troops 
have been stationed on full alert along the Ciskei border. This 
is the word from Defense Minister Kobie Coetsee. However, 
according to a Defense Ministry spokesman, these troops will not 
be deployed inside the homeland. This move follows requests 
from former Ciskei military leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo that the 
South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] take over administration of the territory. Ciskei's chief 
representative at the TEC, Mr. Mickey Webb, made the 
announcement of Brig. Gqozo's voluntary release of the reins of 
power to that body last night. 
  Matters came to a head in the Ciskei yesterday when striking 
policemen took officers hostage in the capital, Bisho. The 
strikers demanded that Brig. Gqozo address them. However, the 
former leader said he saw little point in speaking to the men 
after his resignation. Last night South Africa's ambassador to 
Ciskei, Mr. Piet Goosen, spoke to the strikers. The border 
chairman of the ANC [African National Congress], Mr. Smuts 
Ngonyama, also spoke to the policemen in the early hours of this 
morning. For the latest in the eastern Cape, it's over to James 
Barkhuizen.... But I believe we don't have that link at the 
moment. James has confirmed this morning that Brig. Gqozo was 
under house arrest. [passage omitted] 
  Well, we have that link now with James Barkhuizen in Ciskei, 
who is in Ciskei at the moment, and apparently in Brig. Oupa 
Gqozo's house. Good morning, James. What can you tell us? 
  [Barkhuizen] Good morning. I'm in the brigadier's house, 
Brig. Oupa Gqozo's house. Brig. Gqozo didn't speak to me up 
until now, but people working for Brig. Gqozo -- I can't confirm 
whether they are bodyguards or defense force members; they 
wouldn't say, but they are at the house -- they say that we must 
correct the earlier report on the news. The brigadier is 
allowed to go anywhere. He is not, I repeat, he is not -- 
according to these people -- he's not under house arrest. The 
brigadier himself is next to me now. I wonder, Brigadier, would 
you please speak? It's live on air. Brigadier, can you please 
explain the situation? 
  [Gqozo] Yes. Hello. 
  [Pockock] Good morning, Brigadier. What can you tell us? 
  [Gqozo] Suzette, I'm definitely not under house arrest as it 
was reported in the news earlier. 
  [Pockock] What is the position? 
  [Gqozo] The position is that since I have announced 
yesterday 
that I'm retiring, I think that has caused a little bit of 
confusion, and the soldiers received it with mixed feelings. 
They are definitely outraged that I could just resign like 
that, when they thought there was nothing really worth the 
effort. They didn't want me to resign, but I've told them that 
it is just a matter of resigning 2 weeks earlier. I would have 
had to resign, anyway, after 27 April. 
  [Pockock] Now what is the position of the strikers at the 
moment? 
  [Gqozo] The strikers are still holding those people hostage, 
but I promised them yesterday that I would talk to them at 7.30 
today. 
  [Pockock] And what will you be saying to them? 
  [Gqozo] Well, basically I'd like them to release the 
officers, to go back to work, and let us wait for the TEC people 
and some officials from foreign affairs to come and discuss the 
future of this territory. 
  [Pockock] Now we beleive that a woman and a child are being 
held hostage. Is that correct? 
  [Gqozo] I'm not yet sure where the woman and the child have 
been taken to, but I was told yesterday night that the acting 
commissioner of police's wife and child have been abducted from 
the house, although no one was certain where exactly they were 
taken to. 
  [Pockock] Now what exactly do the strikers want? What are 
their demands? 
  [Gqozo] This is what is making me totally frustrated, 
Suzette. They say they want their pensions paid out now, and you 
know, it's very impossible. So such impossible demands led me 
to believe that this was just an excuse to try and do another 
Bop [Bophuthatswana] on Ciskei, and I thought that the best way 
to avoid it and to avoid that any losses of life and any 
destruction of property would be for me to step down before 
something happened that has happened in Bophuthatswana. I don't 
think it's worth it. If people would like to have a change of 
government or a change of scene, I think it's better that we act 
and preempt that by acting wisely. In this case, I thought that 
retiring from office and getting the South African Government 
and the TEC to already put an administration which would ensure 
that all these grievances are answered, would be the best. I 
don't think at this moment I've got any power to grant leave 
gratuities, I've got no power to grant the people all the 
assurances that they want about their future in a future 
government. 
  [Pockock] Now, Brigadier, one last question. What is the 
mood of the people in Bisho this morning? 
  [Gqozo] Very cool. I think the whole night was very quiet 
and very cool. There is absolutely nothing that shows any 
excitement or extraordinary activities. Everybody is happy and 
everybody is waiting to hear what will unfold today. 
  [Pockock] Brig Gqozo, thanks very much for speaking to us 
this morning.

  [Text] [Announcer Norma Odendaal] We have James Barkhuizen 
on the telephone again to bring us up to date on the latest 
situation in Ciskei. James? 
  [Barkhuizen] Norma, from a quiet Bisho everything has 
suddenly erupted into chaos. People are out on the streets, the 
whole of Bisho is filled with people carrying placards and 
shouting slogans. Earlier when I was at Brigadier Gqozo's house 
I was forced by his bodyguards -- at least six of them, all 
armed -- I was forced to call Television News in the earlier 
bulletin and to say Brigadier Gqozo was not under house arrest. 
When I had reported that, the bodyguards brought the brigadier 
into the room to speak with you on the telephone. It was a very 
tense situation. Later I left, and at the gate, when I was 
leaving the palace, a Ciskei Defense Force member, a corporal, 
told me that he was going to search my car because Brig. Gqozo 
must not be allowed to escape under any cirumstances. Shortly 
after that Brig. Gqozo was taken out through the palace gates 
under guard. I waited for them at the Ciskei police college 
where the strike has been under way since yesterday, and where 
the hostages are being held. Brig. Gqozo wanted to speak with 
Ciskeian police force members in small groups at the college. On 
his arrival at the gates he was led into an ambush. No shots 
were fired, but people armed and in Casspirs [armored vehicle] 
and other vehicles surrounded his own armored vehicle and his 
bodyguards. One cannot tell whether the bodyguards themselves 
led him into the ambush, whether they are part of the plot, or 
whether they have also now been arrested. But they were taken 
back from the police college under armed guard in a convoy, back 
through Bisho and out to the Bisho stadium, where the Bisho 
massacre took place in 1992. Civil servants, Ciskei Defense 
Force and Police Force members have all gathered in the stadium. 
They are demanding to hear Brig. Gqozo. That is the situation 
at the moment. I will have to leave for the stadium now to see 
what happens there. 
  [Odendaal] Thank you very much, James.

  [Text] The minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Pik Botha, says 
the situation in Ciskei is explosive and that violence could 
erupt at any moment. In an interview with our political news 
staff Mr. Botha said there were fears for the life of former 
Ciskei military leader, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. He said the South 
African Defense Force had been deployed and was on full alert to 
intervene if necessary. The South African ambassador to Ciskei, 
Mr. Piet Goosen, has been appointed interim administrator until 
the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] appoints two 
administrators to take over the running of the homeland. A 
crowd of about 8,000 people has gathered at the stadium at Bisho 
to be addressed by Brigadier Gqozo. Brigadier Gqozo was supposed 
to be at the stadium at 1100 but didn't arrive. 
  A delegation of the Transitional Executive Council which has 
arrived in King William's Town will decide later if Brigadier 
Gqozo will address the people at the stadium.

armed men at the Ciskei police college in Bisho had all been 
released by late on Wednesday [23 March] morning, witnesses 
said. They added some of those who had been held hostage were 
seen at Bisho stadium later Wednesday as former military ruler 
Brig Oupa Gqozo arrived to address cheering police rebels. It 
was not immediately clear if the brigadier was being held under 
arrest by the rebels. Witnesses said the former military ruler 
was travelling in a blacked-out armoured vehicle. 
  Meanwhile, the Transitional Executive Council task force 
charged with setting up an interim administration in Ciskei 
arrived in the capital Bisho on Wednesday. At the lunch hour, 
task force members were huddled in talks with South African [SA] 
Ambassador Piet Goosen at the SA Embassy.

  [Text] Queenstown March 23 SAPA -- State President F. W. de 
Klerk on Wednesday [23 March] said the potential for violence in 
the Ciskei could not be ruled out. "We have a large crowd at 
one of the stadiums demanding Brig (Oupa) Gqozo's presence. 
Brig Gqozo said he is not going. There is a volatile situation 
there but we have taken steps to defuse the situation if this 
volatility erupts. We are on the scene and are absolutely 
willing and able to protect South Africa's interests and, of 
course, the interests of the Ciskei," he said at a press 
conference in the border town of Queenstown. 
  At least 20 South African Defence Force armoured vehicles 
were parked on the outskirts of the town as Mr de Klerk spoke.

  [Text] Bisho March 23 SAPA -- Confusion reigned at Bisho 
stadium on Wednesday [23 March] where by 1 PM Ciskei's former 
ruler Brig Oupa Gqozo had still not arrived to address security 
force members and other civil servants. Striking Ciskei police 
force members said the defence force, which now controlled Brig 
Gqozo's movements, was refusing to bring him to the stadium 
unless his safety was guaranteed. The army was unhappy with the 
large number of African National Congress [ANC] supporters who 
had occupied much of the stadium's grandstand and had been 
singing and dancing there since early morning. 
  In nearby King William's Town, a Transitional Executive 
Council Task force was having discussion on Wednesday afternoon 
with South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, Mr Piet Goosen, on a 
strategy for dealing with the territory now that Brig Gqozo was 
no longer in control. It is understood ANC Secretary General 
Cyril Ramaphosa is also attending the meeting. 
  The meeting at the Bisho stadium was originally scheduled to 
start at 7.30 AM. By midday, a steady stream of people was 
leaving the stadium as members of the police, prisons and 
defence force argued about what should happen next. At one 
point, the entire prisons contingent went behind the grandstand 
to caucus. Attempts by police spokesmen to address the crowd 
were shouted down by ANC supporters.

  [Text] The Lebowa government has appealed to the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] to take over financial control 
of the homeland. Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike said, in a 
statement this afternoon, that the tension between his 
government and the Department of Regional and Land Affairs, 
which controls the finances of the region, was the cause of the 
collapse of services. Thirty-thousand striking civil servants 
have virtually crippled the Lebowa government. The situation 
came to a head today when members of the police force began a 
sit-in. They said they had been promised salary increases which 
never materialized. Isolated incidents of violence have also 
been reported, and at least three government vehicles were set 
alight in Seshego.

  [Text] The South African Police [SAP] have not received any 
instructions to move into Lebowa. 
  This was said by the regional commissioner of police in the 
far northern Transvaal, Major General Nick van Rensburg, 
following reports that senior police officers had been chased 
out of their offices at Lebowakgomo by striking policemen this 
morning. General van Rensburg said the SAP was ready to respond 
to any situation if needed. Meanwhile, Lebowa policemen have 
reportedly drawn all the available LM-5 automatic rifles and 
ammunition from the Lebowa quartermaster, raising concerns about 
the security situation in the region. It was not known if the 
policemen had any other weapons in their possession.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- The Azanian People's 
Organisation [Azapo] on Wednesday [23 March] urged blacks to 
continue their "revolutionary campaigns against the remaining 
dummy structures and puppets in the so-called bantustan and 
tricameral administrations". 
  An Azapo statement expressed the organisation's "salutation 
to black people in the Eastern Cape for having forced once more 
another puppet dictator, Mr (Brig) Oupa Gqozo, out of power". 
Brig Gqozo was the leader of Ciskei. The statement continued: 
"The brave and relentless efforts of black people against 
(Brig) Oupa Gqozo's administration vindicates Azapo's 
longstanding position that our people have never accepted the 
bantustan and tricameral system and its puppet leaders." 
  Azapo called on blacks to celebrate their victories in 
forcing Brig Gqozo and Bophuthatswana leader Mr Lucas Mangope 
out of power. "Azapo also calls upon black people to defend and 
protect their revolutionary gains by rejecting all attempts by 
the illegitimate (President F W) de Klerk regime and its 
advisory body (Transitional Executive Council) to install yet 
another of its white functionaries or lackeys to administer the 
already discredited bantustan or tricameral structures as they 
have done in the so-called Bophuthatswana. Azapo further 
appeals to black people to struggle more than ever before not 
only to ensure the collapse of the puppet administrators but 
also to ensure that the (Mr) de Klerk regime is overthrown to 
usher in a new and democratic socialist republic of Azania."

  [Text] Johannesburg Mar 22 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples 
Organisation [Azapo] says a bogus pamphlet calling for the 
killing of white people is being distributed in the name of the 
organisation at railway stations in Umlazi, kwaMashu, on the 
Natal south coast and other areas in Natal. The pamphlet, a 
copy of which was sent to SAPA on Tuesday [22 March], reads: 
"Whiteman, with your lying tongue you stole our land, enslaved 
us, jailed us, tortured us, killed us. Now the time has come 
for us to take revenge. You will now cry tears of blood for 
your past actions". 
  Another pamphlet being distributed under Azapo's name reads: 
"Whiteman! We don't care who you are, who you work for, what 
party you belong to, you are the people's enemy. You must die! 
Viva Azapo viva". 
  Azapo said in a statement on Tuesday it rejected the 
pamphlets "with the contempt it deserves. Azapo distances 
itself from the pamphlet because it does not emanate from the 
organisation nor any of its formations. The bogus nature of the 
pamphlet is thereby proving that this is the dirty tricks and 
work of sinister forces who want to create an excuse for 
attacking Azapo members because of the organisation's unwavering 
commitment to expose and fight against a sell-out political 
settlement." 
  The organisation was alerted to the distribution of the 
pamphlet by the South African Rail Commuter Corporation.

  [Text] Ulundi Mar 22 SAPA -- Delegations of the African 
National Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] met 
in Johannesburg on Tuesday [22 March] to finalise arrangements 
regarding the issue of international mediation. ANC President 
Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi agreed on 
mediation at a meeting in Durban three weeks ago. 
  A joint statement issued by both parties on Tuesday said: 
"An 
international mediation effort was agreed upon during the 
meeting between Mr Mandela and Dr Buthelezi. The purpose of the 
mediation is to seek a constitutional settlement between the 
parties." 
  It added both parties had agreed on the names of the 
mediators as well as the terms of reference. 
  "It was further agreed that mediation should begin as soon 
as 
possible, and both parties have indicated their readiness to 
commence mediation at the earliest possible date." 
  The statement added that the co-chairpersons of the ANC/IFP 
joint committee on international mediation will brief the South 
African Government on progress made.

  [Text] Cape Town March 23 SAPA -- Former US Secretary of 
State and Nobel Peace Laureate Henry Kissinger and British 
Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington will serve on a mediation 
commission to settle the kwaZulu/Natal constitutional dispute. 
  Senior negotiation sources confirmed on Wednesday [23 March] 
that Mr Kissinger would head the commission which must decide on 
the federalist content of the new transitional constitution. It 
is understood that the commission would comprise four men, the 
other two being from the USA and India. 
  The same sources said that agreement had been reached 
between 
the two disputing parties -- the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and 
ANC [African National Congress] -- that they would abide by the 
decision of the mediators. 
  It was also agreed that if the mediators ruled in favour of 
the IFP, it could lead to a postponement of the April 27 
election. 
  The ANC and IFP agreed to mediation on the issue of 
federalism which the IFP claims is not present in the interim 
constitution. It is demanding more regional powers for the 
provinces and a greater measure of independence from the central 
government. 
  Mr Kissinger shared the Nobel Peace Prize with his north 
Vietnamese negotiation counterpart for securing the agreement 
for the US withdrawal from Vietnam, thus ending the Vietnam War. 
Lord Carrington was the central mediator in the Lancaster House 
negotiations which brought about the end of Rhodesian UDI 
[Unilateral Declaration of Independence] and the war for the 
liberation of Zimbabwe.

  [Text] Port Elizabeth March 22 SAPA -- The point of no 
return had been reached and the election must now take place 
without the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], State President F W de 
Klerk said on Tuesday [22 March]. Outlining his most recent 
approach to IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, he told a press 
conference in Port Elizabeth he had mooted the possibility of 
the IFP contesting the election in the kwaZulu/Natal region. 
  By not fighting the national election, the IFP could still 
register its opposition to the interim constitution. The IFP had 
rejected his suggestion, Mr de Klerk said. "The point of no 
return has been reached. The matter must be settled 
democratically in the election." 
  Contingency arrangements were in place if violence erupted 
in 
kwaZulu, but he said there was no plan to destabilise the 
territory. 
  Asked if the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] might take 
over the kwaZulu administration, Mr de Klerk replied: "The TEC 
as such is having trouble administering itself." 
  He added: "The government retains the duty to see that there 
will be good governance throughout the republic."

<F P=106> [From the "Channel Africa Report" program] </F>
  [Text] South Africa's National Party [NP] has prepared a 
draft constitution for Natal which makes provision for Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini and the aspirations of his followers. Its 
details will be made public within two weeks. Peet Scott 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Scott] The announcement of the NP's draft 
constitution was made by the party's leader in Natal, Mr. George 
Bartlett, in Durban. Mr. Bartlett said a copy of the draft had 
been handed to IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. 
  [Bartlett] Draft copies have been given to the chief 
minister, and at a recent meeting in Pretoria with the state 
president and King Goodwill Zwelithini I quoted from this 
document, and as a result of that I gave him a copy, so the king 
also has a copy of this document. As I say, we're ready, at the 
drop of a hat, to start negotiating on a constitution for this 
province, and we will make this document public in a week or two. 
  [Scott] Mr. Bartlett said the NP would also be willing to 
negotiate with other parties on the contents of the document. 
He said the NP had done everything possible to accommodate the 
IFP and the Zulu monarchy, so as to get the IFP to participate 
in the election, but that they have had no success up until now. 
He made another appeal to the IFP to reconsider its stance. If 
it did not, an all-out effort would be made to secure the vote 
from its supporters. 
  [Bartlett] Should the IFP not respond to our appeal to 
participate in this election, we make an urgent appeal to all 
IFP supporters to throw their weight behind President de Klerk 
and the NP, so as to stop the [South African] Communist Party 
[SACP] and the ANC [African National Congress] from controlling 
our province. 
  [Scott] At the same time Mr. Bartlett appealed to both the 
IFP and the ANC-SACP alliance not to stoke the fires of violence 
and confrontation in the province. But what if people are 
prevented from voting in kwaZulu? Surely it is the duty of the 
government to ensure that the democratic voting process is not 
interfered with. [Home Affairs Minister] Mr. Danie Schutte said 
the government had contingency plans in case there was 
large-scale disruption of the election, but that these would 
only be used as a last resort. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Channel Africa Report" program] </F>
  [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] has announced 
that it will begin a mass action campaign on Friday [25 March] 
to demand free political activity in South Africa's 
Natal-kwaZulu region. ANC spokesman (Sbhu Ndebele): 
  [Ndeble] The mass action is intended to mobilize all the 
people who want to resolve their issues, political issues, in 
Natal through elections. It will mobilize and demonstrate to 
the people of Natal (?that) it's only a small minority in Natal 
that is against elections, and indeed in the whole country we 
have seen that out of the 26 parties that were at the World 
Trade Center, only two parties today remain that are opposed to 
the election -- namely, the Conservative Party [CP] with its AWB 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] counterpart, with the CP in 
Natal having pulled out of the nonelectioneering CP, and the 
IFP. Those are the only two parties that are left today. 
  What is worrying us about the IFP is that it is doing what 
even the Conservative Party is not doing. The Conservative 
Party is not going on to hold election venues preventing other 
parties, but the IFP has prevented us twice now in Umlazi and 
kwaMashu from using stadiums that we were entitled to use. So 
it is that development that is actually very, very worrying in 
South Africa -- in Natal. Whoever wants peace will have to 
support this form of action. 
  [Correspondent Gary Govindsamy] What if there's resistance 
to 
the march on Friday? 
  [Ndebele] Well, there has been resistance to the struggle 
led 
by the ANC since the 50's. The ANC has got the capacity to 
overcome that. 
  [Govindsamy] Will this be another situation like that in 
Bophuthatswana in Ulundi? 
  [Ndebele] Not exactly. Two situations are not the same. 
Bophuthatswana, though it was not recognized by the whole world, 
was as a matter of law recognized by the South African 
Government and it was recognized in South African law as 
independent. That is why we saw extraordinary measures being 
taken there. KwaZulu is part of the South African law. It is 
not regarded as independent. But on April the 27th the 
constitution of 1993 will come into operation at midnight, and 
that constitution does not recognize any of the self- governing 
states, including kwaZulu or any of the so-called independent 
bantustans -- Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and so forth. So 
there's no need for the ANC in Natal to be mobilizing their 
energies to go and overthrow the Legislative Assembly of Ulundi 
when that assembly won't be there on April 27.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 22 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] on Tuesday [22 March] took preliminary steps to 
bring kwaZulu into the April election. The TEC management 
committee was mandated to take whatever steps it felt were 
necessary to ensure free and fair elections in the territory. 
  The TEC passed the resolution after being presented with a 
report alleging kwaZulu government and kwaZulu Police [KZP] 
complicity in hit squad activity. The report, compiled by 
attorneys Fink Haysom and Howard Varney and the SAP's [South 
African Police] Col Ivor Human, recommended the KZP be brought 
under South African Police jurisdiction ahead of the April 27 
election. 
  Although the TEC decided on no specific or immediate steps, 
the report's conclusions will help inform management committee 
members of the steps believed to be necessary to ensure a free 
and fair election in Natal. It calls on the kwaZulu 
administration to co-operate with all electoral organs, the 
South African Government and with civil service rationalisation. 
  It also recommends indemnity be considered for police 
officers who have information on hit squad activities. 
  The investigations team began its work in December after a 
Goldstone Commission report said hit squads were probably 
operating in Natal/kwaZulu. 
  Investigators heard evidence ranging from KZP involvement in 
hit squad activity to the involvement of the department of the 
chief minister of kwaZulu, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the report said. 
  "The pattern which emerges from the evidence is obvious and 
repetitive. It repeatedly refers to certain individuals and 
similarly reveals a clear pattern with regard to the response by 
the kwaZulu Police to hit squad activity." 
  It notes that "hit squad activity in Natal and particularly 
in the area of jurisdiction of the KZP is rife. The number of 
deaths caused by these hit squads is unquantifiable but would 
represent a significant proportion of those who have died in 
political violence in kwazulu and natal." The report said some 
of the hit squad activities could be associated with people who 
underwent training in the Caprivi Strip in 1986 and who now 
operated within the KZP. These trainees had later been trained 
by the SAP and deployed in the Pietermaritzburg area. 
  It said some officials of the Inkatha Freedom Party and 
employees of a kwaZulu government department were implicated in 
hit squad activity. 
  Victims included members of the African National Congress 
and 
KZP policemen perceived to be disloyal to the IFP. 
  There was evidence that investigations were being hampered 
by 
the "highest echelons of the KZP". 
  "The task group is satisfied that there are linkages and 
connections between different elements engaged in gun running 
and hit squad activity inside and outside the security forces, 
both in the Transvaal and Natal." 
  It recommends a single unified investigative team assisted 
by 
international figures and that the Caprivi trainees be 
transferred from active policing. 
  "We recommend further the immediate cessation of the issue 
and distribution of all firearms, including semi-automatic 
weapons from or through the department of the chief minister of 
kwaZulu." 
  Finally, it recommends that the KZP give exact details of 
steps it intends implementing to prevent hit squad activities in 
the run-up to the elections and the possible revocation of the 
authority of the kwaZulu government to establish its own police 
force.

  [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] has called on the 
Goldstone Commission to subpoena Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] member Pravin Gordhan. 
  The IFP said it would like him to reveal the identity of the 
author of an alleged ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South 
African Communist Party] document outlining a plan for the 
overthrow of the kwaZulu government. The IFP said it believed 
that Mr. Gordhan, a member of the SACP, had seen the document. 
It alleged that a recent statement by him calling for TEC 
intervention in kwaZulu was in line with the strategy set out in 
the document for the destabilization of kwaZulu. Earlier, the 
Goldstone Commission said it would ask the IFP for details of 
the allegations to enable it to conduct a full inquiry. 
  Confirming that he had received a copy of the document, Mr. 
Justice Goldstone said that if the IFP was unable or unwilling 
to furnish the information it should indicate the action it 
wanted the commission to take.

  [Text] Pretoria Mar 22 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel and the commissioner of police are expected to 
decide soon on the fate of three senior police officers under 
investigation by the Goldstone Commission in connection with 
alleged third force activities. A government spokesman said on 
Tuesday [22 March] Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe 
had the authority to withdraw the officers from service, but the 
commissioner had decided to consult the officers before taking a 
decision. 
  "Depending on the outcome of this procedure, the minister of 
law and order might have to consider the possibility of 
suspending the officers concerned," the spokesman said in a 
statement. 
  President F W de Klerk put the three officers, Deputy 
Commissioner Lt-Gen Basie Smit, Police Intelligence Chief 
Maj-Gen Krappies Engelbrecht and Lt-Gen Johan le Roux on paid 
leave last week after the Goldstone Commission released an 
interim report on the matter. 
  The government meanwhile spelt out on Tuesday the grounds on 
which Mr de Klerk decided to put the three officers on paid 
leave, and two of the police generals said they had written to 
Mr de Klerk seeking clarification on the matter. 
  The government spokesman said, apart from the contents of 
the 
Goldstone report, Mr de Klerk had also considered the national 
interest, including the interests of the police and the 
legitimacy of the further investigation into the allegations. Mr 
de Klerk had also found it desirable that police officers should 
be withdrawn from service if serious allegations were made 
against them in the findings of a judicial inquiry. 
  But "the (police) commissioner has the authority to withdraw 
officers from service with full pay, which would give practical 
effect to the state president's decision," the statement said. 
  "He (Police Commissioner Gen van der Merwe) has, 
subsequently, advised the state president that this step must be 
carried out in interaction with the officers concerned and that 
he will soon complete his consultations with them in this regard. 
  As the government made the announcement, Gen Smit and Gen le 
Roux said they had not been placed on mandatory leave by Mr de 
Klerk, adding they considered themselves still in the service of 
the SA Police. They said in a joint statemenththat after seeking 
legal advice they had written to the state president requesting 
clarification on: 

  -  who took the decision to suspend the three generals; 
  -  the exact content of the decision and what it entailed; and, 
  -  on whose authority the decision had been taken, and what 
grounds it was based on. 

    The two generals claimed Mr de Klerk had informed them that 
he had not placed then on immediate mandatory leave, but that he 
had decided they should be temporarily "withdrawn from service". 
  According to the generals' statement, Mr de Klerk informed 
them that he did not have the power to permanently withdraw them 
and that the power to do so lay with the commissioner of police. 
  Mr de Klerk informed the men that in the past the decision 
to 
withdraw officers from duty had been taken after negotiation 
"between the parties involved". The generals said such 
negotiation had not taken place by Tuesday. 
  Gen Smit and Gen le Roux said they were therefore still 
"fully" in the service of the South African Police, and in light 
of Mr de Klerk's reply to them, legal action in this regard 
would not taken. 
  Both generals denied any allegations they had acted 
improperly and demanded a public investigation be held to 
address the "rumours" and vague allegations contained in Judge 
Goldstone's preliminary report. 
  The generals said they would bmth co-operate with any 
inquiry 
which may follow, adding their only demand was that the normal 
principles of justice be applied and that no person be found 
guilty and convicted based on untested and vague allegations "as 
contained in the Goldstone report". Both men expressed their 
"disappointment" at the way the issue was dealt with considering 
the implication it could have on their careers and on the morale 
of the SA Police. 
  In its preliminary report the Goldstone Commission said on 
Friday it had heard evidence implicating three police generals 
in third force activity aimed at fomenting violence and 
destabilising the country. The report said an investigation was 
underway into alleged gun running to kwaZulu.

<F P=106> [Report by Lorraine Braid] </F>
  [Text] Oudtshoorn March 22 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel has appealed for calm from everyone after the 
release of the shock Goldstone Commission interim report 
concerning three police generals' alleged involvement in gun 
smuggling. 
  "I am asking for everyone to be calm, including the generals 
and the SAP [South African Police], because the ANC [African 
National Congress] is using this opportunity to try and cut our 
throats," he told about 500 people in the Oudtshoorn Civic 
Centre on Tuesday [22 March] night. "Don't let us be guilty of 
a hearing and sentence without tested evidence. The Goldstone 
report shocked the SAP and myself, because everything Mr Justice 
Richard Goldstone says in his report is diametrically opposed to 
the policies of the National Party [NP] and State President F.W. 
de Klerk. When Mr de Klerk received the report, I was with him 
and he had no other choice but to act the way he did." 
  Mr Kriel said if the accusations contained in the 
commission's interim report had been ignored, the government 
would have been accused of a cover-up and would have placed the 
SA Police in an even weaker position. It was of cardinal 
importance to get to the truth as soon as possible. 
  Mr Kriel said it was on his recommendations that an 
international investigating team be appointed -- in the interest 
of the SAP. The result of the investigation has to be above 
suspicion of any cover- up, he said. 
  "The report should he handled as soon as possible because of 
the paranoia of the ANC and Democratic Party to prove the SAP is 
a bunch of criminals. The investigation must restore people's 
trust in the SAP." 
  Mr Kriel said the Goldstone Commision interim report showed 
up painful shortcomings in the whole commission system in South 
Africa. "I am not blaiming Mr Justice Goldstone but the system 
lends itself to things not going right. People get a report 
based on untested evidence and allegations which are made public 
and then, people are tried in the media and not in court. That 
is wrong." 
  He said the weakness of commission's report was that 
people's 
careers were also ruined, adding that he was also not blaming Mr 
Justice Goldstone because he had to carry out the procedure. Mr 
Kriel said he was also not blaming President de Klerk who had to 
make a decision. "I am sorry for the victims of such a system. 
I think it should be the responsibility of a government of 
national unity to see that a better commission system is 
introduced, where evidence is tested according to legal 
practice." 
  Mr Kriel said he would not resign because of the report. 
"Any cabinet is appointed or fired by the state president. I 
will not resign if the ANC demands it, or over a report not yet 
tested in a court of law."

Klerk on Wednesday [23 March] announced that 10 generals 
implicated in the Goldstone Commission report into gun running

  The 10 included Maj-Gen "Krappies" Englebrecht. The others 
would be named later on Wednesday, Mr de Klerk added. Generals 
Basie Smit and Johan le Roux have since their implication in gun 
running sought legal advice. There had been negotiations on 
their withdrawal from service and a decision was expected on 
Thursday morning. 
  Mr de Klerk said if those negotiations did not lead to the 
generals' withdrawal, following laid down procedures, Minister 
of Law and Order Mr Hernus Kriel would suspend them.

  [Text] A police officer, Captain Kobus Chappies Klopper, 
who has been identified by police sources as the informer known 
as Q who alleged the involvement of three police generals in a 
so-called third force, has denied being the person involved. 
This is according to an English-language morning newspaper. 
The paper quotes him as saying he will deny that he is Q, and 
that he will also deny all allegations against him. However, 
police sources maintain that it is Captain Klopper who provided 
the information. Captain Klopper says it is irresponsible of 
these sources to make him the scapegoat, and of newspapers to 
publish his name.

  [Text] Pretoria March 22 SAPA -- All prisoners will be 
allowed to vote in the April election, the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] decided on Tuesday [22 March]. The 
decision was taken in the light of widespread prisoner 
dissatisfaction with not being allowed to vote and the 
subsequent riots at prisons countrywide. 
  A joint TEC, Independent Electoral Commission and government 
team was established to finalise the details. 
  The TEC decision reversed a decision last week not to allow 
prisoners who were jailed without the option of a fine to vote 
in spite of the Independent Electoral Commission advising that 
discriminating against some prisoners would create logistical 
difficulties. 
  African National Congress delegate Cyril Ramaphosa warned of 
many more deaths unless all prisoners were given the vote. He 
said 23 prisoners had already died. 
  Earlier in the day, about 50 members of the South African 
Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights protested outside the 
TEC building against the TEC's opposition to prisoners voting. 
  The TEC resolution was possible because the Democratic Party 
reversed its opposition on practical grounds. 
  Government representative Roelf Meyer and Ciskei's Mickey 
Webb reserved their positions but did not oppose the resolution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg </F>
by station announcer Johannes van der Walt--live, interview 
broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Hartzenberg] Firstly, we have to indicate that the 
Afrikaner nation has a claim to land in South Africa. You know, 
Mr. Mandela has said no volkstaat [homeland] for the 
Afrikaners.... 
  [Van der Walt, interrupting] While he is living, yes. 
  [Hartzenberg] Yes, while he is living. The PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] said they are demanding the whole 
South Africa as it was in 1652, before Jan van Riebeeck came 
here. The PAC did not object then when we began to occupy South 
Africa; and we have claims -- legitimate claims -- because ever 
since that time the Afrikaner has been here, and we are a nation 
-- one which is being threatened at the moment. That is the 
international criteria that is necessary. 
  [Van der Walt] Dr. Hartzenberg, in other words the report on 
that working committee, which was requested to investigate this 
matter a few weeks ago, and it has been evaluated and 
considered.... 
  [Hartzenberg] It has now been evaluated and decisions have 
been taken and those decisions will be announced next week. 
  [Van der Walt] Even the issue of boundaries will also be 
announced within a week? 
  [Hartzenberg] The issue of boundaries and how we arrived at 
it -- that will also be announced. We maintain that it actually 
depends on the people. You know, if you have a certain region, 
we know that as South Africa is today there are certain regions 
which belong to other nations and we are not, in any way, laying 
any claims on any of those. There are certain areas which have 
been occupied by other population groups which are a reality, 
which cannot be included in our volkstaat. Then you also have 
some of our people who do not want to be included in such a 
volkstaat, and we do not want to force them to be in our 
volkstaat. In other words, these are all criteria which have 
been taken into consideration. 
  Then we went further and approved the actions in towns and 
cities that have to be planned, the towns must work out 
comprehensive programs aimed at declaring, or rather proclaiming 
-- irrespective of whether the Transitional Executive Council 
likes proclamations or not -- those towns volkstaat towns. 
  [Van der Walt ] Is this the peg that you said.... 
  [Hartzenberg] This is the peg I spoke about, but if you 
start 
talking about claims and you start talking from the point of 
view of regions, then it is up to the people to knock in that 
peg because it will be their will to embrace that town in a 
volkstaat. Those are programs that have been approved and that 
have to be set into motion around 29th March, and that we hope 
-- if it happens throughout -- will be something spectacular and 
will reaffirm our claim on freedom and our claim on land, as we 
saw happening yesterday as regards the Zulu nation. 
  We also further reaffirmed that the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front, AVF] will not participate in the 
elections and that the differences in this regard - in 
right-wing ranks -- will not detract our attention and our 
actions from our actual objectives and our enemies, namely the 
ANC [African National Congress] and the SACP [South African 
Communist Party] as well as the government. That we are not to 
grab each other by the throat, but rather that we strive toward 
our objective purposefully, enthusiastically, with idealism and 
dedication so that we can see our volkstaat materialize -- that 
is what we have been striving for. And we don't have a trace of 
doubt that our nation will not be free in its own fatherland, 
under its own flag, and with its own anthem "Die stem van 
Suid-Afrika" [The Voice of South Africa]. 
  [Van der Walt] And the election? 
  [Hartzenberg] Well, that question, as a result of all the 
things which have happened lately, it has been extremely 
difficult, of course, to bring that to fruition before the 
election. The differences in our ranks, the fact that one of 
our ally partners has been forced through violence to surrender, 
and all that sort of thing has had such a quick effect, but what 
we want to at least do is to make the volkstaat a type of a 
reality, that it is inevitable, that it has to come; and 
everyone will know that it has to be there. And this is our aim. 
I must tell you that when that volkstaat will materialize -- it 
is in fact a question no one can answer -- and how it will come 
about, no one knows. But come it will -- there is no doubt about 
that because that is a legitimate right of every nation, and our 
nation also has that right. Everything depends on us. 
  [Van der Walt] It is something, Dr. Ferdi, that binds us 
together, despite the split in our ranks. 
  [Hartzenberg] That is a fact. That is the cementing factor, 
and we can launch actions in which all can participate to 
promote and strive for this objective. And one of these days 
the election will be over and then there will be no need to 
argue about such things. But if I read the signs correctly, 
then it seems to me as if that election will perhaps not take 
place, because I.... 
  [Van der Walt, interrupting] I have always said that. 
  [Hartzenberg] I have heard some of these revolutionaries say 
that they have brought one government of an independent state to 
its knees, they are in the process of destabilizing another, and 
they also have their eyes focused on kwaZulu, and they say it is 
not their sole aim to take over independent and self-governing 
states, but to take over the Pretoria government. And Mr. 
Mandela has made rumblings which amount to the fact that they 
will achieve this through violence; and that there will possibly 
be no election. And I think we Afrikaners have to realize that 
if they are going around interfering with the governments of 
independent and self-governing states, they are also on their 
way to us -- that they will want to force us Afrikaners to 
surrender. And that is why it is essential that we must not 
grab each other by the throat during these times of crises, 
because should this happen, then we must stand together and we 
must assert ourselves. 
  [Hartzenberg] If it had been during other times, with no 
communist takeover threatening within five weeks, then we could 
have afforded to sort each other out. But right now we have to 
keep the wolf away from the door [laughter from both] and we 
have to see to it that we do not end up in an embarrassing 
situation. 
  [Van der Walt] Dr. Hartzenberg, the agreement which Dr. 
Pieter Mulder spoke about between...[pauses] that they are going 
to take part in the election as a front, but yet remain part of 
the CP. Your comment on that? 
  [Hartzenberg] No, no, I made no such agreement with them. We 
discussed the matter, and look, I did everything in my power and 
under those circumstances no person has a desire to lose 
colleagues along the way. And we discussed the matter and looked 
at all possible ways, to see if there was a solution somewhere. 
But unfortunately that is the position. In politics it is a 
reality, namely that one can only belong to one party, because 
if you belong to two parties, where is your loyalty then? 
Really, one must accept it as a reality, and our constitution 
also determines that. And it's not only because the 
constitution states it, but it's because it is a reality. 
  And the other thing is, if someone belongs to one party and 
you are a candidate to another party, then it's just not 
tenable. All political parties forbid their members to belong 
to other parties and to become candidates of other parties. I 
discussed this with the gentlemen concerned. We did find ways 
and means, but I told them emphatically that if they become 
candidates of another party, then they could very well cancel 
themselves out of the party. The constitution says that if you 
render yourself available as candidate to another party, then 
your membership automatically expires. 
  [Van der Walt] Could you, as leader of the Conservative 
Party 
-- just in conclusion, Dr. Hartzenberg -- say something relating 
to what is in the news this morning and today, this issue about 
the police? We were approached by listeners this morning. They 
want to know our views about the matter -- this thing about 
there being an international investigation into the actions of a 
sort of third force in the police, something the ANC has been 
talking about for a long time? 
  [Hartzenberg] Well, Johannes, I think it is significant that 
such a report has been brought to light now. We have not as yet 
seen the report officially, we have only been reading newspaper 
and other reports. But it still seems as though it is not a 
report based on firm grounds. It is still hearsay evidence. 
And it is part of the suspicion-creating, the revolutionary 
onslaught. These revolutionists work that way, as happened in 
Russia. The resistance against a communist takeover must be 
broken down, and in this case the top general is put in the 
accused's box without any legitimate reasons, without a 
comprehensive investigation. They are put on obligatory leave 
for no real reason; and I think this issue of a third force is a 
story being exploited by the ANC to focus suspicion on the 
police, and the security forces. 
  [Van der Walt] And also to detract attention from the 
conflict with the Inkatha Freedom Party. 
  [Hartzenberg] Yes, but also to weaken the forces which have 
to maintain law and order so that they can violently...[pauses] 
because this is the impression I get, that they don't intend 
taking over the country through an election but through other 
ways. And that fits in with Mr. Mandela's utterance the other 
day, when he said that such an onslaught was being directed at 
the police. And that is why I want to sympathize wholeheartedly 
with those guys who are really being treated unfairly.

  [Text] The Workers' List Party says none of the other 
parties contesting the election can solve the crisis of 
unemployment, illiteracy, and poverty in the country. Launching 
its manifesto in Johannesburg today, the party said only an 
organization firmly against the capitalist system could do away 
with these conditions. This report from Arlene Wainstein: 
  [Begin recording] [Wainstein] Support socialism, down with 
capitalism. This is how the Workers' List Party introduced its 
manifesto this afternoon. The party says it hopes its brand of 
democratic socialism will soon spread throughout the world. 
  [Workers' List spokesman Salim Vally] What we've had in this 
country has been capitalism and that has failed dismally. We 
are not talking about the so-called socialism of the East, of 
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Democracy means that the 
people who create the wealth must also be the people who make 
the decisions, people who must decide whether to build casinos 
or decide whether to build schools. 
  [Wainstein] The party has collected some 10,000 supporters' 
signatures in under a week, now it's planning a national 
campaign based on jobs for all and the right to work. 
  [Workers' List spokesman Ambrose Solomon] Such a right to 
work must be included for people who are unemployed at this 
stage and it must be a guarantee, it must become law, and we 
believe that there must be a strong campaign against 
retrenchments, and people who retrench ... [changes thought] 
bosses that are retrenching people must be blacklisted and 
fought. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Mathatha Tsedu] </F>
  [Text] The Workers' List Party [WLP] is a newcomer to the 
political landscape and was formed this year to contest the 
elections. Its major component is the Workers' Organisation for 
Socialist Action, which gained notoriety for bringing the 
biggest banner at other people's marches. Other components 
include the Cape Action League, Action Youth, Forward Youth and 
Mayibuye. The party has its strongest base in the Western Cape, 
followed by the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. It 
has branches in the Eastern Transvaal, Northern Cape and 
Southern Cape. Support for the party has also come from 
individual trade unionist within both the Congress of Trade 
Unions and the National Council of Trade Unions. 
  The party has fielded only 100 candidates nationally, with 
the first 30 comprising at least 12 shop floor workers. The 
party says in its manifesto that it does not hope to be 
government but intends to promote the formation of a Mass 
Workers, Party. 
  Firmly rooted in socialist programmes, the WLP says other 
parties have compromised with capitalism. These are excerpts 
from the election manifesto: 
<H5>  The right to work </H5>
  We stand for the right to work for every worker including 
the 
unemployed. We demand an immediate end to unemployment and work 
for all on a living unemployment benefit. 
  We stand for a massive public works programme of 
electrification, building houses, schools, creches, parks, halls 
and roads primarily in townships. This programme must be under 
workers' control. The unemployed must be drawn in at a living 
wage. There must a state run training scheme for youth. 
<H5>  Health, education, housing and social services </H5>
  We stand for state provision of free and compulsory 
education 
for all up to and including matric. State provision of adequate 
housing for all, as well as state provision of free health, 
legal, recreation and other community services that will ensure 
the highest possible quality of life. We stand for paid 
education leave of 30 days for each worker per year and longer 
periods of training to be negotiated with worker organisations. 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
  "We believe in working class control over the means of 
production and distribution. We believe in socialism from 
below. We stand for nationalisation under worker control of the 
monopoly companies, banks, mines and land without compensation. 
All areas that have been privatised or about to be privatised 
like railways, electricity and steel should be renationalised 
under workers control." 
<H5>  Trade unions </H5>
  "We stand for strong, united and democratic trade unions and 
community organisations. We believe in a living wage, 35-hour 
week with no loss of pay, an end to retrenchment and a full 
right to picket." 
<H5>  Land </H5>
  The land shall be redistributed among all those who live and 
work on the land in accordance with acceptable principles of 
agricultural economics and democratic consultation. The land of 
absentee landlords and the defence force must be confiscated and 
used for productive purposes. 
<H5>  Equality </H5>
  "The party will fight against oppression of women. Sexism at 
home, at the workplace, in the township and on the farms must be 
exposed and fought against. The disabled must receive proper 
rehabilitation. Children's rights should be entrenched in the 
constitution. The state must ensure that every child has three 
nutritious meals a day and be given adequate shelter and care." 
<H5>  Apartheid crimes </H5>
  No general amnesty and we will bring to trial those who 
defended the apartheid capitalist regime. We must have our own 
Nuremberg trials in SA. We also stand for the bringing to book 
of all those involved in state corruption. 
<H5>  Foreign debt and IMF loans </H5>
  Will campaign against the repayment of loans made by the 
apartheid state from international capital including the 
IMF/World Bank. 
<H5>  Tribalism </H5>

  We reject these divisions and we are against federalism 
based 
on ethnic principles.

<F P=106> [Address by COSATU General Secretary Sam Shilowa at an </F>
Independent Electoral Commission conference in Johannesburg on 
18 March issued by COSATU on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  "Black Economic Empowerment" </H5>
  The fashionable definition of `black economic empowerment' 
is 
the placing of black people in high profile managerial 
positions. More recently, this has been expanded to include the 
acquisition by a few individuals of equity in companies 
previously owned exclusively by whites. In the not too distant 
future, some will further extend this definition to include a 
black elite whose access to political office will, it is 
presumed give them access to the state coffers. 
  Of course, if we accept this definition, we would play 
directly into the syndrome of `white faces, black masks'. That 
is, the economy continues to be owned and controlled by a small 
minority, while the majority remain trapped in squalor and 
poverty. A few blacks, and a few women, are co-opted into what 
was previously a white boy's club. The rules of the game, 
however, remain fundamentally the same. 
  This is not empowerment, but black economic disempowerment. 
It leaves the lives of the majority of people unchanged. It is 
the story of the majority of post-colonial societies, inside and 
outside Africa--a story of broken promises, compradorism, 
corrupt elites, and betrayal. It is a story which COSATU 
[Congress of South African Trade Unions] and the working people 
are determined will not be repeated in our country. 
  The debate about black economic empowerment and affirmative 
action has until recently largely been confined to the 
boardrooms. For the majority, these discussions have been 
remote. At best, they have been seen as attempts by a system in 
crisis to defend itself by selectively co-opting blacks into 
token positions. At worst, the black economic empowerment 
debate has been seen as irrelevant to changing the lives of the 
majority of people. 
  This situation is now changing. We want to redefine the 
terms of the debate, so that it can be placed at the centre of 
our agenda for transformation. Black economic empowerment needs 
to be seen not as a cosmetic attempt to dress up old apartheid 
structures of power and privilege by co-opting selected 
individuals. Rather it should be viewed as a programme to 
genuinely empower millions of people who have previously been 
disempowered. 
  This new definition of black economic empowerment would 
involve at least four key objectives: 

  -  Empowering the majority who have been economically 
dispossessed to participate meaningfully in the mainstream of 
the economy at all levels; 
  -  Unleashing the previously stifled human potential of the 
majority in a way which benefits them and their communities; 
  -  Creating the infrastructure needed for viable economic 
activity, which is currently denied to vast areas of our country; 
  -  Involving people directly in decision-making which affects 
their lives. This means first and foremost empowering them in 
the area of economic decision-making. 

    The democratic movement's Programme of Reconstruction and 
Development [RDP] is precisely designed to achieve these 
objectives. The RDP should therefore be seen as a programme of 
economic empowerment. As I unpack this new definition of black 
economic empowerment, I will try to show how the RDP intends to 
go about achieving these objectives. 
<H5>  Affirmative Action </H5>
  Affirmative action in the workplace is a means of redressing 
past discrimination and disadvantage which has denied black, 
women, rural and disabled people equality of employment 
opportunity. There are two main elements to affirmative action: 
to eliminate discrimination, whether blatant or subtle; to 
implement positive measures to eliminate past disadvantage. 
  Affirmative action for us, therefore goes much deeper than 
just putting a few black faces into supervisory and management 
positions. 
  Chapter Four of the Reconstruction and Development Programme 
outlines areas where affirmative action is needed. It argues 
that to be effective, affirmative action measures would have to 
contain at least the following seven elements: 
  1. A massive programme of education, training, retraining, 
adult basic education and recognition of prior learning, to 
overcome the legacy of apartheid; 
  2. Empower not only individuals, but communities and groups, 
under conditions which promote the collective rights and 
capacity of workers and their representatives to negotiate 
workplace issues; 
  3. Establish principles for the hiring and promotion of 
workers which will prevent discrimination against people 
previously disadvantaged by apartheid; 
  4. Accelerate, through collective bargaining programmes, the 
eradication of discrimination in each and every workplace; 
  5. Provide job security for pregnant women and promote the 
provision of child care, to further women's equality in 
employment; 
  6. Ensure that the development of special expertise among 
South Africans takes priority over the import of outside 
personnel; and 
  7. Establish legislation and a strong ombuds to monitor and 
implement affirmative action measures. 
  The last point notwithstanding, we do not believe that 
legislation or quotas should be the main mechanisms for 
achieving affirmative action. Social and workplace programmes 
negotiated directly with workers must be at the heart of any 
affirmative action drive. 
  At the level of the workplace this means negotiations need 
to 
take place between management and unions on a process of 
affirmative action. This should result in the setting up of 
joint affirmative action committees, with equal representation. 
Management would need to give full commitment to the 
implementation of a programme. Resources would need to be made 
available, including for training, research on the problems to 
be addressed, and full disclosure of information. 
  The committee would need to identify areas which need 
attention. These could include; recruitment procedures and 
procedures for promotion; working conditions; training, 
education, and career paths; disciplinary procedures; 
retrenchment and retirement; wage differentials and benefits; 
facilities; and codes of conduct. 
  Having identified the problem areas, the union and 
management 
should negotiate a plan to address them. The plan should 
include both `negative' and `positive' elements: removing all 
barriers to equality, and formulating measures to ensure that 
the whole company employment structure becomes broadly 
representative of the composition of South African society. 
Genuine affirmative action programmes should also aim to go 
beyond the company gates, into the communities. 
  It is not enough to have an impressive-looking programme 
with noble statements of intent. The plan should contain clear 
time frames and targets, as well as mechanisms to ensure joint 
monitoring and evaluation. If the company's target is to ensure 
that artisans reflect the composition of South African society 
by 1998, there must be a clear programme which sets out how this 
target will be achieved. 
  This is not to suggest that the negotiation of affirmative 
action programmes should be limited to the workplace. National 
measures are necessary in relation to education and training, 
for example, which would have to be implemented both at industry 
level, and by the state. 
  The democratic state will play a key role in implementing an 
affirmative action programme. Public sector employment 
practices should set an example for the private sector. In 
addition to the process of affirmative action negotiations 
outlined above, government should introduce measures to ensure 
that government departments and parastatals reach their targets. 
Importantly, this needs to include reduction of differentials 
between low-paid and high-paid workers. Funding of departments 
could be made contingent on submission of acceptable plans. 
  The democratic government should also take steps to use its 
influence over the private sector to promote affirmative action. 
These could include: procurement policies which specify that 
any publically funded programme, or commissioning of goods and 
services by the state, will be conditional on the relevant 
company having made satisfactory progress in implementing an 
affirmative action programme; any state funding or subsidies to 
private institutions would similarly be contingent on progress 
in this area. Further particular priority could be given in 
allocating state funding to programmes which play an important 
role in advancing the process of affirmative action, eg adult 
basic education. 
  The state would need to ensure a massive expansion of the 
country's labour market statistical base. This is necessary to 
monitor the degree of progress being made in different areas in 
implementing the programme. 
  Finally, I want to deal with irresponsible statements made 
by 
the NP [National Party] and some employers that affirmative 
action aims to replace whites, coloureds and Indians with 
African workers. Affirmative action is part of our 
reconstruction programme which aims to ensure that all our human 
resources are properly developed, and that mass unemployment is 
not regarded as something acceptable, regardless of which sector 
of our society is affected. 
  Affirmative action is aimed at uplifting all those 
communities which have been historically disadvantaged by 
apartheid. Coloured and Indian communities would therefore be 
major beneficiaries of affirmative action programmes. 
  Affirmative action is not designed to punish any particular 
group. White workers are already becoming victims of the 
economic devastation caused by apartheid. The unleashing of the 
countries productive potential, and the resultant economic 
growth and job creation which will flow from bringing previously 
disadvantaged workers into the mainstream of the economy, will 
ultimately benefit all workers, including white workers. COSATU 
rejects any attempt to abuse affirmative action to create racial 
divisions between workers. Mere replacement of white individuals 
with blacks is tokenism which distorts the whole purpose of 
affirmative action. 
<H5>  Workplace Democratisation </H5>
  The South African economy is in a typical third world cul de 
sac--cheap labour, low skill, low technology, overreliance on 
primary commodities. Employers have to come to terms with the 
fact that to get out of this trap we have to end the culture of 
unilateral management decision-making. Industrial 
democratisation is the only route available to South Africa 
which will unleash the creative and productive potential of our 
people. 
  Meaningful empowerment of workers goes way beyond the 
so-called 'worker participation' schemes which are springing up 
in our industries. Most of these schemes, such as quality 
circles, just-in-time etc, are devised to involve workers in 
reorganising work, in a bid to raise levels of productivity and 
profitability. They do not empower workers to make decisions on 
fundamental issues affecting their lives. Further, these 
schemes concentrate on the micro-issues, and do not involve 
workers in decisions on the broad strategic direction of the 
whole company or industry. 
  There is a need for a radical rethink on the process of 
industrial democratisation, to ensure meaningful economic 
empowerment of the majority of workers. Management will have to 
accept that decisions on areas such as investment; technology; 
research and development; training; job creation; levels of 
renumeration; and even distribution of profits; can no longer be 
their sole preserve. Joint decision-making in these area will 
have to become a fact of economic life if our economy is to 
emerge from its current crisis. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] has committed itself to 
ensuring workplace empowerment. The RDP states that: 
"Legislation must facilitate worker participation and 
decision-making in the world of work. Such legislation must 
include an obligation on employers to negotiate substantial 
changes concerning production matters or workplace organisation 
within a nationally negotiated framework." 
  The RDP states further that "company and tax law must be 
amended to ensure that the rights of workers are protected and 
extended...in relation to workers access to company information". 
  This path of industrial democratisation is new for both 
management and unions. We will all have to climb a steep 
learning curve. 
<H5>  Black Ownership </H5>
  The issue of black economic empowerment and black ownership 
is often seen as depending on the acquisition by individual 
entrepreneurs of companies. Yet what is forgotten is that trade 
unions are the single biggest vehicle of empowerment for black 
people. As we confront the challenge of rebuilding the economy, 
we are determined to use our economic muscle to benefit our 
members and their communities. 
  Workers have invested billions of rand in pension and 
provident funds. Yet they have little say in how their money is 
invested. While they and their families cry out for investment 
in jobs, housing, infrastructure, and real development; pension 
funds continue to speculate on the stock exchange, and on glass 
buildings. COSATU is discussing ways of ensuring that real 
control of how their money is invested is put in the hands of 
workers. 
  The RDP states that "pension and provident funds should be 
made more accountable to their members.... The democratic 
government must change the law to ensure adequate representation 
for workers through the trade unions and...legislate a 
transformation of the boards of the mutual funds to make them 
more socially responsible." 
  Other forms of ownership by workers and unions have emerged 
and need to be developed further. These include the setting up 
of co-operatives and small businesses for retrenched workers. 
Another possibility which needs to be explored is of workers 
taking over their companies through buy-outs. There have been 
successful examples of workers taking over failing companies in 
countries such as the USA and Britain. These experiments have 
not yet been possible here, however. 
  Workers share ownership schemes which have been introduced 
by 
employers have, until now been tokenism of the worst kind. At 
best these have been meaningless charity. At worst they have 
been transparent attempts to diffuse union struggles for a 
living wage. Share ownership schemes could only be of any real 
benefit to workers if negotiated with them, and if accompanied 
by a meaningful measure of worker control. 
  Recently there have been a spate of takeovers, deals, and 
launches of new companies by black entrepreneurs. To the extent 
that this represents a challenge to the existing white 
monopolies, and a move in the direction of socially responsible 
business, COSATU would welcome these developments. Further, it 
represents a move away from the traditional image of black 
business being confined to taxis, bottle stores, and shebeens. 
  However, at least some of these deals have exhibited the 
same 
old syndrome of `white faces, black masks'. Black businessmen 
must be wary of being used by conglomerates to serve their own 
ends. A failure to distinguish between genuine empowerment, and 
fronting for white business, will continue to create a 
credibility problem for black business. 
  The Reconstruction and Development Programme identifies the 
existence of monopolies and conglomerates as the main obstacle 
of black business: "The domination of business activities by 
white business and the exclusion of black people from the 
mainstream of economic activity are causes for great concern.. 
A central objective of the RDP is to deracialise business 
ownership and control completely, through focussed policies of 
black economic empowerment.... The RDP will introduce strict 
anti-trust legislation to create a more competitive and dynamic 
business environment. The central objectives of such 
legislation are to systematically discourage the system of 
pyramids where they lead to over- concentration of economic 
power and interlocking directorships, to abolish numerous 
anti-competitive practices such as market domination and abuse, 
and to prevent the exploitation of consumers." 
  The opening up of the economy will also led to the flowering 
of small and medium enterprises (SME's). The building of 
infrastructure, the installation of electricity, and the 
increase in peoples purchasing power will create unprecedented 
opportunities for the setting up of SME's particularly in 
townships and rural areas. 
  The RDP emphasises that policies need to be put in place to 
develop the much-romanticised informal sector from `marginalised 
survival strategies into dynamic small enterprises that provide 
a decent leaving for both employees and entrepreneurs'. 
  The RDP identifies four major constraints facing small and 
micro enterprise (informal sector) including the lack of access 
to: credit, markets, skills and supportive institutional 
arrangements. A range of measures are proposed which the state 
can implement to address these problems. These include: 
Government agencies must provide infrastructure and...provide 
training in productive and managerial skills. The government 
must require financial institutions to lend a rising share of 
their assets to black-owned enterprise. All levels of the state 
should...support joint marketing strategies and technological 
development within the small-scale sector. Existing agencies 
such as SBDC [Small Business Development Corporation] and IDC 
[Industrial Development Corporation] should be restructured to 
support small business more effectively...and end corruption and 
nepotism in their lending programmes. Infrastructural programmes 
(such as building of roads, electricity) must take the 
implications for micro enterprise into account. Local government 
must review zoning and licensing regulations to end 
discrimination against micro and small enterprise. 
<H5>  Black Business and Social Responsibility </H5>
  COSATU will support these initiatives to empower all 
sections 
of our community to start businesses. The main proviso for this 
is that labour standards and the basic rights of workers mustn't 
be undermined. There is a danger, particularly in the context 
of the domination of our economy by monopolies, that emerging 
black business could seek to gain their competitive advantage 
through cheap labour and bad working conditions. 
  This is the path which emerging business has taken in some 
parts of the developing world. This parasitical form of 
capitalism is in fact encouraged by big business, which sees 
opportunities to lower its costs by closing down certain 
activities and sub-contracting to sweat shops, which they have a 
cosy relationship with. Such a trend is already beginning to 
emerge in South Africa, spearheaded by certain large 
corporations. This results in large-scale retrenchments and 
union bashing. COSATU wants to warn that this is a recipe for 
conflict. It won't work in our part of the world. The ANC has 
also rejected this path, committing itself in the RDP to protect 
workers rights and labour standards in SME's. 
  It is a myth, perpetuated by big business, that small 
business necessarily means sweat-shop style operations. The 
most successful SMEs and micro businesses, in terms of 
productivity, job creation, and technological development, are 
in fact in places like Italy, where flexibility is maintained 
without attacking labour standards. We need to study 
international experiences such as this, where industrial 
districts are developed to support SME's, and co- operation is 
sought with workers. 
  Black business, whether in SME's, or in larger enterprises, 
should be a pioneer of new relationships in the workplace. The 
forms of workplace democratisation and joint decision-making 
outlined above would place these businesses at an advantage, in 
terms of community support, levels of productivity, and 
technological development. The type of support mechanisms 
proposed by the RDP, together with healthy relationships with 
the trade unions, could enable black businesses to make this 
breakthrough. 
<H5>  Land and Rural Development </H5>
  Land is possibly the area where the black community has been 
most brutally disempowered by apartheid. It is therefore 
surprising that when people talk about black economic 
empowerment, the question of land reform is invariably left out. 
  According to the RDP "a national land reform programme is 
the 
central and driving force of rural development. Such a 
programme aims to address effectively the injustices of forced 
removals and the historical denial of access to land. It aims 
to ensure security of tenure for rural dwellers. And in 
implementing the national land reform programme, and through the 
provision of support services, the democratic government 
will...generate large-scale employment, increase rural incomes 
and eliminate overcrowding." 
  The land reform programme has two aspects: redistribution of 
residential and productive land to those who need it but cannot 
afford it, and restitution for those who lost land because of 
apartheid laws. The latter will be achieved by a land claims 
court, aimed at restoring land to those dispossessed since 1913. 
  The RDP outlines various ways in which land redistribution 
can be accomplished, aiming to redistribute 30 percent of 
agricultural land by 1999. This will be achieved by: 
strengthening property rights of communities already occupying 
land, combining market and non-market mechanisms to provide 
land, and using vacant government land. 
  Specific mechanisms proposed by the RDP to redistribute land 
include: 
  Acquiring land already on sale and land acquired by corrupt 
means from the apartheid state or mortgaged to state and 
parastatal bodies. 
  Substantial funding must be provided for land 
redistribution. 
A land tax on rural land must help to free up underutilised 
land, raise revenues for rural infrastructure, and promote the 
productive use of land. 
  Rural infrastructure, support services and training must be 
provided to ensure that land can be utilised effectively. 
  Rural development must also unsure that proper 
infrastructure 
is provided to rural areas, particularly the `homelands', where 
most rural people live, and have been denied access to the most 
basic infrastructure and social services. Small-scale farming, 
as well as small business needs to be supported. 
  The RDP proposes that "rural development policy must aim to 
co-ordinate the activities of the relevant democratic government 
agents, and to pass much of the control of democratic government 
funded services to the rural people for whom they are intended. 
The democratic government will include a central ministry of 
rural development and land reform. A unit for rural data 
collection and an early warning system for food and water 
security." 
<H5>  Empowerment of Black Women </H5>
  The legacy of apartheid, particularly the migrant labour and 
bantustan system, has meant that the majority of the poor in 
South Africa are black women. Measures aimed to address the 
disempowerment of women, and boost their role within the 
economy- particularly in relation to jobs, small business, land, 
and training are crucial if black women are not to be left on 
the margins of the economy. 
  We are proposing the following to empower black women: 
  Public works programmes must maximise the involvement of 
women and youth in the poorest rural households and most 
deprived regions to create assets such as water supply, 
sanitation and clinics. Institutions, practices and laws, 
including tenure and atrimonial laws, which discriminate 
against womens access to land must be reviewed to remove womens 
disabilities in relation to land. Adult basic education and 
training programmes should give special emphasis to equipping 
women to enter into the mainstream of economic life. These 
should have child-care facilities. 
  An accessible programme must be established to ensure 
government support for women entrepreneurs. It should include 
business training and access to credit the micro enterprise or 
informal sector requires special attention. 
  Local service centres and satellites must be increased to 
service women involved in enterprises. Women themselves need to 
be involved in planning and implementing these measures. Women 
must be involved in all the relevant institutions, councils 
and commissions. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  We have tried to show that black economic empowerment goes 
way beyond the creation of a black elite, or the enrichment of a 
few individuals. Affirmative action, workplace democratisation, 
worker ownership, black business, and land reform, if 
implemented properly, will bring about a revolution in the lives 
of millions of ordinary South Africans. 
  If we realise this vision, we can bring about an economic 
miracle parallel to what has happened in other parts of the 
world, without relying on social degradation and repression to 
achieve this. We can unleash the pent-up energies and 
productive potential of our people which has been suppressed for 
so long. Economic growth will be integrally linked with job 
creation, the provision of basic infrastructure, massive human 
resource development, and the expansion of our productive 
sector. The Reconstruction and Development Programme aims to 
carve out such a path. We invite business to walk this road 
with us.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Big Defence Force Call-Up -- Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English 
on 23 March in a page-20 editorial says "the country's situation 
before, during and immediately after the election seems destined 
to become more volatile, not less; so there is a strong argument 
for the authorities to tap all available security manpower in 
the form of a big Defence Force call-up. In deciding on this 
step, the SADF [South African Defense Force] top brass will have 
been encouraged by the discipline and efficiency of their troops 
in the Bophuthatswana crisis." 
  De Klerk, NP `Main Casualties' in Goldstone Report Fallout 
-- 
In an article on the same page, Patrick Laurence writes that 
President de Klerk and his National Party "are likely to be the 
main casualties in the fall-out" from Justice Richard 
Goldstone's interim report implicating top police generals in 
politically motivated violence. "De Klerk's immediate reaction 
has been to place all the policemen named in the report on 
compulsory leave and to declare himself in favour of an 
investigation into the allegations by an international team of 
policemen, assisted by one of South Africa's four 
attorney-generals and an eminent jurist from outside South 
Africa. But De Klerk's actions may paradoxically be not enough 
and too much: not enough to allay suspicions in the black 
community that he has lost control of his security forces and 
too much for the police generals and white conservatives to 
stomach." The failure of the De Klerk government to prosecute 
military officers in 1993 "works against it on both flanks. 
Black radicals see it as evidence of his unwillingness to take 
decisive action; white conservatives interpret it as evidence of 
his willingness to sacrifice innocent men to appease the ANC 
[African National Congress]." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Call For Policemen Indemnity -- "Unpleasant as it may seem, 
the way to the truth about police and the `third force' is 
probably through offering indemnity to policemen who may have 
inside knowledge," declares a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 23 March. The priority must be "to 
find out what happened." "If policemen committed or encouraged 
political murders, it is important to know on whose orders they 
acted. What matters now is accountability, whether of senior 
officers or senior politicians. Name the killers, but blame 
those who sent them, failed to stop them or pretended they did 
not exist."

  [Text] Bisho, Ciskei March 22 SAPA -- Striking Ciskei 
police set up armed guards at the gates of the Bisho Police 
College on Tuesday [22 March] night and were breaking out stores 
of ammunition amid rumours that the South African Internal 
Stability Division was on its way. The mood was tense. 
  Some of the strikers have apparently been sent to King 
William's Town to monitor the arrival of the SAP [South African 
Police] and then to race back to give their colleagues advance 
warning. 
  Earlier a spokesman for the strikers, Sgt S G Hewana, said 
they would "talk" to the South Africans. "The police will come 
and talk to us and we will tell them why we are here and they 
will listen to us." 
  He said the strikers were holding 15 officers hostage 
including three brigadiers, two colonels and two captains. 
  The strikers are also holding hostage the wives of several 
officers who they have been unable to locate. 
  Sgt Hewana said the strikers had no grievance against Brig 
Gqozo but "we want our grievances to be solved." 
  Earlier strikers released a list of demands which included 
pension payouts before March 28 and leave gratuities to be 
handed over to all Ciskei police force members not later than 
March 24. 
  All officers in the force allegedly involved in corruption 
should be immediately suspended, they said. These officers 
should not be released until the Ciskei attorney general decided 
whether or not to prosecute them. 
  A spokesman for the strikers said colleagues had been sent 
to 
fetch Police Commissioner Maj-Gen M Noqayi, also suspected by 
the strikers of corruption. The police commissioner was 
reportedly seeking refuge at Ciskei leader Brig Gqozo's state 
house. The strikers said he would be arrested when he was found.

  [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- South African Ambassador 
to Ciskei Mr Pieter van Rensburg Goosen and the Rev Bongani 
Blessing Finca were on Wednesday [23 March] named joint 
administrators of Ciskei. Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha, 
in a statement on behalf of the government and the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC], said the appointments followed a 
request on Tuesday by Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo for an 
interim administration to take over the running of the territory. 
  The government had taken into account that Brig Gqozo's 
government no longer exercised effective governmental control in 
Ciskei. The government and the management committee of the 
Executive Council appealed to all sectors of Ciskei society to 
lend their full support to the joint administrators, refrain 
from violence, return to their daily functions and tasks, and 
accept that all state employees would retain their pensions, 
salaries and positions.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks continue to be heading no 
where. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has 
already arrived back from his trips to secure help from 
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Moroccan King Hassan II. 
Whatever he may have brought back has not yet had any effect on 
the obstinacy displayed by the negotiating teams. 
  In Zimbabwe, the UN special representative talked of 
progress 
and accused the media of speculating when it talks of a 
stalemate at the talks. There is arguing against facts, though: 
No plenary meetings have been held in the Zambian capital over 
the last 20 days because there has been nothing to narrow the 
gaps between the two sides. 
  Simultaneously the least and most important thing to have 
happened at the peace talks so far is that the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, has rejected the 
ministerial portfolios, provinces, and communes proposed by the 
government. 
  Lusaka-based analysts are advising that the talks go into 
recess, at least until some new and active influence can be 
brought to bear on the correlation of forces. They note that 
international observers are also beginning to disagree among 
themselves. 
  The Angolan Government team went to State House again today 
to meet Zambian President Frederick Chiluba. The UN special 
representative's spokesman was here at the hotel for talks with 
the government team.

  [Excerpts] In an interview with MOCAMBIQUE NOVOS TEMPOS, 
Jose Chicuara Massinga, president of the National Democratic 
Party [Panade] said: It is not enough to change the term 
communist to democrat. It is equally important to change one's 
mentality and act in accordance with the concepts of democracy. 
It is important to admit that others too have the capacity to 
think like them (members of the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo]). 
  Jose Massinga says he has not observed any change in 
Frelimo. 
"Their heads are still full of communist concepts and they still 
think they are the only thinking human beings in this country," 
he said. A clear example of this was observed during the 
"multiparty" talks when the Frelimo government showed its usual 
arrogance. [passage omitted] 
  Jose Chicuara Massinga was a Frelimo militant from the first 
days of its founding, in 1962, until 1981 when he was arrested 
together with a number of officers from the Mozambique Armed 
Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique, accused 
of being a CIA agent. Asked to give his version of events, 
Massinga denied having at any time spied for the CIA. 
  After the investigations it was noted that none of the 
prisoners had links with South Africa, hence the CIA story was 
invented to implicate Dr. Massinga, who had American friends 
working in Mozambique. 
  "They made it a big story, since they controlled all the 
news 
media, and the system then did not allow a person to defend 
himself," he said. 
  Jose Massinga said: "The inconsistency lies in the fact that 
the people who accused me of being a CIA agent survive, along 
with their regime, partly because of the money from the United 
States, which owns the CIA that `tormented' them. It is, 
therefore, correct to ask who the CIA agent is: me or them?" 
  Massinga said that, after making up this story, Frelimo 
confiscated all his property, notably his house, car, and 
clothes. He is currently living with his niece, who gave him a 
room, while he is waiting for his confiscated property to be 
returned.

  [Excerpts] Lessees of some hotel industry and 
bakery-related commercial establishments, as well as tenants of 
houses in the city of Manica, have spoken out against the 
measure taken recently by provincial trade authorities to return 
to the alleged owner of the former Manica Commercial Company the 
property they have exploited since nationalization in 1976. 
  Speaking to the NOTICIAS reporter in that part of the 
country, they described as "absurd" the decision that has been 
made by the provincial trade authorities and have demanded 
"serious and plausible explanations" from those responsible. 
  In addition to demanding high indemnification for the 
maintenance, rehabilitation, and restoration work done to those 
buildings over the course of the years, they questioned the 
legality of the measures being taken by the state. 
  In that context, they wondered how it was possible that the 
state, which is now selling houses, should take measures whereby 
such buildings are returned to people turning up claiming to be 
their rightful owners. 
  They also accused some Trade Ministry workers of forging 
documents without the knowledge of their superiors for the 
benefit of those who left the country for political and other 
reasons after independence but who, now that the war is over, 
are back and claiming ownership. 
  In the opinion of those economic agents, documents 
authorizing the return of such buildings to their former owners 
are not produced in accordance with legal procedures but arise, 
rather, from devious procedures. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Trade Director's Response </H5>
  When he was approached by our reporter, Manica Provincial 
Trade Director Jose Gabriel Cuna said that "the whole process 
concerning the handing over of the buildings in question was 
authorized by Prime Minister Mario Machungo. The other dispatch 
came from the Trade Ministry." 
  Referring specifically to the dispatch by the Trade 
Ministry, 
Jose Cuna noted that that document contains instructions that 
must be followed when buildings are returned so that there is no 
friction with their current lessees. 
  He admitted that the first documents dealing with the case 
had not come via official routes, but he stated that "the whole 
process is being carried out in accordance with the law so as 
not to harm current occupants who have invested a great deal of 
money to maintain those buildings." He added that the 
implementation of the process to return that company had begun 
long ago, but he failed to provide the date or the year when it 
had begun. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Ghana today appealed for massive assistance from 
the international community, especially the country's 
development partners, to help meet the extrabudgetary 
expenditure on rehabilitating displaced persons in the ethnic 
conflict in the northern region. Making the appeal at a meeting 
with members of the diplomatic corps in Accra, the minister of 
foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, said the government is 
developing a mechanism that would serve as an early warning 
system to forestall such conflicts in the future. Afari Morny 
reports: 
  [Begin Morny recording] The interethnic conflict in the 
northern region dates back to 1980, but the magnitude of 
previous hostilities is nowhere near what is being witnessed in 
recent times. [passage omitted] Dr. Asamoah told the diplomats 
that there is peace and tranquility in the rest of the country 
and that there is no danger of the conflict spilling over to 
other areas. He said while the task force will pursue plans to 
achieve its objectives, the government, political and opinion 
leaders should intensify their reconciliatory role to achieve a 
lasting solution to the conflict. Dr. Asamoah hinted that the 
government is developing a mechanism that would serve as an 
early warning system to forestall such situations in future. 
  The minister of information, Mr. Kofi Totobi Quakyi, 
repeated 
the guinea fowl story as the immediate cause of the conflict. 
He however stressed that there is no need to apportion blame at 
this stage. A deputy minister of employment and social welfare, 
Mrs. Amah Benuah Andoh, spelled out long and short term programs 
to provide food, shelter and drugs for the misplaced persons and 
to resettle them. She repeated Dr. Asamoah's appeal to the 
international community, to supplement the government efforts to 
meet the extra budgetary expenditure on the rehabilitation of 
the misplaced persons. [end recording]

  [Text] An agreement for mobilization against violence has 
been signed by 16 political parties in Senegal. This 
mobilization comes in the wake of the bloody demonstration that 
took place in Dakar last month, where members of the security 
forces were killed in cold blood. 
  Amath Dansokho, a government minister [of urban planning and 
housing] and an opposition leader, is one of the signatories of 
the agreement: 
  [Begin Dansokho recording] It is necessary to put an end to 
this drift. It is extremely serious, because one has to realize 
that we have very fragile states, and, should there be any 
illusion as to the Senegalese peculiarity, I think that 
everything has now [word indistinct]. It is necessary to face 
facts: If we carry on like this, we are going to lose our 
country. This is a call to all democrats in Senegal, to all 
those concerned about civilian peace, to all those concerned 
about a civilized political life and who oppose a barbarous 
drift, because it is us. This is the way things go in Africa.

March; place not given] 
  [Text] The Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] steering 
committee met today. After analyzing in detail the situation 
prevailing in country and taking into consideration the emotions 
and anxiety that misunderstandings between the two parties have 
raised, the UTD hereby appeals for calm. The UTD has decided to 
send the following letter to Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor, president of 
the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR]: 
  Following the discussions that we held recently, I would 
like 
to bring the following clarifications to your attention in my 
capacity as president of the UTD: 
  1. The UTD has no intention to vie for any government or 
parliamentary post in the institutions of the Fourth Republic 
under any controversial circumstances. It is therefore clear 
that in the absence of any consensus, the UTD will not accept 
any of these posts. 
  2. The UTD understands that as far as it is concerned, the 
CAR wants to occupy all or part of these posts. The UTD does 
not find this inconvenient at all. 
  3. The UTD is on the side of the Togolese people in their 
march toward the establishment and consolidation of the rule of 
law and democracy. 
  4. The UTD hopes that these points will help clarify the 
present situation and strengthen the cohesion of the 
parliamentary majority so much yearned for by the Togolese 
people.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Presidency; place and date not </F>
given] 
  [Text] Since the sovereign national conference, the 
Togolese people have been suffering a great deal from the 
various interpretations of democracy and the provisions for the 
transition. But through patience and determination, they 
mobilized themselves for the pursuit of the democratic process 
that saw the adoption of a new constitution and the holding of 
presidential and legislative elections. According to the 
official results of the legislative elections proclaimed on 14 
March, two political parties, namely the Action Committee for 
Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], won 
parliamentary majority at the National Assembly. 
  In conformity with the provisions of Article 66 of the 
Constitution, the head of state should have named a prime 
minister from within this majority in line with the 
Constitution. But the head of state, out of his concern to 
demonstrate his clearly expressed desire on the eve of the 
elections to set up a broad-based national government whatever 
the elections results may be, decided to hold prior 
consultations with political party leaders. He, therefore, 
received the CAR and UTD leaders on two occasions. 
Unfortunately, after meeting on two occasions with the two 
leaders accompanied by officials of their parties and after two 
other private meetings with these leaders, no consensus was 
reached because the two party leaders have not been able to 
reach an agreement. 
  However, out of his regard for the deep aspirations of the 
people and, in particular, out of his concern to avoid the 
baneful consequences of a policy of exclusion, the head of state 
is relentlessly continuing his consultations with the CAR and 
UTD chairmen. He has already accepted the resignation of the 
transitional government, which he has asked to expedite pending 
matters. Meanwhile, the people, who are deeply affected, are 
waiting for the setting up of the new government team so that 
they can resume their political, economic, and social activities 
as soon as possible with more confidence and in full force. For 
this reason and in the supreme interest of the nation, the head 
of state is making an urgent appeal to the leaders of the two 
political parties to meet the people's expectations.

number of international radios. Cyriaque Simbizi, minister of 
information and government spokesman, has denied the rumor which 
is creating tension in our country. He added that whoever is 
charged spreading this rumor will be severely punished. 
  [Begin Simbizi recording] On behalf of the government, I 
would like to tell Burundi and the world that there has been no 
coup d'etat in recent days. These are rumors which we heard 
mainly here in Bujumbura. As I announced even yesterday, these 
are rumors circulating here in the town of Bujumbura. We were 
surprised to hear foreign radios adamantly asserting that there 
has been a coup d'etat. Foreign radios -- about two of them -- 
reported that nobody knew the whereabouts of the head of state 
and that ministers had fled the country. I can state that all 
these are lies. I would like journalists to explain to the 
citizens and the international community listening to us that 
this is a baseless lie. [passage omitted] [end recording]

streets strewn with mutilated bodies. 
  Meanwhile, the presidential palace has been surrounded since

yesterday, President Cyprien Ntaryamira appealed for calm and 
national reconciliation, but his appeal has apparently not been 
heeded since people continued to be massacred throughout the 
night. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Due to the worsening crisis in Burundi in the 
last few days, President Cyprien Ntaryamira and Burundi Catholic 
bishops issued statements yesterday in which they urged 
Burundians to exercise greater restraint, given that there is an 
increasing number of victims. Concerning the problem of 
security, the situation remains confused in some estates of 
Bujumbura, notably at Cibitoke, Kamenge, and Gikungu where 
gunfire was heard last night. We contacted the commander of the 
2d Intervention Battalion, Commander Appolinaire Ndayizamba, who 
described to us the situation in the northern section of the 
town last night. Commander Ndayizamba answers questions from 
our colleague, Gregoire Nijimbere: 
  [Begin recording] [Ndayizamba] In the course of last night, 
we heard sporadic shooting, notably from Gikungu, Gihosha, 
Cibitoke, and Kinama districts of Bujumbura. I must tell you 
that even if [word indistinct] conditions include leaving the 
Kamenge area, this is not good enough, as long as these people 
are not disarmed because those who acquired weapons did so for 
their own aims. [passage omitted]. 
  [Nijimbere] You were requested to withdraw, but after the 
meeting between the prime minister and the president you were 
requested to deploy wherever necessary and to intervene swiftly, 
and to withdraw once security is restored. We would like to 
know your reaction. Does this make your task of restoring peace 
easier or does it complicate it? 
  [Ndayizamba] [passage omitted] We believe that the decision 
is a political one. Those (?who made) it probably thought that 
those shooting would stop but the fact is that they are 
continuing to shoot. What we can say is that as long as these 
people, who I would describe as.... [pauses] Well, these people 
who are using weapons. As long as they are not disarmed, 
security will continue to be problematic. 
  [Nijimbere] It seems two grenades exploded in the Gikungu 
area. I would like to know about the situation there. 
  [Ndayizamba] The current situation there is that there were 
some gunshots, some shots with handguns. Grenades were launched 
with grenade launchers, rather, they were [word indistinct] 
shells. There were no casualties among the Gikungu area 
residents. After the shots -- I believe it was at 2000 -- there 
were no further shots. The rebels withdrew, probably towards 
the mountains, or hiding places, probably (?Kamenge). [end

<F P=106> [Address by President Cyprien Ntaryamira on 23 March in </F>
Bujumbura--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The Burundian people have truly embarked upon a 
journey into the unknown. Their children are dying by the 
hundreds, dozens of others are fleeing to Zaire, and secondary 
schools are engulfed in violence. The president is calling on 
everyone to return to reason, and Burundian Catholic bishops are 
appealing to the Christian conscience of their followers. But 
first of all, here is the head of state's address to the nation: 
  [Begin Ntaryamira recording] Dear compatriots, it is almost 
unnecessary to remind you that the security problem has become a 
real headache for our government, and that the future of this 
country depends on solving it. As you know, the insecurity 
prevailing in our country since [words indistinct] assassination 
of the late President Ndadaye is being demonstrated by the mass 
destruction of property, houses, and human beings. Just as we 
thought that tragedy had ended, our dear country is once again 
experiencing a deadly folly, especially in Bujumbura, in the 
case of which the relevant departments have not yet informed us 
of the sinister death toll, the number of those mutilated and 
injured, or the amount of the damages. Nevertheless, we already 
know that the toll is very heavy. [passage omitted] 
  Given the prevailing situation, it is not hard to believe 
that certain actors are not play acting, that they are talking 
with forked tongues and adopting dishonest and duplicitious 
behavior, which is likely to shake the confidence vested in them 
by the nation. 
  Thus, it is urgent that all those who have adopted such 
behavior return to reason and immediately put an end to this 
criminal strategy in order for the country to recover its true 
face and return to the proper path. To all those fishing in 
troubled waters masterminding the current tragedy, I say: 
Enough, that is enough, enough is enough, and let this be the 
last warning. 
  I take this occasion to call solemnly on every citizen of 
this country to come out of this trance, and to involve himself 
or herself resolutely in national reconciliation and in the 
reconstruction of the country. [passage omitted] 
  On my part, I reiterate my solemn commitment to do 
everything 
I can to act decisively to reconcile all the Burundians. In 
this regard, I will assume all my responsibilities decisively to 
help our country return to the path of peace, unity, democracy, 
and development. I thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address by President Paul Biya in Yaounde on 23 March -- </F>
live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] My dear compatriots: The IMF board of directors 
has just endorsed our economic recovery program and decided to 
back it. It is an important event that deserves our fullest 
attention. It is important because it has a bearing on our 
country's future. It is important because, henceforth, it will 
determine our multilateral and bilateral relations with our 
foreign partners to a certain extent. [passage omitted] 
  The international finance community's attitude clearly shows 
the confidence it places in our country and its acknowledgement 
of your efforts. I solemnly wish to thank the IMF on your 
behalf. 
  My dear compatriots I wish to salute the courage you have 
shown in accepting and enduring the sacrifices imposed on you. 
You have shown a high sense of responsibility in difficult 
circumstances. As you can see today, those sacrifices were not 
in vain. We are therefore on the right path but we should not 
relent in our efforts. I expect the administration to further 
mobilize its efforts to implement the reforms which still seem 
necessary. [passage omitted] 
  If we keep inflation -- which was inevitable following the 
CFA franc devaluation -- at a reasonable level, there is a good 
chance that we will get out of the crisis and that our future 
will be promising. I must point out that no matter how much aid 
we receive from our friends and foreign partners, the success of 
our recovery program will depend mainly on ourselves. Let us 
look around us. All countries -- big or small, rich or poor -- 
are facing problems and are quite naturally giving priority to 
their own needs. 
  The time-honored development strategies that have been used 
since independence are out of date. We must henceforth 
concentrate more than ever on the task of national 
reconstruction, relying first on our own strengths. There is 
therefore no denying that Cameroon cannot be tempted by external 
adventurism. Although there is no question of giving up our 
sovereignty over the least portion of our territory, our 
attitude remains that of moderation and conciliation. Can 
Africa, which is already torn by several conflicts, really 
accommodate new disputes between sister countries? Our 
continent needs peace in order to achieve development and that 
also holds for Cameroon. We will do everything in our power to 
ensure that the gains achieved in all sectors over the past 
years will not be jeopardized. 
  Of course, a lot more remains to be done to achieve our 
goals, but we are about to see the light at the end of the 
tunnel. Let us put our energies together. Let us be 
imaginative and work harder. By so doing, I am sure we will 
overcome our current difficulties and strengthen our people's 
hope for a better future. Long live Cameroon.

to adopt responsible behavior, so that all phases of the 
negotiations are completed. Any other attitude will, according 
to us, be irresponsible and suicidal for everyone. That is why 
we are appealing to the workers and to you as union leaders. Do 
not emulate those union leaders who, very often, have seen their 
companies facing difficulties, and despite this fact, have 
demanded salary increases. That is suicidal for the comapnies. 
It is important to know that foreign investors are interested 
in what Congolese are capable of, their capacity to be at peace 
with one another. Each of us should bear in mind that [words 
indistinct]. 
  It is therefore essential for us to understand that, after 
having destroyed our economy, we should now, together and 
collectively, commit ourselves to revamping this economy. We 
are in a period of exorcism and we need social peace. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has proposed 
that the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] take over the 
administration of kwaZulu to deal with the situation there. The 
chairman of the ANC in southern Natal, Mr. Jeff Radebe, said in 
Johannesburg that the time had come for the TEC to take charge 
so that free and fair elections could take place. The ANC's 
candidate for the Natal premiership, Mr. Jacob Zuma, said at the 
same news conference that the ANC did not want to prescribe to 
the TEC, but that it had to act. Mr. Zuma also said that there 
were signs that people in kwaZulu were tired of Chief Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's rule, which he described as autocratic.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- Elections in 
Natal/kwaZulu would not be a write-off, African National 
Congress [ANC] Deputy Secretary-General Jacob Zuma said on 
Wednesday [23 March]. He said the ANC was determined the 
elections should go ahead in spite of the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's [IFP] decision not to contest them and to mount an 
anti-election protest throughout the province. 
  Addressing a press briefing in Johannesburg, Mr Zuma and ANC 
Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe called for the Transitional 
Executive Council and electoral bodies to ensure a free and fair 
in Natal/kwaZulu. If this could be ensured only by the 
Executive Council taking over the kwaZulu administration, they 
would be prepared to call for this step. "The situation is 
explosive," Mr Radebe claimed. 
  A meeting would be held at Durban's Currie's Fountain on 
Friday to start a protest campaign. The ANC in Natal and the 
party's National Executive Committee was discussing rolling mass 
action. 
  Mr Radebe said the meeting would demonstrate the majority of 
Zulus wanted the elections to go ahead. Opinion polls indicated 
only 18 per cent of the electorate would support the IFP. 
  He said the National Peacekeeping Force had to be deployed 
in 
the region. Mr Zuma said he could not prescribe what steps the 
executive council should take. It was disturbing that the pre- 
election period was being disrupted by means of resources 
claimed to have been provided to the kwaZulu government by the 
central government. 
  They said there had been a breakdown in law and order in 
Natal/kwaZulu. 
  Mr Zuma said attempts at international mediation between the 
ANC and the IFP were continuing. The ANC would continue these 
efforts until it became clear there was no point in carrying on.

<F P=106> [Interview with TEC member Joe Slovo by announcer Astrid </F>
Ascar on the "Newsline" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Ascar] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] is 
behind some of the moves as it today sent its delegation into 
the area. Now to give us the TEC perspective we have in the 
studio Mr. Joe Slovo. Good evening, Mr. Slovo, and welcome to 
Newsline. 
  [Slovo] Good evening, Astrid. 
  [Ascar] Zam Titus of the TEC delegation said today that the 
situation in the Ciskei is firmly in control. What do you 
interpret that to mean? 
  [Slovo] I interpret it to mean that in contrast to 
Bophuthatswana [Bop] in the early stages the process so far has 
been a completely peaceful one, and we can only hope that it 
remains a peaceful one. From the news reports, it seems that 
the delegation from the TEC was well received, was welcomed, and 
it bodes well for the coming few days. 
  [Ascar] What will the TEC's official response be to claims 
that the ANC [African National Congress] and its affiliates are 
attempting to purposefully destabilize the situation in 
homelands and independent states that are not ANC affiliated? 
  [Slovo] The TEC has not addressed that question yet. Let me 
give my own view, and that is that there is absolutely no 
substance to that allegation. Neither in Bophuthatswana nor in 
the Ciskei was the trigger of events based on any ANC 
incitement. Indeed, in the case of the Ciskei. We were sitting 
at the TEC yesterday afternoon and we received a request from 
Mr. Mickey Webb on behalf of Brigadier Gqozo, asking the TEC to 
take over the Ciskei. So I don't believe there is any substance 
whatsoever in that suggestion. 
  [Ascar] To whom would the TEC be accountable? 
  [Slovo] Well, the TEC would be accountable in terms of its 
powers under the act to the law, and to the people of the Ciskei 
and to the people of South Africa. 
  [Ascar] There has been reports that the TEC would be able to 
guarantee in some way or ensure that the pension funds will in 
fact be there--people do not need to fear that they will lose 
those funds after the elections. How will it ensure this? 
  [Slovo] Well, we had the same problem in Bophuthatswana. One 
of the origins of the conflict there between the civil servants 
and Mangope was precisely this point, and it spilt over into 
other areas. We have managed to get across to the civil 
servants in Bophuthatswana the perception -- which is a correct 
perception -- that their pensions are guaranteed, their jobs are 
guaranteed, and they need fear nothing from the transformation. 
This is a problem which, of course, not only affects 
Bophuthatswana and the Ciskei, but is simmering in many other 
areas of South Africa and is obviously an issue which the TEC 
will have to address in earnest. 
  [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, when you say it's simmering in many other 
areas of South Africa, could I ask you to be more specific? 
  [Slovo] Well, one has heard reports of some activities in 
Lebowa and other homelands, where the civil servants are 
beginning to fear that perhaps the existing administrations will 
either run off with their cash, with their pension funds, and 
that there will be no guarantee that they will eventually get 
what they expect to get and what they are entitled to get. And 
I believe this problem is something which will have to be 
addressed across the board. 
  [Ascar] Reports in the press today alluded to the TEC going 
into kwaZulu. Will you be referring to kwaZulu at all? 
  [Slovo] Well, the TEC has not taken a decision to go into 
kwaZulu. The TEC has taken a resolution calling upon the 
kwaZulu government to allow free and fair election in its area 
and calling upon them to allow all buildings, police stations, 
etc., to be used for purposes of election and to allow the 
Independent Electoral Commission to operate there as they are 
operating in other parts of South Africa. No decision has been 
taken by the TEC as to any specific action which will be taken. 
And of course, depending upon the response of the kwaZulu 
government, the whole question of what the TEC does about it 
will have to be addressed and will have to be addressed very, 
very urgently. Indeed, the management committee of the TEC is 
meeting tomorrow afternoon to consider the kwaZulu response to 
the Johann Kriegler delegation from the IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission] which is there today. I have not yet 
heard a report of whether he has succeeded or not, but depending 
on what the IEC says, the Transitional Executive Council and its 
management committee will have to consider what action is 
necessary in the circumstances. 
  [Ascar] All right, the TEC is considering what action will 
be 
necessary in kwaZulu. It did go into Bophuthatswana, and it has 
gone into the Ciskei. Surely there is a pattern emerging here. 
  [Slovo] Not really, because in the Ciskei we were asked to 
take over by Brig. Gqozo. In the case of Bophuthatswana, we 
know that government had collapsed, the BDF [Bophuthatswana 
Defense Force] and the police were in revolt, there was a 
situation of chaos, and Mangope, if he ever had the confidence 
of any section of the people, had lost it completely. The 
situation was completely ungovernable, and it was necessary for 
the TEC to do something about the citizens in that country 
because they are South African citizens, and we were called 
upon. It would have been utterly irresponsible for the TEC to 
fold its arms and to do nothing about it. So there is no 
pattern. The only pattern that is asserted by the TEC is a 
pattern that every South African citizen -- whether in Bop or 
whether in Ciskei or whether in kwaZulu has an absolute right to 
take part in the election without hindrance, without [word 
indistinct] by any authority. And that applies to Bop, to 
Ciskei, and must apply to kwaZulu as well. 
  [Ascar] Does the TEC, Mr. Slovo, have adequate resources to 
deal with all these situations that are arising? 
  [Slovo] Well, it hasn't got an army. It hasn't got its own 
cash to dish around, but it has got the power to call upon the 
South African Government as it did in the case of Bophuthatswana 
-- as it might have to do if things turn badly in the Ciskei -- 
for the forces under general control of the TEC and the 
government to ensure that the situation remains stable. 
  [Ascar] Does the TEC feel at all that it would have to deal 
with any resistance coming from people living in those areas? 
How would it deal with resistance coming form those people -- a 
kind of impression that: Well, these are outsiders. What would 
it do in that situation? 
  [Slovo] I don't think that we can expect much resistance in 
the Ciskei, and we know that the only resistance really that 
occurred in Bop came from the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and 
from Terreblanche's rag bag army, which tries to come in and 
take over the place. And I don't believe that there will be 
resistance in the Ciskei, at least one hopes not. 
  [Ascar] What will the TEC directive be to the two point 
administrators that have been appointed? 
  [Slovo] If we'd follow the pattern of Bophuthatswana, it 
will be that they should establish an administrative council 
representing all sectors of Ciskei society, that they must 
regulate the affairs of Ciskei during the transition, that they 
must immediately facilitate the work of the Independent 
Electoral Commission and the Independent Media Commission and 
the Independent Broadcasting Commission, and the TEC, that they 
should meet the traditional leaders in order to inform them of 
the changes that are taking place, and assure them of their 
salaries and so on, and that they must take immediate steps 
obviously to assert financial control over all government funds 
and secure all government property. But also the key question, 
which the TEC in the case of Bophuthatswana made absolutely 
clear, is that we must reiterate that all public servants -- the 
police, the army, including those dismissed, and there have been 
some in the Ciskei by the former head of the Ciskei state -- are 
guaranteed their jobs, are guaranteed their salaries, are 
guaranteed their pensions. And that is one of the key questions 
we know at the moment in the Ciskei. 
  [Ascar] You said that includes those who have been 
dismissed? 
  [Slovo] Yes, there's a running sore in the Ciskei of 
thousands of civil servants who two years ago were dismissed and 
are still out of their jobs. That's an issue which will have to 
be addressed. 
  [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, how do you think this will affect Brig. 
Gqozo's participation in the election? 
  [Slovo] Well, it's up to him. If he thinks he can get any 
votes, he should have the complete freedom to participate in the 
election, and I don't believe he has any support whatsoever in 
the area. The decision to step down yesterday was perhaps the 
wisest decision he has ever taken in his life, and of course the 
election should be free and fair, and everybody including 
Mangope, including Gqozo, have the right to take part in the 
election as long as they don't use illegal means in the process. 
  [Ascar] Have you had any reports about any looting or any 
incidents of violence in Ciskei at all? 
  [Slovo] None at all up to now, and that is the most 
gratifying thing about the turn of events there, and one can 
only hope and pray and see to it that there is no violence, and 
that there is no repeat of some of the negative events which 
occurred for example in the early stages in Bop. 
  [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, we thank you for your participation.

  [Text] Ulundi March 23 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Wednesday [23 March] 
conditionally agreed to allow the Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] to prepare for the April elections in kwaZulu. 
  Addressing IEC Chairman Justice Johann Kriegler and his 
delegation in the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly, Mr Buthelezi 
said: "You have come today with a long list of requests for full 
participation in preparation for elections and the holding of 
elections, with which we disagree". 
  He explained that the IFP had advised its members not to 
vote 
in the poll, while Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini had also 
desisted from advising his subjects to vote. "We now face the 
difficult realities that these decisions...are now going to have 
to be adjusted to meet the requirements of your commission," he 
told Judge Kriegler. 
  Mr Buthelezi said however that he was aware that the IEC 
Chairman "can bring the full might of the law to bear upon us". 
But, "nothing would suit the purposes of destabilising kwaZulu 
more than IEC action against myself, the kwaZulu government, and 
the IFP". 
  In terms of the IEC operating in the territory, the kwaZulu 
cabinet had resolved, among others, that: 

  -  government buildings could be made available for election 
purposes on a selective basis. This excluded buildings used for 
essential services; 
  -  community based institutions and tribal authority buildings 
could only be used if those communities or tribal authorities 
gave their blessing; 
  -  damage to kwaZulu government property during elections would 
be 
the responsibility of the IEC; and, 
  -  both the kwaZulu Police and the SA Police jointly man polling 
stations. 

    Mr Buthelezi was at pains to explain his difficulty in 
trying 
to reconcile his party position against the April poll and the 
IEC's interests to secure free and fair elections for those who 
wanted the vote.

  [Text] An Independent Electoral Commission delegation held 
talks in Ulundi today with King Goodwill Zwelithini, Dr. 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly on 
free political activity in the country. We are in direct 
contact with Gary Alfonso in Ulundi. 
  [Begin recording] [Alfonso] Good evening from the KwaZulu 
Legislative Assembly's building in Ulundi where Justice Johann 
Kriegler is still being bombarded with questions by the kwaZulu 
Legislative Assembly members, posing questions on the 
commission's plans for kwaZulu concerning the election and free 
political activity in the KwaZulu-Natal region. Chief Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, King Goodwill Zwelithini, and Justice 
Kriegler have already addressed the assembly. However, the 
reception of Justice Kriegler and his members, including veteran 
politician Helen Suzman, can best be described as cool. The 
judge was jeered when he referred to statements made by the 
king, who said that he could not tell his people to vote, and 
the judge was also interrupted several times by members of the 
Legislative Assembly when he attempted to explain what he and 
his council members, stationed in kwaZulu-Natal, are planning 
for the region. This footage recorded earlier this evening can 
best describe the reception of the Independent Electoral 
Commission here in Ulundi and also the addresses by the king and 
Dr. Buthelezi. 
  [Zwelithini] The kingdom of kwaZulu remains sovereign 
and now we seek our freedom and we seek social, economic, and 
political justice from within that sovereign kingdom. Even 
today, sir, as I address you and your commissioners I cannot 
advise my people that the correct thing for them to do is to 
vote in the forthcoming election. 
  [Kriegler] His Majesty expressly did not say it would 
be incorrect for his people to vote. He said he could not 
advise them to vote. Mark those words. [laughter from crowd] 
Can I ask you...can I ask you to afford me the same courtesy 
that your king and his prime minister afforded me -- to hear me 
out. Can I be afforded that courtesy, please? 
  [Buthelezi] Your interests are to secure free and fair 
elections for all those who want to vote in compliance with the 
law and my interests are to persuade the electorate not to vote 
in compliance with the decision of our party. How do we deal 
with each other, sir, across a situation in which what you do 
serves your interest and works against not what I do, but 
against what my people do, without me instructing them or 
without direction. This could mean that in terms of the act 
under which you work, what my people do and what you do may make 
me a criminal. [end recording]

  [Text] Ulundi March 23 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi warned on Wednesday [23 March] South 
Africa was heading for the worst political turmoil in its 
history and indirectly sniped at the Transitional Excutive 
Council [TEC] which he said had to be checked. "South Africa is 
entering into a period of political crisis never yet before 
experienced, and it is doing so with no effective ruling 
political party, and with Parliament being side-lined into 
irrelevancy," he said in a statement on Wednesday evening. 
  "We are perhaps rapidly approaching a situation in which the 
Machiavellian dictum that `might is right' is going to dominate 
over the causes of political fair play and justice itself. 
  "It is critically important that the social pathology in our 
abnormal society be arrested forthwith, and that the 
transitionary mechanisms and the transitionary processes 
launched by the World Trade Centre negotiations not be allowed 
to destroy this country in the name of the search for democracy 
and justice." 
  The kwaZulu chief minister earlier on Wednesday said he was 
not aware of kwaZulu police hit-squads in Natal/kwaZulu, and 
described claims to this effect as "hideous propaganda". 
Addressing a press conference in Ulundi, he said he was 
surprised at the claim in a report submitted to the Transitional 
Executive Council on Tuesday. 
  "If there have been hit squads, they have not been run by 
myself or set up at my suggestion. 
  "I would like to have evidence of that because I think it is 
just hideous propaganda that is being mounted deliberately," Mr 
Buthelezi said. 
  In his statement later on Wednesday, he said he would seek 
legal advice "on what recourse I have got through the courts to 
defend my intergrity and to clear my name". He was reacting to 
reports he had been personally implicated in violence. 
  On Tuesday the TEC disclosed that a task group investigating 
hit squads in natal had said there appeared to be evidence 
linking killer groups to Mr Buthelezi's office. 
  An interim report submitted by the task group accused staff 
in Mr Buthelezi's office of distributing automatic weapons to 
certain tribal chiefs. 
  Disclosures about the hit squad prompted the TEC management 
committee to pass a resolution mandating it to take whatever 
steps necessary to ensure free and fair elections in Natal. It 
was suggested the kwaZulu Police be brought under the 
jurisdiction of the South African Police.

  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has two 
options to ensure a free poll in Natal-KwaZulu in next month's 
election. So says ANC [African National Congress] Secretary 
General Cyril Ramaphosa. Either the TEC should take 
administrative control of KwaZulu or it should adopt a military 
choice of deploying a combined security force in the region to 
defend polling stations. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ami Nanackchand] Speaking 
at 
an election rally at Phoenix, north of Durban, Mr. Ramaphosa 
said the TEC was determined to go ahead with the elections even 
though there was resistance from some quarters to the first 
nonracial poll. He said the TEC had an obligation to protect 
the taxpayer from threats to his right to vote. 
  [Ramaphosa] And this the Transitional Executive Council must 
do. If we don't do that, then it will have failed in its task 
of making sure that elections do take place on a free and fair 
basis in Natal, and we do have the SADF [South African Defense 
Force], and the South African Police, and we have the National 
Peacekeeping Force, and those forces will just have to come to 
the defense of the people, to come to the defense of democracy, 
to come to the defense of the election process. And if 
Buthelezi does not like it, then tough luck for him. He is in 
big trouble. [end recording]

  [Text] Our representative in Ciskei reports that members of 
the security forces have decided to return to work in the 
interest of the state. The rebellion by security forces was the 
reason for Brigadier Oupa Gqozo's decision to stand down as 
leader of Ciskei yesterday. Brig. Gqozo is reportedly being 
held at a military base in Bisho. The volatile situation, which 
developed at the stadium in the capital this afternoon, was 
defused when Brig. Gqozo failed to arrive and address the crowd. 
Fires are reported to have broken out in two prisons where 
inmates are demanding a general amnesty.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with newly appointed Ciskei </F>
administrator Pieter Goosen by announcer Astrid Ascar -- live] 
  [Text] [Ascar] We have been trying to get hold of Brig. 
Gqozo on the line from his residence in Bisho to tell us the 
reasons behind his decision, but unfortunately he can't be 
reached by telephone. Meanwhile, however, the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] has appointed two joint administrators in 
Ciskei. One of these administrators is South African Ambassador 
Pieter Goosen, who joins us now on the line from Ciskei. Good 
evening Mr. Goosen, and welcome to Newsline. 
  [Goosen] Good evening. 
  [Ascar] The obvious question to start off with: Do you think 
the situation in Ciskei was such that it warranted the brigadier 
stepping down? 
  [Goosen] Brig. Gqozo must have decided that the situation 
warranted that request because this is not a takeover by the 
South African Government or the Transitional Executive Council 
of an existing administration. It is a request from Brig Gqozo 
to the South African Government and the Transitional Executive 
Council to place his administration with that of his own. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Ascar] What do you think would have happened had the 
brigadier not stepped down? 
  [Goosen] It would be speculation. What we've had in Ciskei 
was a protest by the Ciskeian civil servants on matters 
affecting their conditions of service, primarily pension, but 
also matters concerning their conditions of employment, which I 
think is not only restricted to the Ciskeian civil servants but 
could be described as of a universal interest to civil servants 
throughout South Africa. 
  [Ascar] Will you, as the TEC-appointed administrator, be 
able 
to address these concerns of civil servants? 
  [Goosen] Well, we will certainly address them. Whether or 
not we will be able to effectively solve them is another matter, 
but we will certainly try to do exactly that. I am encouraged 
by a meeting which was held this afternoon by the task force on 
the public service, consisting of Minister Sam de Beer and 
Philip Dexter, who were appointed by the TEC, who met 
representatives of Ciskei today, and my impression is very 
positive that there is a willingness on the side of the Ciskeian 
civil servants to cooperate in rendering services to the 
citizens and people of Ciskei. 
  [Ascar] Should the civil servants continue to strike, what 
action would be taken, or do you think it will affect the 
situation? 
  [Goosen] I'm not aware. We discussed....[pauses] We were 
informed that there were certain groups of civil servants who 
intended striking or had intended striking some time ago, and we 
have obviously appealed to them to give the new administration a 
chance to look into their grievances, and my distinct impression 
there also is that they will do so. 
  [Ascar] Mr. Goosen, there have been reports that the 
brigadier is indeed under house arrest. Are you able to clarify 
that situation at all? 
  [Goosen] As far as I know, he is not under house arrest. 
There is not, as far as I can gather, a feeling of kicking 
anybody out or fighting with anybody. I think we all would like 
to see a smooth transition, including dealing with the presence 
of Brig. Gqozo. 
  [Ascar] It's said that about 5,000 Ciskeians gathered at a 
stadium today and waited for Brig. Gqozo to address them. The 
brigadier did not arrive. Do you know of any reason why he did 
not arrive? 
  [Goosen] Well, the obvious reason would be that the 
brigadier 
as from yesterday has stepped down, and when the new 
administration effectively took over as from this morning, he 
must have felt that there was nothing really he could tell them 
as he had relinquished all powers. 
  [Ascar] Did the new administration, as you refer to it, 
address the 5,000 Ciskeians at the stadium? 
  [Goosen] Not the administration, because at that time we 
were 
not formally appointed, but members of the TEC did address the 
civil servants. 
  [Ascar] Would you say that the members of the TEC have been 
welcomed to Ciskei? 
  [Goosen] I think their presence and the visit here has been 
a 
great success. 
  [Ascar] And what lies ahead, what will the next step be? 
  [Goosen] The next step will be for me and my 
coadministrator, 
Reverend Finka, to get together in the morning with a member or 
more of the TEC to formulate our plan of action. Certainly high 
on the agenda would be to address these grievances from the 
civil servants as they were put to us today. 
  [Ascar] Mr. Goosen, we are hoping to have an interview with 
Rev. Finka on the line from Ciskei. We thank you for your 
participation. 
  [Goosen] Thank you.

  [Text] King William's Town March 23 SAPA -- High level 
discussions were underway on Wednesday [23 March] night over the 
Ciskei Defence Force [CDF] -- which did not send a delegate to a 
vital afternoon meeting between a Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] team and representatives of the territory's civil servants. 
  Speaking at a press conference at South Africa's Ciskei 
Embassy in King William's Town, leader of the TEC mission to the 
territory, Zam Titus, said the TEC was going to ensure that the 
CDF was "brought aboard". 
  He said the TEC team had no direct communication with the 
homeland army. It had spoken to some army representatives at 
Bisho stadium earlier on Wednesday, at the rally which was to 
have been addressed by former leader Brig Oupa Gqozo. "They 
indicated then they wanted to regroup as an army and reassess 
their situation and their position." 
  He said the "CDF situation" was being addressed at a high 
level. "But I can't really make any announcement right now. 
I'll be contacting a number of eminent leaders in South Africa 
tonight on the matter." 
  He said he did not know who was in charge of the CDF but was 
given to understand by the SA Defence Force that they knew. 
  Earlier, a highly placed source in the Ciskei government 
said 
he understood that members of the CDF had told Brig Gqozo on 
Wednesday afternoon that they wanted him back as head of state. 
Asked if this could not be merely to ensure that Brig Gqozo 
dealt with their pension problems, he said: "That's not the way 
I heard it. The military were cross with the police. It seems 
there might be some tension there."

  [Text] King William's Town March 23 SAPA -- Former Ciskei 
leader Brig Oupa Gqozo was on Wednesday [23 March] night packing 
his bags to leave his official residence, and all his ministers 
are to be given the sack. 
  Speaking at a press conference at South Africa's Ciskei 
Embassy in King William's Town on Wednesday, leader of a 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] task force Mr Zam Titus 
also said the SADF [South African Defense Force] was fully aware 
of the situation in all parts of Ciskei and ready to take action 
at a moment's notice. 
  He declined to say whether the SADF was already in the 
territory. 
  He said he understood that Brig Gqozo was still at the 
presidential palace in Bisho, but busy packing. 
  Earlier Ciskei's minister of foreign affairs, Mr Mickey 
Webb, 
said he had had a glass of grape juice with Brig Gqozo in the 
palace that afternoon. "He's packing his suitcase. His wife is 
arranging his belongings." 
  Mr Titus said Ciskei's ministers were no longer in power or 
in control. "We will be talking to them tomorrow about how they 
move out...they are out and that is the situation and that is 
quite clear." 
  The TEC team met representatives of the territory's civil 
servants on Wednesday evening and a follow-up meeting would be 
arranged within the next fortnight. 
  The task force said in a statement after the meeting that a 
process to look into the grievances of public servants had been 
established. 
  Grievances already identified would be given urgent 
attention. 
  A member of the TEC task force on the civil service, Philip 
Dexter, said Ciskei government workers should not be concerned 
about their pensions. 
  The task force was going to ensure "real transparency" on 
issues such as this. 
  He said the safety of pensions was guaranteed in the 
constitution -- the strongest guarantee one could get. 
  The new administration, headed by joint administrators Piet 
Goosen and Rev Bongani Finca, would ensure that all civil 
servants would have the right to join the union of their choice. 
  He said the TEC team would have to move into the government 
offices in Bisho as soon as possible to establish a physical 
presence there. On Thursday the team would be review the 
positions of department heads. 
  Mr Titus said he would be in charge of reviewing the 
territory's laws, in co-operation with a larger team. "For 
starters we simply have to provide that all existing laws will 
continue," he said. However, unjust laws would be changed. 
  The joint administrators of Ciskei would review Ciskei's 
representation on the TEC. 
  Steps would be taken on Thursday to ensure a proper 
inventory 
of public property was compiled. 
  People asked Mr Titus whether stability could be restored to 
Ciskei within two or three days. He was confident that the 
territory was moving towards this situation. "We already have 
the co-operation of everyone that matters. The TEC, working 
hand in hand with the South African Government, are in effective 
control of the situation."

  [Text] East London March 24 SAPA -- The South African 
Defence Force [SADF] was monitoring Ciskei but there appeared to 
be no need for it to move into the territory, an SADF spokesman 
said on Thursday [24 March]. She said SADF personnel in King 
William's Town were scheduled to meet the joint administrators 
of Ciskei later on Thursday, and would then "decide what is 
happening". 
  At the moment, however, the situation was "quite quiet". 
  It was reported that the ANC had called a rally in Bisho on 
Thursday morning. 
  A rally called on Wednesday dissolved inconclusively after 
former Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo failed to turn up, and 
representatives of the African National Congress and the 
Transitional Executive Council were prevented from addressing 
the crowd by a failure in the public address system. 
  Ciskei police, whose strike on Tuesday led to the toppling 
of 
the Gqozo government, met on Thursday afternoon at the Bisho 
Police College. 
  A warrant officer, who answered the telephone in the office 
of the commander of the college, would not say what the meeting 
was about. 
  A police captain described the situation as tense.

  [Text] Bisho March 24 SAPA -- Ciskei ambulance workers on 
Thursday [24 March] blockaded the entrance to the territory's 
Parliament with their vehicles, demanding pay parity with their 
South African counterparts. About 15 ambulances completely 
blocked the entrance. Drivers and other ambulance personnel sat 
on the curbs nearby. 
  A spokesman, Mr Frank Makalima, said the vehicles had been 
there since 7.45am. He said the protesters had sent a delegation 
to King William's Town to speak to the Transitional Executive 
Council task force, which took over administration of the 
territory earlier this week. Executive Council member Mr Zam 
Titus said on Wednesday that council team intended to move into 
the ministerial offices in the parliamentary complex on Thursday. 
  Near the ambulance drivers, a convoy of South African 
Defence 
Force troop carriers, ambulances and armoured vehicles with 
cannons were parked at the side of the road. 
  The troops appeared to be observing a rally in progress at 
the Bisho stadium about a kilometre away. There were police 
roadblocks on the N2 outside King William's Town, and on the 
road between Bisho and King William's Town.

  [Text] Mdantsane March 24 SAPA -- Rioting prisoners in 
Mdantsane jail on Thursday [24 March] surrendered their weapons 
to warders after being confronted by police from South Africa's 
Internal Stability Division [ISD]. About one hundred prisoners, 
some in warders' uniforms, escaped early on Thursday morning 
after breaking into the administration block and making holes in 
the asbestos roof. 
  They also briefly held a number of building workers hostage 
inside the prison. 
  One prisoner, convicted robber Thembelani Makeleni, was shot 
in a thigh and hand by a warder when he refused to heed warnings 
to return to his cell. Makeleni was given first aid by ISD 
medics before being taken to hospital. 
  There had been minor unrest in the prison on Wednesday. 
  On Thursday most of the staff went to Bisho to attend a 
court 
hearing on a strike in which they participated in February, 
leaving what one decribed as "very few" members at the prison. 
  One of the builders, Mr David Weimers, said he was tiling 
cells when awaiting trial prisoners "came out" and took him and 
about 15 of his fellow workers hostage. The prisoners seized 
their angle grinder and cut open all the other cells in the 
mens' section. 
  "They held us, they were standing in front of us. They 
didn't 
hit us or anything," he said. 
  The men were freed by ISD policemen who came over the roof, 
fired warning shots and then lowered a ladder so they could 
climb to safety. 
  They prisoners were "badly angry", Mr Weimers said. "They 
say 
they have been here too long. They haven't got a government. 
That's why they want to come out." 
  The prisoners broke into a storeroom to obtain warders' 
uniforms used in the escape, ransacked offices, ripped metal 
window frames out of walls and torched several cells and the 
bail and fines office. 
  After the ISD moved in, and prison staff began returning 
about 11AM, the prisoners moved to one courtyard at the back of 
the jail. 
  After negotiations they handed over their weapons to 
warders, 
watched by ISD members. A SAPA reporter counted about 250 
prisoners in the courtyard, some in convict green, others in 
civilian clothing. Among the weapons were warders' batons, 
kitchen knives, pieces of metal including tripods and a garden 
sickle. 
  According to a watching warder the prisoners had said they 
wanted to negotiate with the jail's commanding officer, Maj W 
Booi, who was apparently amenable to their request. 
  Firemen hosed down the burned-out cells.

  [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The government has reacted 
to Lebowa Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike's appeal to the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] to take over financial 
control of the homeland. Mr Ramodike claimed on Tuesday that 
matters had worsened since the Department of Regional and Land 
Affairs had assumed control of the territory. In a statement on 
Wednesday, Minister of Regional and Land Affairs Andre Fourie 
said he had the "fullest confidence" in the task team 
controlling Lebowa's finances. "This is proved by the fact that 
the task team has already evaluated the files of all Lebowa 
public servants, except some cases related to the Lebowa 
Department of Health, and has forwarded its recommendations to 
the Lebowa Public Service Commission. Of course, this makes a 
mockery of the chief minister's statement," said Mr Fourie.

  [Text] Lebowakgomo March 23 SAPA -- The South African 
Defence Force [SADF] was called in to stop striking civil 
servants from marching to the Lebowa government's offices on 
Tuesday [22 March] afternoon after two days of a police strike. 
Earlier on Tuesday, striking non-commissioned police officers 
told their superiors to leave the offices. 
  The strike concerns police promotions and salaries since the 
South African Government took financial control of the 
self-governing territory in September last year. About 30,000 
public servants are reported to have joined the strike in 
sympathy with the dissatisfied policemen. During the day, two 
Department of Agriculture officials were taken hostage. 
  After representatives of the strikers negotiated with the 
SADF, the marchers were allowed to enter the government premises. 
  The two Department of Agriculture officials were then 
released unharmed. 
  Senior officials from other departments were also evicted 
from their offices. The non-commissioned officers accused their 
seniors of continuing work while other public servants were on 
strike. 
  SA Regional and Land Affairs Minister Andre Fourie, whose 
department is controlling the homeland's financial affairs, 
appealed to the civil servants to return to work. 
  "By striking, you are actively preventing the correction of 
your and your fellow workers' salaries and its implementation," 
he said in a statement issued on wednesday. 
  He said the money for pensions was available at the banks, 
but the officials responsible for the distribution were are on 
strike. 
  He said the South African Goverenment had to exercise 
control 
over Lebowa's financial administration due to "maladministration 
and mismanagement by the Lebowa government which led to serious 
cash-flow problems". 
  "The lack of proper and responsible government in Lebowa is 
the main reason for central government's involvement in this 
self-governing territory. The situation in Lebowa is a direct 
consequence of the decisions of and lack of co-operation of 
Lebowa's Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike," Mr Fourie said. 
  Mr Ramodike on Tuesday appealed to the Transitional 
Executive 
Council to take over financial control of the homeland, charging 
that matters had worsened since the Department of Regional and 
Land Affairs had assumed control. 
  "The takeover and the subsequent reversal of promotions of 
the civil servants by Minister Andre Fourie have led to a series 
of strike and sit-ins that had the effect of disrupting services 
in the region," the chief minister said. 
  Mr Fourie said the Lebowa civil servants had agreed to 
return 
to work in February to help the financial task team to evaluate 
the personnel files of every Lebowa civil servant, so the team 
could recommendations with regard to legitimate salary increases 
and promotions that were suspended on March 31 last year and 
refer those recommendations to the Lebowa Public Service 
Commission for its final approval. 
  "I have already given the go-ahead that those legitimate 
promotions and/or salary increases, approved by the Lebowa 
public service commission, could be rectified immediately. 
  "I wish to reiterate that I have the fullest confidence in 
the financial task team in the execution of its duties," he said 
adding that the team had already evaluated the files of all 
Lebowa's public servants, "except some cases related to the 
Lebowa Department of Health", and has forwarded its 
recommendations to the Public Service Commission. 
  He said the Lebowa cabinet had taken the "dubious decision" 
to transfer R2 million [rand] from the pension fund of members 
of the Legislative Assembly of Lebowa to the Lebowa Police 
Benefit Fund. 
  "The fact remains that the Lebowa cabinet decided to take 
money from a semi-private fund, which had to be butressed by a 
financial injection of several million rands, well knowing that 
their pensions are guaranteed by the constitution for the 
transition. 
  "I wish to ask the chief minister where he would have gotten 
the money from to pay for next month's salaries -- again from 
the pension fund?" Mr Fourie asked. 
  In Tuesday's statement he referred to an earlier press 
release in which he said: "The taxpayer should know that, had 
central government not intervened, the deficit could have been 
as high as R1 billion, which we have managed to reduce to R340 
million."

  [Text] The South African Defense Force has taken control of 
certain key points in Lebowa. The officer commanding the far 
north command, Major General Faan Grobbelaar, says the step had 
followed reports that people were planning to damage key points. 
General Grobbelaar said that the sites to be guarded included 
the Lebowa police magazine, to prevent the theft of arms and 
ammunition. The government building and petrol depot would also 
be guarded. Other defense force units were being deployed at 
strategic places to ensure the maintenance of law and order. He 
said their task was being made difficult by striking Lebowa 
policemen.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- The Northwest 
Christian Democratic Party [NCDP] has officially withdrawn its 
registration for the election, the Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] said in Johannesburg on Wednesday [23 March]. 
It said the extension of the deadline for candidate lists to 
March 25 had allowed for the withdrawal of the NCDP. Printing 
of the provincial ballot paper for the North-West region had not 
yet begun, so the NCDP would be excluded from the ballot paper. 
A total of 26 parties had registered for the election, and 18 
were on the National Assembly ballot paper, the IEC said.

  [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] has issued a strong 
warning that the election campaign in the Western Cape could 
lead to an escalation of racial violence. Addressing a meeting 
in Wellington, DP candidate Hennie Bester proposed that parties 
take urgent steps to prevent the situation from getting out of 
hand. In another development the DP has dropped its plans to 
open an information office on the campus of the University of 
the Western Cape because the police are unable to give them 
protection. 
  [Begin DP Youth Wing Chairman Colin Douglas recording] We

  [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- Twenty-five per cent 
of black people believe there will be no free choice in the 
April election, according to the results of a survey by the 
Institute for Multiparty Democracy released on Wednesday [23 
March]. Political analyst Prof Lawrence Schlemmer said a quarter 
of blacks in Johannesburg might alter their votes because of 
constraints or perceived constraints. 
  Only 54 per cent of blacks were confident their votes would 
not be known by the community. The survey, conducted in 
February, asked respondents about factors constraining freedom 
of choice. 
  In kwaZulu/Natal 44 per cent believed that there was fear 
among those who did not support the area's dominant party. 
Forty-nine per cent of blacks said they lived in areas where 
only one party was dominant. 
  "These results...provide strong evidence that community 
pressures and the fear of violence and intimidation will mean 
that many voters may cast a ballot which is less than fully free 
and fair."

  [Text] Cape Town March 23 SAPA -- An international 
investigation would be set in motion if African National 
Congress [ANC] Western Cape Premier Candidate Allan Boesak 
provides evidence supporting his allegation that cabinet 
ministers stole R70 billion [rand] from the state, Law and Order 
Minister Hernus Kriel said on Wednesday night. "I undertake 
that, if the ANC [African National Congress] tells us who the 
guilty people are, an international investigation team will be 
appointed," he told a cheering crowd of about 500 people at a 
meeting at the Malibu High School in Blue Downs, a coloured 
suburb near Cape Town. 
  "I challenge him to say who it was that was supposed to have 
put that money in their pockets so that we can investigate the 
matter properly and put the guilty ones in jail. 
  "If he does not accept this challenge, then we will know 
why. 
I am not a prophet, but I predict he won't accept this 
challenge." 
  Mr Kriel was replying to recent allegations by Dr Boesak at 
a 
meeting in Moorreesburg that cabinet ministers and national 
party politicians had "stolen R70 billion of state money" over 
the last few years. He said the ANC was hell-bent on 
discrediting the leaders of the NP [National Party]. 
  Referring to a full-page advertisement in Cape newspapers -- 
placed by COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and 
saying the NP ruled through weapon smuggling and assassination 
gangs -- Mr Kriel said the advert was dishonest. 
  Nothing about the so-called third force in the SAP [South 
African Police] had yet been proven. 
  "What has happened to fairness and justice in South Africa? 
If Mr (Nelson) Mandela and Mr (Cyril) Ramaphosa find you guilty 
before it has been proven in a court of law, is this what is 
going to happen in the new South Africa? 
  "Why was the advert placed by COSATU? I say it is because 
COSATU is one of the arms of the octopus that is the ANC. The 
ANC is too scared to place such an advert under its own name 
because it knows it will run up against the Independent 
Electoral Commission which would find they have misused the 
circumstances." 
  Referring to other allegations by Dr Boesak that coloured 
children had poor examination results because of poor education 
facilities provided by the NP, Mr Kriel said the government had 
built more schools and trained more teachers than any other 
government before it. 
  "The NP has never told children to boycott their classes or 
teachers to engage in chalk-downs. We will never sell our 
children out for political gains. The future of South Africa 
lies in the hands of our children. 
  "We say the ANC must leave our children alone so that they 
can learn and become useful citizens of this country so they can 
break the circle of poverty. They can only do that if they are 
educated." 
  Chaos threatened on several occasions during question time 
when a contingent of about 70 ANC supporters were vociferously 
shouted down by the rest of the audience.

  [Text] Cape Town March 24 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] is considering a code of conduct for its members 
of Parliament that will prohibit them from any other work, 
spokesman Carl Niehaus told a Cape-based newspaper on Wednesday 
[23 March]. At present, many MPs continue to hold the commercial 
jobs they held when elected, earning additional incomes as 
businessmen, lawyers, farmers and company directors. MPs 
currently earn a state income of R179,800 [rand] a year, 
comprising a salary of R90,800, a transport allowance of R55,000 
and a daily expenses allowance of R34,000. 
  Mr Niehaus said the restriction on other work would ensure 
MPs devoted their full attention to parliamentary duties. It 
would also minimise corruption. 
  If the proposal is accepted by the ANC, there is a strong 
possibility it will be tabled in Parliament as a measure 
applying to all MPs. 
  A National Party MP who did not want to be named said there 
were two reasons why MPs should be allowed to continue other 
work: it made them financially independent and so less 
vulnerable to corruption, and it gave them valuable practical 
skills that could be directed to parliamentary work. 
  Whenever a commercial concern was discussed in Parliament, 
any MPs with links to it were obliged to declare their interests 
and recuse themselves from the discussion, he said. 
  Although MPs' incomes looked high, there were many hidden 
costs; for example, they had to maintain two households, one in 
Cape Town where Parliament sat and one in their constituency.

<F P=106> [Article by Alet van der Westhuizen: "ANC's Women's League </F>
Will Not Tolerate New Government's `Games'"] 
  [Text] Over the years, the Women's League of the ANC 
[African National Congress] has been at the forefront of the 
struggle to emancipate women. 
  But that is not where the struggle ends. On the contrary, it 
is possible that the struggle is only now beginning, in light of 
the fact that the Women's League will have to defend itself 
against "games" by a new government. 
  This is what Nosiviwe Mapisa, 38, the League's 
secretary-general, tells me. 
  Sitting behind a big desk in her office at ANC headquarters 
in Johannesburg, she is precise and deliberate about the future 
of women in South Africa, especially after the 27 April election. 
  "Our struggle for the rights and recognition of women will 
continue even after the ANC has come to power. We will not 
tolerate any unreasonableness or games from a new government." 
  "We have a future vision for all the women of South Africa, 
and for that reason we will insist that they have at least a 
30-percent representation in the future government." 
  According to Mapisa, it is also a given that the government 
of the future will have to be "gender sensitive" and that women 
must be able to make their contribution to the writing of a 
constitution. 
  The most important short-term objective that the Women's 
League now has is to draw up a manifesto of women's rights 
before the 27 April election. "The manifesto must be ready so 
that it can be put on the table when the electors meet after the 
election." 
  Mapisa says that when the ANC comes to power, that will be a 
victory for many oppressed people, but that is not where the 
ANC's work ends. "It does not matter who leads the country in 
the future; that government must also provide for the needs of 
women. 
  "The government will have to protect women through 
legislation and keep them from being vulnerable as they are now." 
  According to Mapisa, the Women's League does not foresee 
functioning as a separate organization in the future. "There is 
no longer any need for a bunch of different women's 
organizations." 
  "It is necessary that a single women's movement be formed 
that can functional nationally." 
  "If we really want to see to it that women in the future are 
recognized and noticed, programs will have to be offered on the 
national level. That is why it is important that an umbrella 
organization be formed that speaks on behalf of all women." 
  As far as development is concerned, women's education is 
high 
on the Women's League's agenda. "Rectifying action will be 
useless in the future until women are brought up to a level 
where they can meet the demands made of them." 
  "There are still many illiterate women in South Africa. It 
is 
to them that we must now reach out so that they too can learn 
skills that will allow them to contribute to the future of the 
country." 
  There is no ambiguity within the ranks of the Women's League 
on the question of common law. "We are completely opposed to 
that on principle, because in the first place it affects only 
African women, and in the second place it is only to the 
detriment of women most of the time." 
  "The Women's League even feels that it is its duty to 
educate 
those women who are still subject to common law." 
  According to Mapisa, there are still many women, especially 
in rural areas, who do not know what their rights as women are. 
"And for the rest of their lives they will be inferiors in the 
eyes of their community and husbands, because they do not know 
better." 
  "There are many women, such as we in the Women's League, who 
are more enlightened and independent. And it is our duty to 
impress upon women that they have rights, too." 
  "We do not intend by this to destroy all traditions and 
culture through our efforts. On the contrary, the doors of 
culture will in fact be opened. But the Women's League believes 
that culture and traditions that adversely affect women must be 
questioned," she says. 
  The reason for violence, Mapisa says, is that people are 
finally moving toward freedom. 
  She believes that there are forces that are opposed to the 
liberation process and that are trying to divide the people of 
this country. 
  Despite the violence, however, the League's policy is to 
reach out to all the women of South Africa. 
  "By way of the National Women's Coalition, we are reaching 
out to Inkatha women, especially those in Natal where the 
violence is the worst. 
  "We believe that the time will come when all the women of 
the 
country will be able to stand together, because they accept the 
emergence of a new South Africa. That means that it will not 
happen over night, but if we are all willing to work for it, it 
is not impossible."

<F P=106> [Interview with NP spokesman Piet Coetzer and ANC PWV </F>
Regional Secretary Paul Mashatile by announcers Reggie Morobe 
and Xoli Mazibuko on the `Newsline' program -- live] 
  [Text] [Morobe] We are now joined in the studio by an ANC 
[African National Congress] and a National Party representative. 
I must admit that we had invited the PAC [Pan Africanist 
Congress] and it acknowledged receipt of our invitation, but the 
gentleman or lady who was supposed to represent them is not here 
yet. Let me welcome the gentlemen here, Mr Mashatile and Mr 
Coetzer. Good evening and welcome to you gentlemen. 
  Perhaps it would be wise to start with you Mr Coetzer and 
look at the history. This one might say is part of the history 
that your apartheid policies created. We saw some victims 
there, we saw some hardships which people went through. How do 
you explain this today? 
  [Coetzer] Well, I don't think that one can really explain 
history, or explain it away. I think what is important is that 
we remember, first of all, that we tried to learn from history 
and the mistakes of the past and use these celebrations -- if 
you want to -- as a day of remembrance as well as a day of 
reconciliation. I personally have some vivid memories of that 
day. I was a 14-year-old boy growing up in Vanderbijlpark right 
next to Sharpeville. So it left some emotional impressions on 
me as well. I was lucky I grew up in a home where my parents 
taught me to respect people and I experienced Sharpeville in a 
certain way. And I think that we should join hands to ensure 
that our country never slips into that kind of situation again. 
  [Morobe] So you're not trying to reap, perhaps out of 
people's tragedy, you're not trying to reap a point here by 
saying that you want to convert people's tragedy into 
reconciliation, how do you put that right? 
  [Coetzer] Well, the fact of the matter is: If we're going 
to just relive the animosities of the past, then we will not 
build a new nation, and I think that is the challenge of today. 
It is to learn from the past and to construct a better future 
for all the children of South Africa. 
  [Morobe] Let's come to Mr. Mashatile, I'll give you a chance 
just now. How do you read the day? 
  [Mashatile] Firstly, let me say that we are shocked to hear 
about the death of 21 prisoners in Queenstown Prison today. I 
would like to firstly send our sympathies to the families of 
those who died, and hope that this matter will be given the 
necessary attention. Coming back to Sharpeville. Sharpeville 
to us is the day in which we remember the struggles of our 
people who faced the brutality of the National Party regime, and 
we are saying that it is a day in which we draw courage that 
our people fought relentlessly. They were facing a violent 
system of oppression, and fought all the way to ensure that 
today we are on the brink of a new South Africa. And in fact I 
want to say that today, in particular this year, we are seeing 
Sharpeville in a different context. Our theme today was Never 
Again and we are saying that in the future of this country never 
again shall people be brutally murdered as it happened in the 
past. Never again shall there be massacres of innocent people 
when they protest and have legitimate grievances, and we are 
saying that we mark this day today to close that chapter, the 
chapter of brutality and murder through state authorities. And 
we are saying that we are moving toward a new era, but we will 
always remember that we were under a system that ruled people 
through terror, through brutality and murder. 
  [Morobe] What about the fact that now Mr. Coetzer here 
speaks of reconciliation, he wants to look back on the day as a 
day of reconciliation? Do you want to read that from now on? 
After the elections, how do you look at Sharpeville, the 21st? 
  [Mashatile] Yes, we are for reconciliation. In fact, when 
our president came out of prison, the first thing that he said 
was that we should work for reconciliation. The pint I'm making 
is that we will always remember where we come from, and that 
Sharpeville has to be remembered not only as a particular day 
where we remember people who were killed -- the 69 people who 
were killed -- but as a reflection of the kind off system that 
we went through to go where we are going now, and of course 
after April the 27th we will be embarking on programs to ensure 
that we build a new country. Nation-building is our program, and 
we have a plan to ensure that when we say never again, it's not 
just a slogan but we're going to put in place mechanisms that 
are going to ensure that we don't only transform the political 
system, but the entire security systems and the police are going 
to be reformed to ensure that they are open and they are 
accountable to the communities so that the brutality of the past 
should never surface again. 
  [Morobe] On the issue of reconciliation. Let me start by 
asking Mr Coetzer: What did the National Party today actually 
do to mark this day -- your role in this day? 
  [Coetzer] I think it would be wrong for the National Party 
to try and -- especially at this point in time -- to get too 
directly involved, I think in what is a day of remembrance, I 
think in the present emotional situation would be a wrong step. 
I think the important thing for us at this stage is to look on 
the occasion of remembrance with dignity, to take a low profile, 
and to keep on reaching out the hand and say: Let's build the 
future, let's use opportunities in the future to create 
reconciliation. 
  But I accept, yes, that we are coming to the end of an 
episode in our history, and it's important that one finishes 
those chapters and get it [as heard] behind us. 
  [Morobe] When you say finish, I find it a little bit 
difficult in terms of... [pauses] we are talking here of 
massacres. We are talking here of.. [pauses] the whole attack 
was unleashed to the nation. If you say finish, are you infering 
that the people should forget what happened? 
  [Coetzer] No, no, I'm not saying that we should forget. As I 
said right from the start, we should remember, yes, we should 
remember. And we should remember in such a way that we learn 
from the mistakes of the past. All of us have made mistakes. 
This was a horrible mistake. It was a tragedy, and yes, 
together we must ensure that those sort of tragedies don't 
happen in future again. So I'm not asking that we should forget. 
What we're asking for, is let's start building a joint future, 
and get the divided past behind us. 
  [Morobe] When you're talking about building, we have seen 
people who have been maimed, we've seen what has happened. Now 
where are you going to start? Are you going to start by 
compensating the people? 
  [Coetzer] Well, let me say as far as those sorts of subjects 
are concerned, at the national negotiations various mechanisms 
had been negotiated by all the major role players involved to 
ensure that there could be some redresses on some of the issues. 
That is something that has been negotiated. Remember now, if 
we're talking about compensation for instance, we're moving 
after the 27th of April toward a Government of National Unity 
for the next five years which will create the ideal platform for 
us jointly to address programs of reconciliation. 
  [Morobe] But are you not seeing that as part of your 
responsibility now, also a gesture of showing what 
reconciliation is all about in terms of attending to...[pauses] 
some of them, I mean, since then they've never been able to lead 
a normal life. Wouldn't that be your responsibility as now the 
government? 
  [Coetzer] Well, let me say there is a month left before the 
election. I think that it would be seen as cheap politicking if 
we tried to now quickly do something, and I think that would be 
wrong to try and use an occasion like this for narrow party 
political gain. As we've seen in the insert, I think that 
Sharpeville has already taken on a wider meaning. Sharpeville 
was triggered by the PAC, but it's not the PAC only that is 
involved in the remembrance any more, and I think that that is 
the challenge -- to broaden the base of remembrance. Each of us 
will remember it in our own way. The important thing is that we 
don't misuse this at this point in time just for points scoring. 
I'm not saying that anybody is doing that at this point in 
time. But I think to ask us to do something quickly now would 
be wrong. We've negotiated proper structures that can attend to 
this, and on a joint basis. We have 5 years of a Government of 
National Unity in front of us. The challenge is to build that 
national unity. 
  [Morobe] Paul, Pieter Coetzer is talking about cheap 
politicking. Is the ANC not using this as part of the election 
campaigning -- cheap politicking on the whole issue of the 
Sharpeville massacre? 
  [Mashatile] No, no. I mean, we have always remembered 
Sharpeville. It's not the first time today. We can never have 
any cheap politicking. I am saying that Sharpeville, in many 
respects, is a sad day for us because those who were killed are 
our people, killed in the context of their fight against 
oppression. We are saying today that we have to remember where 
we come from. We must remember that today as we are looking 
forward to a new Government of National Unity and so on, we must 
remember what brought us where we are. We are here because of 
our people standing up against brutal oppression, and therefore 
there is no cheap politicking. What we need to do today is to 
begin to say: How are we going to ensure, as South Africans, 
that what happened in Sharpeville on 21 March 1960 does not 
happen again. I'm saying the ANC has a plan to ensure that that 
should never happen again. 
  [Morobe] Now the ANC has a plan. I asked Piet Coetzer 
whether they are going to compensate the people. What is the 
ANC's plan towards that? 
  [Mashatile] Well, our plan is a bigger plan because what 
happened in Sharpeville happened because of a system, a system 
that was in place that ensured that police in this country were 
trained to protect that system and if need be, protect it 
brutally and use all sorts of methods, terror and so on. Now 
our plan, firstly, is to ensure that that system must go. The 
system of apartheid must go, you must bring into place a 
democratic system, bring about a new government, accountable 
government, a government of the people that will ensure that the 
security forces are there to serve the people. Once you have 
that plan in place, then you'd make sure that you never have 
police in this country that are going to do anything that goes 
against the people, but will do everything to protect the 
people. Now the bigger challenge for this country is to remove 
that system, and on 27 April we are saying that that system will 
be gone, and we'll have a new system that will then put into 
place that big plan that will be driven by the new government, 
of course, a Government of National Unity, as Piet Coetzer has 
said, to begin to build reconciliation, nation-building, but 
more importantly, to ensure that the kind of revelations that we 
are seeing today, of supplying arms to people by top generals 
does not take place. That is the plan that we have. 
  [Mazibuko] Let me just stick with you again, Paul, here. 
Within the same context of a plan that you are mentioning, I've 
seen the (?agony) in Sharpeville today. The platform is being 
used more as a campaigning platform towards elections. How do 
you rectify the people's sorrow vis-a-vis the campaigning for 
votes? 
  [Mashatile] Well, our campaign is part of our struggle. 
Election campaign, to us, is not a child's play. It's not a 
game, it's part and parcel of the continuation of the struggle 
that has been fought over 300 years, and therefore any platform, 
whether it is a funeral, whether it is a commemoration service 
of people who have died in this struggle, must be seen as part 
of that struggle. So we are saying today, when we talk about 
elections and a new government and a need to vote, we are 
expressing the will of those people who died in the course of 
this struggle, and therefore we have a duty to express that 
those people who died in Sharpeville were not going to steal 
some sugar somewhere. Those people were expressing the fact 
that they do not accept the system of oppression that imposed 
the pass system on them. This coming election is addressing 
that system, to remove it, therefore we must speak about 
elections in days like the Sharpeville day today. 
  [Mazibuko] So you don't see any dichotomy in terms of 
politicking, or cheap politicking, as you used the term earlier? 
  [Mashatile] No, no, because people died in context of 
struggle. If we don't talk about the need to vote in meetings 
like this, we will be betraying those people who had fallen in 
the course of the struggle, seeking this new change. So it is 
in the interests of the entire oppressed people to ensure that 
any given chance, whatever advances the course of the struggle 
must be on the top of our agenda. 
  [Mazibuko] OK, let's come to you, Piet Coetzer. It comes 
back here to some people's minds -- they say all the National 
Party has done is now in the nineties, it's only taken us 34 
years back. There were peaceful protests then, people were 
trying to express a desire. It's only now that you are coming 
back to that. In real terms, there is no real reform that you 
have come up with. 
  [Coetzer] Well, let me say, first of all, in reaction to the 
question of ANC plans, and ANC plans for reconciliation. I 
think that's a dangerous approach. That's one of the mistakes 
we made in the past, and that was, that one party alone tried to 
make plans. Apartheid is already dead. We are already busy with 
reconstructing a future. A joint plan was made and negotiated 
at the constitutional negotiations. We're in the process of 
executing, jointly that plan. The pass laws were scrapped 9 
years ago. In 1985 already the pass laws were scrapped. That 
is not an issue of this campaign. What should be an issue of 
this campaign is how we are going to reconstruct South Africa, 
how we're going to build a better future. I must say I find it 
a little bit disturbing if one party is trying to say that they 
alone will make plans. That is against the whole spirit of what 
was negotiated, against the whole spirit of a Government of 
National Unity. Yes, plans must be made, yes, some plans have 
already been made, and are waiting for execution by a government 
of national unity, joint plans. That's what we need now. 
  [Mazibuko] OK, fine. Move on then to the issue of taking us 
34 years ago. There were peaceful protests. 
  [Coetzer] Yes. I say again, Sharpeville was a tragic 
mistake. It's not the only mistake that was made. There were 
other mistakes made, many mistakes made on all sides. But I 
don't think today that what South Africa needs is for 
accusations to be thrown across. That will bring us nowhere. 
What we must talk about is, what have we learned from the past, 
and... 
  [Mazibuko, interrupting] What is it that you have learned 
from the past, because here we've seen... [pauses] your reply 
has been more repression when people came up with such protests, 
it's been more repression. What's your new reply now? 
  [Coetzer] Well, what I'm saying is, one of the plans that 
have already been negotiated is a joint negotiated constitution 
that will take us to free democratic elections. One of the 
plans that has been made jointly is a Government of National 
Unity. The biggest mistake we can make -- and repeating the 
past -- is for one party on its own to try and make plans for 
everybody. The point is, we're going into an election that will 
ensure that we have a truly representative government, but a 
Government of National Unity, that should jointly build a new 
future. 
  [Mazibuko] OK, gentlemen, I want you to give me -- I'm 
moving 
towards the end of this discussion now -- I want you to give me 
the plans of what you see for the day. What do you see after 
the elections if we commemorate or we have a day of remembrance, 
what do you see as 21 March under a new dispensation, perhaps 
the government of national unity? 
  [Mashatile] Well, as I said earlier, the first step to us is 
that we must work towards elections, get everybody to vote for 
the party of their choice, and ensure that we bring into place a 
new government. That is the first step. That government will 
then begin to implement a plan to redress the imbalances of the 
past. When I talk about the plan, I'm not saying that there is 
no new constitution negotiated which is a joint plan; there's no 
Government of National Unity. All I'm saying is that when we go 
into that Government of National Unity we must have a plan as 
the ANC, and we welcome all other parties... 
  [Mazibuko, interrupting] What is the plan? 
  [Mashatile] Our plan is that we have to reform the security 
forces. We must ensure that we have a transparent and 
accountable police force; a police force that will work closely 
with the communities. We have already in fact started that 
process, we are discussing with a lot of people, including the 
South African Police, so that when the political system changes, 
we don't only change the political system, but we change all 
other institutions of the state that are going to be ensuring 
that the lives of our people change, and reforming the police is 
one of those plans. 
  [Coetzer] I would like to return to Sharpeville Day per se, 
and you ask me how do I see Sharpeville Day in the future? I 
think that one must, first of all, see it in a broader context. 
I think that we need to sit down as part of the process of 
reconstruction and reconciliation after the election, and that 
is to reevaluate all our public holidays. I can foresee a day 
in the near future, come next year, when Sharpeville Day could 
be one of the public holidays, a day of remembrance. Yes, there 
are other public holidays like the Day of the Vow which is very 
important to Afrikaner people, that needs to be addressed. I 
think that we need to address jointly that whole broader issue 
and create a way in which we remain sensitive for one another's 
past and the things that are important to one another. 
  [Mazibuko] Mr. Coetzer, I'm afraid I have to cut you there. 
We have completely run out of time. Thank you for coming 
through, Mr. Mashatile. 
  [Coetzer] Thank you very much for the opportunity.

<F P=106> [Report by E. Oelofse] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The South African Police 
Union [SAPU] has condemned the government's "apparently 
apathetic attitude" towards police personnel. In a statement on 
Wednesday, SAPU said it was a shocking fact, particularly when 
seen in the light of what was happening in self-governing areas, 
that politicians could "play with" the country's future. 
  "It is obvious the government has no idea of the perilous 
circumstances that have laid low the morale of police personnel 
to its present dangerous level," the statement said. 
  SAPU claimed to have had no reaction from government to a 
memorandum handed to the state president more than a month ago 
in which it was clearly spelt out that immediate attention had 
to be given to the "reasonable demands" of police personnel. 
The union warns that it will not for much longer be in a 
position to ward off "drastic labour unrest" in police ranks. 
  SAPU has demanded immediate salary adjustments for its 
members to bring them in line with members of the National 
Peacekeeping Force and also that immediate attention be given to 
the perilous working conditions of its members.

  [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The South African Defence 
Force [SADF] on Wednesday [23 March] afternoon declined to 
disclose the venue of its meeting with the Pan Africanist 
Congress' [PAC] military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation 
Army [APLA]. 
  The international news agency REUTERS quoted the PAC's 
Deputy 
Secretary-General Tobile Gola as saying the meeting -- due to 
last two or three days -- was being held at a conference centre 
on Pretoria's eastern outskirts. 
  However, SADF spokesman Col John Rolt said as far as the 
SADF 
was concerned the meeting was taking place at a venue in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area and was expected to 
last until Friday. "The SADF cannot unilaterally disclose the 
venue of the meeting and therefore we still stand by our earlier 
information that the meeting is held at a venue in the PWV 
area," Col Rolt said. 
  REUTERS, in its earlier report, said the SADF and APLA met 
for the first time on South African soil on Wednesday to discuss 
an end to hostilities. 
  According to the report Mr Gola said the meeting was 
expected 
to cover "everything". "It deals with all issues in relation to 
the future situation, the integration and the amnesty for APLA 
members. They will talk about the new army," he said. "There 
must be agreement on all issues. We need peace in this 
country," he added. 
  The report also quoted SADF spokesman Nick Sendall as having 
described the talks -- with about eight people on each side -- 
as "very exploratory". They were about "what we do, what they 
do, and what we both look like". They would attempt to find 
common ground for further talks, he said.

  [Text] Umtata March 23 SAPA -- Transkei military leader 
Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa on Wednesday [23 March] criticised the 
call-up of part-time SA Defence Force [SADF] members for the 
election and called for the mobilisation of all forces, 
including those of the TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, 
Ciskei] homelands, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the Nation; 
ANC military wing] and the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army 
[APLA]. 
  "It is obvious that the decision does not emanate from the 
(Transitional Executive Council) sub-council on defence, but is 
a unilateral decision by the government," he said in a statement 
in Umtata on Wednesday. Gen Holomisa said all forces, "including 
the TBVC armies, policemen, MK and APLA", should be mobilised 
for the election to maintain law and order. 
  "The mobilisation of the SADF can only be construed as an 
attempt by the white establishment to intimidate and con voters 
into voting for a particular party," he said.

  [Text] Bloemfontein March 23 SAPA -- The National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] could recruit more than 4,000 
additional troops next month, depending on the availability of 
training bases and accommodation, NPKF Commander Gen Gabriel 
Ramushwana said on Wednesday [23 March]. He said the force was 
urgently looking for new bases with adequate accommodation for 
the NPKF's second intake, due In mid-April. The additional 
troops would be deployed after the elections if necessary. 
  Three battalions of troops, numbering about 3,000, have 
completed training at the De Brug camp near Bloemfontein and are 
undergoing evaluation before deployment next month. Another 
battalion is near the end of its training at Koeberg near Cape 
Town. 
  Gen Ramushwana said he and his commanders were not too 
concerned about the looming election date or the numbers of 
troops at hand, but rather concentrated on the quality of the 
peacekeepers. 
  He stressed the NPKF was not the only security agency 
responsible for a peaceful, fair election.

people died in political violence in Natal in February. 
Although this was lower than the number recorded in the closing 
months of 1993, the HRC noted that passions were running high in 
the province and that continued attacks had created a high level 
of frustration and tension. 
  The HRC said the Midlands area had witnessed the most deaths 
with 64 killings. There were four major attacks in the area. 
At Richmond 12 people were killed in a single attack and at 
Creighton 15 African National Congress supporters were killed. 
  In the greater Durban area there were 54 deaths; in northern 
Natal five; 44 on the north coast; and 13 on the south coast.

<F P=106> [Report by Willi Germund: "Brown Network From Germany to </F>
South Africa"] 
  [Text] Johannesburg -- German and South African 
authorities are investigating the possibility of an 
international network by which German right-wing extremists are 
taken to South Africa. Yesterday morning, German Horst Klentz 
(57) was arrested, along with his accomplice, Alex Neidnelein, 
in Boskop, close to the South African capital, Pretoria. Last 
Monday, there was a gunfight with the South African police. 
  According to information obtained by DIE TAGESZEITUNG, 
Klentz, who is wanted in Namibia for murder, belongs to the same 
network of German right-wing extremists with whom the murderers 
of South African communist leader Chris Hani, who was killed in 
April 1993, were in contact. He wrote, among other things, for 
the neofascist circular DIE AUSCHWITZLUEGE [The Lie About 
Auschwitz] and used newspaper advertisements to recruit "young, 
strong people." They were later trained in shooting and bombing 
techniques on farms in South Africa. Helmut Hornung, who owns a 
farm on the Sabie River near the city of Graskop in Transvaal, 
also belongs to the Klentz group in South Africa. Hornung only 
receives visitors who have been personally recommended by 
National Democratic Party of Germany functionary Guenter Deckert 
in Weinheim and Peter Dehoust, publisher of the magazine NATION 
UND EUROPA in Coburg in Upper Franconia. According to Hornung, 
the German right-wing extremists are still in training on farms 
in South Africa. 
  NATION UND EUROPE publisher Dehous was in close contact with 
South African journalist Arthur Kemp, who procured the addresses 
of politicians who were to be murdered at the order of Hani's 
murderers. At that time, Kemp was not arrested because he helped 
the authorities with their investigations. Before that, he had 
written articles for NATION UND EUROPA and held lectures before 
right-wing extremists and the "German-South African Society" in 
Coburg. Moreover, the Klentz group in South Africa maintains 
contacts with German neo-Nazi Manfred Roeder, who was released 
from prison early in 1990. He held lectures when he visited the 
Cape in early 1993. 
  During a gunfight last Monday, Thomas Kuntz, who was wanted 
for aggravated robbery in Germany, was killed. His accomplice 
Stephan Rays was arrested. Some weeks ago, the two had been 
watched in the circle of South African right-wing extremists 
around the formerly illegal radio station, Radio Pretoria.

<F P=106> [Article by Ronelle Rademeyer: "South African Defense Force </F>
Knows Nothing of the Camp Where Rightwing Zulus Are Training"] 
  [Text] The South African Defense Force (SADF) acknowledged 
a report yesterday concerning secret training camps in the 
mountainous slopes between eastern Orange Free State and Natal, 
where right-wing Zulus are learning the more refined tricks of 
warfare. 
  However, a Defense Force spokesman said yesterday that the 
Defense Force knows nothing about the so-called Alpha base where 
Zulu recruits are being trained by right-wing instructors in 
bush warfare, field skills, weapons training, house evacuation, 
and first aid. 
  Concerning the revelation that active members of the SADF 
are 
part of the corps of instructors at the Alpha base, the 
spokesman said that it is unclear whether these members are part 
of the Permanent Force or of the Citizen Force. 
  Mr. Leonard Veenendal, former "chief of staff" of the Order 
of the Boer Nation and now a "commander" at the base, told 
RAPPORT that some of the instructors are active members of the 
Defense Force. 
  Concerning the revelation that extreme rightwingers and 
Zulus 
are active behind the scenes in putting the dissolved 32d 
Battalion back on its feet, Army spokesman Colonel John Rolt 
said that people who are no longer part of the Army can work for 
whomever they wish. 
  The "new" 32d Battalion will supposedly be part of a 
specialist unit of the Zulu and right-wing forces. 
  Military cooperation between the rightwingers and the Zulus 
is part of the preparations for fighting the "bloody struggle" 
between the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] in the 
lead-up to the 27 April election. 
  The recruits are groups of Zulus who have been designated 
for 
this training by indunas [chiefs]. The training lasts seven 
weeks. 
  The Zulus who are trained at the camps will also be 
available 
to patrol farms and "hunt and wipe out" APLA [Azania People's 
Liberation Army] terrorists that are attacking farms.

<F P=106> [Article by Peet Kruger: "Katlehong Member of Self-Defense </F>
Unit Tells How They Eradicate People: `We Kill the Enemy Like 
Chickens'"] 
  [Text] A senior member of an ANC [African National 
Congress]-affiliated self-defense unit (SDU) in Katlehong has 
admitted that he and his companions murder "enemies of the 
people" like "chickens" because they do not deserve to live if 
they do not understand the will of the people. 
  The SDU member said in an interview broadcast yesterday 
evening by the BBC's Radio 4 in London that he does not know how 
many people he has already murdered, because he does not keep 
count. 
  Yesterday, both the National Party [NP] and the ANC 
condemned 
the SDU member's shocking remarks. The NP said that it would ask 
the Law and Order Subcouncil of the Executive Transition Council 
(ETC) to look into the matter. 
  The SDU member, whose alias is Tembo, told the BBC reporter 
that he and his companions commit the murders to protect the 
community. He recognizes that murder is wrong in the eyes of 
God, but the situation around them forces them to do it. 
  They will be glad if the Peace Force stabilizes the 
situation 
and the SDU members can get "normal" work. 
  Tembo said this about his routine work as murderer: "I don't 
think about it. It doesn't bother me, because the situation is 
one where if we kill a certain person...it's like...for me it is 
like I have killed a chicken, because I see no reason for him to 
live if he does not understand what the will of the people 
is...what it is that we are fighting for." 
  When asked about the matter, NP spokesman Mr. Marthinus van 
Schalkwyk said that the NP regards this as such a serious 
indication that the ANC's SDUs are responsible for much of the 
violence that he will ask the Law and Order Subcouncil of the 
ETC to take a close look at the matter. 
  "This proves that the ANC's attempts to blame others for the 
violence is a massive disinformation campaign," he said. 
  ANC spokesman Mr. Carl Niehaus expressed his shock over the 
SDU member's remarks and said that this is unacceptable. 
  He said "by way of explanation, not justification" that the 
remarks must be viewed against the background of societal 
decline and violence in the region. 
  It is a tragic indication of the circumstances under which 
young people have grown up, where violence has become part of 
their lives. 
  "The ANC's position is clear. This (the murders) is 
unacceptable. The ANC will do everything possible to end this." 
  Mr. Niehaus said that the ANC is working on a program to 
restructure SDUs insofar as that is possible. The ANC is trying 
to draw up guidelines to ensure that SDUs do not take the 
offensive, but rather act only in self-defense. 
  It is the duty of everyone in South Africa to improve 
socio-economic conditions in places such as Tokoza and Katlehong 
in the Eastern Rand so that such people can have a meaningful 
future. The hostel problem must also be ironed out. 
  Cooperation among all political parties and the entire 
community is necessary for that, as provided for in the holistic 
plan being worked on by President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson 
Mandela, as well as the ETC. 
  "This must not be used for political propaganda. It is a 
problem that must be solved," Mr. Niehaus said.

  [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The "disappearance" of 
25kg of highly enriched uranium from South Africa's aborted 
nuclear bomb programme could not be ascribed to theft or a 
secret sale but to allowable chemical process losses, Armscor's 
[Armaments Corporation of South Africa] Executive Manager 
Tielman de Waal said on Wednesday [23 March]. 
  He told a media briefing -- a year after the announcement 
that South Africa would terminate its nuclear bomb capability 
and destroy seven bombs, six of them completed -- that 
international nuclear energy inspectors from Vienna had 
investigated the recorded 25kg deficiency and ascribed it to 
normal losses resulting from the chemical processes which the 
material had been subjected to. 
  The highly enriched uranium extracted from the devices and 
stored in South Africa could be used as medical isotopes. Worth 
about R300 million [rand], it was a valuable national asset. 
  Mr de Waal said destruction of the devices was continuing 
and 
the metal parts, which had already been sawn up, would be sawn 
into smaller parts and melted in furnaces in the next three 
months. 
  To his knowledge none of the technicians associated with the 
project had sold their skills abroad. 
  Mr de Waal said South Africa never tested any of its nuclear 
bombs, but the head of Armscor's missiles department Deon Smith 
said there was no doubt they would have worked. 
  A Japanese television researcher who attended the briefing 
is 
producing a programme drawing parallels between South Africa's 
nuclear disarmament programme and North Korea's nuclear 
programme which is seen as a threat to Japan.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  `Selective Morality' of Foreign Community -- "There has been 
a strange silence from church leaders over the execution of two 
Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement, AWB] members 
who, no matter that their organisation is neo-Fascist, were 
still human beings who did not deserve to be killed in Mmabatho 
in this horrendous fashion," declares the page-6 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 22 March. "We have heard 
no word from the dozens of foreign peace observers and monitors 
about the shocking events in Bophuthatswana or from their 
governments for that matter." THE CITIZEN believes that if 
kwaZulu Chief Minister Buthelezi "doesn't give the undertakings 
sought and is Bophuthatswana-ed, the observers and monitors will 
remain silent and the OAU and other foreign groupings will say 
`Serves him right,' no matter how many people are killed. It 
does suggest a kind of selective morality, but then we have 
always accused the foreign community of being biased -- and this 
election will not make them take a more objective view." THE 
CITIZEN also urges the African National Congress (ANC) not to 
"drive matters to extremes as happened in Bophuthatswana. The 
Zulus who support Chief Buthelezi are of warrior stock and they 
will not easily succumb -- as they have shown up till now -- to 
imported violence." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Pressure on Buthelezi To Participate in Election -- As a 
result of the ousting of Lucas Mangope in Bophuthatswana and the 
resignation of Oupa Gqozo in Ciskei, "the pressure on Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi is now bound to increase," notes a page-20 editorial 
in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 March. "The Freedom 
Alliance which may have bolstered his Ulundi laager is virtually 
defunct. There are signs of disunity in the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party], and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] is not 
going to allow kwaZulu to become a no-go area in the election." 
"The kwaZulu Chief Minister must know that his anti-election 
platform and machinations around a Zulu kingdom are profoundly 
misguided tactics. And his chances of emerging from the 
transition phase with honour are rapidly diminishing." 
Buthelezi is encouraged to "participate in the election before 
events overtake him." 
  Prisoners' Vote `Blackmail' -- A second editorial on the 
same 
page notes that the TEC has reversed its decision to exclude 
certain prisoners from voting in the forthcoming election and 
says this "has set a disturbing precedent for the manner in 
which this country will be governed." The impression left by 
the TEC is that "if people cause sufficient mayhem, those in 
authority will rather not make a stand. Apologists claim that 
the country is in transition; that this is our first 
all-inclusive election and so on, but they miss the point. 
Giving in to blackmail merely evades problems; it never settles 
them." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Homelands Falling at `Behest of the ANC' -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 March in a page-12 editorial finds 
it is "not necessarily a bad thing" that the homelands should be 
incorporated into South Africa before their scheduled demise. 
"What is a cause for concern is that it seems to be happening 
at the behest of the ANC and that the fall of each dictator 
serves to remind others where political homage is due." "It is 
hardly a coincidence that the targets are either ANC opponents 
or not slavish devotees, and that the ANC faithful such as 
Transkei military strongman Bantu Holomisa are not threatened by 
riots, pension demands or other `spontaneous' outburts of public 
concern. Worse, as the ultimate objective is Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's kwaZulu, the falling dominoes are more likely to 
harm the cause of free political activity than help it. The 
implied threat, if not to sweep away all opponents before the 
election, is `do as we say, or else'. This may increase 
obduracy in Ulundi rather than lead to negotiated or mediated 
solutions." 
  Criticism of IMF-ANC Agreement Secrecy -- A second editorial 
on the same page notes that the IMF and the ANC "may well have 
agreed" that "state deficit spending targets should not be set 
in concrete. But that felicitous development is unlikely to 
impress cautious businessmen and foreign bankers demanding more 
than just ordinary guarantees of fiscal and monetary rectitude 
of South Africa in this time of abrupt political change. 
Secrecy over the agreement between government, the ANC and the 
IMF on the IMF's special $850m [million] drought relief loan to 
this country added to the insecurities of financiers looking to 
South Africa." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Momentum Toward Dissolution of kwaZulu -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 24 March in a page-14 editorial says the 
"domino effect" started by the collapse of Lucas Mangope in 
Bophuthatswana and Oupa Gqozo in Ciskei is likely to raise the 
"political temperature" in kwaZulu/Natal as the elections draw 
nearer. "This is both good and bad news. It is good because 
the re-unification of South Africa is finally about to be 
realised." The bad news is that "the leaders of kwaZulu are not 
going to fall as easily as Bophuthatswana and now Ciskei. There 
is likely to be a fight to the finish, unless the political 
leaders put their country before political ambitions. It is not 
too late for some type of deal to be made with kwaZulu. The 
current events, which seem to have very little to do with the 
so-called ANC-SACP document plotting the overthrow of that 
territory, are gathering momentum towards the dissolution of 
kwaZulu." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  De Klerk `Unable or Unwilling' To Act on Goldstone Report -- 
Referring to the interim report of Judge Richard Goldstone on 
the involvement of senior police officers in gun running and 
"stirring up violence" in the country, Cape Town CAPE TIMES in 
English on 21 March in its page-10 editorial says this issue 
"needs to be assessed by impartial international investigators 
as a matter of urgency and placed before the courts." President 
de Klerk "cannot duck his responsibility" on this matter. "He 
has been obliged to agree to an international presence in the 
investigating team and there is scant chance of yet another 
high-level SAP [South African Police] or MI [Military 
Intelligence] cover-up." "The sad truth is that President de 
Klerk has been unable or unwilling -- and perhaps afraid -- to 
do what has been manifestly necessary to clean up a deadly 
malaise. His position is now unenviable. Of course his 
Minister of Law and Order, Mr Hernus Kriel, must go. It is 
plain that Mr Kriel does not enjoy De Klerk's confidence anyway, 
as he was among the last to be told of the Goldstone 
investigation."

  [Text] The latest reports from Burundi say fighting is 
still continuing in and around the capital, Bujumbura, and in 
the north of the country. Reports reaching Dar es Salaam from 
Kigoma say the soldiers have defied a call by President 
Ntaryamira to return to barracks, and instead they have been 
killing innocent civilians and children and burning their 
houses. The reports said the president is still in Bujumbura 
and that no government minister was killed in the Army mutiny. 
  In Dar es Salaam, Burundians living in exile in Tanzania 
have 
called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to 
Burundi to contain the situation.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 24 Mar (AFP) -- Armed clashes in recent 
days between the Burundian Army, which is dominated by the 
minority Tutsi ethnic group, and members of the majority Hutu 
group in the northern area of the capital, Bujumbura, have left 
nearly 400 dead, according to a report issued today by 
Government Spokesman Issa Ngandakumana. Heavy shooting could 
still be heard this morning from the districts of Kamenge, 
Kinama, and Cibitoke (where most of the inhabitants are Hutus), 
according to the AFP correspondent in Bujumbura. People have 
started fleeing from these areas to Zaire. The Burundian radio 
made several appeals for calm this morning. 
  The UN special representative in Burundi, Ahmedu Ould 
Abdallah, said between 60 and 80 deaths were recorded last 
night. In a statement to AFP, Ould Abdallah pointed out that 
the dead included members of both ethnic groups as well members 
of the Armed Forces which lost at least five men. He described 
as "extremely exaggerated" the reports given by Rwandan radio 
last night stating that at least 1,000 persons were killed in 
Bujumbura over the weekend. "It is in the interest of some 
politicians to make people believe that things are not going 
well. There is no general insecurity in Burundi," he added.

  [Text] In Gabon, the new cabinet has still not been formed 
11 days after Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba's reappointment by 
President Omar Bongo. Although certain reports had indicated 
that the new cabinet list would be released today, a communique 
has disclosed that the prime minister has adjourned the meeting 
he convened for this morning to confer with party leaders. The 
communique stressed that the meeting was adjourned due to the 
absence of opposition political leaders. Sources close to the 
prime minister, whom the head of state has asked to confer with 
all the political parties to establish a priority action 
program, indicate that the prime minister is continuing his 
consultations. Gabon is one of the African countries that will 
appear before the IMF next week to have their letters of intent 
examined.

  [Excerpts] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, will 
today in Abuja launch a campaign to safeguard the Lake Chad 
Basin. The launching is part of the summit of the Lake Chad 
Basin Commission, which began in the Federal Capital Territory 
yesterday. Addressing the opening session, Gen. Abacha called 
on the international community to give African nations the 
freedom to solve their internal problems. [passage omitted] 
  The Lake Chad Basin Commission, established in 1964 in 
response to the resolution of the Economic and Social Council of 
the United Nations, is a joint venture between the Governments 
of Chad, Niger, Cameroon, and Nigeria. The Chadian delegation 
to the summit is being led by President Idriss Deby while 
President Mahamane Ousmane is at the head of Niger's team. The

  [Text] President Paul Biya of Cameroon says his absence at 
the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission going on in 
Abuja is not deliberate. In a letter to the head of state, 
General Sani Abacha, he said his inability to personally attend 
was due to commitments at the national level. The letter was 
read by the leader of the Cameroonian delegation to the summit, 
Mr. Augustin Kodock, at the state banquet held in honor of the 
visiting heads of state in Abuja. State House correspondent Oje 
Ogbonaya Oje was there: 
  [Begin recording] [Oje] Mr. Augustin Kodcok, who is also the 
Cameroonian minister of state in charge of planning and regional 
development, said it was necessary to make the letter public to 
reduce speculation and mutual suspicion on why President Biya 
was not attending the summit. 
  [Kodock] My president and dear brother, you kindly invited 
me 
to participate in the summit of heads of state of the Lake Chad 
Basin Commission scheduled in Abuja on 21 to 23 March 1994. 
Commitments at the national level unfortunately made it 
difficult for me to honor your kind invitation, and believe me, 
Mr. President and dear brother, I do regret this sincerely. 
  [Oje] President Biya appealed to the head of state to extend 
the usual Nigerian hospitality to the Cameroonian delegation to 
the summit. He has reaffirmed his country's interests in the 
activities of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. 
  In a three-page address delivered at the dinner, Gen. Abacha 
described the Lake Chad Basin Commission as a forum to promote 
development in areas of agriculture and water resources among 
member countries through regional cooperation: 
  [Abacha] Our commission is one of the pioneers in this 
field. 
It is, therefore, imperative that our efforts toward integrated 
planning within the Chad Basin were in the advantage of all 
concerned. However, as members of an organization grouping 
brotherly neighbors, we cannot restrict our views only to the 
issues of economic development and the [word indistinct] of the 
environment. Our commission will also increase its role as a 
forum for the enhancement of peaceful coexistence among the 
member states. We all know that no serious economic development 
can take place without peace and security. 
  [Oje] The state banquet, also attended by Presidents Idriss 
Deby of Chad, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, and their entourage as 
well as members of the Provisional Ruling Council, ministers, 
and members of the diplomatic corps was full of glamor. 
Traditional dances from Sokoto, Borno, Kano, Plateau, and Benue 
also added color to the occasion. [end recording]

  [Text] A joint security force that would safeguard life and 
property within the Lake Chad Basin area is to be set up soon. 
The force is to have political and logistics support from 
member nations of the commission. This is contained in a 
communique issued at the end of the eighth summit of the Lake 
Chad Basin Commission this morning in the Nigerian capital, 
Abuja. The establishment of the joint security force was agreed 
upon by the summit because of its belief that programs on the 
master plan of the commission can only be achieved in a secure 
environment. 
  The commission therefore decided on a rotational leadership 
for the joint security force with defined mode of human and 
material contribution by member states. The headquarters of the 
force will be at Bagakawa, in Borno State of Nigeria. 
  The summit also adopted a master plan designed to halt 
ecological degradation of the lake and its basin. The Nigerian 
head of state, General Sani Abacha, described steps taken by the 
commission in this respect as a significant milestone in the 
search for a lasting solution to a major environmental crisis. 
He said the master plan contained viable and sustainable 
strategies for the management and development of the natural 
resources of the Lake Chad Basin. Gen. Abacha also explained 
that the water resources of the lake had reduced from 25,000 
square km in the 1960's to 20,000 square km at present. 
  The summit admitted the Central African Republic as the 
fifth 
member of the commission. The inclusion of that country was in 
respect of its strategic location as the source of major rivers 
which are flowing to the Lake Chad. 
  The next summit of the commission is to be held in Chad next 
year.

  [Excerpts] Abuja, 24 March (PANA) -- Leaders of the Lake 
Chad Basin Commission, meeting in the Nigerian capital Abuja, 
agreed Thursday [24 March] to set up a joint security force to 
ensure the safety of lives and property in the area. 
  In their communique, the heads of state of the five-nation 
commission decided at the end of their two-day summit to 
"immediately set up a joint security force with a clear mandate 
and logistic support." The leaders said that troops and 
material contribution to the force would be clearly defined. 
[passage omitted] 
  The communique was signed by Presidents Sani Abacha of 
Nigeria, Idriss Deby of Chad, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger and 
Felix Ange Patasse of the Central African Republic. Augustin 
Frederic Kodock, Cameroon's minister of state for planning and 
development, signed on behalf of Cameroonian President Paul 
Biya. They also approved a document prepared in collaboration 
with a French company, IGN-France, on the boundary demarcation 
of the basin, urging each country to "adopt it, in accordance 
with its national laws." The document is to be signed by each 
country before the commission's summit in 1995 in Ndjamena. 
  The two-day summit was held amid heightened tension between 
Nigeria and Cameroon, both members states of the commission. 
Since the beginning of February they have been embroiled in a 
renewed dispute over the oil rich Bakassi Peninsula located in 
the Gulf of Guinea, near south-eastern Nigeria. Efforts to 
convene a summit of Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha 
and Cameroonian President Paul Biya have failed. 
  The heads of state in their communique reaffirmed their 
belief "in the ability of African nations to always amicably 
settle their occasional differences either through bilateral or 
regional fora." They also stressed the need for regular dialogue 
at heads of state and government level. 
  Political observers in the Nigerian capital see both the 
signature of the communique by Cameroon and its decision to 
participate in the joint security force, to be stationed in 
Nigeria, as the beginning of a detente between the two 
neighbouring countries. 
  Conference sources told the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA) 
that the dispute between the two countries featured in the 
14-hour discussions held Wednesday through early Thursday, 
behind closed doors. The heads of state also reviewed a wide 
range of current issues including the forthcoming elections in 
South Africa, and the protracted wars in Angola, Burundi and 
Somalia. The leaders also decided to re-elect for a second 
three-year term the executive secretary of the commission, 
Abubakar Jauro of Nigeria.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 24 March (PANA) -- The dispute between 
Nigeria and Cameroon over ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula was 
high on the agenda of the ministerial meeting of the OAU central 
organ for conflict resolution which began meeting in Addis Ababa 
Thursday [24 March]. The one-day meeting will review the 
conflicts in Angola, Somalia, Liberia and Burundi where renewed 
fighting in Bujumbura, the capital has claimed many lives. 
  Cameroon, which is a member of the 11-nation OAU organ for 
conflict resolution, is being represented at the meeting by its 
foreign minister, Ferdinand Leopold Oyono, who reiterated his 
government's position that the withdrawal of Nigerian troops 
from the peninsula was a pre-requisite for negotiations. "It is 
only through such a withdrawal that Cameroon could consider the 
possibility of a summit" between the Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani 
Abacha and President Paul Biya, Oyono told the organ. He 
however stressed that Cameroon remained open to any concerted 
initiatives likely to facilitate the search for a durable and 
peaceful resolution to the conflict. 
  The Nigerian Government in a memorandum sent to the OAU 
Secretariat, called on the organ to encourage ongoing bilateral 
initiatives and implore both countries to agree on an early date 
for the summit between the leaders of the two countries and 
"seriously commit themselves to the resolution of the dispute 
through the current peace initiatives". Nigeria referred to the 
"intensive bilateral efforts" of President Eyadema of Togo and 
Husni Mubarak of Egypt to resolve the dispute, saying "both 
leaders have almost concluded arrangements for a summit of the 
leaders of Cameroon and Nigeria at a neutral venue to be agreed 
upon soon".

  [Text] Rival Somali clan leaders General Mohamed Farah 
Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed today signed an agreement to end the 
civil war in Somalia. They will also try to establish a central 
government. The two leaders signed the reconciliation agreement 
after two weeks of talks in Nairobi. UN officials said that the 
announcement of the declaration is a breakthrough in the Somali 
peace talks, which had been deadlocked for months. The Somali 
leaders said they will implement their declaration on the 
restoration of peace in Somalia. 
  [Begin recording] [Aidid, in Somali] Our country has 
suffered destruction. 
  [Unidentified translator, in English] We all know that a 
very heavy tragedy and destruction faced our country. The only 
way to finish off that problem for Somali people is to solve the 
differences which have been caused by the civil war. 
  [Ali Mahdi, in English] Presence of the Somali leaders here 
today is a clear manifestation of the closing and the (?harsh) 
of historical chapter and the opening of a new [words 
indistinct] enthusiasm and hope which will permit us to address 
seriously on the issues of our national reconciliation process.

  [Text] As you are all aware, the Federation of Labor Unions 
of Niger [USTN] has launched a 48-hour warning strike as of 
today. The USTN is demanding the cancellation of the ordinance 
banning workers' right to go on strike, and a 30 to 50 percent 
salary increase. The USTN organized a rally at the Place de la 
Concertation today before conducting a peaceful march to the 
prime minister's office, where its leaders presented workers' 
grievances to the premier's permanent undersecretary. A large 
contingent of security forces supervised the demonstration, and 
no incidents were reported. 
  The strike seems to have been widely followed in the capital 
despite various orders given to workers to report for work. In 
Zinder, the strike was widely followed but the peaceful march 
failed. According to the NIGER NEWS AGENCY [ANP], only about 50 
labor activists joined the march organized by the local USTN 
secretary general. In Diffa, the strike call was widely 
followed, the local ANP correspondent noted. The march was also 
a success and union activists chanted slogans hostile to the 
ordinance on the right to go on strike. 
  Meanwhile, several labor unions, particularly the National 
Union of Commerce Workers, have sent motions to the USTN 
expressing their unflinching support for the USTN and calling on 
their activists to respect and follow the strike call. The 
Autonomous Union of Magistrates has also expressed total moral 
support for the USTN in its demand for salary increases and for 
payment of salary arrears. It called on the USTN and the 
government to find a solution to the dispute over the law 
ratifying the bill on the right to go on strike. 
  The Executive Bureau of the Union of National Administration 
School Students, after analyzing the situation, regretted the 
showdown between the various parties and called on the 
government and the USTN to show a higher degree of patriotism by 
making every effort to give priority to dialogue in finding a 
solution to the problem. It urged members of parliament to 
fully play their role as people's representatives by helping to 
ease all tensions. The union also called on Nigerois to be 
aware of the various dangers that are looming and threatening 
our dear country. 
  The National Executive Bureau of the Union of Youth, 
Culture, 
and Sports Workers also reminded some officials that the 
exceptional period and the period of intimidation are gone for 
ever. It gave its unwavering support to the USTN's struggle and 
urgently appealed to all its activists to heed the strike call.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the government; place and date not </F>
given; read by government spokesman Moctar Diallo--recorded] 
  [Text] [Begin Diallo recording] Since it assumed office, 
the government of the Third Republic, in conformity with the 
pledge it made in its general policy statement, has favored and 
developed dialogue and consultations with all social partners in 
order to find solutions to problems that have arisen. It will 
notably be recalled that when in September 1993, in the face of 
the serious economic and financial crisis our country had been 
experiencing, it became necessary to look for cost-saving 
measures that could remedy the situation, the government did not 
at any time hesitate to undertake direct negotiations with the 
Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN] in order to agree on 
the level of sacrifices workers had to make. 
  The government has always given the same attention to any 
matter affecting the life of workers. Thus, as soon as the CFA 
franc was devalued, various administrative and fiscal measures 
were taken to minimize the effects of the decision on the living 
conditions of workers. In this regard, apart from the 
reintroduction of price controls, various tax alleviation and 
inflation reduction measures on essential commodities were taken 
to make them accessible to the general consumer and, 
particularly, to workers. 
  In the same desire to protect workers' purchasing power, 
salary deductions effected since August 1993 as part of the 
cost-saving measures, were stopped as from January. Instead, 
government workers' nominal salaries were automatically 
increased by 10 to 20 percent. Furthermore, during the ongoing 
negotiations with the labor unions, the government proposed an 
across-the-board and immediate increase of 5 to 12 percent in 
government workers' salaries. As it can be deduced, the 
cumulative salary increase that the government proposed ranges 
from 15 to 32 percent in relation to the predevaluation 
situation. 
  Furthermore, after paying one -- that of March -- out of the 
four months of salary arrears inherited from the transition 
period, the government has undertaken to reduce the arrears for 
the remaining months in the course of this year, according to 
the following timetable. Nearing the 'Id al-Kabir festival, one 
month's worth of salaries will be paid, and at the beginning of 
the school term, another month's worth will be paid. At the end 
of the year, yet another month's worth will be paid. In other 
words, within 12 months, the government will pay the equivalent 
of 16 months of salaries of which three have already been paid 
to date. 
  It should also be recalled that from May 1993 -- the 
beginning of the Third Republic -- to the end of March this 
year, salaries have been regularly paid without taking the 
months of arrears into account. Such efforts should not be 
underestimated in view of all the economic and financial 
difficulties that our country is battling with. All workers are 
aware of such difficulties today. This is why the government is 
greatly surprised to hear that despite these efforts, the USTN 
has launched a strike order to demand a salary increase 
following the devaluation, and a repeal of Ordinance 9302 of 3 
September 1993 regulating government workers' right to strike as 
well as Decree 9412 PRM of 3 February 1994. 
  The government is even more surprised because not only are 
the negotiations initiated with the unions in connection with 
the first point still under way, but especially because the 
USTN, in the very words of its secretary general, plans to refer 
the disputed law to the Supreme Court. How then does one 
explain the decision of a labor federation, which claims to 
respect republican values, to embark on a strike against a law 
it intends to contest before the highest legal body of our 
country without even waiting for a ruling on the matter. The 
essentially unionist rationale for this form of struggle, as one 
can see, is far from being established. This is why the 
government is urgently appealing to all democrats of integrity 
to foil the maneuvers of all those who, under the guise of 
(?unionism), are trying to satisfy their personal ambitions. 
  At any rate, the government wishes to point out that since 
Ordinance 9302 of 3 September 1993, which regulates strike 
rights was enacted by the National Assembly, it will be fully 
and rigorously enforced. It should be noted, in particular, 
that failure by workers to comply with orders to go back to work 
and interference with work freedom will be punished in 
accordance with the law. Salary deductions corresponding to the 
number of strike days will be effected on the salaries of 
striking workers whose names shall be drawn up by the personnel 
director and forwarded to the finance and planning minister. 
Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, 25 Mar (AFP)--The Nigerian Defense 
Headquarters asserted today that the Army has, for the past two 
days, noticed an "unusual movement" of Cameroonian troops 
stationed in Bakassi toward the Nigerian border area. "Up until 
yesterday, all we learned was that there was unusual movement of 
Cameroonian troops toward the Nigerian border," General Fred 
Chijuka, spokesman of the Defense Headquarters, told AFP. Gen. 
Chijuka, however, remarked that the movement of the Cameroonian 
troops does not necessarily mean that they have come "into 
contact" with Nigerian troops. "They are probably moving their 
troops closer to the border just in case hostilities break out," 
he said. Nigeria and Cameroon, which are claiming ownership of 
the Bakassi Peninsula, a 1,000-square-km zone rich in fish and 
oil, have stationed their troops at their borders.

the need for the two opposition political parties, which

distribution of responsibilities at the head of the institutions 
to be put in place after the 6 and 20 February legislative 
elections. In reaction to that letter, the UTD and CAR chairmen 
each accompanied by one aide met the same day at 1530 to put 
finishing touches to their discussions on the choice of a prime 
minister. The two parties agreed that the CAR should propose 
one of its activists to take up the prime ministerial post. 
Following this agreement the CAR proposed a name that was then 
accepted by the UTD. The two political parties are now waiting

  [Text] In an interview from Lusaka today, Jorge Valentim, 
head of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] negotiating team, said his movement is not making 
unjustifiable demands for government posts. He said there has 
been an equivocation about what is happening in Lusaka. 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim] There has been an equivocation. 
On 6 March 1994, the government made its third offer. The 
first offer was made on 13 December, and the second on 27 
February. On 6 March, the government offered us the Ministry of 
Health, and we accepted it. It offered us the Ministry of 
Tourism and Hotels and we accepted it. It offered us the 
Ministry of Commerce and we accepted it. It offered us the 
Ministry of Construction Materials, but we told them that there 
was no such ministry. In fact, there are no installations, 
stationery, furniture, or even mats. This is a ministry that 
was supposed to be created from the existing Ministry of Public 
Works. On 27 February, the government offered us the Ministry 
of Public Works. So, we suggested a minor change. There are no 
other ministries that UNITA is asking in addition to what the 
government has offered us. To say that we are asking for key 
ministries while we are trying to (?accommodate) the 
government's offer, is completely wrong and is contrary to the 
proposals [words indistinct] placed on the negotiating table. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So, is that the only 
outstanding 
issue to be tackled at the Lusaka talks? 
  [Valentim] That is one of the problems. We will now deal 
with the question of governors. We have (?stated) our position 
[words indistinct] for the sake of national reconciliation. We 
also want other provinces where we feel we have a role to play 
regarding [words indistinct] Huambo and Benguela. 
  [Correspondent] What was the government's response? 
  [Valentim] Well, instead of discussing the issue clearly, 
the 
government is saying that we are exaggerating and [words 
indistinct] we ought to clearly debate the issue. 
  [Correspondent] You have lost the elections [words 
indistinct] the government has offered you several ministries 
and provinces. How can you [words indistinct]? 
  [Valentim] I think that what is a stake here is not the

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces </F>
for the Liberation of Angola in Huambo on 21 March] 
  [Text] 1. In Lunda Norte, South African mercenaries have 
met the appropriate response to their adventure of 16 March 1994 
when they carried out an attack in the area between Lufige and 
Luxa Rivers, resulting in the death of 12 white South African 
mercenaries. They were led by Lieutenant (Stein Marais) and 
Noncommissioned Officer (Bronoz). Captured documents revealed 
that additional groups are being deployed in the region. 
  2. The Russian aircraft impounded in Rundu, Namibia, are 
owned by the Futungo [Angolan Government] and have nothing to do 
with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA]. The pilots are Angolan and Portuguese nationals. The 
Namibian Government is hereby challenged to take the crew to one 
of its tribunals so that the world may know the truth. 
  3. Until a general and verifiable cease-fire is declared, 
the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] will 
seize no more UNITA-occupied positions without receiving the 
appropriate response. Military adventures must come to an end. 
  [Dated] Huambo, 21 March 1994 
  [Signed] Army General Arlindo Chenda Isaac Pena Ben-Ben, 
chief of the General Staff

  [Text] Pretoria March 25 SAPA -- Three employees of the 
South African-based Executive Outcomes CC are believed to have 
been kidnapped by UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] rebels in Angola, a statement by the 
company's lawyers in Pretoria said on Friday [25 March]. 
  The statement by Wilsenach, Van Wyk, Goosen and Bekker said 
the employees were believed to have been kidnapped by UNITA on 
Wednesday while investigating "criminal activities" near the 
company's training area in Angola. "The next of kin of the 
three members have been notified. Currently a large-scale 
operation is being conducted by the company and assistance is 
being rendered by the Angolan armed forces," the statement 
added. More information would be released later. 
  Executive Outcomes provides security services in Angola.

  [Text] The Military Command of the Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] in Lunda Norte Province has urged 
the relevant South African authorities to withdraw without delay 
all South African Defense Force [SADF] soldiers whether they 
belong to the Buffalo Battalion or not. 
  The Military Command says if the South African Government 
does not immediately extradite the mercenaries fighting 
alongside People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FAPLA] units, it will be accused of destabilizing southern 
Africa because the presence of foreigners in the Lunda region is 
a violation of the spirit of Lusaka. The Military Command added 
that Pretoria, which has a diplomatic mission in Luanda, and 
South Africa, in its capacity as a sovereign state, cannot 
afford the luxury of saying it does not know what is going on. 
Members of the South African army have been deployed in Angola. 
Our source added that the South African mercenaries should 
appear before a court of law in their country for betraying 
South African laws, as stated by General Kotze. 
  The Military Command noted its disappointed, saying that 
mercenaries wounded in action in Soyo in 1993 were welcomed as 
heroes at Jan Smuts Airport. One should see concrete action 
before one can believe in Gen. Kotze. 
  Independent sources yesterday confirmed information given to 
the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel in early March by 
Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa. The information spoke of 
renewed military operations in northern Angola. The 
international media says in its offensive, Luanda earmarked more 
than 3,000 men and dozens of tanks, as well as heavy artillery 
pieces, but encountered strong UNITA resistance in 
Dange-ia-Menha near Cuanza Norte Province. The MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] suffered heavy losses. 
Katangese mercenaries were among the victims. 
  UNITA forces will not give up any area under its control 
until a general peace accord is signed in Lusaka.

  [Text] Gweru March 24 SAPA -- Seventy-three Umhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- African National Congress military 
wing; MK] and Azanian Peoples' Liberation Army [APLA] officers 
have graduated from a 12-week course for platoon commanders at 
the Zimbabwe Military Academy in Gweru. 
  The 22-week course was completed in record time so the 
officers could be in South Africa in time for the April 
elections, the ZIANA news agency reported on Thursday [24 
March]. The initial four-week phase equipped army officers with 
the knowledge and skills necessary for planning and supervising 
live firing. 
  The second phase, of five weeks, equipped them with basic 
knowledge of conventional warfare and the employment of platoon 
weapons and other support arms within a company setting. They 
were also provided with practical experience in the handling of 
a platoon in the field. 
  A third phase covered aspects of counter-insurgency and 
military law. 
  Reviewing officer Maj-Gen Philip Sibanda said Wednesday's 
graduation ceremony was a milestone in the history of the 
African sub-continent because the Zimbabwean Army had trained 
officers from the African National Congress and Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] simultaneously. 
  The officers and others who were being trained elsewhere in 
Zimbabwe would form the nucleus of South Africa's post-apartheid 
defence force. The officers are due to return to South Africa 
on Saturday.

  [Text] Harare March 25 SAPA -- The Zimbabwe Government's 
tenant resettlement programme is benefiting only government 
officials, the Forum Party of Zimbabwe [FPZ] President Enock 
Dumbutshena says. Addressing the party's first anniversary 
meeting on Thursday [25 March], Mr Dumbutshena said the 
government was derailing the noble cause of giving land to the 
homeless by allocating land instead to senior officials of the 
ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic 
Front]) Party. 
  The government last month announced it would lease 
designated 
farms to individuals. Tenants would be resettled because some 
designated farms would be put to best use if not divided into 
smallholdings. But so far senior government officials, including 
cabinet ministers, have benefited most from the programme. 
  About 110,000 rural families are still waiting to be 
resettled on five million hectares of land which the government 
has yet to acquire, the ZIANA news agency reported. 
  FPZ Vice-President Washington Sansole said the resettlement 
programme was a failure. He said the government rushed to give 
people land, but failed to provide roads, schools, clinics or 
water supplies. Mr Sansole said some government officials 
benefiting from the tenant resettlement programme had 
"absolutely no idea about farming" and treated the farms as 
holiday resorts.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Foreign Minister Pik Botha in </F>
Pretoria on 24 March by E. van Wyk] 
  [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Pik Botha on Thursday questioned the possibility of free and 
fair elections in kwaZulu in view of widespread intimidation. 
  At a news conference in Pretoria, Mr Botha warned of an 
"ominous possibility of bloodshed and conflict" in 
Natal/kwaZulu. He said he did not know to what extent kwaZulu 
chief minister and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi was prepared to allow the Independent Electoral 
Commission to do its work to ensure free and fair elections. 
  The fact was that the African National Congress [ANC] and 
the 
IFP were at war with each other, he said, suggesting that 
20-strong delegations of the ANC and the IFP under the 
chairmanship of an international figure or the chief justice 
meet to sort out their differences. "With so much intimidation 
in so many places there can hardly be a free and fair election." 
  Mr Botha warned of the danger that South Africa could be 
"forgotten" after the election and inauguration of the new 
president if the violence and intolerance did not come to an end. 
  He appealed to the ANC and the IFP to put South Africa 
first, 
rather than party political interests.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by IEC chairman Johann Kriegler </F>
in Pretoria on 24 March by Erna van Wyk] 
  [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- Electioneering in 
kwaZulu/Natal would be frustrated, with a "grave risk of 
violence", because of the kwaZulu government's attitude, the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Thursday [24 
March]. IEC chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler told a news 
conference in Pretoria the IEC was convinced that only severely 
limited balloting in kwaZulu/Natal would be possible. 
  The IEC was therefore awaiting appropriate political and 
governmental action following its failed mission on Wednesday to 
convince the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly that free 
electioneering should be allowed in the homeland. Mr Justice 
Kriegler addressed the news conference immediately after he 
briefed President F. W. de Klerk and African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela on the IEC's Ulundi mission, 
during which he was repeatedly booed by kwaZulu Legislative 
Assembly members. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler told the news conference that in order 
for the IEC to conduct free and fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal, 
the requisite degree of stability and co-operation had to be 
established in the region as a "matter of urgency". 
  Referring to kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's 
reported conditional agreement to allow the IEC to prepare for 
the election, Mr Justice Kriegler said: "The inference is 
irresistible that the (Ulundi) proceedings were orchestrated so 
as to create, on the one hand, an impression of willingness to 
comply with the law, but on the other, make it plain that there 
would in fact be widespread and sustained resistance to the 
electoral process in kwaZulu." 
  The IEC's ability to organise, administer and conduct free 
and fair elections in that province would remain "severely 
curtailed", Mr Justice Kriegler said. He did not want to 
elabrate on what the IEC viewed as appropriate political and 
governmental action. The IEC would continue with its 
preparations for the elections in the whole of the province. 
  "It (the IEC) does so under manifest constraints and has 
conveyed its concerns to each of the governmental and political 
bodies with whom the power and responsibility rest to enable the 
IEC to fulfil its mandate in kwaZulu/Natal, Mr Justice Kriegler 
said. 
  Responding to a question that the toppling of ex-president 
Lucas Mangope's Bophuthatswana government had followed an IEC 
visit to that territory, Judge Kriegler said that was a 
"malicious and uneducated" perception. The IEC had also failed 
on that mission, he said, adding there was no link between the 
visit and subsequent events in Bophuthatswana. 
  Judge Kriegler ruled out the possibility that the April 
elections could be postponed because of the Natal/kwaZulu issue. 
It was not the IEC's function to pull free and fair elections 
"out of a hat". 
  In spite of differences, political parties should realise 
that South Africans had a common destiny and the new South 
Africa should be ushered in by substabtially free and fair 
elections.
