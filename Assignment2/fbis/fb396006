<F P=106> [Interview with TEC representative Mac Maharaj, SACP </F>
National Chairman Joe Slovo, and IFP representative Dr. Ziba 
Jiyane in the Durban studio and Foreign Minister Pik Botha via 
telephone by announcer Freek Robinson on the "Agenda" program -- 
live, in English; italicized passages in Afrikaans] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Good evening. The Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] is increasingly in the news following 
its action in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, and now also in kwaZulu. 
Questions are also being asked about the council's 
accountability concerning its relations with government and how 
it makes its decisions. Well, to comment on this issue I have 
with me in the studio Mr. Mac Maharaj from the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] and also Mr. Joe Slovo of the 
SACP [South African Communist Party], whom we will be talking to 
a little later, and then Dr. Ziba Jiyane of the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] in our Durban studio. We are also linked 
by telephone with Minister Pik Botha. I would like to begin 
with Minister Pik Botha. Can you hear me Minister Botha? 
  [Botha] Yes, Freek, I hear you clearly. 
  [Robinson] Minister Botha, let us first refer to 
today's developments. What is the latest information you have 
concerning developments in Ciskei? 
  [Botha] It was a very tense day, and I was continually 
in contact with President de Klerk and President Mandela to try 
and defuse the tense situation today, where people gathered at 
the stadium. At one stage we were concerned for Brigadier 
Gqozo's life. It seems that at the end of the day things 
improved. Mr. Mandela gave me the assurance this morning that 
he would contact the ANC [African National Congress] 
official in the Ciskei to ask the people to leave the stadium 
and to conduct themselves in an orderly manner, so actually 
today was an example of what can be achieved if the ANC and the 
government work together. 
  [Robinson] We heard tonight on the news that you 
expressed concern at the general spirit of uprising and violence 
in the country. What do you mean by this? 
  [Botha] Well, everywhere...[pauses] 
Yesterday in Mabopane, the Bophuthatswana police handed out 
title deeds typed on ordinary paper, not worth anything, and the 
black civilians thought that these were their title deeds -- 
developments in Ciskei, developments in Bophuthatswana, the 
developments in kwaZulu -- and kwaZulu is not Bophuthatswana or 
Ciskei. KwaZulu is something big, monumental, and serious and 
cannot be pushed over. This is not a picnic. This is a huge, 
serious situation, and throughout the country, in all 
communities, people are buying canned foods, paraffin, candles. 
They are scared of the future. This is worrying. I must be 
honest with you. This is worrying -- the fear in the hearts of 
our people. I feel that there should be a plan of action 
through which political differences should be of lesser 
importance in South Africa's interest. If we do not grow 
economically then it does not matter which political party 
wins. 
  [Robinson] Minister Botha, would you say that this fear 
and the recent developments are spontaneous, or not? 
  [Botha] The problem is that people are faced with 
uncertainty and political parties are making statements of a 
wild and aggressive nature, and the people hearing this do not 
know, they do not know what type of decisions to make, how to 
vote. They do not know in what direction we are moving. They 
do not know where we are heading, and this is a shame, and I 
foresee problems because the outside world will come here. 
Heads of state -- after election day -- they will come here for 
the inauguration. After that they will depart and leave us 
alone, and we must decide now what is most important for us. I 
am really concerned. Tonight, I must tell you honestly, I am 
concerned about the spirit of uncertainty throughout South 
Africa. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Botha, thank you. I would like you to 
stay linked to us by telephone and for you to listen to our 
discussion so that you can also participate. Could I go to 
you, Dr. Jiyane, in Durban? 
  [Jiyane] Yes, sir. 
  [Robinson] I have spoken to Minister Botha. I don't know how 
much of that you could hear or understand, but basically he said 
that he was very worried about the general spirit of violence in 
the country. I asked him the question, whether he thought that 
it was spontaneous and with due respect to the minister we 
didn't get a very clear answer on that. What is your assessment? 
  [Jiyane] Well, my assessment is clear in that you are seeing 
here the fifth column in action, that is in communist lingo, 
that means the destabilization efforts that are orchestrated by 
the South African Communist Party-ANC alliance. 
  [Robinson] How do you know that? 
  [Jiyane] Well, we know because, here in kwaZulu, we have 
clear evidence that they are planning the same thing. 
  [Robinson] Who? 
  [Jiyane] The ANC and the South African Communist Party. 
  [Robinson] What evidence do you have? 
  [Jiyane] Well, you are going to hear from the Goldstone 
Commission. We have evidence of documents that have been 
written by the Communist Party in which they outline exactly 
what they are doing now, which of course, true to their, what 
you call, character, they will deny publicly but you will see 
they will do exactly that which is in that document because it 
is orchestrated by them. 
  [Robinson] Well, Mr. Slovo, according to Dr. Jiyane, true 
to your character you will deny that? 
  [Slovo] Well, I do deny it, not because it's true to my 
character, but because the document is a fraud. And anyone 
reading that document carefully would conclude that. I could 
give a few examples. 
  [Robinson] Please do? 
  [Slovo] For example, the document talks about 
reincorporating 
kwaZulu into South Africa. I think even a member of ours who 
has been a member for a week will know that kwaZulu is in South 
Africa. It also talks about chiefs being reactionary 
institutions which we must take under our wing, and that goes 
completely contrary to everything we've done in the negotiating 
process, to the provisions of the interim constitution. We've 
recognized chieftainship, something which both the ANC and the 
South African Communist Party have supported and will continue 
to support. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Slovo, the reason why you are here tonight, 
obviously is as the result of this document, and then also Mr. 
Maharaj, to talks to us about the powers of the TEC and how we 
can resolve these issues, to have free and fair elections which 
is after all the task of the TEC. Now can I refer you to the 
statement made tonight by the ANC, and you are in alliance with 
the ANC, and whatever you might deny about this document, the 
fact of the matter is that the tension in the country is rising 
and one might say that having mass action at this time is just 
going to add to the tension? 
  [Slovo] Well, you know this cliche of mass action and 
rolling 
mass action must be examined. Because the dividing line between 
what people call mass action, and the right of people to assert 
their democratic right to march, to have meetings, to protest, 
that line is very thin indeed, and if we take this concept of 
stopping mass action completely, what we are really saying, or 
what some people are saying, is that political activity must 
stop. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Slovo: But Mr. Radebe, who is one of the most 
prominent leaders of the ANC in Natal, himself talked about mass 
action, and he is launching a campaign? 
  [Slovo] Well, there is nothing wrong with mass action. It 
was mass action by the Bophuthatswana Defense Force and Police 
and civil servants which corrected the historic injustice of 
Bophuthatswana. It doesn't have to be accompanied by violence, 
unfortunately in that case violence asserted itself in the 
initial stages. Now it's mass action today in the Ciskei by the 
civil servants and so on, which resulted in Gqozo stepping down 
and handing over to the TEC. Now, all that is mass action. 
There is nothing wrong with mass action as long as it is not 
accompanied by violence and is in accordance with the democratic 
norms of political activity and protests. 
  [Robinson] Would you say that mass action in itself does not 
in any way add to the tension? 
  [Slovo] It can. It obviously can. It depends what kind of 
mass action. If you want to know the kind of mass action that 
adds to tension, it's when Mandela wants to go and visit the 
king and you see IFP organizing 10,000 people, many of them 
armed with bazookas and AKs, that kind of mass action obviously 
adds to the tension. 
  [Robinson] But no mass action by the ANC, that could not add 
to tension? 
  [Slovo] Well, obviously there have been occasions when, 
during the course of mass action, all kinds of events have 
occurred which one does not approve of. There is a danger, but 
it's the duty of organizations to ensure that it doesn't spill 
over into illegalities and violence. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane in Durban, do you accept the right of 
people, spontaneously or otherwise to go into the streets and to 
voice their feelings? 
  [Jiyane] Yes, as long as they know that all rights go with 
responsibility or duty. Duty to keep the peace, and not be 
violent. 
  [Slovo, interrupting] And to let the other organizations 
have 
their meetings in the stadium and not occupy them before their 
speakers arrive. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Maharaj, you want to come in? 
  [Maharaj] I was going to say, Freek, one of the critical 
problems facing the country is the question of free political 
activity. We are 35 days from the elections. The right of 
people to vote or not vote is one that is fundamental. The 
problems that are arising, are for example, we need all 
administrations, all government departments to make available 
schools, police stations etc, available to the IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission] for the conduct of the elections. We have 
a problem, the kwaZulu administration so far refused, now if Dr. 
Jiyane could make that commitment tonight, I'd be happy to hear 
it. In keeping with the agreement his leader made with Mr. 
Mandela that there will be free political activity, those who 
want to vote will be allowed to vote, those who don't want to 
vote need not vote. Will the schools, buildings, resources 
available to the kwaZulu administration be available to the IEC 
for polling purposes? 
  [Robinson] Let's hear your response to that, Dr. Jiyane. 
  [Jiyane] Well, if you listened the news tonight, you would 
have heard that our leadership in Ulundi told Judge Kriegler 
about the fact that we are open, we voted for this in 
parliament, we are open to that, but he pointed out that schools 
here that are still left, that were saved from the UDF [United 
Democratic Front] onslaught when they burned schools because 
they thought in the ashes of bourgeois society they will build a 
new society. Now those schools that are still remaining are run 
by parents here who pay their own money. The fact that the 
leadership has agreed does not mean that on the ground the 
parents will necessarily agree. 
  [Robinson] I think Dr. Jiyane, the specific question is: 
Will 
you be willing to put to the control of the IEC all of those 
officials buildings that are in kwaZulu-Natal? 
  [Jiyane] That's what our leadership said tonight. 
  [Maharaj] Can I ask you the same question connected with 
free 
political activity. The kwaZulu administration has sent out a 
circular to all civil servants to report to Ulundi on the 27th 
and 28th of April. Those are election dates. Surely, if you 
are committed to allowing people to exercise the vote, you 
should not be calling civil servants to such a meeting on those 
two days because you are directly challenging their right to 
exercise the vote on that day. Will you withdraw that circular 
and instructions? 
  [Jiyane] Well, no, that circular is neither here nor there. 
That circular I'm not aware of it, nor other authorities that I 
work with are aware of it. It's just a figment of imagination 
by some people. Why would we do such a thing? And in any case 
of course, the kwaZulu government as long as it is in authority, 
it has the right to talk to its civil servants, but I don't 
think what is being said here is true in specific terms. 
  [Robinson] Since you do not know, let's leave that for a 
moment. Mr. Botha, do you want to comment on the issue of 
mass action? 
  [Botha] Yes, I think that there are entirely wrong 
impressions created tonight. The people in Bophuthatswana and 
Ciskei and elsewhere want their pensions because they do not 
trust a new government. It is no consolation for Mr. Joe Slovo 
or Mac Maharaj. It actually means a lack of trust in them, and 
the sooner they realize that, the better. There is uncertainty 
in the minds of the people, and the whole program here tonight 
is once again occupied with touchy, petty issues while the basic 
facts of the country are that Inkatha and the ANC are engaged in 
a war against each other. These are the simple facts. And 
unless these two leaders and these two parties reach an 
agreement to create peace, South Africa on the whole will pay 
the price. 
  We have to stop now with these touchy and petty debates 
and nonsense. These are the facts of the matter. Inkatha is in 
war with the ANC. These are the facts. This is how the world 
sees it. This is what every international visitor has told me. 
Mr. Maharaj talks a lot about free political activity, but 
Holomisa says the National Party may not hold a gathering in the 
Transkei. What is he doing about that? Why does the TEC not 
step in and say give all parties in the Transkei the right to 
conduct free, active politics? They are too scared to 
intervene. 
  [Maharaj] I think Mr. Botha could control his language. I 
was speaking in a very controlled way. I'd like to remind him 
that he and I went to Bophuthatswana, and we went there 
precisely because by working together, we present the most 
credible face to control the situation. Insofar as he alleges 
the matter to the ANC, let me ask him: His deputy minister has 
condemned the IEC, the Independent Election Commission, drawing 
inferences of betraying credibility in them. This is from a 
government minister. I did not want to raise this but in the 
tone that he raises it, is he prepared to repudiate today his 
own deputy minister who has been on record, Deputy Minister Fick 
from regional government. Secondly... 
  [Robinson] Can we have a response from Mr. Botha, then I 
would like to follow up on questions also raised. 
  [Botha] I do not know what my deputy minister said. I 
am saying what the government's standpoint is. 
  [Maharaj] A deputy minister is a member of the 
government. 
  [Botha] No, it is not so. He is not a member of the 
cabinet. And I think it is unfair because he is not here with me 
to say exactly what he said. 
  [Robinson] Let us skip that matter, Mr. Botha. I just 
want to follow up on some of the things that you said. And 
Mr. Maharaj will remember that at the beginning of this program 
I referred specifically to the TEC and the powers that you do 
have. Now it seems to me with all great respect that the 
perception is rife that you are trying to assert your powers in 
Bophuthatswana, that you are doing so in Ciskei, that you are in 
the process of trying to do so in kwaZulu, but that we do not 
see the evidence that you are trying to do so in Transkei, to 
see to it that there is free and fair political activity in that 
country. 
  [Maharaj] The TEC so far has addressed the question of 
Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, kwaZulu, and the general question of 
free political activity, and that is with the participation of 
Minister Botha's government, with their agreement, and we are 
addressing that question in terms that are extremely serious. 
Now Minister Botha knows that. He knows also that the NP 
complaint on the question of Transkei is under discussion and is 
being dealt with. 
  [Robinson] By whom? 
  [Maharaj] By the TEC, as well as the IEC, as well as the 
response. In particular the Transkei has responded to the 
complaint and said one of the problems they have is security. 
This is a reason that Minister Botha will understand, that when 
the question of security arises as it has arisen in 
Bophuthatswana, it had to be dealt with. And in particular they 
are saying there are specific problems, and they accept the 
right of the NP. What we have to do is to facilitate.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] What can you do? What are you going 
to do? 
  [Maharaj] In particular, we have brought the Transkei into 
discussion with the South African Government. We have 
encouraged them to resolve this matter peacefully. In the case 
of Bophuthatswana, we sought to resolve it peacefully, and in 
the end it became necessary when the Mangope government lost 
control to remove him from power and put an administration in 
place. In the case of the Ciskei, it is Brig. Gqozo who 
appealed to the TEC, including Minister Botha, and Minister 
Botha referred it to the TEC to say he cannot control the 
situation. And then we stepped in. We never tried to step in 
as the TEC, steamrollering the process and disrespecting the 
institutions that exist. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Botha, do you want to respond? 
  [Botha] Yes. Where I agree with Mr. Maharaj: Within 
five weeks from now we must form a government of national unity 
in any case. So I do not want to be technical. I think it is 
better that the TEC and we should work very closely, and on some 
important matters there has been that cooperation which I 
appreciate, but the one point which I want to mention here: It 
is not acceptable to me that the Transkei does not allow us -- 
and it is not acceptable to me that Mr. Maharaj is putting the 
blame on security reasons, which means that we may 
not campaign in Transkei because our people are going to be 
shot. But at the same time they are demanding action in kwaZulu 
-- it is just not acceptable. 
  [Robinson] What would you suggest the TEC do 
specifically to ensure that you have the freedom that you would 
like to have? 
  [Botha] The TEC must take a decision to inform the 
Transkei government they must fall in line with the norms and 
standards and the TEC's objective aims -- namely, that all 
parties have the right to campaign there freely. 
  [Robinson] Would you say there is a difference in 
approach with the TEC regarding Transkei, vis-a-vis the others 
where they have already acted? 
  [Botha] No, because my own colleagues are sitting in 
the TEC, and I know that they are fighting for this. All that I 
am asking is: Please treat Transkei exactly the same as 
Bophuthatswana and Ciskei. 
  [Slovo] I presume Minister Botha doesn't mean by that that 
we 
should take over the Transkei with administrators. What he 
means is that we should be egalitarian in our approach. And I 
agree with that, but if I could come back to something else that 
he said about the war between the ANC and the IFP. What he has 
omitted to mention is that that war has also a third factor in 
it, and that has come out clearly in the recent Goldstone 
report, and Minister Botha didn't refer to that even though the 
evidence is prima face at the moment. We've been saying it for 
years that this violence is very much instigated by elements 
within the security forces. The train violence, the murders 
that are taking place, the instigation on the ground between the 
various forces. I'd like Minister Botha to say something about 
that because he has completely omitted that and like Minister 
Kriel, all he does is talk about the war between the ANC and the 
IFP. The people who pull the trigger on the ground might be 
black, but behind it there are many other hands coming from the 
security services. 
  [Robinson] Could you react to that? And then I 
would like to have the comments of Dr. Jiyane, as well. 
  [Botha] But of course, Mr. Mandela phoned me this 
morning and briefed me about attacks on ANC institutions and 
people who fled to the sugarcane fields. I agreed with him and 
I said to him we have to end this violence. What I want to say 
frankly here is: Those generals in the police are entitled -- 
and I hope Mr. Slovo and Mr. Maharaj will agree with me -- they 
are entitled to a public hearing of their side of the story. I 
am sorry to say tonight that I do not agree with a procedure 
where people who have been charged cannot seek legal 
representatives. Where a case is conducted behind the 
scenes.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] You are referring to Mr. 
Goldstone? 
  [Botha] Of course. I want to be very frank with you. 
Let these things be exposed -- Mr. Slovo is right there. Let 
it be opened up so that the people involved can get a fair 
chance to state his case in the presence of all South Africa's 
media, with legal representatives, because that is freedom. 
  [Robinson] I do not think anyone will argue about that 
particular point. But Mr. Botha, the point made here by Mr. 
Slovo is the specific allegations which have been made about the 
government's involvement in destabilization, and with great 
respect, I must also tell you tonight that we really tried in 
this program to get a view from the government for the last few 
days and nobody has as yet given it to us. 
  [Botha] But I will state the view. No entity in 
South Africa has worked so hard -- and I sit in the cabinet and 
I know President de Klerk, and I know what goes on -- to get 
down to the truth. I promise you this and I promise South 
Africa here tonight, to us it is a case of extreme seriousness. 
What can we gain as a party or government from such acts? We 
condemn it. And all that I am asking is: Let it be tried 
according to the legal system of a civilized country. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, could you come in specifically on the 
question of complicity by Inkatha and the kwaZulu government in 
so-called third force activities? 
  [Jiyane] Yes, this is yet another example of the hypocrisy 
and double standards that the TEC is all about. It was 
originally intended to level the playing fields, but it is 
clearly there now to serve the African National Congress and the 
government. Take for example, you know that the IFP has lost 
about 400 leaders and thousands of its members, and we don't 
know who are the hit squads that are killing these people. Not 
a word has been said about that. Now, you also know that there 
are things called defense units which the late Comrade Chris 
Hani already pointed out that many of them were being used by 
police, and those have killed hundreds of IFP people, and even 
ANC Youth League leaders have been killed by the SDU's 
[self-defense units], given guns by the police some of them. Now 
because the whole aim of this so-called transition and TEC is to 
favor the ANC against others, we are hearing all these things 
from the Goldstone Commission that is such a willing partner to 
this communist plot. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, I have listened to you, and it's 
clear 
to me, with all due respect to all of you, that you are just 
going to accuse each other here tonight. Neither of you is 
going to admit to anything. 
  [Jiyane] If it is true that there are hit squads or even 
suspected hit squads in kwaZulu, but don't you at least take it 
as fair to ask who are killing IFP leaders -- 200 of them -- if 
there aren't hit squads of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of 
the Nation; ANC military wing] and the SDU's and reports have 
revealed this, but that is beyond any examination because those 
are immune.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Dr. Jiyane, could I say, as a South 
African myself, that I'm deeply concerned about the violence, in 
particular as you will know also today that a peace monitor has 
been shot down, and that was an Inkatha man, now obviously that 
must be condemned. Could I just ask you that it is clear to me 
that I have been through many of these debates that nobody 
admits to anything, and we have just accusations. Can I ask you 
Mr. Maharaj what the TEC can do to try to bring some order now, 
free and fair elections, and whether you will be fair in your 
own conduct. 
  [Maharaj] Freek, I think that the situation in Natal is one 
of the sharpest ones in the country. The violence is escalating 
at an unacceptable rate, and there is no free political 
activity. The TEC in addressing this question has put two 
proposals that can solve the problem peacefully and in the 
interest of the people and the country. One, it has called open 
the kwaZulu government and the Natal Provincial Administration, 
and all other administrations to cooperate with the IEC, the 
TEC, and the South African Government in realizing free 
political activity. Secondly, it has called on all government 
departments, civil servants components to participate in the 
rationalization process, and to cooperate as a means to ensuring 
their own futures through the implementation of the new 
constitution. These are two issues that could bring about 
stability in the current disquiet and the current violence. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, what can you do as some high-ranking 
official of Inkatha to try to ensure peace. 
  [Jiyane] We can only repeat that which was repeated before. 
All people of South Africa have the right to have an input in an 
inclusive constitution that must bring peace in this country. 
As long as the TEC and the IEC, which are clearly favoring the 
ANC, which are very shy to investigate the ANC's intimidation of 
the National party, DP [Democratic Party], and everybody else, 
with such alarming alacrity they jump to investigate the IFP 
because that's the whole aim. As long as such double standards 
exist and persist, there is not a hope for any free and fair 
elections. 
  [Robinson] But will you yourself promote it? 
  [Jiyane] We ourselves have promoted that for all our 
history. 
We still do now, but we have said we will not be held 
responsible when the anger of the people at the grassroots level 
-- here in particular in kwaZulu/Natal -- is such that nobody 
can control it, because they know that they have a king whom 
they love, and he's been disregarded, ignored. In fact, the TEC 
thinks that it has more claim over this land than even the king. 
The anger of the people of this region will show the people who 
are so stupidly disregarding us that that which was done in the 
19th century, and the Zulus stood up, will be repeated now. You 
will never destroy the spirit of the people to resist. 
  [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Jiyane. Those are very grave 
words. Mr. Slovo, if you can do so, please refrain from 
reacting and making counter accusations. What can we do to 
resolve this situation and have peace? 
  [Slovo] The key situation at the moment is the situation in 
kwaZulu. And in order to have peace, it is necessary to ensure 
that the people of kwaZulu, who, according to the latest poll -- 
even the IFP supporters--the majority of them want to 
participate in the election, have a free and fair right to take 
part in that election. Mr. Jiyane has said that they want a 
certain kind of constitution, and people have a right to a 
certain constitution. Yes, but basically at the moment in the 
coming 35 days, the basic rights that people must have is a 
right to vote without intimidation, and without threats of 
violence. Mr. Jiyane has repeated some of the statements of his 
chief minister which amount to thinly-veiled threats of drowning 
the process in blood, and that must stop. 
  [Robinson] Our time has run out, but I must give Minister 
Botha an opportunity. Mr. Botha, it seems to me like a 
considerably bad situation. What can you and the government do 
to ensure that peace will be restored? 
  [Botha] We appeal to all parties: Please come to your 
senses. The future of this country depends on economic 
development, to give people jobs, to open new factories, to get 
the international community to come and invest. I am appealing 
to all, please settle your differences. My appeal is, people of 
South Africa -- black, white, Indian, colored -- let us join 
hands and create a new South Africa. Let us stop with these 
disturbing debates on differences and hatred and envy and 
killings, and look past the election to a new South Africa. I 
blame no one, not Inkatha, not the ANC. I am appealing to the 
ANC and Inkatha, please throw your weapons in the ocean as Mr. 
Mandela once said. Let us build this new South Africa. 
  [Robinson] Thank you Mr. Botha, our time is up. I 
thank you for the sober words. Thank you very much to all 
of you for your participation tonight. Thank you Dr. Jiyane in 
Durban. I hope from the bottom of my heart that all of you who

some contribution. Thank you very much, we'll see you next time. 
Goodbye.

  [Text] Durban March 25 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] marshalls lost control of thousands of ANC supporters soon 
after they began marching from Durban's Curries Fountain to the 
city centre on Friday [25 March] afternoon. Near-chaos reigned 
as crowds broke free from the body of the march and marshalls 
struggled to maintain order in Grey Street. 
  The crowd was estimated at more than 30,000, with hundreds 
more joining from buses and sidewalks. At least 20,000 African 
National Congress supporters had massed at Durban's Curries 
Fountain by 1 PM on Friday. South African Police [SAP] 
spokesman Col Johan Stoltz said between 700 and 800 policemen 
had been deployed in central Durban in preparation for the march. 
  South African Communist Party spokesman Dennis Nkosi told 
SAPA at Curries Fountain: "Let (Inkatha Freedom Party President 
Mangosuthu) Buthelezi know we have majority support in the 
region." He claimed IFP supporters were "war weary" and were 
"joining the democratic movement in their thousands". 
  Central Durban was virtually deserted except for police 
patrols and security forces ready to erect razor wire cordons. 
  SAP spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said townships around Durban 
were quiet except for two shooting incidents in kwaMashu.

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Pik Botha; place and date not </F>
given; later issued by the NP Federal Council on the SAPA PR 
Wire Service] 
  [Text] At a National Party [NP] press conference in 
Pretoria today Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said: 
  On 24 January the SACP [South African Communist Party] 
published a list of 34 members on the ANC [African National 
Congress] candidates list. The SACP acknowledged that its 
members made up an "embarrassing" 16 of the top 50 on the ANC 
list. 
  SACP member Jeremy Cronin challenged the NP to produce proof 
of any other members on the ANC list. Today the NP is doing 
exactly that. We attach documentary evidence drawn from public 
sources to disprove the SACP's figures. 
  We say that the SACP is systematically deceiving the South 
African people by concealing the extent of its influence in the 
ANC. An examination of the top 50 ANC candidates reveals that 
25, not 16, are current SACP members. A further 3 are former 
SACP members. 
  This means that a total of 28 out of the top 50 ANC 
candidates are current and former SACP members. It is 
absolutely extraordinary that the SACP, which as a political 
party in its own right only obtains 1 percent support in opinion 
polls, should be given the majority of places in the ANC's top 
50. This is truly a case of the ANC horse being ridden by the 
SACP jockey. Or a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
  The questions for the SACP to answer are: 
  Why, when they held their press conference, did they lie to 
the media and the public about the number of SACP members on the 
ANC list? 
  Why did the SACP conceal the identities of the following 
party members who are in the ANC top 50? (ANC list number in 
brackets): 
Steve Tshwete (12), Dullah Omar (15), Gertrude Shope (22), 
Mohammed Valli Moosa (26), Peter Mokaba (27), Aziz Pahad (37), 
Penuell Maduna (38), Alfred Nzo (44), and Gill Marcus (47). 
  The SACP on 24 January declared that Ahmed Kathrada (7) and 
Marc Maharaj (17) no longer belonged to the party. 
  Why did the SACP omit to mention that Thabo Mbeki (3) was in 
the same category? Furthermore, there is doubt over whether Mr 
Kathrada has really left the party. As recently as 7 January 
1994, he was named by fellow SACP member Essop Pahad (29) as one 
of 15 SACP members on the ANC National Executive Committee. 
  The ANC and the SACP have continued to lie about the extent 
of SACP influence in the ANC. 
  On 23 February, Thabo Mbeki was reported as telling a 
Johannesburg breakfast meeting that "no aspect of the ANC could 
be described as communist". 
  On 13 March, during the Top Level TV programme on communists 
in the ANC, Mr Joe Slovo said of SACP members "we know there are 
26 on the list". Mr Slovo should have known better. After all, 
he is the SACP chairman. His figure was 8 members less than the 
SACP itself admitted in its deception of 24 January. 
  Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the minority of non communists 
in the ANC top 50, remains silent on this highly embarrassing 
issue. Interviewed on Britain's Channel 4 TV news on 24 January, 
Mr Mandela said, "I think as far as the question of the 
Communist Party is concerned, that's a non issue as far as we 
are concerned. We are not even prepared to discuss it". 
  The ANC and the SACP have also remained silent about the non 
elected communists they intend to bring in to the administration 
after the April election. 
  THE WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN (11-17 February) named several 
members of the ANC's civil service unit pilot group expected to 
become senior Pretoria officials. These included Josiah Jele 
(also 138 on the ANC candidates list); Sindiso Mfenyane; Sipho 
Makana (former ANC chief of mission in Moscow); Anthony Mungalo 
(former ANC chief of mission in East Berlin); and Stanley 
Mabizela. All are SACP members. 
  THE SUNDAY TIMES (13 March) led its business news section 
with the headline, "ANC's Fiery Turok To Run PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Economy". Mr Turok who the ANC 
plans to be in charge of its Reconstruction and Development 
Programme in the PWV, is a former member of the SACP. 
  There can be little doubt in the minds of any objective 
person that the communists play a dominant role in the ANC, and 
would play a dominant role in ANC government posts and policy 
formulation. This is why the communists are trying to reassure 
the business community and international opinion by pretending 
that their policies are not those which brought economic and 
political disaster to every other country which practised them. 
But if the SACP try to deceive people about their real numbers 
in the ANC, they will try even harder to deceive people about 
their real policy intentions.

  [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- The Freedom Front [FF] 
said on Thursday [24 March] it was ironic that the National 
Party [NP] was suddenly concerned about the number of communists 
on the African National Congress' [ANC] election candidates list. 
  Reacting to Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha's statement 
that more than half of the people in the top 50 of the ANC's 
list were communists, the Freedom Front said it was the NP that 
had declared communism dead when it unbanned the SA [South 
African] Communist Party [SACP] in 1990. 
  Mr Botha was responding to a challenge by SACP official 
Jeremy Cronin that the NP should prove the SACP had more than 16 
members on the ANC list. 
  Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said his party 
remained 
consistent in its opposition to communism, and urged voters to 
support the FF to effectively combat the communist threat.

<F P=106> [Report by Ben MacLennan] </F>
  [Text] King William's Town March 24 SAPA -- Tensions in 
Ciskei eased on Thursday [24 March] evening when representatives 
of the territory's defence force pledged total support for the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. They also rejected claims 
that elements of the Ciskei Defence Force [CDF] wanted to 
restore former Ciskei ruler Brigadier Oupa Gqozo to power as 
"totally wrong and mischievous". 
  The TEC-appointed joint administrators of the territory 
formally assumed control of the Ciskei at 10 AM, and on Thursday 
evening President F.W. de Klerk signed a TEC-approved decree 
that gave them sweeping powers. 
  The administrators, Mr Piet Goosen and Rev Bongani Finca, 
said in a statement that all members of the former council of 
state had quit. They also called on all civil servants to act 
immediately to restore stability in the territory's 
administration. 
  Earlier there were fears of a showdown between the CDF and 
SA 
[South African] Defence Force [SADF] troops who have moved into 
the territory in armoured vehicles. It was reported that Ciskei 
troops took up defensive positions inside the territory's 
largest military base, one Ciskei battalion, when an SADF column 
approached, and that the column later withdrew. 
  SADF officer Colonel Johann Engelbrecht said on Thursday 
afternoon that the CDF was "out of control" and that its command 
structure had "gone for a total loop". He said the commander of 
the South African Force, Brigadier Toon Slabbert, had ordered 
Ciskei soldiers to hand in weapons they had seized from 
armouries. 
  "We are very gravely concerned about this.... There are 
literally hundreds of weapons floating around, shotguns, R4s, 
G3s." But in an exclusive interview with SAPA on Thursday 
night, ten representatives of the CDF ranging in rank from 
riflemen to senior officers, said they and their colleagues were 
non-partisan professionals and would serve the present 
administration and future government. 
  The represenatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
sent 
a delegation to the Ciskei's newly appointed admsinistrators on 
Thursday afternoon, and a follow-up meeting has been arranged 
for Friday morning. "We are loyal to the TEC and therefore we 
also support the newly-appointed administrators," one of the 
delegates said. 
  It was in fact the Ciskei military that had pressurised 
Brigadier Gqozo's government into joining the TEC. "I suppose 
journalists and some politicians would like to see a war. We're 
not going to give them that pleasure." At a press conference on 
Thursday evening, Mr Finca confirmed he and Mr Goosen met the 
CDF delegation. 
  "We were assured that all the rumours that suggested they 
were resisting the change taking place were false. They want 
the entire community of Ciskei to understand they are supportive 
of the transition," he said. A senior officer in the delegation 
said he had been in contact with the SADF, who had told him they 
did not want armed CDF members to continue patrolling outside 
the one battalion base. "We had no problem accepting that. The 
soldiers are back in the base, and weapons control systems are 
working." 
  He also said Brigadier Gqozo's resignation caught the entire 
CDF by surprise. Not even senior officers were given prior 
notification. There had initially been some dissatisfaction 
because it was felt that he had abdicated a responsibility for 
addressing lower ranks' pension and leave gratuity grievances. 
However, they were now satisfied that the joint administrators 
would address these issues. 
  Earlier in the day, the SADF moved into the territory in 
force to secure key points, including Military Intelligence 
headquarters and Radio Ciskei. A convoy of ratels [armored 
vehicles] also kept a watchful eye on the Bisho stadium, where 
ANC [African National Congress] regional officials addressed a 
few thousand civil servants and supporters. 
  Speaking at a press conference on Thursday evening, a member 
of the TEC task force on the civil service, Mr Zam Titus, said 
the decree signed by President de Klerk gave the administrators 
the authority to introduce laws in consultation with the 
president and the TEC. It also scrapped sections of Ciskei's 
constitution, and gave the administrators power to recover 
public property from former ministers and the head of state. 
  He said it had to be made "abundantly clear" to all civil 
servants that all existing laws, including those relating to the 
public service, were still in operation. "If they don't act in 
accordance with these laws, there are procedures which define 
what must happen with errant civil servants." 
  Mr Goosen said that as far as he was aware the territory's 
commissioner of police, Major-General Manyona Noqayi, had not 
resigned. General Noqayi, who was held hostage by striking 
police earlier this week, is to face fraud charges relating to 
faked salary payouts. 
  "The appointment of a new commissioner is one of the matters 
that will receive our attention at the soonest," Mr Goosen said. 
The administrators also had what Mr Finca described as 
"suprisingly positive" talks on Thursday afternoon with Ciskei 
ambulance service workers, who earlier blockaded the entrance to 
Ciskei's parliament and ministerial offices to demand pay parity 
with their South African counterparts. They also met 
representatives of the Ciskei police and nurses. 
  Rev Finca said a mechanism would be set up to deal with 
civil 
servants' greivances. An office for doing that would be in 
operation on Monday. Asked if the administrators would be using 
Brig Gqozo's former office, Mr Goosen replied: "Probably."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with newly appointed joint Ciskei </F>
administrator Reverend Bongani Finca by CCV TV announcer Astrid 
Ascar -- live] 
  [Text] [Ascar] Good evening, Reverend Finca. Welcome to 
Newsline. 
  [Finca] Good evening. 
  [Ascar] As I asked Mr. Goosen earlier, plans for the 
immediate future. I'd like to ask you again what do you think 
can be done to address the concerns of the civil servants as 
regards their pensions? 
  [Finca] There is a task force already set up by the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] for that purpose and I am led 
to believe that that task force is already addressing that 
issue. We, as the joint administrators, will be lending our 
support to what the task force is going to be doing. 
  [Ascar] Rev. Finca, do you think there are any similarities 
between the situation in the Ciskei and the situation in 
Bophuthatswana not too long ago? 
  [Finca] There are similarities, and there are, of course, 
differences. The similarities lie in the fact that there is a 
popular uprising of dissatisfaction with these Bantustan 
dictators. The similarities are in the fact that in Ciskei there 
has been, what I believe, an acceptance by Brigadier Gqozo that 
he can no longer control the situation and has voluntarily 
stepped down. 
  [Ascar] Do you not see a pattern emerging in the independent 
states? Is there not a fear that this could spill over to other 
areas? 
  [Finca] I don't know whose fear that is. Is that the fear of 
those who are in authority or is that the fear of the people? I 
think there is a general trend developing in our country that 
democracy has to be dictated to by the people on the ground. 
  [Ascar] Rev. Finca, would you corroborate what Mr. Goosen 
said, that the Brigadier is in fact not under house arrest? 
  [Finca] I'm not as conversant with the facts of what has 
been 
happening today as my colleague Mr. Goosen is. I've just come 
in this morning from Johannesburg. I've been attending a 
meeting there, so I believe that Mr. Goosen's version of what is 
happening will by and large be correct. He has been closer to 
the situation than myself, for today. 
  [Ascar] You have been in the Ciskei today. Are you able to 
ascertain whether there are indeed Ciskeian Defense Force 
loyalists who are still supporting the brigadier? 
  [Finca] I am not able to comment on that. I'll be going to 
Bisho for the first time tomorrow morning. I came in, as I say, 
from Johannesburg this morning, and I have never been to Bisho. 
  [Ascar] Rev. Finca, we thank you for your participation. 
Thanks for joining us. 
  [Finca] Thank you.

after threats of violence and unrest in the homeland. Brig 
Gqozo said as leader of the ADM he would now be able to devote

<F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Sommerset West March 23 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress' [ANC] large role in the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC] should be seen as hot-air and personal political 
aspirations, Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer 
said on Wednesday [23 March] night. He addressed an audience of 
150 people attending a National Party [NP] campaign meeting in 
the Sommerset West town hall and elaborated on the precise role 
of the TEC. 
  Mr Meyer also explained the events around Bophuthatswana and 
Ciskei and called for South Africans to give their moral support 
to the security forces as the only guarantee of everyone's 
safety. "It is important to note that the TEC is not the 
government, nor a government in waiting or in training," he said. 
  The government still dealt with the day to day 
administration 
of the country while the TEC had limited powers to level the 
political playing field and ensure a free and fair election in 
the transition to a democratic South Africa. 
  He asked his audience to imagine the chaos which would have 
resulted without the TEC in dealing with the crisis in 
Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu. "Without the TEC they would all 
have been the government's sole responsibility and used against 
the government by all the other parties. Now all the other 
parties are co-responsible and the government's responsibilities 
are shared by the other participating parties in preparing for 
the elections. If the ANC is seen to play too big a role then 
it is so much hot air with one eye on the elections and the 
other personal aspirations," he said. 
  Mr Meyer said it was sometimes not easy to be the government 
representative on the TEC which consisted of 19 other parties, 
each with their own approach to a problem. 
  He said the SAP [South African Police] and SADF [South 
African Defense Force] were the security forces of all South 
Africa's people. "It is the responsibility of every political 
leader to give their full support to the security forces. Our 
safety depends on it." 
  Regarding the latest Goldstone Commission report alleging 
third force activities backed by high-ranking police officers, 
he said the just thing to do was to ensure there was a quick, 
efficient and impartial investigation to establish whether there 
were grounds for further investigation and action. 
  The government would in consultation with the TEC and 
possibly with international assistance see to it that such an 
investigation was constituted as swiftly as possible. "But 
irrespective of this, we have a responsibility to stand by the 
police and the commissioner (of police) and to support them that 
they may protect us." 
  Reviewing the situation in Bophuthatswana, he said the 
events 
there had been tragic and unnecessary. "He (former Bop 
[Bophuthatswana] President Lucas Mangope) was swallowed by 
history because he would not make the correct decisions in time 
to be part of the future." 
  State President F W de Klerk had invited Mr Mangope and his 
cabinet for discussions more than a year ago to join him in 
planning for the future in order to ensure that Bophuthatswana 
would become part of South Africa and participate in elections. 
"Mr Mangope's answer then and consequently every time 
afterwards, remained the same: `I will die for independence'". 
"Politically, unfortunately he did die," Mr Meyer said. 
  There was no way Bophuthatswana could remain an independent 
state. In the 1993/94 budget year 71 per cent of its income was 
derived from South Africa. "Democracy arrived in South Africa 
and democracy often plays hard with those that stand in its way." 
  On the Zulu quest for an independent sovereign monarchy, Mr 
Meyer said it could be accommodated within the new amended 
constitutional structure but not in terms of a sovereign king 
ruling without elected representation of the people. 
  On the issue of international mediation, he said he would be 
meeting representatives of the ANC and IFP on Thursday morning 
and as yet had no confirmation as to whom they would be 
proposing. "What is important, however, is that whatever they 
wish we will consider in terms of such a mediation panel." 
  The government would look at its scope and final intentions 
but could not consider it unless it was certain that mediation 
could make a contribution to resolving the issues. 
  The two parties have decided on international mediation ?o 
determine the federalist content of the transitional 
constitution.

  [Text] Lebowakgomo March 24 SAPA -- The atmosphere in 
Lebowa was tense after the South African Defence Force [SADF] 
took control of key points in the homeland on Thursday [24 
March] to prevent looting and damage to property while thousands 
of civil servants continued their strike action. Among the key 
points being guarded were government buildings and fuel depots, 
as well as the police armoury. 
  Striking public servants, including nurses and members of 
the 
Lebowa police, gathered and toyi-toyied [protest dancing] 
outside the main entrance to the government offices at 
Lebowakgomo. 
  Lebowa Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike called on the South 
African Government to report personally to striking workers on 
why promotions and salary increases had been withheld, 
apparently a key factor behind the strike. 
  The South African Government took over the financial 
administration of Lebowa in September 1993, following charges of 
maladministration and irregular promotions which led to serious 
cash-flow problems in the homeland. 
  About 30,000 public servants are reported to be 
participating 
in the strike. 
  Mr Ramodike said that since the SA Government had taken over 
the running of Lebowa's financial affairs, labour unrest had 
increased. 
  He called the take-over a political ploy with a view to the 
election and earlier this week suggested the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] assume responsibility for Lebowa's 
finances. 
  Late on Thursday, thousands of striking public servants 
waited at the homeland government buildings for members of the 
Transitional Executive Council to address them. 
  A spokesperson for the public servants said the TEC was 
expected to arrive at Lebowakgomo on Thursday afternoon to 
discuss their problems. He said a full report regarding the 
issue of their promotions would be given to given to the TEC. 
  The South African minister of regional and land affairs, Mr 
Andre Fourie, on Thursday denied allegations by Mr Ramodike that 
matters had worsened in Lebowa under his department's control. 
  Mr Fourie said in a statement "maladministration and 
mismanagement were the trademarks of Mr Ramodike's 
administration and as chief executive, he is responsible for the 
lack of proper and responsible government in Lebowa". 
  Regarding Mr Ramodike's statement that "the takeover and the 
subsequent reversal of promotions of the civil servants by 
Minister Andre Fourie had led to a series of strike and sit-ins 
that had the effect of disrupting services in the region", Mr 
Fourie said the civil servants themselves were to blame for 
salaries not yet being ready. 
  "Due to the fact that civil servants have been striking most 
of the time and wasting the South African taxpayer's money, only 
to return to work at the time when salaries are being processed, 
I have given instructions that their salaries may only be 
processed after the claims of suppliers and contractors had been 
attended to," Mr Fourie said. 
  He also claimed the civil service strike was directly 
responsible for pensions not being paid in Lebowa. He said the 
pension money was available at the banks, "but the officials 
responsible for the payment of pensions are on strike".

  [Text] Colesberg, Northern Cape March 24 SAPA -- A decision 
would be taken on Friday [25 March] on the future of the SA 
[South African] Police [SAP] generals implicated by the 
Goldstone Commission in violence, Law and Order Minister Hernus 
Kriel said on Thursday night. 
  Speaking after a National Party [NP] meeting in Lowryville, 
in the Northern Cape town of Colesberg, he said SAP Commissioner 
Johan van der Merwe was negotiating with the generals over their 
suspension from the force and was keeping the minister informed. 
  "I will evaluate the decision and if I don't agree with it I 
will bring into play certain powers available to me," he said, 
without giving any details. 
  Mr Kriel said he had not met President F.W. de Klerk on 
Thursday, as had been reported on national radio. He said he 
personally had no reason to resign as he was in no way involved 
in the violence. "I am a man of peace." 
  He told the meeting of about 250 enthusiastic supporters 
that 
the NP wanted to help the poor and to assist people in acquiring 
houses. His speech was characterised by attacks on the African 
National Congress, which he said was a violent party that forced 
children and teachers out of schools with boycotts and strikes. 
  He told people to stand up against intimidation and not to 
participate in violence, and to vote against what he called the 
ANC's "impractical plans for the future". 
  Mr Kriel was asked by an ANC supporter why his party was now 
wooing the coloured vote when it had removed coloureds from the 
voters role shortly after it came to power in 1948. 
  He responded quickly by admitting that the NP had made a 
mistake which had now been rectified.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 25 SAPA -- The policeman named as 
the mysterious Q who made disclosures about alleged third force 
violence -- Captain Kobus "Chappies" Klopper -- has apparently 
fled the country, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
radio news reports. Two Johannesburg-based newspapers reported 
on Friday [25 March] morning the former Vlakplaas operative had 
gone into hiding, apparently in Europe. 
  One newspaper reported he left on a flight from Cape Town on 
Tuesday evening to Frankfurt, and then onto another destination 
in Europe. The report could not be confirmed. 
  News of his departure from the country comes amid a report 
in 
another newspaper that the Goldstone Commission has discovered a 
Swiss bank account used to fund third force activities. The 
newspaper said information about the fund was one of the cards 
Mr Justice Richard Goldstone was holding back as he prepared for 
an all out confrontation with Police Commissioner General Johan 
van der Merwe. 
  It said Judge Goldstone was also in possession of a 
video-tape incriminating several of the people named in its 
latest report.

<F P=106> [Report by Jackie Cameron] </F>
  [Text] Police morale has hit an all-time low and many may 
strike or resign -- unless their salaries are brought in line 
with those of National Peace Keeping Force [NPKF] members. 
  This shock warning was issued to the Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] by the officially recognised South African Police 
Union (SAPU) in a document which paints a picture of a police 
force brewing with rage and turmoil. SAPU national secretary 
Captain Peter-Don Brandt said in an exclusive interview 
yesterday: "The threat of a police strike before the election 
in April is not to be taken lightly. Union and non-union 
members are not asking for an increase in salary, they are 
demanding it." 
  Strong fears were also expressed that if the demands were 
not 
met, many policemen would join private armies. The police 
medical aid, Polmed, has also cut its medical aid contributions 
for psychological treatment from about R160 [rand] per visit to 
just R30. 
  There is a massive discrepancy between the salaries of NPKF 
and SAP [South African Police] members: NPKF constables and 
lance-sergeants earn double the salary of their SAP 
counterparts. NPKF members ranking from sergeant up to captain 
earn about one-third more than SAP members of the same rank. 
  In addition, the daily allowance for NPKF members is almost 
triple that given to SAP members, R61.50 per day compared to 
R22.50. 
  "Policemen on the ground believe that a strike will work for 
them because it worked for the NPKF," Capt Brandt said. He said 
that he had to daily "pacify" those who believed a strike was 
the only option. Trainee NPKF members were granted salary 
increases earlier this month after they went on strike when they 
discovered they were being paid at the lowest rate for their 
particular rank instead of the highest -- which they had been 
promised. 
  "SAP selection standards are much higher and our training is 
much longer and more purposeful than those of the NPKF and see 
what they get compared with us," Capt Brandt told the TEC. He 
said that policemen would play as vital a role as the NPKF in 
the pre-election, election and post-election phases. 
  With ordinary policing also continuing, SAP members would 
have to work overtime constantly during the run-up to and after 
the election. Already there is talk of 12 hours continuous 
work, followed by 12 hours of rest, immediately followed by 
another 12 hours duty. 
  "Should chaos break out, it could mean that these time 
schedules will have to be maintained for an indefinite period 
which could place unprecedented, indefinite pressure on the 
police." Police are overworked and tired, suffering from stress 
"and our families are disintegrating because of this". 
  While police were fully prepared to render impartial 
service, 
they were "sick and tired" after being abused by several 
politicians in the past "to give of their best at a meagre 
salary and no overtime pay". 
  Mr Craig Kotze, spokesman for Minister of Law and Order Mr 
Hernus Kriel, said yesterday: "We will not allow policemen to 
strike. There is no reason for them to do so and all the 
channels are in place for them to voice their grievances. We do 
not believe police morale is that low. Policemen chose their 
career path because they wanted to serve the community," he said. 
  Chairman of the law and order subcouncil of the TEC, Mr 
Peter 
Gastrow, said last night the matter would appear on the 
council's agenda at their meeting next week. Speaking in his 
capacity as DP [Democratic Party] spokesman on law and order, he 
said: "The unhappiness of members of the police force is 
perfectly understandable in the light of the exceptionally heavy 
burden which they are being asked to carry while others appear 
to receive a better reward. I think they are justified in 
taking this matter up at the highest level and if the minister 
does not want a demotivated police force during the election 
serious attention will have to be given to their demands". 
  SAPU has recruited more than 10,000 members since January -- 
more than 2,000 from the Western Cape. Major-General Nic Acker, 
regional commissioner of police in the Western Cape, said last 
night the morale of the men under his command was "a hundred 
percent". 
  The head of the SAP's Police Psychology Unit, Dr Neel le 
Roux, said it was a tragedy that just when policemen needed 
psychological assistance more than ever the carpet was being 
pulled from under their feet by the cut in medical aid 
contributions for psychological treatment. 
  "At the moment about 80 percent of medical boardings in the 
force are psychological and the suicide rate in the police force 
is about seven times higher than the rest of the population," he 
said. A spokeswoman for Polmed in the SAP, Major Marinda van 
Rooyen, said they had introduced the benefit cuts in January but 
said they were re-evaluating the cuts following numerous 
complaints from members and practioners.

  [Text] A preelection snap poll done for the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] by Markinor gives some idea of 
how election campaigns are going down in the Western Cape. A 
representative sample of 400 people of all races throughout the 
province was interviewed earlier this month. 
  The poll found that the National Party [NP] and its leader, 
F.W. de Klerk, had quite favorable images among the Western Cape 
electorate as whole, and they are the strongest among coloreds. 
Sixty-one percent of all potential voters see the NP favorably, 
as do 74 percent of colored voters. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] and its leader, Nelson 
Mandela, have fairly unfavorable images in the same area except 
among the African minority. Both major party candidates for 
provincial premier are unpopular. Only 12 percent think the 
NP's Hernus Kriel would make a good premier, while 21 percent 
think the ANC's Allan Boesak would. The poll found that the 
issues having the most impact in the Western Cape campaign 
concerned group identity and economic benefits. These include 
fears of how an ANC government would treat coloreds and whites, 
and whether coloreds identify with whites or with blacks. 
Overall, the survey found that 37 percent of potential Western 
Cape voters say the National Party could best handle what they 
consider the most important issues. Twenty percent named the 
ANC, 7 percent the Democratic Party, and 2 percent the 
Pan-Africanist Congress.

<F P=106> [Report by Guy Rogers] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 25 SAPA -- If international 
mediation to break the current constitutional impasse takes 
place, as has now been agreed, one of the first and most 
difficult issues will be procedural rather than substantive: 
The timescale for mediation and the date of the April election. 
  This according to SA [South African] Institute of Race 
Relations researcher Anthea Jeffrey, who notes the Inkatha 
Freedom Party's [IFP] position that mediation "will not achieve 
anything while the election process and its timetables outstrip 
steps that can be taken to find a comprehensive solution". 
  However, African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson 
Mandela has said the election cannot be postponed, a position 
endorsed by the National Party [NP]. 
  Ms Jeffrey says that if mediators get the antagonists past 
this obstacle then two key constitutional issues, plus the 
demand made by King Goodwill Zwelithini for Zulu 
self-determination, still need to be resolved. 
  February amendments to the constitution, reflecting the 
viewpoint of the ANC and the NP, included an increase in the 
areas of jurisdiction -- although not the legislative powers -- 
of provinces, and the provision for two ballots in the election. 
Another amendment enables provinces to determine their own 
"structures", although not their legislative or fiscal 
capabilities. 
  Central to the issues which still need to be resolved by 
mediation is the IFP's position that it will make further 
concessions -- accepting wide powers of central override in 
relation to provincial legislative powers -- only if the Freedom 
Alliance's December 19 "yellow paper" is accepted as a package. 
  The two key issues at the heart of the yellow paper and 
which 
require international mediation are: 

  -  the current two-phase process for constitution-making; and, 
  -  the entrenched devolution of substantial power to provinces. 

    The ANC insists on the former, Ms Jeffrey Notes, but refuses 
the latter. The IFP insists on the latter but rejects the 
former. It has said it will concede a two-phase process at 
national level only if substantial power is given to provinces 
in the transitional constitution and also entrenched in the 
final constitution. 
  Substantive, entrenched provincial powers, in the IFP's 
view, 
require: 

  -  more legislative competance for provinces; 
  -  an independent tax base for provinces; 
  -  substantial autonomy for provinces in drawing up their own 
constitutions; and, 
  -  entrenchment of provincial autonomy. 

    The ANC, Ms Jeffrey notes, says it and the NP have gone "a 
long way" towards addressing the Freedom Alliance's concerns, 
much further than they believed they ought to have gone. The 
IFP has said the election timetable might need to be revised to 
give the mediation process enough time and to enable all parties 
to compete on an equal footing. But, according to ANC Secretary 
General Cyril Ramaphosa, "the election date is engrave in stone. 
It cannot be changed." 
  If mediation goes ahead despite the repercussions of the 
recent events in the homelands, Ms Jeffrey concludes, "one of 
the first and most difficult issues to face international 
mediators, accordingly, will be procedural rather than 
substantive: the timescale for mediation and the date for the 
April election". 
  It was announced in a joint statment this week that the ANC 
and the IFP had agreed to international mediation "to seek a 
constitutional settlement between the two parties" and that this 
should begin as soon as possible. 
  Senior negotiation sources have revealed that former U.S. 
secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Henry 
Kissinger will head the mediation commission and British Foreign 
Secretary Lord Carrington will be one of three other men under 
him. 
  The sources told SAPA the two parties had agreed to abide by 
the commission's decision.

  [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council's [TEC] Sub-Council on Finance said on Thursday [24 
March] the payout of pensions to public servants would have a 
negative effect on the economy and South Africa's image abroad. 
  This was in apparent reaction to the recent swell in demands 
by mainly civil servants for their pension contributions to be 
returned to them before the April election. 
  In a resolution adopted on Thursday, the sub-council said 
the 
demand for immediate pension payments had been precipitated by 
the "pre-emptive securing of excessive pensions and employment 
benefits by certain political office bearers". Another reason 
behind the demand for pension payments was that civil servants 
had been denied access by certain administrations to 
decision-making with regard to pension funds. 
  "The Sub-Council on Finance wishes to reassure all concerned 
that their pension benefits are adequately protected in the 
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993. Section 236 
(5) of the constitution specifically provides that pensionable 
salary or pensionable salary scale of civil servants shall not 
be reduced below the levels applicable before the commencement 
of the new constitution. 
  "Section 212 (6) of the constitution specifically protects 
the accrued benefits of members of official pension funds. In 
essence it provides that any amendments to pension benefits, 
which may be prejudicial to members, may not be instituted 
retroactively." 
  The sub-council urged all concerned to exercise utmost 
restraint and called on affected people to consider their demand 
for immediate pension payouts. 
  "Such a call is made especially in the light of the fact 
that 
the longer-term disadvantages to the individual and the country 
far outweigh short-term benefit that might accrue from an 
immediate pension payout."

<F P=106> [Report by J Saunders] </F>
  [Text] Port Elizabeth March 24 SAPA -- Creating job 
opportunities for one section of the population did not mean 
depriving others, Minister of Finance Derek Keys said on 
Thursday [24 March]. As the only party which realised this, the 
National Party [NP] had to gain enough representation in a 
future cabinet to communicate this concept successfully. 
  Mr Keys, who is standing in the April election as an NP 
candidate, gave Port Elizabeth businessmen his reasons for 
optimism and caution. "Although this is a minority opinion, my 
view of a future economic policy under a government of national 
unity is very good.... Every participant in the government is 
agreed on an issue of primary importance: the achievement of 
social objectives is the ultimate test of the validity of any 
economic policy. There is total agreement on the no. 1 social 
objective -- jobs. Nothing else, nothing complicated. Jobs. 
Now we know, and our future partners know, you cannot create 
jobs unless you have growth. We know, and they know, that you 
cannot have growth unless you have investment." 
  The public sector could not produce growth or sustainable 
job 
opportunities. "Only the private sector operates in a stingy 
enough fashion to achieve that." 
  South Africa needed an economy which was friendly to 
investors and entrepreneurs, in which the private sector would 
not only survive but flourish, said Mr Keys. 
  The business community had performed magnificently and since 
1989 commodity prices had fallen drastically. In addition, the 
outflow of capital had lessened since December. "I think the 
worst is over." 
  In multiparty talks negotiators had managed to achieve an 
institutional framework which secured property rights and 
protected the independence of the Reserve Bank. 
  But a future government would have to trust participants in 
the economy such as bankers, mining houses and trade unions to 
get the best results. And it should learn that the creation of 
job opportunities was not a "zero sum game". "We are the only 
party which realises that creating job opportunities for one 
section of the population doesn't mean that you have to deprive 
someone else of opportunity. We have to make sure we can 
communicate this concept successfully in the government of 
national unity. The extent to which we can win these arguments 
will depend on our representation in cabinet."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Call for Generals' Withdrawal -- If the generals named in 
the 
Goldstone Commission report on police involvement in the 
violence in Natal are innocent, "then they, their colleagues and 
the Commissioner of Police should accept their withdrawal from 
duty instead of fighting it on procedural grounds," declares a 
page 14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 
March. "It is, of course, correct that proper procedures must 
be followed, but this is a quibble that the commissioner could 
have sorted out in hours. There can be no argument at all that 
the generals and all others accused in the report should be kept 
out of the way until innocence or guilt is proven." 
  Editorial Skeptical About Mediation Success -- A second 
editorial on the same page says Lord Carrington and Henry 
Kissinger, named to mediate between the Inkatha Freedom Party 
(IFP) and the African National Congress (ANC), "face a most 
daunting task even before they begin their work." "Ideally, the 
mediation should be completed before the election, so that the 
IFP can be included in the process. But mediation can be long 
and cumbersome and preparations for the election must, 
therefore, go ahead as planned. Perhaps the mediators' wisdom 
can devise a means by which agreements reached after the 
election could yet be included in the constitution. We wouldn't 
bet on it, however." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  TEC `Gave In' To Prisoners' Protests -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS 
DAY in English on 25 March in a page-6 editorial notes that the 
Transitional Executive Council (TEC) "gave in to violent protest 
in deciding that all prisoners should be allowed to vote in 
South Africa's first democratic election." "Having won their 
first battle through rioting which cost at least 23 lives, some 
prisoners are already setting out new demands. Some long-term 
prisoners want to vote `at home', and this novel idea is sure to 
catch on. Demands do not stop there. Other Ciskei prisoners 
say they should be released because `there is no government'. 
If they riot savagely enough, will the TEC decide they have a 
point, and let them loose?" 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Government, TEC `Dawdled' Over Issues -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN 
in English on 25 March in a page-12 editorial says the TEC and 
the government "dawdled" on the issues of prisoners' voting 
rights and the lack of free political activity in Bophuthatswana 
(Bop). The TEC and the government "huffed and puffed and wrung 
their hands until Bop folk took the law into their hands and 
sent Mangope scuttling. It was only then that the TEC and the 
Government stepped in." Now it is "happening in kwaZulu, the 
Ciskei and the other homelands. It's happening with decisions 
on the other violence racking the country. The message from all 
this is that only might is right. It is the old story of the 
liberation struggle: Lives have to be sacrificed first before 
there is action. This is all against the message that the TEC 
and the Government are trying to give us -- that negotiations 
and democracy are the way of a new South Africa." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Call for SADF Intervention in Natal/kwaZulu -- Johannesburg 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 25-30 March in a 
page-20 
editorial believes that to avoid "direct and bloody conflict" 
between the IFP and the ANC, "the South African Defence Force 
should be sent in to isolate the Inkatha warriors, separate the 
ANC mass activist from their IFP rivals, neutralise the kwaZulu 
Police, disarm all parties and stop the informal training of 
warriors. Their purpose should not be to depose anyone -- that 
would worsen the situation -- but to secure the region for 
elections and reduce the death rate."

  [Excerpt] Violence is continuing in Bujumbura, especially 
in the areas of Kinama, Cibitoke, and Kamenge. Widespread 
rumors have exacerbated worries and fear among the people. In 
the northern areas of the capital, gunfire continues to be 
heard, with the inhabitants departing in the hundreds to other 
areas of the capital or to Zaire. 
  A government communique that has just reached us deals with 
a 
few rumors in particular: A rumor particularly harmful for 
peace and national reconciliation in Burundi has reached the 
national and international press community. The prime minister 
categorically denies the allegations detailed by this rumor and 
states the following: There was no coup attempt during the 
night of 22 to 23 March 1994. The Presidential Palace and the 
government headquarters are enjoying the usual protection of the 
security forces. The president of the republic and the prime 
minister are at work as usual, as witnessed by the U.S. deputy 
under secretary of state, Mrs. (Prudence) [word indistinct]; the 
UN secretary general's special representative, Mr. Ahmed Ould 
Abdallah; and the ambassador of Cote d'Ivoire in Bonn, Mr. 
Simeon Ake, who heads the UN international commission in charge 
of investigating the events that have occurred since 21 October 
1993. All these officials were received today officially at the 
government headquarters. There are not government members on 
the run abroad, and no definitive figures for losses have yet 
been established after Monday's [21 March] clashes in the 
northern areas of the capital between security forces and rebels 
armed with assault rifles, grenades and heavy weapons. [passage

  [Text] Another plenary session has been postponed in 
Lusaka, Zambia. The session was expected to examine the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] 
reply presented to the mediator yesterday. Our correspondent in 
Lusaka, Joao Ligio reports. 
  The new document presented by UNITA asks for the 
continuation 
of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel's [Vorgan] 
broadcasts on shortwave, the return of its property in good 
condition, and the granting of party installations and houses 
for its leaders. UNITA also announced the introduction of a new 
list of its 70 deputies. 
  The government, which was expected to give its official 
reaction had the plenary session had taken place, said that 
Vorgan Radio should operate on shortwave only until December. 
Thereafter, it should join other medium wave national broadcasts. 
  On the return of property, the government says: Give me what 
is mine, and you will have what is yours. If you impose 
conditions on what is mine, you will receive equal treatment. 
  On the granting of party installations and houses for UNITA 
leaders, the government referred to the law regulating the 
acquisition of immovable property in the country. 
  On the new list of UNITA deputies, the government wants to 
know the fate of those who in parliament speak in the name of 
UNITA. 
  What is strange is that this document does not mention the 
debate over ministries and provinces. This could mean the 
parties are making progress in this direction. According to 
UNITA's Jorge Valentim, his delegation accepts the government's 
offer of the Ministries of Health, Tourism and Hotel Industry, 
and Public Works. The Public Works Ministry will still be 
debated, in view of its nonexistence. Jorge Valentim said UNITA 
accepts the Provinces of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, 
and it is presently negotiating the Provinces of Benguela and 
Huambo, which the government says are negotiable.

  [Text] Durban March 24 SAPA -- Greater security force 
deployment could be expected in the coming weeks in Natal, 
including the possible deployment of the South African Defence 
Force [SADF] in townships, State President F W de Klerk said in 
Durban on Thursday [24 March]. He said Natal was a "difficult 
province" but "in the weeks to come we will deal with the 
volatile and explosive situation". 
  "We will definitely talk about making wider use of the 
SADF," 
Mr de Klerk said. 
  Mr de Klerk said he on Thursday morning received morning 
updated intelligence reports and contingency plans for Natal, 
and would be given a full run-down on Thursday afternoon. "The 
government is willing and able to ensure that law and order is 
effectively maintained." He said the solution lay in continued 
successful negotiations. 
  On the controversy surrounding his laying of the foundation 
stone at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Phoenix earlier in 
the day, Mr de Klerk reiterated he had acted as the head of 
state. He chastised the Democratic Party Natal Chairman Mike 
Ellis for suggesting his visit was an electioneering strategy. 
  He said he was performing a "pleasant" duty as the leader of 
the government. "I don't need them to teach me good manners," 
said Mr de Klerk. 
  He also criticised the Transitional Executive Council for 
"poking their nose" into his public duties. He said they should 
rather concentrate their efforts on stopping intimidation. "This 
is beyond my understanding," Mr de Klerk commented.

<F P=106> [Report by N Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk is 
to have "fundamental" discussions with Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to ensure free and fair 
elections in kwaZulu/Natal against a background of African 
National Congress [ANC] pressure to have administrators 
appointed to the region. Mr de Klerk announced this at a news 
conference at the Union Buildings after he met an ANC delegation 
led by ANC President Nelson Mandela on Thursday [24 March]. 
  Mr Mandela addressed a separate news conference at the Union 
Buildings after they failed to fully agree on the measures to be 
taken in kwaZulu. Mr de Klerk said while his government was 
empowered to take over government functions in kwaZulu, as ANC 
Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had suggested earlier, this 
was not what he intended doing. 
  Mr de Klerk briefed the ANC delegation which included Mac 
Maharaj, Mr Ramaphosa and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo 
on the government's security contingency plans for Natal. The 
SADF [South African Defense Force] call-up would obviously 
involve an increase in manpower levels, he said. 
  On a political level, Mr de Klerk said he would like to meet 
Mr Buthelezi as soon as possible to discuss arrangements to 
ensure free electioneering in kwaZulu, and to discuss the 
possibility of another initiative to involve the region in an 
inclusive political process. 
  He would see Mr Buthelezi to prevent the necessity for SA 
Government intervention. 
  Mr Mandela told a separate news conference Mr de Klerk had 
not reacted like a state president in his comments on Mr 
Ramaphosa's suggestions, but like a petty politician. Mr 
Mandela was "completely disgusted" by Mr de Klerk's response. 
Mr de Klerk had failed to contact Mr Mandela on the matter as 
he should have handled an issue of national concern. 
  Asked whether there was a rift between him and Mr de Klerk, 
?r Mandela said they had "made progress" during their 
discussions on kwaZulu/Natal's political and security situation. 
If there was progress, free and fair elections in Natal should 
be possible. 
  Mr de Klerk had defended kwaZulu's and the IFP's actions, 
and 
ignored the fact that state resources were being used to 
destabilise the political process, Mr Mandela said. 
  Mr de Klerk said he made it clear at the meeting that the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] did not have the powers to 
tamper with lawfully-elected institutions in kwaZulu. He 
dismissed any notions that he was part of a strategy to topple 
the kwaZulu government. 
  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Johan 
Kriegler earlier briefed both leaders on meeting with the 
kwaZulu Legislative Assembly on Wednesday. Mr de Klerk said the 
IEC's information on the situation in kwaZulu was more negative 
than initial interpretations had suggested.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 25 March (PANA) -- The OAU has called 
on Nigeria and Cameroon to withdraw their troops from the 
disputed Bakassi Peninsula and settle their border dispute 
peacefully based on the United Nations and OAU Charters. The 
OAU's central organ of mechanism for conflict resolution, in a 
resolution adopted Thursday [24 March] in Addis Ababa, called on 
both countries to "exercise restraint" and take appropriate 
measures to restore confidence and continue with the dialogue 
already initiated. 
  In the resolution adopted at the end of its one day meeting, 
the organ reaffirmed its "attachment to the respect of the 
principle of the inviolability of frontiers inherited from the 
colonial period" as well as the respect of sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and independence of all states. 
  The organ, while expressing grave concern at the escalating 
situation and its implications for the two countries and the 
region as a whole, expressed satisfaction that the two nations 
"are for a peaceful settlement of the dispute." It noted with 
appreciation the efforts of Presidents Eyadema of Togo and 
Mubarak of Egypt aimed at defusing the situation and reaching a 
peaceful settlement. 
  However both Nigeria and Cameroon expressed reservations 
over 
the wording of the text of the resolution. The Nigerian 
delegation called for the withdrawal of non-African troops from 
the peninsula to be included in the text, while Cameroon 
specifically wanted the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the 
peninsula saying Nigeria invaded the peninsula.

  [Text] Tension is mounting between Cameroon and Nigeria 
over the disputed ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula. Nigeria, 
which asserted yesterday that there was an unusual movement of 
Cameroonian troops at the border, said it was determined to 
defend its territorial integrity. A communique from the 
government emphasized that the flexibility of Nigeria's policy 
must not be taken as an inability to defend its territorial 
integrity. This statement has not left the Cameroonian 
authorities indifferent. During a press conference held 
yesterday in Addis Ababa following discussions with the OAU body 
in charge of preventing conflicts, Cameroonian External 
Relations Minister Leopold Ferdinand Oyono said that war can 
break out at any time. 
  This topic was at the center of discussions yesterday in 
Paris between Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, Cameroonian minister 
of state in charge of communications, and French President 
Francois Mitterrand. After the audience, Mr. Kouomegni briefed 
Mamadi Youssoufou on his visit to France. 
  [Begin recording] [Kouomegni] We have delivered to the 
French 
authorities a message from the Cameroonian head of state. We 
discussed with them the conflict between Nigeria and Cameroon. 
We also discussed the situation on the ground and efforts being 
made on the diplomatic front and together we examined the 
prospects. 
  [Youssoufou] Can you give us an idea about President 
Francois 
Mitterrand's position on this border conflict between your 
country and Nigeria? 
  [Kouomegni] France's position is simple. France is firmly on 
the side of Cameroon to ensure that the border demarcation 
between Nigeria and Cameroon is respected. France, we are told, 
is strict on ensuring respect for international law throughout 
the world. 
  [Youssoufou] Does this means that you are maintaining your 
decision to bring the case before the UN Security Council? 
  [Kouomegni] The case is not only before the UN Security 
Council, but also before the OAU and the International Court of 
Justice. We are not dropping any of these proceedings. All the 
same, we are open to any other initiatives, either bilateral or 
multilateral. The most important thing for Cameroon is that 
both of these methods should create the hope for a real 
solution. [end recording]

  [Text] Calm seems to have returned to the northern suburbs 
of Bujumbura this morning. According to AFP, there was no 
shooting last night or early this morning. The death toll for 
the recent clashes in Burundi has now been revised downwards, 
but the clashes between soldiers and civilians are nevertheless 
said to have claimed several dozen lives. Doctors Without 
Borders Belgium has expressed its concern about the fate of the 
wounded. Most of them are said to be too afraid to leave their 
shelters to seek medical help. Christian Sendegeya, vice 
president of the Burundi National Assembly, is currently 
visiting Paris. He has confirmed that the head of state remains 
quite free to move around as he wishes, and he denied that there 
was any coup attempt, as had been claimed. This latest flare-up 
nevertheless started when soldiers tried to disarm Hutu 
civilians in Bujumbura. Murielle Pomponne began by asking 
Christian Sendegeya if he felt that this process of disarmament 
should continue: 
  [Begin recording] [Sendegeya] I quite agree that this 
disarmament should continue, but we have to ask ourselves who 
should be disarming whom. Is the Army to be involved in 
disarmament? A large proportion of the Army was actively or 
passively involved in the assassination of President Ndadaye. 
Are we now to send out that same Army to disarm other people? 
This does not make any sense. 
  The solution I believe is, as we have always asked, for the 
international community to send a neutral force to Burundi. 
This force could perhaps be entrusted with this mission of 
disarmament. 
  [Pomponne] The OAU was set to send a number of men. Where 
does this plan stand now? 
  [Sendegeya] The OAU was first going to send some 180 
soldiers. The Army together with some opposition parties 
complained about this. Now we are talking about some 50 
officers who are expected to come and be scattered across the 
various military camps in the country in order to monitor the 
behavior of the Army. I feel, however, that this is not what is 
needed. We need a good team of soldiers who could prevent the 
current Army from doing any harm, who could begin the whole 
process of disarmament, and then could help us to set up a 
really national army, made up of soldiers from all regions. [end 
recording] 
  That was Christian Sendegeya, vice president of the Burundi 
National Assembly. 
  In a communique, the European Union yesterday condemned the 
violence in Burundi. According to the Twelve, I quote, this 
violence has been fanned by extremist elements in the 
authorities, the opposition, and the Army.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 25 March (AFP) -- Confusion reigned in 
the Burundi capital on Friday [25 March] as soldiers involved in 
a week of tribal killings ignored government orders to withdraw 
from northern parts of the city. UN special envoy Ahmedou Ould 
Abdallah said the Army must pull out within the day. "But they 
are dragging their heels and the High Command is not exerting 
strict discipline," he said. He noted that the Army, dominated 
by the country's Tutsi minority, had a "terrible reputation" 
among the majority Hutu population in northern parts of 
Bujumbura where gun battles broke out at the weekend. 
  Abdallah estimated that at least 100 people were killed, 
adding that the death toll might be higher "because lots of 
people in this country do not weep and do not display their 
dead." Diplomatic sources said there were "misunderstandings" 
between the military and the government, "which are considerably 
complicating the situation." 
  The UN special representative repeated his complaint of the 
previous day that some Hutu politicians with vested interests 
were claiming "vastly exaggerated" casualty figures. Interior 
Minister Leonard Nyangoma told government radio in neighbouring 
Rwanda earlier in the week that almost 1,000 people had been 
killed. The latest official figure was given on Thursday by 
Communications Minister Cyriaque Simbizi at about 400. 
  Abdallah also rapped false reports spread in the last few 
days that the Army was mounting another coup and that government 
ministers had fled the country. "It is dangerous for the Hutu, 
who may well lose their credibility abroad," he said. Abdallah 
said he was worried about the estimated thousands of residents 
who fled their homes during the fighting into other parts of 
town, thereby causing overcrowding which could lead to fresh 
tensions. 
  Although there were no shooting overnight and things were 
relatively calm in northern districts of the capital, people 
were still seen quitting their homes for neighbouring Zaire, 
other parts of the city or outlying banana groves. 
  Part of the Army mounted a short-lived coup last October, 
killing Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's first Hutu president. Since 
then, tribal fighting has left tens of thousands dead and driven 
700,000 into refuge in surrounding countries.

  [Text] Security remains poor in the capital, Bujumbura, 
although last night was much calmer. Sporadic gunfire continued 
to be heard, especially in the northern areas of Bujumbura. In 
the area of Kamenge, which has been most affected by the 
prevailing insecurity, the situation seems to have eased. 
  The mayor of Bujumbura and the commander in charge of 
security in that area today toured the area and witnessed the 
situation that has relatively bettered and called on the 
hundreds of people that have fled to return to their homes. 
[sentence as heard] 
  In the meantime, Defense Ministe Lieutenant Colonel Gedeon 
Fyiroko talked about the prevailing situation and the way the 
Army was working to take control of the situation. They also 
showed to reporters a heap of weapons that had been taken from 
what were said to be rebels fighting the Army in the northern 
areas of the capital. They also denied any rumors of a military 
coup attempt in preparation. Mathias Ndayiragije has more: 
  [Begin Ndayiragije recording] Insecurity which prevails in 
this country could be settled soon, the defense minister said, 
if all moral forces could indulge in such business. He said 
other forces must collaborate with the government and the 
population as a whole, in an attempt to find ways out. For him, 
the first thing to be done was to create confidence among the 
population and be aware of the danger as it results in several 
losses of human lives, for which the minister for defense does 
not want to make stories or accounts whatsoever, because it is a 
shame. [sentence as heard] 
  All rumors which are [word indistinct] in this country tend 
to create mutual hatred among the population and this hatred 
results sometimes in mutual exclusion. 
  As for rumors which said there ought [as heard] to occur a 
military force coup, the defense minster said that the Burundi 
Army keeps loyal and fully supports the government and all the 
democratic institutions of the country. 
  The Burundi minister expressed concern over the disarmament 
issue because people who have no civil rights to hold weapons 
continue to seek them and this will always constitute a threat 
to the country's security. There are [word indistinct] 
thousands of weapons circulating among the population, and some 
of them are not available in the Burundi arsenal military stock. 
Some of the weapons are manufactured and imported from South 
Africa, Israel, Brasilia, China, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Russia 
and so on. 
  Those weapons include guns, (?F.M. Karash), grenades of 
different kinds, as well as rockets. There were also some 
weapons which are not available in the Burundi military stock 
arsenal but which are actually used in the Rwandese Army. Most 
of the other weapons such as pistols, are used by the Burundi 
intelligence services. For him an action of disarmament should 
start soon and provide [break in transmission]. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The president of the Republic, Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, this morning opened the proceedings of the National 
Security Council, which will examine solutions to end the crisis 
prevailing since 21 October. The president first recalled the 
mission of the National Security Council then spoke on the 
prevailing insecurity. 
  [Begin Ntaryamira recording] [passage omitted] Even though 
the authorized services have not yet given figures on the death 
toll following the tragic events, there are estimates of about 
100,000 deaths. There are indications of a decline in the 
economic and social sectors. The worst thing is that the 
situation does not seem to be stabilizing. After the killings 
in Kamenge and Tangara, our country wakes up daily to witness 
heaps of corpses, destroyed or burned houses in some areas of 
Bujumbura, and more particularly in Nyakabiga, Cibitoke, Kinama, 
and Musage. 
  A climate of suspicion has returned to some boarding 
schools, 
notably at Cibitoke, Bururi, Kayanza, and in northeastern and 
eastern parts of the country. There is still a fear of an 
external attack. 
  In the western and central parts of the country, local 
leaders report people are receiving training in weapons 
handling, while the specter of the Party for the Liberation of 
the Hutu People haunts some people. All the inhabitants of this 
country, both nationals and foreigners, need peace and stability 
in order to restore mutual trust and to live together once 
again. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The National Security Council held its first 
ordinary meeting yesterday under the chairmanship of the head of 
state, who is also the chairman of the National Security 
Council, His Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira. The following is a 
report on the meeting by Laurent Kagimbi: 
  [Begin Kagimbi recording] After an introductory speech by 
the president of the Republic, the council first studied a draft 
of the internal rules. The council then exchanged general views 
on the state of security prevailing in the entire country, 
particularly in Bujumbura. While discussing other business, it 
examined the modalities of going on meet-the-people visits to 
work toward a return to peace. 
  Concerning the internal rules, the council members examined 
the proposed draft, contributed to it, and referred its adoption 
to the next session. 
  On the problem of security in the entire territory, and in 
particular in the capital, the security members studied the 
issue in all its aspects and found that it was a priority 
concern for the country's leaders and the population. The 
council sadly noted that if peace and security were not restored 
swiftly, the country would inexorably slip into perdition. 
  The council expressed its deep sympathy for the victims of 
this destructive madness, which has befallen our dear motherland 
since the coup attempt in which the elected president, Melchior 
Ndadaye, was killed. 
  In order to restore security and peace in the country, the 
National Security Council proposes to the government the 
following: 
  First, all the institutions of the Republic and political 
and 
moral leaders of society must permanently speak the language of 
peace and reconciliation. The spirit of solidarity must be 
revived and reinforced so that the people, irrespective of their 
ethnic affiliations, can cultivate a spirit of mutual help in 
the face of danger, fighting together against criminals and all 
types of wrongdoers, and reject the enticement of those who want 
to once more drag them into ethnic violence and vengeance. 
  Second, all the institutions charged with public order, 
whether magistrates, administrative leaders or security forces, 
must carry out their tasks with discipline, work in permanent 
consultation, and act with the utmost firmness to neutralize all 
troublemakers and all wrongdoers who kill, loot, and destroy. 
In this respect, the government must establish a crisis 
committee which will meet daily to assess the situation, 
identify those responsible for the tragic events we are 
experiencing, propose strategies for fighting them, and report 
daily to the president of the Republic. The crisis committee 
will include the minister of state for the interior and public 
security, the minister of national defense, the minister of 
justice, and the general administrator in charge of national 
documentation and immigation. 
  Third, concerning disarmament, the government must study 
methods and appropriate working structures so that this 
operation, which is indispensable, does not become an occasion 
for confrontation but rather an operation which, with the 
participation of everyone, aims to restore peace. 
  Concerning Bujumbura, the government must put in place the 
following measures: 
  One, the establishment and revival of administrative 
structures which must cooperate closely with the security 
forces. To this end, every zone leader will be delegated an 
Army officer charged with assisting him in security matters and 
in the intervention of security forces. 
  Two, a patronage committee will be set up in every zone, and 
will be charged with administrative problems and security forces 
to restore the peace. The committee will consist of a 
government member [as heard], a National Assembly member, a 
National Security Council member, and a field officer of the 
Armed Forces or the Gendarmerie. 
  Three, there will be a gradual reduction in military 
checkpoints and a placing of intervention groups on alert in the 
barracks, so that these forces can quickly swing into action to 
rescue the populace at the request of the administrative 
authorities, or in case of emergency. 
  Concerning some foreigners, particularly groups of young 
Rwandans who sow insecurity, the government must strictly apply 
the laws in force at the national and international levels. 
  In conclusion, the National Security Council called upon all 
the Burundian people to commit themselves fully to the return of 
peace and reconciliation. If this is not done, our motherland 
will inexorably head towards its destruction. [end recording]

  [Text] The Cameroon Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono, 
currently in Addis Ababa for the OAU talks, has said that war 
between Cameroon and Nigeria can break out at any time over the 
Bakassi peninsula. He said he was not satisfied with the OAU 
recommendations which, despite urging troop withdrawal from the 
peninsula, have refrained from condemning the Abuja regime as 
Yaounde expected. According to Oyono, the Cameroon and Nigerian 
armies are now facing each other and are only 300 meters apart.

  [Text] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has strongly condemned 
the killings in Burundi, which were carried out by soldiers 
against unarmed citizens. He said that they should cease what 
they are doing immediately. In talks with a special envoy of 
President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, who delivered a message 
this evening at State House in Dar es Salaam, President Mwinyi 
said that the Tanzanians had received the reports about the 
continued killings in Burundi with a great deal of sadness. He 
said that the government could not remain silent while such 
injustices continued to be perpetrated in a neighboring country. 
  He said that, under any circumstances, whatever happened in 
Burundi affected Tanzania and other neighboring countries. He 
said that it was for this reason that he had contacted the 
leaders of the east and central African countries to seek an 
urgent solution, in cooperation with the OAU. 
  For his part, the Burundian envoy, Mr. Severin Mfatiye, who 
is also the ambassador of Burundi in Rwanda, briefed President 
Mwinyi at length about the grave and deplorable security 
situation in Burundi.

  [Excerpt] President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has proposed 
a regional conference to discuss the escalating tribal violence 
in Burundi. Addressing the press in Kampala on his return home 
from a brief visit to Tanzania, Mr. Museveni suggested that the 
leaders of Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Zaire, and Zambia hold a 
meeting immediately to find a lasting solution to the Burundi 
conflict. He said the formerly minor historical issue in 
Burundi had over the decades been complicated by mismanagement. 
The Ugandan leader blamed some foreign countries for the 
mismanagement of affairs in both Burundi and Rwanda. [passage

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Yoweri Museveni; place </F>
and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow Ugandans, the 28th day of March 1994 is the 
day when elections for the Constituent Assembly [CA] will take 
place. It is an important day for our country as it marks the 
culmination of a long process in our people's participation to 
make a new constitution, a constitution that will lay a firm 
foundation for a democratic governance and ensure a stable 
future for our country. You started this process when you 
presented your views in your constitutional memoranda to the 
Constituent Assembly commission. Now the time has come to elect 
those who will represent your views in the Constituent Assembly. 
  I, therefore, appeal to you fellow Ugandans who registered 
to 
vote to turn out in large numbers and vote. By turning out to 
vote in big numbers, you will ensure that the right people get 
elected to represent your views in the Constituent Assembly. 
  The NRM [National Resistance Movement] government is 
committed to ensuring that we have successful Constituent 
Assembly elections. As you know, part of the turmoil our country 
has gone through has been on account of rigged elections. 
Rigging elections means robbing the will of the people to chart 
out their own future and to determine their own destiny. 
  Therefore, the NRM government is determined to ensure that 
no 
rigging takes place in these elections. We passed the 
Constituent Assembly statute in the NRC [National Resistance 
Council] with this in mind. Where, for example, there used to 
be a number of ballot boxes, we have provided for one. Where 
casting a ballot would be done in a voting booth where all types 
of electoral mischiefs could be committed, we have provided that 
voting be done in full view of the people but far enough to 
ensure secrecy for the voter. Where ballot papers would be 
ferried to be counted at one central point, we have provided 
that counting of votes must be done at the polling station and 
on the same day. In an effort to prevent gerrymandering of 
constituencies, we have provided that the county should be the 
best constituency unit. 
  All this and more is evidence of our resolve to put to an 
end 
the bad habit of rigging elections. I am informed, however, 
that a good number of our people are already addicted to 
election rigging, that it is almost impossible, according to 
these people, to conduct free elections. Complaints about 
partisan returning officers and presiding officers who violate 
every requirement for impartiality have reached me. I am 
appealing to these people and also warning them to change their 
ways and act in an impartial manner as is expected of them and 
as the law provides; otherwise, the full force of the law will 
be brought down on any electoral official who misconducts 
himself or herself in the performance of his or her duties. 
  I also call upon the RC's [Resistance Councils] to document 
every malpractice they may witness in the performance of duties 
by the returning officers or presiding officers so that they 
make it available to the legal machinery after the elections or 
even during the elections. We shall not condone or give quarter 
to anyone who engages in electoral malpractices. 
  I have been assured that sufficient preparations have been 
made to ensure the smooth holding of these elections. In a 
society such as ours, where technological and communications 
problems prevail, it may not be possible to rule out possible 
last-minute hitches here and there. Where such unforeseen 
problems arise, the commissioner of the Constituent Assembly 
will no doubt put in place practical measures consistent with 
the CA statute. 
  I have heard that there are fears in some quarters that some 
people may disrupt these elections. I wish to assure the whole 
country that security measures are well in place and no one will 
be able to disrupt these elections. Anyone who harbors the idea 
of disrupting these elections and tries to do so will be dealt 
with decisively. Please take no heed of anybody spreading this 
kind of rumor, but instead go to the polling station and vote 
for the candidate of your choice. 
  To the CA candidates: (?Put) an end your long and hard 
struggle to win the hearts of the people for your election. All 
of you cannot win and inevitably, many of you are bound to lose. 
Therefore, those of you who lose should know that it is the 
verdict of the people and should respect it. And those of you 
who win should appreciate the responsibility that the people 
have entrusted to you and the challenge that this entails. I 
wish you all successful CA elections. Thank you very much.

  [Text] The deputy central government representative in 
Mbale, Mr. Henry Rwigyemera, has strongly condemned the 
political thuggery exhibited yesterday by some political 
reactionaries who tried to assassinate the minister of tourism, 
wildlife, and antiquity, Mr. James Wapakkabulo, last night, by 
throwing two hand grenades at his vehicles, killing one person 
and injuring 14 others, two of them critically. 
  One grenade was aimed at two vehicles belonging to the 
minister and his supporters and another at a minibus belonging 
to one of the minister's supporters. 
  Talking to a Kampala Radio Uganda Network reporter by 
telephone from Mbale, Mr. Rwigyemera assured the people of Mbale 
and the entire country that government authorities in Mbale have 
zeroed on those reactionaries and security precautions have been 
maximally undertaken to ensure that such acts of thuggery do not 
occur again, and that elections are not disrupted at all. 
  He disclosed that they are aware that the target area for 
the 
thugs are Mbale municipality, Bubulo east and west 
constituencies and Manjiya County. He said the cause of these 
is that the reactionaries have realized that they are in for a 
shock on Monday [28 March], contrary to the fallacy that Bugisu 
and eastern Uganda are their power base. He said that the thugs 
have also realized that the people can no longer be manipulated. 
  The central government representative expressed condolence 
to 
the relatives of the young man who was killed in the attack. He 
also expressed sympathy to the relatives of those who were 
injured.

completed. UNITA said its forces would continue to resist 
attacks by the Angolan Army until a general peace accord had 
been signed. UNITA made this announcement in a statement after 
it claimed a major military victory over government forces in 
the region of Dange-ia- Menha in Angola's northern Cuanza Norte 
Province. The movement said it had inflicted heavy casualties 
on a government military convoy estimated to consist of about 
3,000 infantry soldiers and dozens of tanks. A number of 
Zairian mercenaries fighting alongside the Angolan Army had also 
been killed.

  [Text] Fierce clashes continue to take place in the area of 
Dange-ia-Menha, in Cuanza Norte Province. This is the priority 
target for Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace, which wants to 
eventually reach diamond-rich Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul 
Provinces. 
  In the latest fighting, the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-Labor Party, forces lost 
one BM-21 rocket launcher and one TMM mobile bridge, suffered 
101 soldiers confirmed killed on the ground, 160 soldiers who 
surrendered, and 30 soldiers who were captured. 
  The fighting is continuing with the Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola having the upper hand in terms of 
operational initiative, thereby frustrating this warmongering 
adventure by the warlords in Luanda. Vivaldo Prata, the Voice 
of Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent in the area, 
reports: 
  [Begin Prata recording] The war situation in Cuanza Norte 
Province is deteriorating daily. The MPLA is using military and 
[words indistinct] equipment (?to try and secure) strategic 
positions on the various operational fronts. The MPLA forces 
have been involved in major military movements from Dondo since

  [Text] Despite the defeats that his People's Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] have been suffering, Chief 
of General Staff Joao de Matos has again urged his soldiers to 
be ever more ready for war against -- obviously -- the 
defenseless people of Angola. Addressing the ceremony marking 
the close of the course for the first marines in the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola's [MPLA] navy yesterday, 
Joao de Matos said that, quote, we must continue training forces 
like these, so that we can be more effective in combat, unquote. 
  The MPLA war chieftain once again resorted to his usual 
excuses, saying the victim is the aggressor, and alleging that 
the FAPLA forces will continue to defend themselves in the face 
of aggression by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, 
when in fact he is the one who is ordering the FAPLA forces to 
go on an offensive against Cuanza Norte, Cuanza Sul, Lunda 
Norte, Lunda Sul, Zaire, Huila, Moxico, and Bengo Provinces, 
among others. The MPLA's increasingly bellicose behavior is 
closely related to the inflexibility of the Faustino Muteka-led 
government team to the Lusaka peace talks, thereby confirming 
reports that the MPLA is only wasting time in the Zambian 
capital while waiting for the arrival of mercenaries and 
military equipment imported from foreign countries.

  [Excerpts] Calm has not returned to Cuanza Norte Province 
yet. Fierce clashes are continuing in the area of 
Dange-ia-Menha. After realizing that their militarist adventure 
against the area is a dream that will never come true, the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party forces 
are now desperately looking for ways to get back to Dondo. They 
are under siege, however, and it is getting tighter all the 
time. [passage omitted] In clashes at 1500 GMT yesterday, as 
the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, 
were trying to make their way back to Dondo, they left on the 
ground 10 dead soldiers, hundreds of wounded soldiers, two burnt 
out T-55 and T-66 tanks [words indistinct] and 20 cargo 
vehicles, also burnt out. Our forces also captured one 130-mm 
cannon. The other FAPLA forces are last in the jungle at this 
stage.

  [Text] The political and military situation in Cuanza Norte 
Province is still characterized by war, with Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos' men suffering heavy defeats. In Dange-ia-Menha, where 
the remaining Luanda troops have sought refuge, the situation is 
extremely difficult. The siege around Dange-ia-Menha is being 
tightened by [words indistinct] left with no supplies. The 
Luanda troops are surviving on roots. They are unable to break 
the siege. The only alternative left to them is to surrender to 
the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FALA.

commander of the 2d Tactical Group of the 45th Regiment. Our 
forces captured [words indistinct] People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] [words indistinct] lost many men

  [Text] The Republic of Namibia is regarded as the country 
most likely to trigger off more tension in southern Africa. 
Taking into consideration the alliance that exists between that 
country and the Luanda regime, it can be concluded that Mr. 
Nujoma clearly wants to provide substantive help to the Luanda 
communist regime in its vain attempt to destroy the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] by attacking 
UNITA's rearguard here in Cuando Cubango Province. 
  In addition to the fact that Namibia has been used by the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, to secure the services of South African mercenaries, 
that country is now also becoming the center for MPLA-PT secret 
police agents to carry out diversionary attacks on UNITA here in 
Jamba. 
  Such behavior by the regime led by Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 
in tandem with the South-West African People's Organization, 
SWAPO, is a serious threat to stability in southern Africa, 
particularly if one takes into account the troublesome situation 
in South Africa, Mozambique, and Angola are currently going 
through. 
  Little by little, UNITA is losing its patience. It has often 
warned the Namibian regime not to be involved in promoting the 
Luanda regime's macabre operations. A source in the Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] General Staff has 
said that, quote, when the FALA forces turns their cannons on 
invaders -- who will be hunted down until they go back to where 
they have come from -- we will not be responsible for whatever 
may happen. We have enough equipment at this stage to put on 
the run any forces provoking us, unquote.

  [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, forces continue their high profile 
movements in Lunda Sul Province. Those forces are on an 
offensive under the leadership of [former military commander for 
Huambo Province] Jorge Sukissa. They are attacking defenseless 
civilians in general as well as National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA]-controlled areas. 
  Reports from the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, 
Vorgan, correspondent in that area, say that the Luanda 
communist regime's air force bombed the villages of 
(Caumbangala), (Cuilo), (Chacolo), and (Samucuai) on 20, 21, 22, 
and 23 March, killing 34 civilians, including 22 children. 
  It is interesting to note that the government press in Lunda 
Sul Province has made no mention at all of those attacks by the 
MPLA-PT forces. Instead, it has falsely accused the UNITA 
forces of taking the initiative and launching an offensive. The 
UNITA forces have the simple duties of defending the people 
against the genocide being perpetrated by Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos' men and of abiding scrupulously by the unilateral 
cease-fire declared by UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro 
Savimbi on 20 September of last year. 
  Meanwhile, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
have 
informed the Angolan and international communities that they 
will do everything in their power to defend the people against 
attacks by South African or any other mercenaries helping the 
troops run by Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace.

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister General Andre Pitra Petroff, 
general commander of the Angolan Police, reaffirmed at a news 
conference yesterday that the results of all inquiries ordered 
by the Angolan Police General Command will be made public once 
investigations into the various police departments are over. 
During the course of the news conference, Interior Minister 
Petroff admitted the possibility of irregularities in certain 
departments, notably the Traffic Department, where there are 
indications that briberies may have been accepted. 
  The Angolan Police general commander also made it clear on 
that occasion that there is no inquiry under way concerning the 
activities of Police Commissar Gaspar da Silva, until recently 
Angolan Police commander for Luanda Province, but, rather, 
against the police command in that province. Interior Minister 
Petroff gave the reasons: 
  [Begin Petroff recording] Reports we have been getting since 
the first stage of [words indistinct] searches we carried out in 
the homes of some [word indistinct] we found weapons of war such 
as Makarov and other pistols, as well as submachine guns. Now, 
everyone knew that Ango-Segu [privately owned security company] 
had a mini-army, but we also found some weapons in the [words 
indistinct] so we ordered an inquiry to establish how those 
weapons had come into the possession of those [word indistinct] 
that is the principal reason why we ordered an inquiry against 
the Luanda Province Police Command. [end recording] 
  Asked why his name has been linked to the creation of 
Ango-Segu, Interior Minister Andre Pitra Petroff replied: 
  [Begin Petroff recording] That depends on how (?you think) 
you can link my name to Ango-Segu. In truth, however, I must 
say that Ango-Segu was helped by the Angolan Police General 
Command [words indistinct] Ango-Segu was an enterprise whose 
initial aims were to [words indistinct] assure safety for 
certain enterprises dealing in the buying and selling of 
diamonds [words indistinct] with knowledge of the law on 
liberalization of diamond buying and selling. Ango-Segu Company 
was created to protect those (?interests). [passage omitted]

  [Text] The head of state, President Henri Konan Bedie, 
granted an audience late this morning to a Cameroonian President 
Paul Biya's special envoy. The envoy is Cameroon's culture 
minister, who brought a personal message from President Biya to 
President Henri Konan Bedie. Noufe Nabi brings you this report: 
  [Nabi] Foreign affairs Minister Essy Amara and the 
Cameroonian ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire were present at the 
audience, which lasted about 30 minutes. Talks during the 
audience centered mainly on the Bakassi Peninsula border 
conflict between Cameroon and Nigeria. Professor Joseph-Marie 
Bipoun Woum, President Biya's envoy, reaffirmed Cameroon's claim 
to ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, and hoped that the 
current problem would be resolved peacefully. 
  [Begin Woum recording] Yes, Cameroon is confident of its 
rightful claim to this peninsula, and is engaged in the search 
for a solution to this problem by peaceful means. We advocate a 
peaceful solution to the conflict through regional and 
international intermediaries, as our claim over this peninsula 
is backed by a series of documents and legal instruments which 
date as far back as 1885 [words indistinct]. In all we have a 
total of 23 legal documents, including [word indistinct], 
protocols, agreements, declarations, and other documents 
established by our joint border commissions. So, these legal 
instruments cannot be disputed today and we are ready to defend 
them wherever necessary to back our legal claims. Naturally, in 
view of the broad outlook and global experience of President 
Henri Bedie, as well as the friendly and fraternal relations 
that have always existed between our two countries since their 
respective independence, Cameroon hopes that Cote d'Ivoire will 
contribute to efforts to find a peaceful solution to this 
conflict. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Fighting around ULIMO [United Liberation Movement 
for Democracy in Liberia] headquarters in Tubmanburg has put the 
Liberian peace process in serious jeopardy in the last few days, 
with plans to set up a transition council and to demobilize the 
warring factions being dealt a serious blow. The fighting 
appears to have been between two ULIMO factions -- one under 
Alhaji Koromah and supported by the Mandingo people; the other 
by Krahns, led by ULIMO's military wing chairman, Roosevelt 
Johnson. But there have also been reports that Charles Taylor's 
NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces were also 
involved in the fighting on Roosevelt Johnson's side. Well, 
today we spoke to Roosevelt Johnson himself, and on the line to 
Monrovia, Audrie Brown asked him what he knew about the fighting: 
  [Begin recording] [Johnson] Well, the fighting started early 
yesterday morning and died down in the evening. 
  [Brown] And, how many people were involved in this fighting? 
  [Johnson] Roughly, 2,000 something men went in to rescue the 
people there. 
  [Brown] Who are the people they went to rescue? 
  [Johnson] The relatives. The relatives and some other 
soldiers that were being held hostage there. 
  [Brown] What kind of losses did your side sustain? 
  [Johnson] Well, only two soldiers got wounded on the leg and 
they have been treated now in Bong Mines, and a few days ago my 
mother was slaughtered together with my two kids and my sister. 
  [Brown] You lost your mother and your children in this 
fighting? 
  [Johnson] Well, it was not actually in the fighting. They 
were coming to Tubmanburg, and they were captured by some of the 
Mandingo soldiers and they were slaughtered. 
  [Brown] So in this fighting your side are, I understand, 
Krahn soldiers and you are fighting Mandingos. Why are you 
fighting now? What is behind the latest fighting, this fighting 
that started on Friday [25 March]? 
  [Johnson] Well, it is because the Mandingo people, the few 
Mandingo people who are loyal to Koromah, continue to kill 
innocent people. Once you cannot speak Mandingo, they kill you. 
  [Brown] So when did they kill innocent people? 
  [Johnson] They have been killing them for the past three 
weeks, because as Koromah said we did not vote for Sheriff to 
become chairman on the Council, so that annoyed them and this is 
the reason why they have started disarming all other tribes, you 
know, within ULIMO, and that's when they started killing. 
  [Brown] Now, there are reports that you are fighting with 
Charles Taylor's NPFL. Can you confirm this? 
  [Johnson] This is not true. The information is completely 
misleading. I have had no connection with Taylor to get men 
from Taylor, or whatsoever connection. I don't have any 
connection with Taylor. The men that are fighting are purely 
ULIMO soldiers, and not only Krahn. What happened we.... 
[pauses] In the ULIMO we have all tribes there, and those 
soldiers that went in were not only Krahn. We have Grebo; we 
have Bassa, and other tribes mix with them. 
  [Brown] So are you in control of Tubmanburg now? 
  [Johnson] Definitely not. [as heard] Yes. I can tell you 
that my men on grounds now in Tubmanburg. 
  [Brown] If you have captured Tubmanburg, what have you done 
with the people who supported Alhaji Koromah who were still 
there? 
  [Johnson] Look, it is not our intention to kill anybody. 
Okay? So, even when we are fighting with NPFL, when we capture 
the NPFL soldiers we don't kill them. So I don't see why I 
should capture anybody from Alhaji Koromah's side and kill them. 
But the only thing is we had to move in militarily to bring the 
situation under control. 
  [Brown] So have you taken them prisoner? 
  [Johnson] Those that I have captured, yes, they are 
prisoners. 
  [Brown] So where do you go from now? You say you have 
captured Tubmanburg. Do you now want Alhaji Koromah to step down 
as the leader of ULIMO and you be leader or you choose another 
leader, or what do you want now? 
  [Johnson] We will decide that at a later date. We have to 
meet our men and listen to them, and listen to their suggestions 
before we can make comments on such a thing. 
  [Brown] So where is Alhaji Koromah now? 
  [Johnson] I understand he went to Guinea. 
  [Brown] And the rest of the ULIMO leadership, were they in 
Tubmanburg when the fighting started, and have you taken them 
prisoner? 
  [Johnson] They are in hiding. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Joint communique issued by the leaders of the Action </F>
Committee for Renewal and Togolese Union for Democracy on 26 
March in Lome, read by CAR vice chairman -- recorded] 
  [Text] A delegation from the steering committee of Action 
Committee for Renewal [CAR] official met with a delegation from 
the steering bureau of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] on 
26 March from 1500 to 1700. The two delegations agreed to 
review the prevailing situation in our country and to adopt an 
official position on questions that are of interest to them, 
with the aim of clarifying the statements which had led to 
divergent interpretations in the past. The two delegations hope 
that this initial joint communique will serve to clarify all the 
dark spots and dissipate once and for all the doubts that might 
still subsist in the minds of some people. 
  1. Concerning their relations, the CAR expresses regret for 
any positions it adopted that might have disturbed its partners 
in the UTD. The UTD, which took an active part in the 
democratic struggle, solemnly reaffirms its unequivocal 
adherence to the parliamentary majority. The CAR reaffirms its 
desire to treat the UTD as a full partner, without which there 
would be no parliamentary majority, and is determined not to 
undertake anything on issues of common interest without prior 
consultation. The UTD is determined to work in collaboration 
with CAR for the triumph of democratic ideals, in line with the 
wishes expressed by the people during the 6 and 20 February 
legislative elections. 
  2. Concerning the leadership of the institutions, the UTD 
confirms the terms of the 23 March letter, in which it affirmed 
that the management of the people's victory must be done by 
consensus, notably when there is a question of choosing 
government and parliamentary posts. The UTD reaffirms that it 
has no intention of vying for any of these posts without 
reaching a prior understanding and consensus agreement with the 
CAR. 
  Consequently the two sides agree to clarify those points 
which might have led to divergent interpretations: 
  A. The CAR has officially chosen the post of prime minister. 
The UTD rallies around this choice; 
  B. Concerning the name of the CAR activist who is to occupy 
this post, official consultations have been held today between 
the two parties, a name has been proposed, and the UTD sees no 
inconvenience about this and accepts this choice; 
  C. Concerning the other posts, the same delegation will 
continue with their consultations; 
  D. The two delegation have agreed to have more contacts in 
order to harmonize their viewpoints on a permanent basis in line 
with the wishes of the people; 
  E. The two delegations pledge to eschew their war of 
communiques, media, and press attacks, either directly or 
through the offices of a third party. 
  Issued, in Lome on 26 March. 
  Signed, for the CAR by Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor, and for the UTD 
by Mr. Edem Kodjo.

  [Text] The Federal Government this evening said that 
Nigeria's claim over the Bakassi peninsula is supported by the 
history of the founding of the area and the population 
settlement. In another statement signed by the chief press 
secretary to the head of state, Mr. David Attah, government said 
it finds it absolutely necessary to give more information on the 
border feud between Nigeria and the Cameroon in order to put the 
facts straight. 
  According to the statement, historically, the Efiks of 
Nigeria in Cross River state, who migrated from (Uwan), now in 
Akwa-Ibom state, while searching for better fishing grounds, 
discovered (Udombi), which the early Europeans to the area later 
renamed Bakassi Peninsula. More specifically, (Udombi) or 
Bakassi was founded in the late 16th Century on the authority of 
the king and chiefs of Old Calabar. It was then too that 
fishing settlements were established at Ekang, renamed Archibong 
in Abana and Atabong out of south (Udomhi). 
  The statement has it that the Efiks and (?Efuts) declared to 
the British Council in 1884 that their allegiance was to the 
kings and chiefs of Old Calabar, the only authority approved by 
them for entry into a treaty with the British Council. British 
acceptance of the legal authority of the king of Old Calabar of 
(Udombi) led to the treaties of 1985 [as heard], 1890, 1893, and 
1906 between the UK and Germany. The treaties preserved 
(Udombi) as part of Old Calabar. 
  The implication of the treaty is that Germany, which had 
authority over the then Cameroon agreed totally that (Udombi) 
people are Efiks and the territory Nigerian, not southern 
Cameroon. Even when southern Cameroon passed on to the UN 
trusteeship after World War II, it did not alter the legal 
status of (Udombi) as an integral part of Nigeria. The 
statement goes on to assert that when the present Western 
Cameroon was part of Nigeria, (Udombi) area was administered 
from Eket on the authority of the former Eastern Nigerian 
Government. 
  The statement expressed the Federal Government's disquiet 
when Cameroon let loose its gendarmes into Nigeria's fishing 
settlement in Bakassi to harass, plunder, and murder at will 
Nigerians. Nigeria continued to remain calm despite the 
provocations, and sought dialogue with Cameroon, using 
established diplomatic machinery. 
  Nigeria's efforts would have resulted in a meeting between 
President Paul Biya and General Sani Abacha in Maiduguri in the 
northeastern part of Nigeria which has border with Cameroon. 
Government explained that, unfortunately, before the planned 
meeting, the Government of the Cameroon took steps to 
externalize the conflict with French connivance. The statement 
stressed that Nigeria's policy of accommodation should not be 
construed to mean inability to maintain Nigeria's territorial 
integrity in the face of violation of our rightful borders on 
land, sea, and air.

  [Text] Lagos, March 26 (AFP) -- Prince Yormie Johnson, a 
former Liberian warlord currently living in Nigeria, who was 
rushed to a hospital here after collapsing, is "recovering 
well," a Liberian embassy official said Saturday [26 March]. 
  The prince, who fainted Friday, had "regained consciousness 
and he is recovering well," the unnamed diplomat said. 
  The comments were the first official confirmation of 
Johnson's health status. 
  The diplomat refused to disclose the identity of the 
hospital 
for security reasons. 
  Johnson, who has been living in Nigeria for more than a 
year, 
collapsed Friday morning while taking his children to school. 
  Sources at the hospital said his ailment was linked to high 
blood pressure problems. 
  The former rebel leader had earlier this month expressed his 
wish to return home to participate in the peace process to end 
Liberia's long-running and bloody civil war. 
  Johnson, 43, was the former leader of the rebel Independent 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), a breakaway faction 
of Charles Taylor's rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia. 
  Johnson's soldiers captured ex-Liberian head of state, 
Samuel 
Doe, in September 1990 and tortured him to death.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter de Ionno] </F>
  [Text] Disgruntled South African nuclear and rocket 
scientists are threatening to expose closely guarded secrets 
about the country's arms programme unless they are paid 
R[Rand]4.5-million in retrenchment benefits. 
  A spokesman claiming to represent 16 scientists admitted 
this 
week the threat amounted to blackmail. 
  "We want a settlement but negotiation has failed and we 
don't 
want to have to take this to the industrial court. Our 
disclosures will prove embarrassing for Armscor [Armaments 
Corporation of South Africa], Denel (an off-shoot of Armscor) 
and the Nationalist government," he warned. 
  The group has unreleased details about South Africa's past 
co-operation with Israel on missile technology. Some of this 
challenges claims by President F.W. de Klerk last year tLat he 
had come clean on the country's nuclear story. 
  The 16 scientists are preparing an appeal to the industrial 
court in which they are demanding two years' salaries and 
benefits from Denel. 
  They were retrenched with two months' notice from Advena, a 
Denel subsidiary, on April 15 last year. They claim they were 
promised another two year's work. 
  The spokesman, who asked not to be named at present, said 
their firsthand information would identify sources of 
specialised equipment for nuclear bombs in the United Kingdom, 
France and Germany. 
  He also claimed Israel supplied rock technology and details 
of a process which transformed a satellite launcher into a 
nuclear ballistic missile. 
  And in a move which could realise the arms industry's 
greatest fear -- nuclear weapons scientists selling secrets to 
rogue nations or terrorists -- the spokesman said the group 
would construct bombs for anyone, if their salaries were 
guaranteed. 
  When Mr de Klerk announced the destruction of South Africa's 
nuclear capability a year ago, he was adamant that no foreign 
help was used in the weapons' programme. But he made no mention 
of missile delivery capability. 
  Now the spokesman for the maverick scientists claims South 
Africa's defunct space programme was originally intended to use 
a clone of the Israeli Jericho II two-stage solid fuel missile 
to deliver nuclear weapons. 
  Two all-terrain mobile launchers were build and tested at 
Armscor's proving group at Advena in 1988 and 1989. They were 
never used. The missile, last codenamed RSA3, was only fired in 
static tests. 
  The spokesman said more than 200 South Africans visited 
Israel covertly and worked on the missile programme between 1989 
and 1992. 
  In a multi-million rand deal, Israel had sold South Africa a 
system of explosives that could stop the missile in mid-flight 
at a predetermined point, allowing it to fall on to a target 
city with an accuracy of less than one kilometre. 
  In October 1989, publicly expressed concerns by US 
officials, 
including President George Bush, about Israeli and South African 
collaboration on a medium-range nuclear missile were denied by 
both countries. 
  The spokesman said that after the initial 18-kiloton (18,000 
tons of TNT) "dirty" bombs were completed, development of more 
powerful nuclear weapons continued in secret at SADF [South 
African Defense Force] insistence until late 1989 when Mr de 
Klerk ordered that the programme be stopped. 
  These more powerful nuclear weapons included thermo-nuclear 
hydrogen bombs. 
  "What is the deterrent value of a 20-kiloton bomb when your 
enemy is threatening you with a 100-kiloton bomb?" the scientist 
asked. 
  The spokesman, who identified himself as a supporter of the 
right wing, said: "Some of us and many in the SADF [South 
African Defense Force] strongly believed that a couple of bombs 
should have been held back and kept in white hands." 
  The spokesman said: "I am not ashamed of what we did, but I 
cannot get a job. We are treated like outcasts. We are South 
Africa's nuclear casualties." 
  He had applied for 50 jobs and five of the rest of the group 
were unemployed. 
  The international implications of the scientists' threats 
are 
severe. Revealing suppliers would tarnish South Africa's 
credibility in the secrecy-obsessed international arms market 
and cause controversy in the countries involved. 
  The involvement of South African expertise in outlaw weapons 
programme would raise great international concern and possible 
conflict with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has 
overseen South Africa's nuclear rehabilitation. 
  A Denel spokesman confirmed yesterday that 16 employees were 
contesting termination of their service. Negotiations had 
failed because of their "unfounded and unreasonable claims and 
expectations". 
  Intimidation through the media left Denel disillussioned at 
the conduct of people "with high technology standing for whom 
Denel has only the highest regard and sympathy," the spokesman 
said.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 27 SAPA -- Any "disgruntled 
nuclear and rocket scientist", who disclosed information about 
South Africa's nuclear weapons programme, would be liable to 
charges under legislation preventing the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of 
South Africa] said in a statement on Sunday. 
  Armscor was responding to a Sunday newspaper report which 
said nuclear scientists in a salary dispute with Armscor had 
threatened to reveal as yet undisclosed information about South 
Africa's past cooperation with Israel. 
  The report said the 16 scientists charged that they had been 
promised two years' employment with local armament manufacturer 
Denel, but were retrenched with only two months' notice. 
  Reacting to these allegations, Armscor said the 16 former 
employees only had limited know-how of nuclear devices. Armscor 
reaffirmed there was no international cooperation on the 
development and manufacture of South Africa's nuclear devices. 
  The statement said Armscor also endorsed the principles of 
the international non-proliferations bodies on not disclosing 
information which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- Scores of Zulus -- 
many armed with traditional weapons -- began making their way to 
Johannesburg's Library Gardens on Monday morning in answer to a 
call by indunas [chiefs] to rally in support of King Goodwill 
Zwelithini. A group of mostly male marchers could be seen 
making their way down Commssioner Street. Pedestrians stayed 
clear of the marchers. 
  The rally follows a call made on Saturday by the Transvaal 
deputy chairman of Zulu indunas, Joseph Zulu, who appealed to 
Zulus to stay away from work on Monday and rally at the Library 
Gardens in support of King Goodwill. He said the rally was to 
express support for the Zulu king's demand for a sovereign 
kingdom in Natal and opposition to the interim constitution. 
  Mr Zulu said "Zulus" were also demanding President F. W. de 
Klerk reply to King Zwelithini's letter on the sovereignty 
issue. Also on Saturday, traditional leader Induna Sikhumbuzo 
Mabizela told a press conference in Johannesburg a meeting of 
indunas in the Transvaal had decided on the rally. It was 
scheduled for 9 AM on Monday. 
  Mr Mabizela said: "We support the claim of King Zwelithini 
to his land. We totally reject the constitution of F. W. de 
Klerk and his colleagues of Kempton Park. We will fight to the 
last atom of our stren?th if the king's demands are not met."

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program presented by Rodney Trudgeon] </F>
  [Text] [Trudgeon] Thousands of Soweto commuters were 
prevented from getting to Johannesburg this morning as roads 
leading out of this area were barricaded. We have on the line a 
resident from Soweto, Chris Mabuye. Good morning, Mr. Mabuye. 
What exactly was the problem? 
  [Mabuye] The streets are barricaded, you know, and exits 
towards the city. 
  [Trudgeon] All the exits? 
  [Mabuye] Most exits. I mean, we have got one, the Main Reef 
Road, which is from the Potchefstroom highway, which is 
completely sealed. People have to use the Eldorado 
Park-Kliptown road to come into town. 
  [Trudgeon] What are they barricaded with, Chris? 
  [Mabuye] Stones, cars, you know, wrecked cars that are 
broken, and all that. 
  [Trudgeon] What is the reason for this? 
  [Mabuye] The reason is the march for Zulus, marching today. 
  [Trudgeon] And have there been any signs of any tension or 
trouble or... 
  [Mabuye] Well, a lot of people have been injured. I believe 
there are two deaths already on the road. 
  [Trudgeon] How did that happen? 
  [Mabuye] One was shot, the other one was hit by a stone. 
  [Trudgeon] So are most commuters then trapped in Soweto at 
the moment? 
  [Mabuye] Yes. Some are not even able to come out. 
  [Trudgeon] Is there a police presence? 
  [Mabuye] Yes, they have just come in now. 
  [Trudgeon] And what is happing now as I am talking to you? 
  [Mabuye] The people are afraid because of the barricades. 
They cannot maneuver through the barricades. And another thing 
is that the Carlton Center, it's like almost what happened in 
Mafikeng. There's a lot of shooting there, and people are 
running for their lives. 
  [Trudgeon] Has this just happened this morning? 
  [Mabuye] This morning. 
  [Trudgeon] So it's a surprise to all the residents? 
  [Mabuye] Yes, and we have two buses from Alberton which were 
-- how do I put it -- were stoned, their windscreens were 
smashed out. 
  [Trudgeon] And you've no idea who is responsible for this? 
  [Mabuye] It's the youth, black youths that were running 
amok. 
  [Trudgeon] Thank you, Chris. That's Chris Mabuye, a resident 
of Soweto. And when contacted, the police confirmed that there 
were problems in the township, but that details were sketchy at 
this stage.

<F P=106> [Report by Lew Elias] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- At least four people 
were shot in central Johannesburg during a rally of Zulus 
marching through the city to demonstrate support for King 
Goodwill Zwelithini. A man was shot in the leg, allegedly by 
sniper fire, in Jeppe Street at about 8.15 AM as a group of 
between 10 and 15 marchers moved down the main CBD [central 
business district] thoroughfare in the rush-hour traffic. As 
the group was between Delvers and Von Weilligh Streets between 
eight and 10 shots rang out. Pedestrians on the pavenments fled 
into the nearest doorway or building entrance and within seconds 
of the shots being fired the normally busy street was deserted 
for the entire block. 
  One man was wounded in the leg and a motorist, Lawrence 
Mavundla -- a priest at the nearby St Mary's Cathedral, had a 
narrow escape as a bullet pierced the radiator of his car. 
  In Commissioner Street at least three people were wounded 
when a larger group of marchers travelled down the main street. 
Two women and a man were shot outside the Kine Centre as the 
marchers approached the giant office and cinema complex. A 
policeman at the scene said they were most probably shot by 
shopkeepers anxious about destrution of property and looting. 
Two of the wounded, a man and a woman -- both shot in the leg, 
managed to get to the Market Street entrance to the Smal Street 
mall -- a block away. The third, a middle-aged woman, was 
loaded into an ambulance in Commissioner Street with unknown 
injuries. 
  When another group of 400 marchers came down Commissioner 
Street about six heavy-calibre shots rang out at about 9.30 AM. 
As the group marched down the streets informal sector hawkers' 
kiosks were robbed. 
  In Jeppe Street, handfuls of traditional weapons -- heavy 
sticks, home-made spears and iron pipes -- were found near the 
scene of the shooting and handed to the police. The weapons 
were dropped after the burst of automatic gunfire which wounded 
one man. 
  People living in flats in Delvers Street around the scene of 
the shooting crowded on balconies to see what was happening as 
shop owners closed their doors to barricade themselves in. 
  Stores and banks in the Smal Street mall were being closed 
and evacuated in the wake of the early morning city unrest. A 
staff member at the branch of the Allied Bank in the mall, where 
a man was to have been treated for a gunshot wound, told SAPA: 
"If you want anything, ask head office -- I'm out of here. We 
have evacuated the place."

<F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program, presented by Patricia Glyn] </F>
  [Text] [Glyn] We have Barry Claassen on the line, reporting 
for Newsbrief from the Library Gardens in central Johannesburg. 
Barry, can you hear me? 
  [Claassen] I can hear you. 
  [Glyn] Barry, can you tell us, where were those shots coming 
from? It seemed to be unclear when you last spoke to us. 
  [Claassen] Well, it appears that there are snipers on the 
rooftops, shooting down into the crowds. The police are 
shooting back with what appear to be 9 mm pistols. I personally 
came across a man lying in the street. It looked as if he'd 
been shot in the head, blood pouring out of his head, and he 
wasn't moving. We've now heard an unconfirmed report of about 
15 people being shot. How many of those have been killed, I 
don't know, but as you might hear in the background, there's 
still sporadic gunfire being heard. At the moment it's very 
chaotic, with people crowding into shop doorways and trying to 
keep down. It's total, it's complete chaos here. 
  [Glyn] Are any of the snipers on top of the city council 
building? 
  [Claassen] Not that we can see. Some of the high buildings, 
but not the city council building at this stage, but anything is 
possible. You know, you can't always make out where the shots 
are coming from, but I did see snipers up on the buildings. Who 
they are, I'm not quite sure. 
  [Glyn] But the crowd is making no attempt to disperse? Do I 
understand that? 
  [Claassen] At the moment, not. I think they most probably 
might be too terrified to move away, so what they're doing is, 
they're lying down on the pavement. 
  [Glyn] Barry, I'm sure we'll hear from you again, but do 
take 
care of yourself.

  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- Police reinformements were 
being sent to Johannesburg to contain the violence and bring the 
siuation under control as a soon as possible, Law and Order 
Minister Hernus Kriel said on Monday. "In view of the extremely 
serious sitation in central Johannesburg the king of the Zulus 
must be urged to exercise his influence to calm and control his 
subjects," Mr Kriel said in a statement to SAPA in reaction to 
the eruption of violence around a Zulu march on the city centre. 
  "This volence illustrates how lack of control over 
supporters 
creates violence and that political intolerance and indiscipline 
have emerged as the single biggest threat to free and fair 
elections. Due to the seriousness of the situation I have 
requested the SA Police to urgently send reinforcements to 
contain the violence and bring the situiation under control," he 
added.

  [Text] At least 14 people have been killed and 50 injured 
during violent incidents linked to a march by thousands of Zulus 
in the Johannesburg city center. The police said the injuries 
ranged from gunshot wounds to serious hack- and stab wounds. 
  Reporters at the scene have described scenes of chaos, with 
several bodies lying in the streets. Police say thousands of 
people are still streaming into the city to join the march. The 
march is to protest against next month's elections, and to show 
support for a Zulu kingdom. 
  The marchers apparently plan to proceed towards the offices 
of the Independent Electoral Commission. Business in the CBD 
[central business district] has come to a complete halt, and the 
Johannesburg Traffic Department has advised motorists to avoid 
the city center. People in office blocks have been advised to 
remain inside the buildings. 
  We have just heard that the police have returned the fire of 
shots which were fired from rooftops in the city center a short 
while ago. Several people appear to have been hit by gunfire. 
  Another report says that at least five people were shot dead 
and eight wounded when Zulu marchers engaged ANC [African 
National Congress] security guards at the ANC's Shell House head 
office in Plein Street. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA 
[SOUTH AFRICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION] that there had been attempts 
by armed men to enter the building. He said security guards at 
Shell House had fired warning shots in the air, but were forced 
to open fire in self-defense.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- At least one Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] supporter was seriously wounded as what are 
believed to be sharp shooters opened fire on a march in support 
of the Zulu king in Jeppe Street, Johannesburg, on Monday. 
Eight to 10 shots rang out as a small group of marchers came 
down Jeppe Street about 8.15 on Monday. 
  One man lay sprawled on the pavement between Delvers and Von 
Weiligh Streets as police, firearms drawn, combed first floor 
balconies searching for the attackers. One of the shots hit the 
car of a priest working at St Mary's Anglican Cathedral nearby. 
  The priest, Lawrence Mavundla, said, "I just heard the 
shots, 
I heard my car get hit. I got out of it and ran, leaving the 
car in the middle of the street." 
  The car was abandoned for about 10 minutes before being 
removed by city officials. The radiator had been punctured.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] has rejected police suggestions that a sniper, 
apparently aiming at a Zulu march, was responsible for the early 
Monday Jeppe Street shooting. ANC Regional Office Deputy 
General Secretary Obed Bapela said that when the marchers got 
outside the organisation's offices they had stopped and begun 
hurling abuse at the ANC. They were also brandishing guns, Mr 
Bapela alleged. 
  As the ANC's security retreated "there was a burst of 
gunfire", in which one man was wounded. Mr Bapela said he did 
not know who the gunfire had come from. "We want to dismiss the 
police story that there was a sniper in this building." 
  The ANC had agreed to co-operate with police in allowing 
them 
to carry out ballistic tests on the security guards' weapons, he 
said. The ANC earlier telephoned SAPA to say its regional 
office was being "attacked". 
  Police told SAPA's reporter on the scene minutes after the 
shooting, however, it appeared as if the wounded man had been 
hit by a sniper who had been aiming at the marchers. 
  By 9.20 AM, with the bulk of the Zulu marchers still due to 
arrive at their kick-off venue at the Library Gardens, a state 
of near-hysteria seemed to hang over Johannesburg. 
  Security personnel hovered around with walkie-talkies, 
merchants gossiped in little groups in their shops, work 
apparently forgotten, and SAP [South African Police] officers 
patrolled four-abreast. The streets, for this time of the day, 
remain relatively deserted. 
  Mr Bapela said he and ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] General Secretary Tokyo Sexwale would be doing a 
helicopter fly past to "assess the situation".

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- At least five people 
were shot dead and eight wounded when Zulu marchers engaged 
African National Congress [ANC] security guards at 11.30 AM at 
the ANC's Shell House head office in Plein Street, Johannesburg 
on Monday. 
  When journalists arrived on the scene at least three of the 
wounded were being treated at the side of the road after the 
dead had been removed by police. A tense situation developed 
outside the building where members of the police's Internal 
Stability Division and SA [South African] Defence Force cordoned 
off the area. Initial reports said ANC guards shot dead at least 
five Zulu marchers and wounded eight as they tried to attack the 
ANC head office. 
  ANC Spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA there had been 
"attempts 
by armed men to enter the building". "There have also been 
reports of people shooting at the ANC headquarters from 
buildings across the road. Security guards at Shell House fired 
warning shots in the air but were forced to open fire in self 
defence," Mr Niehaus added.

  [Text] Durban March 28 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party's 
[IFP] Ed Tillett claimed on Monday that the African National 
Congress [ANC] had planted gunmen among Zulu marchers in 
Johannesburg to discredit Zulus in Transvaal. 
  Mr Tillett, an IFP spokesman, said: "We've just received 
information from intelligence sources that the ANC planted 
snipers in the crowd. There are deliberate plans to discredit 
Zulus in the Transvaal. The ANC will claim this is an IFP march 
and this will probably be an attempt to discredit the IFP as 
well." 
  He stressed it was not an IFP march but rather one organised 
by "indunas" [chiefs].

<F P=106> [Report by N. Lewis] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 27 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] has strongly condemned the torching of ANC Deputy 
Secretary-General Jacob Zuma's Northern Natal house at the 
weekend, saying the attack underlined the need for the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] and the government to act 
decisively to create free political activity in the province. 
Mr Zuma's house in Nxamalala, near Nkandla, was torched by 
unknown vandals on saturday soon after anti-ANC pamphlets were 
distributed in the area. 
  In its reaction on Sunday, the ANC charged the attack was 
the 
work of those consistently opposed to the peaceful transition 
towards democracy in South Africa. "The fact that anti-ANC 
pamphlets were distributed in the area prior to the attack -- 
and were the same malicious pamphlets distributed in kwaMashu, 
near Durban, before hostel dwellers attacked B-section last week 
-- indicates that the leaflets were aimed at creating a climate 
in which Mr Zuma's house would be torched," said ANC spokesman 
Ronnie Mamoepa. 
  "This latest attack underlines the urgency of the need of 
the 
TEC in conjunction with the government to act decisively to 
create a climate for free political activity in Natal and to 
ensure the success of the democratic process. 
  "We call on the law enforcement agencies to ensure the 
killers of our people in Natal and those responsible for the 
arson at Mr Zuma's house are brought to justice," Mr Mamoepa 
added.

<F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claasen] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town March 26 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] would impose peace and conditions conducive to 
free and fair elections on Natal, ANC Secretary General Cyril 
Ramaphosa, said on Saturday. He was the keynote speaker at a 
Western Cape regional reconstruction and development conference. 
"We know we are going to stamp freedom on Natal," he said. 
  "Yesterday the biggest march in the country's history stated 
clearly that the people of Natal are going to the polls, come 
rain, come shine and whether (Chief) Buthelezi likes it or not." 
  The march had brought a great deal of hope. "We are going to 
install a unique peace in Natal where our people can campaign 
securely. If (Chief) Buthelezi does not like it, we will impose 
it on him. We are the ANC -- We will call the shots in Natal as 
we call the shots in the whole country," Mr Ramaphosa said. 
  He said the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] was 
saying 
it was impossible to hold free and fair elections in Natal even 
before the election was held. "If the attitude of the kwaZulu 
government continues then it is not possible to hold free and 
fair elections there and the IEC will not be able to make such a 
declaration at the end." 
  This had propelled the ANC to put pressure on State 
President 
F W de Klerk to take steps. "We had talks with him but he 
ducked and dived out of taking action." The ANC would 
nevertheless impose peace there. 
  Mr Ramaphosa said the fact that the NP [National Party] had 
fielded totally discredited ministers to become `provincial 
premiers'showed it was not serious about transforming the 
country. 
  It had nominated Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel for the 
Western Cape, "while his whole department is deeply immersed in 
the murder of our people". 
  In the Eastern Cape it had nominated Dr. Tertius Delport 
whose long relationship with the right wing had almost led him 
to defect from the NP. In Natal it was Mr George Bartlett. 
"The NP has no commitment to non-racism or reconstruction in 
this country." The ANC would expose the tactics and racist 
slogans it was using. The ANC was daily gaining support for its 
Reconstruction and Development Program -- the most comprehensive 
document on socio- economic issues ever developed in the history 
of the country. "One of the central reasons for people being 
attracted is because they can see we have a plan to address the 
ills and evils that have been visited on our people by 
apartheid. The entire leadership is behind this programme and 
declaring it will be implemented whether FW (de Klerk) and the 
NP like it or not."

<F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claasen] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town March 27 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] will escalate its rolling mass action until it 
has attained its demand for free political activity in 
Natal/kwaZulu, ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said on 
Sunday. 
  Furthermore, he told a media briefing in Cape Town, the 
Natal 
issue would be taken up by the management committee of the 
Transitional Executive Council (TEC) on Monday. 
  He welcomed political initiatives which he said had been 
started with a meeting between President F W de Klerk and ANC 
President Nelson Mandela this week and which had continued with 
Mr de Klerk meeting kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
at the weekend. 
  Political initiatives, however, were not enough. Security 
forces had to be deployed to protect people from roving bands of 
armed killers, he urged. "As the ANC we will insist that 
security forces protect the lives of our people and guarantee 
that elections take place. The ANC has also embarked on rolling 
mass action to ensure that we get our demands for free political 
activity. This will escalate unless Chief Buthelezi and the 
government agree that our people will be given the political 
space, and agrees with the TEC to ensure free and fair elections 
are held." 
  He said all homeland governments would cease to exist on 
April 27 and that whoever was a chief minister or minister would 
lose his position on April 27 when the new constitution came 
into operation. "Chief Buthelezi will cease to be chief minister 
but what happens between now and then is a moot question. 
Clearly we expect the kwaZulu government to co-operate in 
holding free and fair elections." 
  The TEC would discuss the IEC's [Independent Electoral 
Council] report on the kwaZulu situation and would need to 
reflect on the position put forward.

<F P=106> [By Greg Arde'] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 27 SAPA -- While rampaging violence in 
Natal dominated South Africa's political talks at the weekend, 
more blood has continued to flow in the province with police 
reporting at least 12 deaths since Friday. 
  The African National Congress [ANC] and violence monitor 
Mary 
de Haas said there were unconfirmed reports of another 10 
killings throughout Natal, and in northern Natal particularly, 
where political fighting is said to be rife. 
  The kwaZulu police said four people were killed in separate 
incidents in homeland-administered areas at the weekend. 
  Ms Alice Mhlongo, 43, and Mr Mzokhona Daniel Mhlongo, 17, 
were attacked and shot dead at their home in Umbumbulu, south of 
Durban. 
  Ms Regina Mthembu, 38, also of Umbumbulu, was shot and 
killed 
by unknown assailants and Ms Thembi Khumalo, 36, of Esikhawini 
on Natal's north coast, was stabbed to death. A criminal motive 
is being investigated in all cases. 
  Police spokesman Maj Hamilton Ngidi said two people were 
killed in kwaMakutha, south of Durban, and two people were 
fatally shot in Ndwedwe, north of Durban. 
  In Bhambayi, also north of Durban, four people were 
murdered. 
  ANC northern Natal spokesman Zipho Mkhize said six people 
were believed to have been killed in Ntambanana, near Empangeni, 
since last week. 
  Ms de Haas said there were unconfirmed reports that three 
people had been murdered in Ensingweni, near Mtunzini, on 
Natal's north coast. 
  She said the situation in areas around nearby Eshowe were 
worsening with reports of a politically motivated murder in 
S'qwanjana on Friday. Women in the kwaMfana area were fleeing 
their homes at night and sleeping in the bushes after a number 
of homes had been attacked and set alight, she said. 
  On Sunday there were fears of a confrontation between IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters and ANC members after the 
network of independent monitors alleged that IFP members had 
occupied an ANC rally venue in Vryheid, northern Natal. 
  The ANC on Natal's south coast said it was worried about 
similar conflict linked to its rally, to be addressed by SA 
Communist Party stalwart Joe Slovo on Sunday. 
  Continuing violence in Natal was the subject of urgent talks 
between State President F W de Klerk and IFP leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi in Durban on Saturday. 
  There the leaders agreed to establish a mechanism to search 
for solutions to the problem of holding elections in kwaZulu- 
administered areas, and both pledged to try and reach agreements 
aimed at eliminating violence and the present tension in Natal. 
  While they met, about 10,000 ANC supporters marched through 
Pietermaritzburg to support their stated demand of free 
political activity in the province. On Friday, the ANC brought 
Durban to a standstill when 80,000 supporters demonstrated for 
the same reason. 
  The ANC has demanded the immediate deployment of South 
African troops and the National Peace Keeping Force (NPKF) in 
the region to ensure free political activity, and warned of 
"unprecedented" mass action if its demands were ignored. 
  Expressing its concern about the worsening situation in the 
province, the Natal church leaders' group on Friday said the SA 
Defence Force (SADF) should be deployed in violence flash points. 
  The Democratic Party (DP) said the situation was bad enough 
to warrant a postponement of the April elections. The initial 
weekend death toll has brought to over 120 the number killed in 
Natal since last Friday.

Fountain in Durban this morning for the march through the city 
center that got underway a short while ago. Our reporters on 
the scene say the atmosphere is peaceful but that police are 
maintaining a strong presence and the area had been cordoned 
off. Shops in central Durban have been closed since 10 AM [0800

purpose of the march is to call for free political activity, 
especially in areas under the administration of the kwaZulu 
government.

  [Text] At least four people have been killed and several 
others injured in violence apparently connected to the return of 
people from an ANC [African National Congress] march in Durban. 
Three people, two of whom were young children, were shot dead 
in the Bhambayi squatter camp near Durban yesterday, and several 
shacks were set alight. In Empangeni several people were 
injured in attacks on people returning from the march, and in 
Stanger an ANC supporter was stabbed after a march. The ANC has 
blamed the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] for the violence. 
  Meanwhile, the IFP has dismissed as a failure yesterday's 
ANC 
march through the Durban city center. The IFP accused the ANC 
of busing in Xhosas from the Transkei and the Eastern Cape, and 
said many of the protesters had been too young to vote. The ANC 
said the rally proved that tens of thousands of Zulus supported 
participation in the election.

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus, and Freedom </F>
Front spokesman General Tienie Groenewald, by SABC announcer 
Leslie Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program, date not given -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Good evening and welcome to Newsline. 
Tonight in our program we focus on the manifestos of the Freedom 
Front and the African National Congress [ANC]. Later on the two 
parties debate these manifestos. The question of a volkstaat 
[Afrikaner homeland] raised a lot of eyebrows when it was first 
mooted and it remains one of the most contentious issues to come 
to the fore in recent years. I am now being joined by the 
Freedom Front's General Tienie Groenewald and the ANC's Carl 
Niehaus. Good evening gentlemen and welcome. What is the real 
state of affairs? Are we going to have a volkstaat? Mr. Nelson 
Mandela proclaims that during his lifetime there will never be a 
volkstaat. What is the latest? 
  [Niehaus] Well, Leslie, the important issue is whether we 
are 
keen to address the concerns that everyone in this country has 
of different languages and different cultures. The ANC says we 
are. We are keen to try and work out a feasible and a workable 
plan on how to address these concerns. You know, this is not a 
new thing. We had said since 1955 that all the languages and 
all the cultures in this country must be able to grow and 
develop, but we also say there are practical ways of doing it 
and there are impractical approaches, and an impractical 
approach is to insist on a geographical area, a specific piece 
of land, and the reason why we say that is very simple, not 
because we try to deny anyone in this country their rights, 
their culture, their language, but because the reality is that 
nowhere in South Africa are the Afrikaners or that group of the 
Afrikaners who support a volkstaat, and they are a minority, 
even amongst Afrikaners, nowhere are they in the majority in any 
geographical area. And the citizens ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Okay, but ... 
  [Niehaus, continuing] Can I just conclude this, because it's 
crucial. The people who live in that area are in every area -- 
the majority are black people, and what I hear from the 
Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] is that those people will 
not be able to have full citizenship. They won't have voting 
rights. They will be in a position of second class citizens. 
That is unacceptable. The ANC had fought since 1912 for 
nonracialism, for an inclusive democracy which will grant rights 
to everyone. We cannot now come and grant rights to one group 
to the detriment, at the cost of the majority of our people. 
  [Mashokwe] Tienie Groenewald, the ANC's manifesto says the 
land belongs to all who live in it. In a way it is an inclusive 
document which seems to be addressing some of your concerns. 
  [Groenewald] You'd like my comment on the ANC's statement 
that the land belongs to everyone? Certainly, we do not deny 
that but in South Africa we have all three major causes for 
conflict. There are only three causes for conflict. The first, 
is disputes over territory, secondly, disputes over ethnicity or 
nationalism, and thirdly, disputes over religion or ideology. 
There is not one single unitary state in the whole world where 
these three causes of conflict are present in states that are 
democratic states. The only states where this occurred was 
where you had a dictatorship, such as the old Soviet Union and 
in Yugoslavia, and the moment you imposed a democracy these 
states fell apart, which proves one thing -- that when the 
causes of conflict are present, and the three causes of conflict 
are present in any particular state, then you must look at a 
different dispensation. Now in this respect what we've done in 
South Africa is -- we have been led by the ideological thinking 
and the constitutional thinking, mainly from the communist 
sphere of influence on the one side, and secondly, by American 
thinking as to what is good for South Africa. We never looked 
at the European examples, examples such as Switzerland, examples 
such as Belgium. Now if we take those examples we find that 
these were countries where you had the same causes for conflict, 
and they went for a constitutional dispensation in which power 
was basically brought down as close to the people as possible. 
Now this, this is where the basic difference is in the ANC's 
policies and our policies. Now coming back to the points that 
Mr. Niehaus made, now first of all, could I correct a few 
statements. He said first of all there is no such area in which 
there is a concentration of Afrikaners, in which the Afrikaners 
are the majority. In the discussions that we've had with the 
ANC, we have presented to them a scientific map in which there 
is an area of approximately 14 percent in which there is a 
majority of Afrikaners. Now this is the first point which I 
think is extremely important. 
  [Mashokwe] Where is this area? 
  [Groenewald] This area has Pretoria as the center, with a 
part of the eastern Transvaal, a part of the western Transvaal, 
and a part of the northern [Orange] Free State. Now let's come 
back to the second point. That second point was that in this 
volkstaat only Afrikaners will have the vote. Now let me say 
that this question is still being debated, and we are still 
negotiating with the ANC, and there is an accord which is 
presently being negotiated which specifically addresses this 
particular point, of voting rights within the volkstaat. That 
question has not been resolved yet. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Niehaus, you want to respond quickly? 
  [Niehaus] Well, first of all, the question of voting rights 
is not resolved because there is a continuation and an 
insistence from the Volksfront that they want to give special 
rights to what they call the Afrikaner group who they want to 
see as exclusively in control of that area, but secondly, 
nowhere in South Africa, I repeat again, is there an area where 
Afrikaners are in the majority. Of course you can go and take a 
small little area in Pretoria, where because of the Group Areas 
Act there may be a majority of whites living there, but that 
area is an integrated part of an economic system and Pretoria is 
integrated with Mamelodi, with Atteridgeville, and all the areas 
surrounding it. It's an impractical suggestion, except if Gen. 
Groenewald is saying that those areas such as Mamelodi and 
Atteridgeville should be used in the old racist and apartheid 
system, as satellites to the Pretoria area where they will be 
able to monopolize the economic power and make use of people who 
come in on the basis of migrant labor, moving in and out to work 
there and not being able to deal in the richness and in the 
economy of that area. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's get Gen. Groenewald to explain his position 
with regards to the areas -- the black areas around Pretoria for 
instance, because you mentioned Pretoria particularly. 
  [Groenewald] Now I can give you examples, in the United 
States for example ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let's look at Pretoria. 
  [Groenewald] Okay, but let me give you an example of what is 
acceptable in the rest of the world. In the United States they 
have demarcated certain constituencies, one in particular which 
is a hundred miles in length, and at one place a hundred yards 
wide, specifically to draw in an area in which the negroes have 
a majority so that they could have more negro seats in the 
senate. In Belgium they have drawn ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let's look at Pretoria. I am 
worried about time. 
  [Groenewald] Now what I'm saying is we should also look at 
how these problems are solved in the rest of the world, and we 
find in Belgium, in particular, the boundaries have been drawn 
very strictly along language lines. Now whether you draw the 
boundary in such a way that Pretoria is in the Volkstaat, and 
for example Mamelodi and Atteridgeville is outside, that does 
not really matter. What matters is what happens to the 
industrial areas, in the areas in which the wealth is created, 
in those areas where people work and where the jobs are, on 
which side of the border ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] It doesn't answer the question on 
what do you do with the people around there. Do they become 
part and parcel of the volkstaat, of the Pretoria volkstaat as 
it were, or are they migrant laborers as its was the case in the 
past? 
  [Groenewald] No, there's no reason whatsoever why they 
should 
be migrant laborers. 
  [Mashokwe] Dormitory townships? 
  [Groenewald] Yes, there is no reason whatsoever ... 
  [Mashokwe] What do they do? Do they then have their own 
little black volkstaat outside of Pretoria? 
  [Groenewald] If they want it. This is the advantage. If 
they want it. Now the point -- let me just explain this to you. 
We are not talking of a South Africa which is economically 
completely segregated. We are talking about an area in which 
economically we are still integrated as we are in South Africa 
today. There's no reason why we cannot do that. 
  [Mashokwe] Let me get Carl to respond and react quickly to 
this. 
  [Niehaus] Leslie, we are talking about a lappieskombers 
[patchwork quilt], as we say in Afrikaans -- little pieces of 
land torn apart, but the reality is this kind of proposal 
doesn't take into consideration that throughout South Africa, 
through all the different cultural groups, through all the 
language groups -- now no group that says as a majority they 
want a volkstaat. There is a small minority in the Volksfront 
who say they want a volkstaat, and the reality is that in this 
country there are political divides that cut across all the 
different language groups and all the different cultural groups. 
I'm sitting here tonight. I'm an Afrikaner. I don't want to be 
part of a volkstaat and the vast majority of the Afrikaners 
don't want to be part of a volkstaat, so the concept, as it was 
set out for some of the European nations, doesn't work for South 
Africa because in this country we have a South African nation 
where people, regardless of whether they are Afrikaners, Zulus, 
Xhosas, are identifying themselves with particular political 
ideals set out in the ANC, in the Volksfront, in the National 
Party, in the Democratic Party, all of those parties. 
  [Mashokwe] Could you respond quickly. 
  [Groenewald] That is what the negotiations with the ANC is 
about, to prove substantial support and by means of 
participating in the election, to also prove exactly where the 
boundaries of such a volkstaat should be. In other words, what 
I'm saying, is the whole question of support and the question of 
boundaries is a question which will be resolved in the election 
on the 27 April, so let's not argue about that now. We'll see 
what happens on the 27 April as far as substantial support is 
concerned. Let me also add that all the opinion polls, all the 
meetings we have had at this stage, proves beyond all doubt that 
70-80 percent of Afrikaners in South Africa want a volkstaat. 
  [Mashokwe] The one question that always bothers people is 
that who are the Afrikaners, who are the Boere and who are these 
people? That seems to be confusing the issue all the more 
Tienie. 
  [Groenewald] Yes, certainly, but in every nation, in any 
ethno-cultural group you have divergent views. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you Boer or are you Afrikaner? 
  [Groenewald] I'm an Afrikaner Boer and I can explain that to 
you, but I think the point is you took a statement made by Mr. 
Robert van Tonder. He is not a member of the Volksfront and he 
is not a member of our party. 
  [Mashokwe] But he is one of the Afrikaners, one of the 
Boere. 
  [Groenewald] Okay, he is one of the Boere. Now the point I'd 
like to make is, Carl considers himself an Afrikaner, as I 
certainly do, now the first point I'd like to make -- an 
Afrikaner knows whether he is an Afrikaner or not. There are 
two requirements. First of all you must classify yourself as 
something, and secondly, once you have classified yourself to a 
particular group then that group must also recognize you as part 
of that group. Those are the basic two criteria. 
  [Mashokwe] Thank you. Carl you were going to respond to Gen. 
Groenewald. 
  [Niehaus] Yes, it immediately links with what Gen. 
Groenewald 
is saying. Who is the Afrikaner? The Afrikaner is diverse. 
There is no center really of who the Afrikaner is. I am an 
Afrikaner, Gen. Groenewald is an Afrikaner, but the real issue 
is, is there anyone who tries to talk on behalf of the 
Afrikaner, who put themselves so to speak at the gate of 
Afrikanerdom, and is arrogant enough to say that they talk on 
behalf of Afrikaners? There I must take issue, because Gen. 
Groenewald and the Afrikaner Volksfront very often says that 
they are talking on behalf of the Afrikaner and I don't know on 
whose behalf they are talking. They are definitely not talking, 
and I repeat again, on behalf of the majority of Afrikaners. 
The Markinor survey of a few weeks ago said exactly the 
opposite of what Gen. Groenewald is saying about support for the 
volkstaat, in fact, it said that six out of every 10 supporters 
of the Afrikaner Volksfront is not prepared to leave their 
territory, to leave their land, and sacrifice anything for the 
sake of a volkstaat. So it's very weak support even amongst 
those groups who identify themselves. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay Carl, let me get Gen. Groenewald here to 
explain to me exactly what is going to happen then to the people 
who happen to be in those areas that are designated as the 
volkstaat. 
  [Groenewald] Let me say first of all that we don't expect 
anyone to leave any part of South Africa and to move to the 
volkstaat. The idea of a volkstaat ... 
  [Mashokwe interrupting] What about people who are in the 
volkstaat -- in the areas that you designate as a volkstaat? 
  [Groenewald] Exactly the same thing. We do not expect mass 
movements of people. This is not what the intention of the 
volkstaat is. What we are saying is that we'd like a center 
somewhere where we as a people can survive, where our culture 
can grow, where we have the political power to determine our own 
future. It's a matter of...[pauses] We have been talking about 
the volkstaat all the time, but the critical question is the one 
of self-determination. It's a matter of being in the position 
where you determine, as a people you determine your own future. 
Now this does not mean that in South Africa we are looking at 
mass movement of people. This is certainly not the intention. 
  [Niehaus] There are two questions: The first one is, if 
there 
is not going to be mass movement of people out of the volkstaat, 
will every person who lives in that volkstaat have exactly the 
same rights as every Afrikaner? Will they vote there? Will 
they be able, if they are the majority, when they have a 
political party, to take over the government of that area? 
That's the first question. And the second question, in addition 
to that is, are we actually saying to each other that it is 
possible to talk about self- determination without a 
geographical area, because the ANC says, we believe it is -- we 
believe we can address the center of concern that Gen. 
Groenewald is talking about without granting a particular 
independent geographical area, and that is, can I just 
emphasize, that is exactly the crux of the question that we have 
been debating and what that memorandum that Gen. Groenewald is 
referring to is trying to address. 
  [Groenewald] Let me answer that question quickly by saying 
no 
people has ever, in the history of mankind, survived without 
having their own geographic area. That is the first and a vital 
question, so geographic area is very much a part of the survival 
of any people. Secondly, as far as citizenship is concerned and 
as far as civil rights is concerned, and as far as voting rights 
is concerned, whatever system we eventually negotiate in the 
volkstaat will have to conform to international accepted 
standards. 
  [Mashokwe] So you will not discriminate against people who 
are not Afrikaners? 
  [Groenewald] No, no certainly not. 
  [Niehaus] So there will be the chance for the black majority 
in that area to take control and to rule that area together with 
a united South Africa. 
  [Groenewald] I'm not saying that. 
  [Niehaus] That's the crux of the question. 
  [Groenewald] No, that's not the crux of the question. The 
question is: We have a South Africa, and a South Africa which 
belongs to everyone, now what we are now saying is let us in 
this South Africa find a place for everyone of the different 
ethno- cultural groups. That's the first and vital question. 
So we don't want a situation ... 
  [Mashokwe] Is there such a place? 
  [Groenewald] Yes, there is such a place. I have indicated 
this to you, but you see what you've done is you have 
concentrated so far on the volkstaat, you've concentrated on the 
question of self-determination, but we should start looking at 
the alternatives. We should start looking at the ANC 
alternative, because what we have done so far is we have limited 
this discussion ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Okay. What problems do you have 
with that one? 
  [Groenewald] Okay, now let me tell you what the basic 
problem 
is, and this is the crux of the political problem in South 
Africa, is the fact that the ANC wants to concentrate all the 
power at the center so all political power must be at the 
center, and in the present constitution, and certainly according 
to the viewpoints of people like Mr. Joe Slovo, and people that 
we have negotiated with, that there is not single, not one 
single critical function that has been devolved to provinces or 
to the different states, not one. There is no exclusive powers 
whatsoever in the provinces. This basically means that because 
all the power is at the center, and as far away from the people 
as possible, this is an absolute requirement for the creation of 
a Marxist state or a socialist state where you have central 
planning. We say no. We want the power as close as possible to 
the people in the provinces. 
  [Mashokwe] Let me respond to that -- power to the people. 
Don't you believe in that? 
  [Niehaus] With respect, I don't agree at all with Gen. 
Groenewald that the African National Congress and the other 
negotiating parties have not taken great care and went to great 
lengths to try and accommodate the concerns of the Freedom 
Alliance. That is why we had another session of the negotiating 
council and why a number of powers were actually devolved to the 
regions, and Gen. Groenewald knows that those powers as they 
were set out at the last session of the negotiations council 
actually were exactly the powers that were negotiated and 
discussed with the Freedom Alliance, so that is not correct, but 
secondly, let us talk actually about economic policy because 
that is the crux of the matter. 
  [Groenewald] I think we must, we must first talk about this 
issue of exclusive powers, because a wrong statement was made by 
Mr. Niehaus and we must correct that statement. 
  [Mashokwe] Correct it now and we have to move on. 
  [Groenewald] Certainly, we'd like to move on. The point I'd 
like to make is -- the functions negotiated and passed on to 
provinces in the changes in the constitution were powers 
previously that presided with local authorities, like abattoirs, 
and it was now pulled up to the second level of government. 
  [Mashokwe] But are you not happy with that at least? 
  [Groenewald] Of course, because they are not exclusive, 
because there are at least seven provisions -- subjects -- so 
there is not one function that has been allocated to provinces. 
Secondly, all the functions of provinces can be changed by the 
central government without the authority of the provinces. 
  [Mashokwe] Is it not a fact Carl? 
  [Niehaus] Leslie, the fact is that those powers, including 
the powers of abattoirs were exactly the ones that were asked 
for by the Volksfront and especially that the leader of the 
Conservative Party, Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg, had asked for. The 
sad thing is that it seems that Dr. Hartzenberg and members of 
the Volksfront have not even known exactly what they were asking 
for, because once we gave it to them then they complained that 
they were not getting the powers that they wanted, and we gave 
them exactly what was discussed. 
  [Groenewald] That is not true. That's simply not true. 
  [Mashokwe] Gen. Groenewald, let's look at how you are going 
to address the issue of the disadvantaged people and the fact 
that we had a situation where the Afrikaners were poor and now 
they are the economic powerhouse of this country. Are you going 
to address that one? 
  [Groenewald] First of all, when we look at the volkstaat as 
such, or the proposed volkstaat, it only -- it provides for 
approximately 12 percent of the GNP of the whole of South 
Africa, so it's one of the poorer areas of South Africa. I 
think this is the first and the most important point. The 
second point I'd like to make is in the volkstaat we'll have an 
absolutely freemarket economy. You cannot always create wealth 
by taking away from the rich and giving to the poor. I think 
this is the first point. 
  [Mashokwe] But there was an important thing that happened in 
1929 when the Afrikaners were poor, there was a deliberate 
effort at empowering them economically. Are you going to do the 
same in addressing the demands and the wishes of the black 
majority in this country, or are you at all worried about that 
problem? 
  [Groenewald] No, of course we are. The important thing is 
that everyone has a responsibility towards the socioeconomic 
upliftment of those people who are less advantaged. This is a 
commitment which we all have. The question is how do you do it. 
Do you do it through a program by creating a socialist economy 
or do you do it by creating wealth through a freemarket system. 
Now our point is that if you employ a socialist sys?em there is 
no way in which you are going to get foreign investment. 
  [Mashokwe] You are not suggesting that the ANC is ... 
  [Groenewald] Of course they are. Of course they are. 
  [Niehaus] Well, that's surprising because the ANC is not 
having a socialist system. We say that we have an economic plan 
that must create jobs and we say that we work in an integrated 
and complex economy where those jobs must be created. You 
cannot do it in little pieces of land. It must be an integrated 
process of having the necessary public works programs, laying on 
electricity to all our people, building roads, running water, 
all of those issues. 
  [Mashokwe] But then how are you, Carl, how then are you 
going 
to have the state playing such an important role in creating all 
these jobs? 
  [Niehaus] Well, the state will play an important role in 
helping to direct this process together with the private sector. 
We are saying we will enter into a partnership where the state 
will help with the creation of a public works program, but we 
will also, together with the private sector, help with the 
creation of small business and that again is an issue which 
cannot be addressed in small areas. It must be a national 
approach, of course devolved through the nine provinces that we 
have, and the ANC says that as the Afrikaners in 1929 and 1948 
were trying to change around an unjust system, I agree, 
Afrikaners were disadvantaged, they were being discriminated 
against, so has the majority of people in this country got the 
right to change that system around but not through an unjust and 
divided economy. Through an integrated economy that will serve 
... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Okay, let's get into this point ... 
  [Niehaus] Just give me a chance. I think Gen. Groenewald has 
been receiving quite a lot of time. And the ANC says, yes, let 
us work together. Let us get also the expertise of the 
Afrikaners, and I think the Afrikaners have got a lot of 
important expertise to ensure that jobs are being created for 
all our people, but let us not isolate the Afrikaner and 
sideline them and put them in that area that only has 12 percent 
of the gross national product, and actually create a new 
situation where the Afrikaner will be impoverished by this plan 
of standing apart from the rest of South Africa. 
  [Mashokwe] Tienie? 
  [Groenewald] I can assure you one thing, that we will not be 
impoverished, but I think the important thing is, and this 
really is the Achilles heel of the ANC -- let's leave the 
economy to private enterprise and not to the state, because this 
is the basic, the real basic difference between the policy of 
the Freedom Front and the policy of the ANC. The policy of the 
ANC is centralizing everything -- political control, the 
economy, everything. The state must control every individual. 
What we say, the state has but one responsibility, one prime 
responsibility, and that is to see that the individual is not 
exploited and that the individual is safe. That's basically it. 
Let's leave the economy over to industrialists, to private 
enterprise. 
  [Mashokwe] But Gen. Groenewald, the Nationalist Party 
government took the bold step of addressing the Afrikaner 
problem. How are you then going to address the black problem 
this time of deprived people, disadvantaged people? Do you care 
for their vote? Should they vote for you? 
  [Groenewald] Let me say, first of all, as far as black 
people 
are concerned. Of course you have to create jobs, but so far 
experience throughout the world has proved one thing, and that 
is that socialism, state control of the economy has destroyed 
job opportunities and not created it. This is the experience of 
Africa. This is the experience of every Marxist state throughout 
the whole world. What we do find is those economies that have 
grown, that have relieved the problems of poverty amongst the 
people has been those states in which you have a private sector. 
  [Mashokwe] You are not answering my question on affirmative 
action General with due respect. 
  [Niehaus] But Leslie, with respect ... 
  [Groenewald] I beg your pardon? 
  [Mashokwe] You are not responding to my question on 
affirmative action. 
  [Niehaus] But can I just come in quickly, because Gen. 
Groenewald ... 
  [Mashokwe] But let him respond to that one. 
  [Niehaus] I think he can respond but he keeps on harping on 
socialism. The ANC is not presenting a socialist program. We 
are presenting a plan where the private sector, the different 
trade unions, all the people of this country, all the different 
economic interest groups have worked together in the national 
economic forum and also in the plan that we have developed in 
the Reconstruction and Development Program. 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let me get Gen. Groenewald to 
respond first to my question. Thank you, Carl. 
  [Groenewald] To the whole question of affirmative action? 
  [Mashokwe] Yes, what are you going to do on that one? 
  [Groenewald] Let me say that we have been busy with 
affirmative action for a very long time. Let me give you an 
example. From 1970 -- from 1970 until 1990 there has been a 
real increase in black wages of 70 percent. 
  [Mashokwe] We are talking about the Freedom Front please. 
  [Groenewald] No I'm just indicating to you that we have been 
busy with a whole program of affirmative action for the last 20 
years. There has been enormous changes. Now affirmative action 
is something which should be related first of all to your 
productive capacity -- the creation of wealth in the country 
through private enterprise, and jobs being created, certainly, 
by private enterprise and not by the state. Now this is the 
first and important question, so it's a very delicate measure of 
having a system of taxation ... 
  [Mashokwe] Let me hold you right there. Carl Niehaus, 
respond quickly. 
  [Groenewald] Let me just complete it. Let me just complete 
my point. 
  [Mashokwe] Let him respond. 
  [Niehaus] Well, you interrupted me so now can I proceed. 
  [Mashokwe] Please continue. We'll come back to you. 
  [Niehaus] General Groenewald knows very well that no 
economy that is successful in Western Europe and in the United 
States is only, simply a private enterprise. It is a 
combination of state and private enterprise, and the ANC says, 
let us first of all acknowledge that there was an unjust system 
in this country and that system needs to be turned around and 
the state, together with private enterprise has got a role to do 
it. And with respect Gen. Groenewald, the National Party who 
you seem to refer to as having implemented some kind of program 
of affirmative action in the past, has not done so. If we look 
at the World Bank's economic index, the one category where South 
Africa comes first is on the category of the most divided 
society and the most unequal society in the world. That has to 
be addressed ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Let him respond quickly Carl. 
  [Groenewald] Look, I'm not arguing about that. We are 
talking about the future, first of all, and the point that I 
wanted to make is that in your system of taxation, which is the 
base and which will be the base of the ANC's program of 
affirmative action, it's a matter of a delicate balance, whereby 
you can have enough funds available for investment through 
private enterprise and enough funds available for so-called 
affirmative action. 
  [Mashokwe] Carl, you were still explaining one thing or the 
other with regard to the economic policies. Yes, the hand of 
the state seems to be very strong. To what extent would you 
then say the private sector is able to maneuver and create jobs? 
  [Niehaus] Well, the private sector will be able to maneuver 
and create jobs very well. If you look at our plan we say there 
are certain sectors where obviously the private sector will have 
a real problem in providing for all the needs like the provision 
of electricity, but we say let us work together, for example, on 
the building of houses in a combination with the private sector. 
The state will help through a public works program, through 
providing some resources and so will we expect from the private 
sector to do so, and Gen. Groenewald agreed with me, although he 
initially just spoke about free enterprise, that in no state 
that is truly successful there is only free enterprise. 
  There is always this combination and those countries like 
Chile during the last few years that have been truly successful 
have worked out a plan, and it is a comprehensive plan that 
includes the whole geographical area. It can't be a plan that 
is divided by the kind of volkstaat concept that Gen. Groenewald 
has. That is the plan for poverty and that is a plan for 
division and eventually for a total destruction of the South 
African nation. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, let me get Gen. Groenewald here. I asked 
you earlier whether you want black votes. 
  [Groenewald] At this stage our intention is to get a 
volkstaat, but certainly, everyone, everyone who cherishes the 
question of self-determination, will find in the Freedom Front a 
party that will do everything in their power to achieve a 
constitutional dispensation in South Africa where 
self-determination plays a central role. 
  [Mashokwe] Do you want black votes? 
  [Groenewald] We are not going out of our way to specifically 
look for black votes. 
  [Mashokwe] So you are racist. 
  [Groenewald] No, please don't say that. It's not a question 
of racism. It's a question that we are looking at the self- 
determination, first of all, of the Afrikaner people. That's 
what it's all about, and this has got nothing to do with racism. 
Let's be quite clear about that. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, Carl. 
  [Niehaus] Leslie, at a time when we are in South Africa's 
history where the injustices of the past must be put right, 
where the people who have been oppressed must be helped to 
become part of a full South African nation, Gen. Groenewald is 
saying: We are not interested in black votes. We are simply 
there to continue to help to promote those who have been 
privileged in the past. That is, he said the Achilles heel -- 
in the past he used that concept -- that is the Achilles heel of 
the Volksfront, and unfortunately this whole evening Gen. 
Groenewald has been beating around the bush and I must really 
thank you for having put your finger on the real issue. Behind 
all the nice talk, the Volksfront still has the festering sore 
of racism and the Afrikaner cannot afford that. The Afrikaners 
cannot allow ourselves to be pulled into that situation. The 
Afrikaner can only survive, Leslie, in a united South Africa. 
The Afrikaner is strong enough to do so without geographical 
areas. We've got a good language. We've got a good culture. 
  [Mashokwe] General. 
  [Groenewald] Okay, let me emphasize this once and for all. 
South Africa is looking at a constitutional dispensation in 
which we will have peace. We have many examples in the world, 
examples such as Switzerland, which went through a period of 
enormous friction and violence until they resolved a situation 
in which you have good neighbors working together as a group. 
We are not racist. What we are saying is that let's move power 
away from the center and let's realize that in South Africa we 
have different ethno-cultural groups who must take hands across 
the table, who must take hands across the table and find a way 
in which they can live together in such a way they do not 
destroy each other. 
  [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, your concluding statements 
  [Niehaus] Well, Leslie, racism is evil. It must be rejected. 
In whatever form it comes, even in a Afrikaner Volksfront form. 
What we need in South Africa is an economic plan. A plan for 
justice, a plan to give free education for the first 10 years to 
our children, to provide proper health care. That can only be 
done in a united, nonracial South Africa. The only organization 
that has such a plan is the ANC and that we will promote. 
  [Mashokwe] Thank you, your last statements. 
  [Groenewald] Let me say the solution in South Africa is not 
imposing a system that has never worked in the Soviet Union or 
in other socialist countries. Let us look at a system in which 
we have a new and modern approach -- approach where everyone can 
have his own dignity and his own place under the sun, and this 
is what the Freedom Front proposes. 
  [Mashokwe] On that note, Gen. Groenewald, Carl Niehaus, 
thanks for joining us on Newsline. Goodnight.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  SUNDAY TIMES </H5>
  Economic Justice -- "In South African political mythology, 
economic justice is viewed as a matter of taking money from rich 
whites and giving it to poor blacks. This perception, crude as 
it is, underpins not only political rhetoric, but the policies 
and perceptions of the ANC [African National Congress]," an 
editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 27 March on 
page 28 notes. A second myth postulates "a massive shift of 
wealth in the past two decades from white to black," in effect 
"the policy which the ANC plans to pursue is already, to some 
decree, working." What has happened is a "massive shift of 
wealth from the poorest class of whites to the richest classes 
of balcks," in other words among "white and black, the rich are 
getting richer (or, among whites, at least hanging on ti their 
wealth)." "Unless the ANC adopts appropraite policies -- which 
means, simply, policies that will lift people out of poverty by 
placing them in stable employment -- we may subside towards the 
conditions of Zaire." "Class divisions, not racial dicisions, 
are likely to be the critical issues as rich blacks get richer 
and poor whites poorer." 
<H5>  SUNDAY NATION </H5>
  Natal Marchers -- "We know at least about 60,000 brave Zulus 
who believe that King Goodwill Zwelithini's idea of boycotting 
the April 27 elections and establishing a sovereign kingdom is 
not at all a bright idea," an editorial in the Johannesburg 
SUNDAY NATION in English on 27 March on page 6 notes. "We want 
to believe that the marchers are just the beginning of an even 
larger Zulu community" which "will use its might to show the 
world that it is not going to be a sacrificial lamb to save 
Buthelezi's selfish political ambition." "This is the time for 
all democrats to test their claimed popularity at the polls in a 
fair manner. Ths process should take place on April 27. 
Natal-kwaZulu should not be an exception to this rule." 
  De Klerk and the Generals -- "Open defiance of the state's 
political authority by police generals implicated in third force 
violence is worrying in the extreme," the second editorial in 
the SUNDAY NATION on 27 March notes. "While on one level it 
demonstrates the decree to which the police have become 
politicised, at another it reflects the extent to which they 
refuse to be held accountable for their actions." Weakness in 
the presidency and Law and Order Ministry derive from "the fact 
that over the years of NP [National Party] rule" the police 
"developed into an authority into itself, bent on protecting 
party political interests rather than society" and becasue 
"South Africa has no history of ministerial accountability." 
"Accountability must be forced on De Klerk, Kriel and their 
generals by the masses who have had to bear the pain of the 
government's distain for black human life." 
<H5>  BEELD </H5>
  Zulu King Raising Temperatures in Natal -- The Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans of 22 March points out in a page 14 
editorial: "King Goodwill Zwelithini has driven the political 
pressure in Natal higher with his announcement on Friday 
regarding the restoration of the Zulu kingdom -- not because he 
is fighting for the maintenance of the Zulu kingdom, but because 
he is holding out to his subjects the threat of protest against 
the election as a means of achieving his goal. There must be 
millions of Zulus in Natal who pledge loyalty to their king, but 
who want to vote and want the election to take place. Where 
will his call leave them? King Goodwill and his great advisor, 
Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, have the fullest right to fight for 
the preservation of the Zulu culture and traditions. But they 
have no right to deny other Natalians and Zulu subjects and the 
rest of South Africa the right to exercise their democratic 
right. The king, Mr. Buthelezi, and the rest of South Africa who 
are watching kwaZulu-Natal with bated breath, must know that 
the ANC will not accept the king's call for an election boycott 
lying down. Indeed, they are already making plans for mass 
action and other disruptive activities." "In kwaZulu-Natal the 
result will be much bloodier and messier that in Bophuthatswana, 
but the outcome will be the same," and "the party to benefit 
most will be the ANC." 
  Vote for All Prisoners A Mistake -- "The unrest in prisons 
in which prisoners demonstrated in support of participation in 
the election by all criminals behind bars can be seen as the 
fruits of an unfortunate compromise," says an editorial on page 
8 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 23 March. "What 
those who support the vote for criminals forget is that 
imprisonment is imposed with the aim of totally removing the 
offender from society for a period. During that time his rights 
as a member of society are withdrawn; it includes the right to 
participate in political activities. The argument being raised 
by the ANC, that it is unjust to prevent some prisoners from 
exercising their most basic right -- the vote -- does not hold 
water. The right to vote is not the most basic right; that 
right is the right to life, and it is that right which the 
majority of the criminals sentenced to death denied to others." 
"The granting of the vote to all imprisoned criminals merely 
compounds what is already an awful mistake." 
  Caution Needed Over Police Generals -- A second editorial on 
the same page notes: "We would Nike to believe that State 
President F.W. de Klerk, when he ordered three of the country's 
top generals to take compulsory leave following the release of 
the Goldstone report, did not act without very good reason. The 
allegations against the generals are very serious, but it is 
precisely for that reason that we have an uneasy feeling about 
the course of events during the investigation by Justice 
Goldstone." "A very important principle in law is that every 
person must be given the opportunity to fully state his side of 
the case, which was apparently not done here. In addition the 
generals were not provided with legal assistance and they were 
not given the opportunity to cross-examine the people who 
presented evidence against them. So we ask: go steady with wild 
accusations and allegations. Hold a full investigation in which 
the law is properly applied, before crucifying people." 
  Culture of Lawlessness Being Created -- A third editorial 
points out: "One of the most deplorable statements heard in the 
election campaign comes from Mr. George Biya, president of the 
Azanian Youth Organziation. Mr. Biya praised the looters who 
stole goods during the uprising in Bophuthatswana. His 
justification for this is: `No white man arrived from Europe 
with a refrigerator or a bed. On the contrary, our people only 
took what was theirs, and no apology is made.' Should one wish 
to sink to the same level as Mr. Biya, one could point out that 
it is precisely because of this kind of mentality by too many 
too often in Africa that the continent finds itself in the state 
it is." "Black entrepreneurs and the general public are daily 
victims of looting in its various forms, encouraged by people 
like Mr. Biya who are helping to create a culture of 
lawlessness. Real leaders will have to take note that South 
Africans of all colors are sick and tired of any form of 
hooliganism."

  [Text] New York, 25 Mar (INA) -- Iraq has called on the 
United Nations to implement Security Council Resolution 778 
requiring all countries that hold deposits representing proceeds 
from Iraqi oil sales or products, paid in or after August, 1990, 
to transfer these funds from the suspended guarantee account 
[hisab al-daman al-mu'allaq] as laid out in Resolutions 706 and 
712. 
  This came in a letter from Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The letter emphasized the need to observe the general rules 
requiring that Iraqi money deposited in the suspended account be 
invested efficiently and that the proceeds be added to the 
principal. 
  Following is the text of the letter: 
  Your Excellency Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
  UN Secretary General, 
  New York 
  Regarding UN Security Council Resolution 778 of 1992, I 
would 
like to point out the following: 
  1. Paragraph 1 of the said resolution decided that all the 
countries that hold deposits of money for the Iraqi Government 
which represent proceeds of Iraqi oil sales or oil products, 
paid in or after August 1990, must transfer the funds as early 
as possible to the suspended guarantee account, as laid out in 
Resolution 706 and 712 of 1991. 
  Inasmuch as the money put into the Iraqi deposit accounts 
cannot legally come under this heading, since, although it 
represents the proceeds of oil sales, having become part of the 
account it loses this capacity. The money thus becomes Iraqi 
deposits, in view of the fact that the source of the debt 
changed from a sales contract to a bank deposit. Consequently, 
the money does not represent oil sales as stated in the 
resolution. 
  The argument stated above supports Paragraph 2 of the same 
Security Council resolution referring to the proceeds from oil 
sales before they are added to any account. This means the sale 
price must go into the suspended credit account. 
  2. According to banking transaction rules, a suspended 
account owner, in our case the Iraqi Government, does not lose 
it. Accordingly, as the legal proprietor of the account, the 
Iraqi Government's opinion must be taken into consideration in 
all that affects the account. 
  3. It must also be taken into account that the general rules 
require funds deposited in the suspended account to be invested 
efficiently and their proceeds added to the principal. 
  From the above, it is obvious that the provisions of the 
said 
Security Council resolution are illegal; indeed, they flout 
established banking norms that form the foundations of 
international trade. 
  Kindly distribute this letter as a document of the Security 
Council. Regards.

<F P=106> [Report on Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf's </F>
statement on Iraqi Television on 15 March: "Al-Sahhaf: 
Resolution 706 Contains Traps and Snares To Shackle Iraq and To 
Continue Imposing the Blockade; There Is a Treacherous Game in 
Applying the Resolutions Aimed At Avoiding Fulfillment of 
Obligations"] 
  [Text] Iraqi Television last night carried an interview 
with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf in which he 
reviewed the provisions of the resolutions which were issued by 
the UN Security Council, Iraq's position on them, and the lack 
of any justifications for these resolutions now that Iraq has 
fulfilled its obligations. 
  The minister remarked that this subject needs to be 
explained 
and clarified in detail in view of the conspiracies and intrigue 
which the enemies of Iraq and Arabdom have woven around it. 
  The minister said: Let me begin by pointing out very briefly 
that Resolution (687) was passed on 3 April 1991 after being 
submitted by the henchmen of the imperialist powers. There were 
16 drafts before the resolution was finally put to a vote. Some 
12 member states voted for the resolution. Cuba, which was 
daring and courageous, voted against it. Two other 
non-permanent member states; Ecuador and Yemen, abstained. Some 
member states, such as China and others, gave their vote for the 
resolution, but they also explained their position on it and 
contested some of its provisions. 
  The minister added: The resolution has a preamble and 34 
operative paragraphs. It is a long, complicated resolution and 
its operative paragraphs are purposely divided into 9 sections, 
of which Section (C) is the axis. The leader president had 
dealt with this section in his [13 March] speech. The 
resolution was passed on 3 April, and on 6 April Iraq nofied the 
Security Council of its frank and clear position on it in a 
long, precise message based on the principles of international 
law and the UN Charter. Iraq dealt with all those paragraphs, 
explaining how they conflicted with the principles of 
international law. Iraq concluded its message -- and it is 
important that I mention this -- by citing the words of its then 
Foreign Minister Professor Ahmad Husayn: "While recording these 
principled, legal, and legitimate observations, Iraq appeals to 
men of free conscience among the members of the international 
community and world public opinion to understand the truth as it 
is and to support justice as they should. Iraq has found itself 
faced with one choice only, which is to accept this resolution." 
We then requested that our message be distributed as a document 
of the Security Council, and this was done. 
  The minister added: The purpose was to establish our legal 
and legitimate position which was based on the UN Charter and 
the principles of international law so that our rights would not 
be lost even if we had to accept the resolution under the 
existing circumstances. 
  Al-Sahhaf said: The second remark I would like to make -- 
and this is very important also -- is that on line three of its 
preamble, Resolution (687) affirms the member states' commitment 
to defending Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
political independence. But no sooner had they mentioned this 
sentence than they went about violating it in several paragraphs 
of the same resolution. Several paragraphs conflict with this 
basic principle on which international society is founded. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf pointed out that he had to make 
this 
remark so people will fully comprehend the unfair general 
blockade which is being imposed on Iraq. The minister said: 
Resolution (661), which was issued on 6 August 1990, explained 
why the unjust blockade was imposed. It was imposed because 
Iraq did not approve Resolution (660) which was issued on 2 
August 1990. What does Resolution (660) say? Resolution (660) 
has two paragraphs providing for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, 
calling on Iraq and Kuwait to sit together to solve their 
problems, and noting that the Security Council welcomed all 
efforts being exerted, including those of the Arab League, to 
achieve this aim. 
  The minister said: Later, Iraq approved all the resolutions; 
namely, 660, 661, and so forth. Still, the Security Council did 
not fulfill its obligations. So they came and drafted this 
resolution [687], thus "swallowing up" all their previous 
resolutions on the one hand, and producing new conditions and a 
new situation which only exposes the real aims of the whole 
aggression against Iraq. 
  The minister added: Everyone in our society must know how 
matters were twisted at every stage and the purpose behind doing 
so. Resolution (687) has 34 operative paragraphs. The preamble 
refers to Iraq's political independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity only as a formality. The preamble also 
includes certain principles which were carefully selected by 
those who drafted the resolution in order to serve as a 
background and a basis for the operative paragraphs which, in 
themselves, are a gross violation of international law and the 
UN Charter in particular. 
  The minister said: The key point of Resolution (687), to 
which the leader president referred in his speech, is Section 
(C). This section includes Paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 
13). Paragraph (14) is an explanation saying if Paragraphs 7-13 
are applied successfully to Iraq, it would the beginning of 
their application to the entire Middle East to turn it into a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They have not yet 
done anything on this score. 
  The minister said: Regarding Section (C), which includes the 
paragraphs I just mentioned, they said: We know that you Iraqis 
have weapons of mass destruction. These weapons exist in the 
following fields: the nuclear field, the chemical field, the 
biological field, and the delivery systems field; that is 
missiles. They also said: We have Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
12, and 13 to apply and we will set up a UN Special Commission 
for that. There is also the International Agency for Atomic 
Energy, which specializes in these matters. The Special 
Commission and the agency have been instructed to work out a 
plan with you. You will tell them the weapons and missiles you 
have. Teams from the Special Commission and the agency will 
come to inspect them, and the existing arsenal will be 
destroyed. We will inspect the sites where you manufactured and 
installed the machines and plants which produce these weapons. 
We will remove parts of these machines so that they would no 
longer be able to produce chemical weapons or missiles with a 
range of more than 150 km. 
  The minister added: They wanted us to reveal all that we had 
and to destroy it. They wanted us to destroy the weapons, which 
were banned under the provisions of this resolution, and also 
the machines and factories connected with their production. 
Once these steps were taken, Iraq would have nothing left and 
would be in no position to produce anything. 
  The minister said: They said: But in order to make sure that 
you Iraqis -- and we know you are a clever and dynamic people -- 
will not go back to producing these weapons, we will set up a 
future monitoring system. They mentioned in Section (C) of 
Resolution (687) that the monitoring system would last for one 
year. 
  The minister said: Since they accepted the resolution, one 
would presume that based their acceptance on the principles of 
law, international relations, and the UN Charter, meaning, 
first, that whatever they requested under Section (C) would not 
prejudice Iraq's national sovereignty and independence, its 
ability for development, and its right to self-determination, 
which are basic for any society and country. We presumed that 
our dealing began on the basis of the provisions and principles 
I mentioned. 
  The minister added: We have been following Section (C) since 
the cease-fire in 1991. The leader president said: Tell us 
what you want so we can sit together, discuss it, and destroy 
some machines and plants to make them unserviceable. And in 
order to reassure everyone we will also set up a monitoring 
system. This has been going on since 1991. We did more than we 
promised. For the sake of precision and to prove to our people, 
I will mention some of the documents which we deposited with the 
United Nations and which are now considered documents of the 
Security Council. They asked us to begin with the nuclear field 
first, and we did. They said we want Iraq to announce its 
commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty, we said: Fine, we 
have the following: six letters which were sent by the foreign 
minister containing Iraq's adherence to the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 16 messages and statements 
confirming that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons and that 
it does not produce these weapons or any substance that goes 
into their production, 62 letters containing Iraqi declarations 
on nuclear positions, and 23 nuclear teams. Then they said: 
Tell us about the components of the Iraqi nuclear program. We 
told them what we had: 547 tonnes of natural uranium [yuraniyum 
tabi'i] and 50 kgs of highly enriched fuel. They took them and 
transported them outside Iraq. We said also that we had 1,850 
kgs of a fairly enriched uranium, 6 kgs of plutonium for 
scientific research, and 6 tonnes of uranium waste. That was 
all. 
  They carried out a thorough inspection. Then, they said: 
We want to know the stages of your nuclear program. So, we 
told them that our stages are as follows: Extraction of uranium 
from ore and its transformation into uranium compounds. We have 
electromagnetics, chemicals, and central [word indistinct]. All 
this is for research. We also process fuels. This framework, 
as you can see, is very normal. We have nuclear reactors we 
bought from you. We have an electro-nuclear power project, 
plants to retrieve depleted (wasted) nuclear fuel, and a plant 
for the treatment of radioactive waste. We have scientific 
research efforts that are connected to the program. Our 
position is the same as that of any other nation or state that 
is conducting research. It is all scientific research for use 
in medicine and agriculture, as part of the development 
programs. Finally, we have agricultural and medical 
applications, to which we have already referred. Of course, we 
have a nuclear safety system, nuclear safety measures, and the 
engineering support for them. 
  The minister said: They saw and thoroughly inspected what we 
had. Talks with [UN chief inspector] Ekeus began in July 1993. 
They continued in September, October, and November of that year, 
and in New York, as well. In his capacity as the representative 
of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, he wrote -- we 
have the document because it is a now Security Council document 
-- saying: There are no more secrets in the Iraqi program. Iraq 
has approved Resolution 715 concerning permanent monitoring. We 
believe Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations. 
  The minister said: Regarding the chemical field, we followed 
the same line. We told them what we have. I will mention some 
figures, because we have them in our records and they are also 
documented with the Security Council. 
  The minister continued: Some 12 large chemical inspection 
teams came, under Paragraph 9 of Section C, to see the records, 
visit the sites, and obtain samples. We detailed our stockpile: 
10,780 pieces of missile hardware ['atad sawarikh] for 122-mm 
missiles, 1,776 shells [qanbarah], 12,634 artillery shells, 30 
al-Husayn missile warheads and 2,000 mortar shells. We said you 
can visit the sites where this hardware is produced, and the 
development laboratories, as well. They inspected them. Then 
they asked: Where are the simple materials [al-mawad 
al-basitah]? We told them that the stockpile of active 
materials [al-mawad al-'awamil] is 280 tonnes, and the simple 
materials stockpile is 75 tonnes. They asked to see the 
canisters. We told them here are 45,000 canisters for 122-mm 
missiles and 5,000 shells for 250-mm missiles, and here are the 
24,000 that were destroyed in the bombing. They were all 
destroyed in the bombing. They saw it all, including the scrap 
metal. Then, they began inspecting. Later, they said: We want 
to see the documents. 
  The minister added: We gave them the nuclear documents, 
which totaled more than 60,000 pages. Then they asked for the 
documents on chemical weapons. We told them they were destroyed 
in the bombing. Then they told us: We want you to remember 
everything and write it down on paper. Iraqi experts exerted 
great efforts and wrote down everything in order to eliminate 
any excuse. Ekeus wrote on a piece of paper: I find this to be 
satisfactory, meeting all requirements. Ekeus then heard the 
statements by the official in charge of the Iraqi and Gulf 
Section in the U.S. State Department and by the U.S. National 
Security Council adviser. He became suspicious after hearing 
these statements, although we had a signed document between us 
in which he said that what he saw was satisfactory and met all 
requirements. 
  When he heard those people speaking in this way, he decided 
that he wanted more information and that what we had given him 
was not enough. Some 12 large chemical teams came. They left 
nothing unearthed. They analyzed water and soil. They carried 
out air inspections. They were very provocative, but the Iraqis 
restrained themselves and remained very patient. The behavior 
of the others was really bad and provocative. 
  The minister said: Iraq did not have anything in the 
biological field. Actually, what we had was just scientific 
research. We did not have any secrets. The so-called 
reinforced microbes [mikrubat mujahhadah] were purchased from 
the United States for purely scientific research, not for 
biochemical weapons. Several experts came and saw them. Then 
they said: We want to see the laboratories, even in those in 
Iraqi universities. They also asked if there were any private 
sector laboratories. 
  Regarding the missiles, we told them: This is what we have. 
Here are the al-Husayn missiles. Here are the Scuds we got from 
the Russians. We gave them details. During this period, they 
brought in 21 teams, if not more, consisting of missile 
specialists. 
  The minister said: The United States continued to play the 
same tune, i.e., that Iraq hid some missiles. So, they launched 
a new search campaign. I call it a search campaign, not an 
inspection campaign. They brought in helicopters and gamma ray 
spectrometers to discover what Iraq might have hidden 
underground. They then toured the country. They stayed for 
several weeks. The American lie was exposed. 
  The minister added: Finally, they asked for the records 
about the disposal of missiles. We gave them the records. Then 
they said: We want to see if these documents are original or 
recent. They brought in a team to inspect the documents. Then 
they said: The documents are original, but we will take them to 
Europe for further inspection by more sensitive instruments, 
although we are sure they are original. We will take them to 
inspect them. We patiently said: Take them. Then we said: 
Fine, we have covered all fields under Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, 12, and 13 of Section C. Nothing has been left uninspected. 
  I will now mention how far they have gone in their behavior. 
They said: We want to go to the southern marshlands, because we 
received information about possible leftover chemical weapons 
that were used there. We said: This is very ridiculous. They 
said: Still, we must go. We took them to the south. They wore 
protective suits against chemical weapons. They were flat on 
the ground while helicopters hovered over their heads. They 
located an object stuck into ground. They walked over 
cautiously, tied a rope round it, fearing it might explode. 
When they pulled it out it turned out to be used mortar shell. 
I still remember how some of them shook their heads shamefully, 
and others said: These people -- meaning the Americans -- are 
making a mockery of us. 
  The minister said: We knew right from the start that it was 
an intentional thing. This was one of hundreds, if not 
thousands, of examples that Iraqis have patiently endured since 
1991. 
  The minister added: You may not have heard some of the 
remarks made about the Ministry of Agriculture, which turned out 
to be theatrical, since they did not find any of the things they 
claimed were inside the Ministry. Actually, there was nothing 
in the Ministry. But since they had nothing to say, they wrote 
in their report: We found in one of the rooms "a scratch" on a 
wall caused by a chair. Apparently, the employee using this 
particular chair placed it against the wall, causing the 
scratch. They said in the report: We saw the chair but its 
back was not as high as the scratch. So, it was not the chair 
that caused scratch. This means the chair that made the scratch 
was replaced. They included that in the report as evidence. 
The report was referred to the UN Security Council. You know 
how tense relations were with the Security Council, which wanted 
any justification in order to deceive the world about the 
aggressive threats being made by peoples' hangmen. 
  The minister said: As you can see, I am only citing examples 
and completely avoiding any personal comment. I dealt with this 
person, Ekeus, right from the start. I recall that during our 
meeting together during his last visit here in February 1994, we 
asked him certain specific questions. I asked him: Why this 
delay? What more is asked of us? We explained what we have. 
You also know what we destroyed. I also gave you figures. 
Then they said they wanted whatever we mentioned in writing. 
They said: Actually, we saw the destroyed ammunition, and the 
picture you presented to us was clear, but please remember 
everything and put it down in writing. They wanted us to sit 
down, remember everything, and commit it to writing. We had to 
think and remember what happened in a certain month or a certain 
year, what empty shell, magazine, or simple weapon was used, and 
for what purpose. 
  The minister said: Iraqi technicians sat down and very 
patiently searched their brains so as to eliminate any excuse. 
They produced a full record for Ekeus. He was astonished by 
the results. He said: What you have written down from memory is 
sufficient and meets the purpose. We recorded it in our joint 
minutes. But the Western henchmen said it was not enough. We 
could not accept their haphazard remarks. We told Ekeus: Sit 
down. You said the record was sufficient and met the purpose. 
Therefore, this change in attitude is politically motivated in 
order to prolong the blockade of Iraq. Some Western henchmen 
say this is not enough. To be honest, most members in the 
Security Council are against the extension of the blockade on 
Iraq, because they have begun to see the irrefutable facts. But 
the Americans are known for influencing and blackmailing others, 
and Ekeus knows that. During the last meeting in February 
regarding the monitoring, Gart [name as transliterated] produced 
a chart and reminded me of Resolution 706, which provides for 
exporting oil worth $1.6 billion. The world knows only that oil 
is to be exported. But it does not know the traps and snares 
inherent in this resolution designed to shackle Iraq. All these 
traps and snares are actually intended to make us approve the 
monitoring system details. 
  The minister said: Fine, you have worked out everything. 
Ekeus said: Well, I cannot say that. I said: Fine, why don't 
you find out? You have the Special Commission and the 
experience. You have used everything, including espionage 
aircraft. And now you say you do not know anything. How can 
that be? He said: We do not have the capability. I said: 
Fine, when the Americans wanted to support Iranian claims that 
Iraq used chemical weapons in the Gulf, you made a big uproar. 
A working team was immediately dispatched to the south. Fine, 
let us talk about monitoring. Iraq and its people have been 
very patient with you since 1991. Yet, you now say that you do 
not have the capability. This is unacceptable. We ask you, in 
fact, it is our right -- or, to be more precise, it is our 
minimum right -- to work out a timetable to apply to what 
remains, if you have something new to be monitored. Practically 
speaking, the monitoring began in December 1993, it is in 
progress, and the inspection cameras have been mounted at 
missile sites and nuclear establishments. The inspection teams 
also continue to operate in the factories. They even marked 
some machines with tape, saying they must not be used. Ekeus 
came to us saying: There are machines in some factories that 
must not be used until the monitoring system has been installed. 
So, he produced some tape and stuck it on the machines, 
although they are ordinary commercial machines that the Iraqi 
could have used for months. Tape was stuck on machines, cameras 
were installed in two places, to inspect missile engines and in 
the nuclear sector. Iraqi laboratories are under inspection and 
all the monitoring measures have been taken, yet Ekeus comes and 
says: But our capabilities are limited. This is an obvious 
lie. Its purpose is to waste time and to continue the blockade 
of the Iraqi people. We told Ekeus in February: This is our 
minimum right. We have been patient with you until now. 
  The minister said: We said let us work out a timetable. He 
evaded the subject. We pressed him. We held three meetings 
that continued for hours. But he prevaricated like a fox in the 
forest, as the leader president said. He said: We must have a 
protocol, or a record, for each factory specifying the type of 
monitoring being conducted in it. We should also set up logs. 
Although this was completely unacceptable, we told him: Let it 
be, although we are not 100-percent convinced that you have the 
capability. We know what your capabilities are. We know what 
the Americans have placed at your disposal. We ask you: How 
many Iraqi engineers and experts do you want? Two hundred? 
Take 200. They will help you accomplish your work quickly, 
according to this timetable. As far as we are concerned, we 
believe monitoring began in December 1993. Ekeus said: If I 
agreed to that, they would say I was cooperating with the 
Iraqis. What a weak excuse! So, he completely avoided 
committing himself to a timetable, which is our minimum right. 
  The minister said: The announcement should have been made 
in December 1993. But now that we are in this phase, let us 
respond to the one who brought up the fabrication, although the 
resolution clearly says that once Iraq has fulfilled its 
obligations in these fields there can be nothing left against 
it. It was Ekeus who came up with this prevarication. We do 
not know where he got it from. Monitoring began in December 
1993. The six-month period is a baseless fabrication. The 
resolution itself, as we have heard, spoke of one year. The 
leader president has proved this. The game has become only too 
clear, not just to the politicians, but to any citizen, 
observer, or anyone with an ordinary interest in this subject. 
He can see very clearly that there is a treacherous game that 
goes beyond this resolution. No matter what anyone might say, 
this resolution violates the entire UN Charter and the 
fundamentals of international law. The game has been completely 
exposed. Ekeus wanted to maintain the blockade on Iraq, so he 
looked for any excuse to avoid his obligations. That is quite 
obvious. 
  The minister added: As soon as the inspection teams began 
their work, we should have said that there was nothing left 
unfavorable to our country. But the mean, mean game has 
continued ever since. We have been very patient. I say this 
because we have, indeed, been very patient; in fact, too 
patient, about the enemy's own standards, assumptions, and 
violations of our sovereignty. These people are aggressors who 
resorted to any feeble excuse to implement the resolution their 
way. All these steps could have taken in the spring of 1992, 
but they wanted to continue injuring the Iraqi people, because 
they are the only people who said "no" to the entire 
imperialist-Zionist game. So, they have continued to play the 
fox in the forest to this day. Even now, they insist on what 
they are doing. I will mention some figures. You all recall 
the U.S. spy David Kay. He fabricated a crisis. Therefore, 
they issued Resolution 707, that included several paragraphs 
violating Iraq's sovereignty and independence. I will cite some 
of the provisions in this resolution. The provisions say the 
inspection teams have the right to intercept any car, ship, or 
plane; enter any house or place; storm any building; and 
completely freeze Iraqi rights, even with regard to medicine. 
Even isotopes needed for medicine were withheld from us. Yet, 
they say all Security Council states uphold Iraq's sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and political independence. 
  The minister continued: They imposed the no-fly zone in the 
South on 28 August. Before that, they imposed the no-fly zone 
in the North. From 28 August to 31 December 1993, the Americans 
violated Iraqi sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political 
independence 25,534 times; that is more than 10 times daily. 
There were days when there were 80 violations. This is in 
addition to dropping flares on fields from low-flying aircraft. 
Thousands of Iraqi women suffered abortions. Several diseases 
were caused. Many people's interests were disrupted. This was 
just during that period. But what did those who imposed this 
situation do? What did those who included in the resolution the 
sentence about member states upholding Iraq's independence, 
territorial integrity, and political independence do? They 
committed scores of violations daily. We have recorded 
everything. They have all been documented with the United 
Nations and even the Arab League. Let us now restrict our 
discussion to the Security Council and Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687, which represents the minimum Iraqi rights. As I 
said, the picture now in the Security Council is as follows: 
Those renegades who want continuation of the blockade on the 
Iraqi people are a minority in the council. The majority in the 
council, without mentioning names, call for the need to speed up 
the implementation of Paragraph 22. The majority includes some 
of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. They are 
also a majority within the five big powers; in fact, three of 
the big powers. What is taking place in the Security Council is 
a reflection of the international situation. I believe that to 
a large extent these changes are an expression of an 
international awakening, albeit slowly, to the big plot planned 
in the eighties and carried out against Iraq. The so-called new 
world order was aimed at Iraq and the world. The changes taking 
place in the Security Council are an expression of this 
comparatively slow awakening. We might be able to expedite this 
awakening. 
  The minister added: Tangible changes are definitely taking 
place in the Security Council. The reason is that Iraq has 
fulfilled all its obligations under this resolution, despite its 
unfairness. The so-called new world order has also been 
exposed. Iraqi blood was shed, but the Iraqis remained patient 
all this time. When the evil directed against Iraq began to 
affect others, the changes started. Everyone said: God help 
the Iraqis and give them patience. Yes, when the spark of fire 
began to reach others, they started asking questions: What is 
going on? They could not stand it. What can we say about the 
Iraqis who had to endure this for four years; who were hit by 
the equivalent of seven nuclear bombs? Iraq will soon enter the 
fourth year of the blockade. Indeed, the change has started. 
  The minister said: The leader president, may God preserve 
him, spoke about the nature of the mission of Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz. I have just spoken about general climate 
of this mission, which is very clear, documented, and founded on 
a basis that any sensible and logical person can understand and 
come to the same conclusion as the leader president, i.e., that 
the game has been exposed and Iraq is only demanding its rights 
under Paragraph 22; rights that should have been applied in the 
spring of 1992. The international situation now -- actually the 
change became evident in the last quarter of 1993 -- is very 
different from what it was on 3 April 1991. The resoluton was 
issued at an inadvertent moment in history, within the game, or 
plot, of the so-called new world order. They tried to establish 
something that conflicted with the nature of things in all parts 
of the world. So, their plans were deadlocked in 1992 and 1993 
and began to be exposed after the last quarter of 1993. 
  The minister explained: The international atmosphere now is 
clearly in favor of Iraqi rights. This inclination exists in 
the Security Council. As I said, the majority in the Security 
Council are demanding implementation of Paragraph 22. Their 
conscience is burdened by the Iraqi people's sufferings as a 
result of this despicable crime committed against them since the 
imposition of the blockade; in fact, since the issuance of 
Resolution 661 on 6 August 1990. The majority is making 
demands. There are divisions in the minority and even inside 
the United States itself. 
  The minister said: Actually, a significant debate took 
place within one of the subcommittees of the Congressional 
Foreign Relations Committee. The debate was between Committee 
Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat and a Clinton supporter, and 
Assistant Secretary of State Pelletreau. The latter was U.S. 
ambassador to Tunisia during the initial contacts with the PLO. 
He was then transferred to the State Department. Pelletreau 
was summoned to testify before the committee. Hamilton himself 
put the questions to Pelletreau. He asked him: Tell me, what 
do you want from Iraq? Pelletreau tried to dodge the question, 
but Hamilton kept coming back with the same question, saying: 
You are not making it clear to me. I want you to say exactly 
what you want from Iraq. What is it that Iraq has not fulfilled 
and must fulfill before the blockade is lifted? Pelletreau 
replied: I believe it will be wise if I do not answer your 
question. The question was repeated ten times, but Pelletreau 
remained evasive. Hamilton then told him: Go now and come back 
after one or two weeks with a written reply. 
  The minister said: This shows that even inside the enemy map 
the atmosphere is no longer the same as the one they fabricated 
and presented in 1991. Yes, the situation is changing and will 
continue to change. We have all seen how world nations changed 
their attitude when spark from the fire that hit Iraq and the 
Iraqi people began reaching them. They stood up and said: This 
is unacceptable. 
  The foreign minister said: Iraqi rights will definitely be 
achieved. The arguments, evidence, and documents we have just 
outlined will silence the largest of them. Who will continue to 
be stubborn once he has been exposed? I believe justice will 
prevail and that Iraqi rights will triumph. No one has been as 
patient as the Iraqi people. No one has withstood such a savage 
onslaught as our people. I believe our people will remain 
steadfast until they hold final victory in their hand and regain 
their rights, God willing. 
  [Badawi] Are there any other implicit conditions set by the 
United States before lifting the blockade on Iraq, even 
partially? Are there conditions related to Iraq's internal 
situation? 
  [Salih] The resolution itself does not include any 
conditions, except those I have just mentioned, i.e., the 
application of the clauses related to Iraq. But outside the 
resolution, there are proposals. Yes, there are proposals, 
including, for example, the issue of human rights and respect 
for human rights. The issue is completely reversed. It is not 
the Government of Iraq that violates human rights. It is the 
U.S. Government and some officials in the United States and 
Britain that violate human rights in Iraq. They are interfering 
in Iraq's domestic affairs in violation of the UN Charter. They 
imposed two no-fly zones on the official forces, apart from the 
Security Council's resolutions. There is no Security Council 
resolution in this regard. These pretexts have become weak. 
These justifications are unfounded. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, it has been noticed that 
differences surfaced during the recent Security Council debate 
on Iraq, especially among France, Russia, and the PRC on one 
hand and the United State and Britain on the other, and on the 
position to be adopted regarding the assessment of Iraq's 
efforts to handle and respond to the international resolutions. 
The Security Council's members differed. They were unable to 
agree on a statement praising Iraq, for example, for making 
progress regarding disarmament. How do you assess and interpret 
these differences, as well as the French, Russian, and PRC 
positions? 
  [Salih] The facts at present have imposed those differences 
because it is wrong to renew the blockade automatically and 
without any discussion or without considering Iraq's measures to 
implement the relevant Security Council resolutions. Here, any 
objective and fair person will certainly raise his voice and 
call for a pause to discuss the reason why they decide 
automatically, without discussion. Raising such a question will 
lead to differences between the two sides, because some want to 
renew the sanctions without giving convincing reasons and others 
call for discussing and seeing if the reasons that made them 
impose the blockade on Iraq are still there. The answer will 
be: No, none of the reasons are there. Therefore, there will 
be a demand for lifting the blockade. So, the United States and 
Britain are trying to prevent such a trend. 
  [Badawi] There have been Iraqi threats to take some certain 
measure if a settlement was not reached regarding the oil 
embargo on Baghdad, but Tariq 'Aziz did not disclose the nature 
of that measure. What do you mean by a certain measure, 
especially since your demand for lifting the oil embargo was not 
met? 
  [Salih] Let us ask any world state, whose people are placed 
under a comprehensive and firm blockade for four years, what it 
would do when it sees its people dying slowly in a genocide-like 
situation, when its officials and doctors see children dying 
before their eyes without being able to do anything because they 
do not have medicine, and when it sees its people hungry and 
their health affected. What would that state do in such a case? 
It will take measures to protect the people. We should not go 
too far to hint that we will launch a new war. No, we will do 
our utmost to lift that blockade. Our forefathers said: 
Poverty amounts to infidelity. When people starve and are 
naked, they have the right to do everything. 
  If we have managed to restrain our people and prevent them 
from doing things that violate the international will, or can be 
considered a departure from the prevailing concepts, then I 
believe that if our people do something in the future, we will 
not be able to tell to them stop, as we did and continue to do. 
  [Badawi] In other words, is it possible to expect a popular 
Iraqi move? 
  [Salih] I cannot define a certain formula. This might happen 
on the spur of the moment. I cannot now define the formula by 
which we will respond to the injustice our people have suffered. 
However, the wronged have the right to do anything. 
  [Badawi] There is also the question of recognizing Kuwait, 
which was raised again during the debates. Tariq 'Aziz promised 
that if the embargo against Iraq is lifted, then Baghdad might 
reconsider its stand on Kuwait. 
  [Salih] In case the embargo is lifted, then everything can 
be 
discussed. Tariq 'Aziz's answer was clear. I have nothing to 
add to that answer. 
  [Badawi] How can the question of reconsidering the issue of 
Kuwait be interpreted? A final recognition of borders, for 
example? 
  [Salih] Until 2 August 1990, we considered Kuwait a state. 
We dealt with Amir Jabir as a head of state. During his 
meetings with Amir Jabir, President Saddam Husayn dealt with him 
as such. Therefore, when we accepted Resolution 660, I think 
that implicitly meant recognition. But, if we are asked, after 
all that happened to our people, to be lenient to our people's 
enemies -- who insist on harming us -- of course, this puts us 
in an embarrassing position. What will we tell our citizens if 
we keep silent when we see them or their family members die or 
get sick without finding medicine? What will we tell him? What 
will we do? 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, you are taking part in the 
Interparliamentary Union [IPU] meeting in Paris. In accordance 
with an IPU spokesman, a proposal to discuss a request to lift 
the economic sanctions against Iraq has been rejected. In your 
view, does this stand reflect the support of most international 
parliamentarians for the continued sanctions against Baghdad? 
  [Salih] After the disappearance of the role of the former 
Soviet Union, the world now is controlled by a sole superpower, 
the United States. Therefore, all that is prevailing in 
international politics does not reflect the true state of 
affairs. Some fear for their interests, and some even fear 
their own safety. Therefore, the real stands are unclear now. 
Yet, there is broad international sympathy for the Iraqi 
people. This is because the issue is a human issue. Besides, 
the proposal was an extra item. It was not a basic item. 
Therefore, it could be that... 
  [Badawi, interrupting] Yes, but it was rejected. Does this 
reflect a certain orientation, or are your contacts... 
  [Salih, interrupting] No, I do not think it reflects 
reality. 
For the first time, the proposal was put to the vote on the 
first day, while such a thing would usually happen three or four 
days after the opening of the conference. Of course, this seems 
to be a game by the presidency of the conference. 
  [Badawi] The presidency of the conference? 
  [Salih] The traditional presidency of the conference. I do 
not mean the French. The president, I believe, is British. 
  [Badawi] Contacts were recently noted between Baghdad and 
France, Russia, and even Turkey. Turkish President Demirel 
recently called for either toppling the Baghdad regime or 
permitting Ankara to play a role or embark on meditation between 
the Iraqi Government and the Kurds. What is your comment on 
this talk? 
  [Salih] We and Turkey are linked by old and broad relations. 
However, the Iraqi-Turkish relationship was affected by the Gulf 
war. As was the case with several other states, Turkey 
sustained much damage as a result of the blockade. We 
understand what Demirel meant. Demirel meant to say: Enough. 
You are wagering on the possibility that the Iraqi regime will 
fall due to the continued blockade, but this lengthy blockade 
has resulted in nothing to this effect, so you should lift the 
blockade. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: The Turkish position was 
accompanied by information about Iraqi troop concentrations in 
northern Iraq and a plan to reopen the northern road leading to 
Turkey. Is this true? 
  [Salih] I have no such information. 
  [Badawi] Is there not an intention to reopen the Baghdad- 
Ankara road in order to facilitate exchanges, export, or 
import... 
  [Salih, interrupting] The Baghdad-Ankara road would have 
been open if hadn't been for the Hammer Force and for the U.S. 
and British interference that prevented free movement. This 
road is passable. There are no obstacles on it. 
  [Badawi] But, at present, this road lies in the Kurdish 
region ... 
  [Salih, interrupting] I believe, however, that if there was 
approval of movement, such movement would take place. 
  [Badawi] So, an international green light is awaited. 
  [Salih] Yes, we are awaiting the departure of the Hammer 
Force. It is illegitimate. This force represents flagrant 
interference in the affairs of an independent state and a UN 
member state. 
  [Badawi] Within this context, Mas'ud Barzani has accused the 
Iraqi authorities of taking revenge on the Kurds for the 
extension of the economic embargo on Baghdad by halting fuel 
supplies to the Kurds. 
  [Salih] Iraq is besieged. We told you we suffer much due to 
this blockade, in many forms, including food, medicine, and 
fuel. There is strict rationing of all these materials. The 
Kurds receive their rations. But, if the Kurds compare their 
rations to the pre- war period, the rations will naturally seem 
very small. However, this is the ration Iraq can provide at 
this time. When the blockade of Iraq is lifted, you will find 
that the blockade on the Kurds will consequently and 
simultaneously be lifted. 
  [Badawi] Hence, this measure is linked to ... 
  [Salih, interrupting] It is linked to the main blockade [on 
Iraq]. 
  [Badawi] So, Barzani is right. 
  [Salih] No, he is not right, because he accuses the Iraqi 
Government. But where can the Iraqi Government get additional 
rations? It cannot give to a Kurd twice the ration of an Arab. 
It gives the Kurd the ration mentioned in the ration card. We 
are not responsible for the Kurds' failure to control the 
disbursement and delivery process because we do not have any 
employees there. As a result of the interference in our 
internal affairs, we do not have any authority in that region. 
We deliver the supplies to certain points, and they receive 
them. If they do not deliver the supplies, it is their own 
responsibility. If they sell fuel to Iran for hard currency and 
dispose of fuel as individuals, it is their own responsibility. 
  [Badawi] It is reported that Iraqi oil is being exported to 
Pakistan and Afghanistan via Iran. How true is this? 
  [Salih, laughing] How can oil be exported across borders? 
You know oil is exported in pipelines and requires large 
investments before this can take place. This is not available 
at present. 
  [Badawi] Then, these reports are incorrect. 
  [Salih] Yes, incorrect. 
  [Badawi] Regarding the domestic situation, the opposition is 
talking about the expansion and exacerbation of tension, 
particularly on the security level, in Baghdad and elsewhere in 
Iraq. 
  [Salih] My answer to such utterances is that we welcome 
anyone, even the one who calls himself the opposition, who wants 
to find out or be sure of the true situation. The country is 
opening its doors to all -- to newsmen, politicians, and 
parliamentarians -- to see for themselves in full freedom and to 
become closely acquainted with the situation. I can say in 
advance that they will discover that what they said was wrong 
and does not represent the truth. Security is prevailing all 
over Iraq, except for the area outside state authority, which is 
called the Kurdish area. This area consists of the three 
Governorates of Dahuk, Irbil, and al-Sulaymaniyah. 
  [Badawi] What about the situation in the south? 
  [Salih] The situation in the south is no different from the 
situation in Baghdad. Both are the same. Stability is complete 
and overwhelming. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: In the aftermath of the 
second Gulf war, promises were made that there would be reforms 
on the political level, toward democracy, pluralism, and so 
forth. Negotiations and dialogues were held with the Kurds. 
Afterward, we heard nothing in this regard. How long will the 
suspension of dialogue between authority and other political 
factions, including the opposition and others, continue? 
  [Salih] We embarked on what you termed political reform at 
the end of the war with Iran. We were expecting to implement 
all that was required by the end of 1990. This included the 
endorsement of a new constitution for the country through a 
referendum and the election of a National Assembly, a Shura 
Council, and the president of the state. These steps were 
expected to be taken at that stage. However, things happened. 
Now, the situation of Iraq is as follows: It is besieged. Part 
of its territory is in one way or another under the control of 
international forces, particularly the United States and 
Britain. Accordingly, these steps are now suspended, but not 
forever. We will implement them as soon as the present 
extraordinary circumstances come to a conclusion. Still, the 
National Assembly discussed and ratified a new party law, which 
is currently valid. Any Iraqis wishing to engage in politics, 
in Iraq or abroad, can apply according to this law. Thus, this 
is a pledge that was not imposed on us but stems from our creed, 
from our conviction that democracy is the right path to run the 
affairs of our country. 
  [Badawi] What about the federation proposal called for by 
the 
opposition factions as a final solution for the Iraqi issue? 
  [Salih] I think there was an answer that was also proposed 
during the dialogue: There is nothing beyond autonomy. We will 
not accept a formula beyond autonomy. We believe this autonomy 
fulfills the aspirations and demands of the Kurdish sons of our 
people. These people enjoyed these rights before their brothers 
in other countries -- Turkey, Syria, and Iran -- did. These 
countries did not give the Kurds what Iraq gave them. But it is 
the game of politics. Iraq wants to build a progressive, 
developed, and cultural system with a sound scientific method. 
Some international powers, however, do not want this. 
Therefore, problems are created. This is one of the problems 
that were first created by Britain and now pursued by the United 
States, to keep Iraq weak and backward. 
  [Badawi] A last word about the future. How do you view it 
from besieged Baghdad? 
  [Salih] The future is for Iraq. The present circumstances 
are extraordinary and temporary. The day will come when the 
world will discover it has wronged Iraq. Many will come to help 
Iraq continue its march because it pursues a sound course. The 
whole question is that we do not want anyone to interfere in our 
internal affairs. Therefore, we respect those who respect us and 
cooperate with them to the end. Iraqi-French relations and the 
previous Iraqi-Soviet relations, and Iraqi-Chinese relations, 
serve as good examples of this. We established good relations, 
even with the United States, but we are very sensitive to any 
interference in our internal affairs. I am sure that future is 
for Iraq. 
  [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the 
Iraqi National Assembly. 
  [Salih] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (INA)--Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf has said Iraq is being subjected to something 
that has nothing to do with the issue of Kuwait or the 
implementation of UN resolutions. Instead, he said, it is a 
U.S.-led conspiracy with obvious political objectives. 
  Al-Sahhaf was addressing a news conference at Arab League 
headquarters today. It was attended by correspondents of Arab 
and world news agencies, television networks, and the press. 
Al-Sahhaf stressed that Iraq has fully cooperated with the 
United Nations and implemented its resolutions, especially 
Resolution 687. According to the mutual obligations outlined by 
this resolution, especially Paragraph 22, al-Sahhaf noted, the 
United Nations is supposed to unconditionally lift the blockade 
imposed on Iraq. 
  Noting the allegations and charges about the issue of Iraqi 
weapons, al-Sahhaf said: At present, Iraq does not possess any 
banned weapons. Iraq is completely free of the weapons covered 
by Resolution 687. Recalling the UN Special Commission's 
reports and confessions, al-Sahhaf said Iraq cooperated with the 
inspection committees and approved the long-term monitoring 
programs in order to expedite the lifting of the blockade 
imposed on its people. 
  In this regard, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf pointed out the 
major shift in the positions of many UN Security Council members 
in light of Iraq's great response and major strides in terms of 
commitment to and implementation of UN resolutions. 
  He said the UN Security Council's debates and sanctions 
review during its recent meeting saw a major shift in the 
positions of most of its members in favor of Iraq. He said 
France, China, and Russia -- in addition to nonpermanent member 
states of the UN Security Council, such as Brazil, Rwanda, Oman, 
and Spain -- demand that the blockade be lifted. 
  He expressed extreme regret that international resolutions 
continue to be drafted under U.S. influence, and that the U.S. 
Administration continues to besiege Iraq despite the 
far-reaching effects on society's public health, especially 
among children and women. He said that under U.S. influence, 
the Security Council has decided to maintain the sanctions, 
something intended to humiliate and annihilate the Iraqi people. 
  The foreign minister drew the attention of public opinion 
and the international community to the depth and seriousness of 
the crime perpetrated against the Iraqi people. He said the 
continuing freeze on Iraqi assets at Western banks and 
establishments robbed Iraq of the opportunity to employ the 
international resolution to use these assets to import food and 
medicine. 
  The minister stressed the fact that this reflects the 
illegal 
criminal and hostile campaign of annihilation waged against Iraq 
by well-known international powers. This has no precedence in 
history. He said: Reports by international bodies, the World 
Health Organization, and UNICEF clearly point out the crimes 
perpetrated against Iraq. 
  The minister refuted the Kuwaiti regime's lies and its 
claims 
about so-called missing Kuwaitis. He reemphasized that there 
are no Kuwaitis in Iraq. He said: Iraq has cooperated in a 
positive way with the Red Cross and the Arab League about this 
issue. 
  The foreign minister accused the al-Sabah family of 
continuing to exploit the aggressive U.S. position, instigating 
public opinion against Iraq, and preventing the lifting of the 
embargo against the Iraqi people by creating the lie about 
missing Kuwaitis. 
  Reinforcing his argument, al-Sahhaf said: The Kuwaiti regime 
has not responded to or agreed with all the Arab initiatives, 
including Gulf initiatives, intended to close the book on these 
allegations used to injure Iraq. 
  Focusing on relations between Iraq and the Gulf states, 
al-Sahhaf said: We follow a constant policy based on principles 
of promoting cooperation and activating ties with Arab countries 
. He stressed Iraq's permanent readiness to sincerely cooperate 
with the Arab group to serve Arab causes. He said: We now have 
good relations with Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and other brothers. 
  Touching on the issue of Arab reconciliation, al-Sahhaf 
said: 
Iraq supports every Arab effort to effect solidarity. He said 
such efforts and intentions should be based on the principle of 
preserving pan-Arab security and confronting threats directed at 
Iraq and the Arab nation, indicating in this regard Iraq's 
previous positions on this issue, particularly the pan-Arab 
declaration of President Saddam Husayn in August 1980. 
  Warning the Arab nation against the gravity of the 
U.S.-Zionist scheme against it, al-Sahhaf said: Those 
intentions are not aimed just against Iraq. Rather, the 
imperialist-Zionist scheme targets all Arab countries and seeks 
to incite direct and indirect problems in them. 
  The minister shed light on the aggressive U.S. practices 
designed to dismantle Iraq and harm its national sovereignty. 
He said the air exclusion zones in southern and northern Iraq 
are nothing but a U.S. plot, drafted in the form of a 
resolution, that contravenes UN Security Council resolutions. 
This has been admitted by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, he noted. 
  He explained that from the time the no-fly zone was imposed 
in southern Iraq to the end of last year, U.S. and British 
aircraft carried out over 25,535 violations of Iraqi airspace in 
the south, using bases and facilities provided by the Saudi and 
Kuwaiti regimes. 
  Touching on imperialist-Zionist interference in northern 
Iraq, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said the central government had 
been about to sign an agreement with Kurdish parties to promote 
self-rule. However, the U.S. Administration, as acknowledged by 
Barzani, prevented those parties from signing the agreement, 
which was in the interest of the Kurds of Iraq in the first 
place. 
  Al-Sahhaf accused Washington, Tel Aviv, and Arab parties, 
including the al-Sabah family, of conspiring against Iraq and 
supporting some gangs in northern Iraq in order to ensure the 
continuation of the abnormal situation there and to partition 
Iraq. He stressed that Iraqis are aware of the objectives of 
these schemes, and are very prepared to confront them. 
  The minister described the domestic situation in Iraq as 
very 
excellent. He said rumors propagated against Iraq are nothing 
but exposed and explicit propaganda campaigns pushed by the 
United States and other hostile parties.

  [Text] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said the 
signing of agreements between Iraq and two French oil companies 
is a matter that only concerns the two companies. 
  Commenting on contacts between Iraq and the French companies 
last Friday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news 
conference that he would like to have a list of companies from 
other countries that have the same contacts with the Iraqi 
Government--a reference to the U.S., British, and other Western 
companies. 
  Minister of Oil Safa' Hadi Jawad emphasized in a statement, 
published in AL-QADISIYAH last Saturday, that several major 
international oil companies have shown a strong desire to sign 
contracts with Iraq. 
  He said negotiations with French oil companies in Paris 
resulted in agreements that will be implemented after the siege 
is lifted.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Mar (INA)--Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi 
Jawad has said that a number of leading U.S., Canadian, British, 
Brazilian, and Spanish oil companies have expressed a strong 
desire to conclude contracts with Iraq and to cooperate with it 
in the field of oil production. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-QADISIYAH published 
here today, the minister said that these international 
companies, which play a great and effective role in their 
countries' governments, seek to reemploy their expertise and 
investments in our oil industry despite the continuation of the 
blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  He said that there is another group of oil companies that 
seek to improve and promote their relations with Iraq, and that 
they seek to seize the appropriate opportunity to hold contacts 
and talks with Iraq in order to reach a specific agreement or to 
conclude contracts to develop their investments after the 
blockade is lifted. 
  The oil minister said: Negotiations with the international 
oil companies have taken place not only in Baghdad, but also in 
other world capitals, including Amman and Vienna. He stressed 
that the negotiations with the French oil companies, which were 
recently held in Paris, resulted in agreements that will be 
implemented after the blockade is lifted. 
  He emphasized that the continuation of the blockade not only 
affects Iraq and its people, but it is now affecting the 
neighboring states and other states with interests in Iraq. 
These states have begun to feel the grave damage inflicted on 
their economies. He added that Turkey is now suffering from a 
serious economic crisis after the stoppage of the Iraqi-Turkish 
pipeline, and after banning the crude oil exports through this 
line to Turkey and then to other ports. He said that 
reoperating this line will secure jobs for thousands of Turkish 
workers. 
  Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad added: The closure of the 
Iraqi- Turkish oil pipeline has led to the deterioration of the 
economic situation in the Anatolia region and the Turkish ports, 
to the growth of unemployment rates, and to the deterioration of 
the security situation in the region. 
  He noted: As a result of these problems and obstacles, 
Turkey began to pressure the UN Security Council to allow the 
reopening of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, which will reactivate 
trade between the two countries using 1,000 trucks per day to 
transport goods. 
  The oil minister pointed out that Iraq's current production 
of crude oil falls within the limits of 550,000-600,000 barrels 
per day to meet the local needs for oil byproducts. He said 
that important explorations have been undertaken in the central 
and western regions of Iraq, and that previously-discovered oil 
fields have also been developed.

  [Text] Tehran, March 27, IRNA -- Loss of floppy diskettes 
containing vital classified information has terrified the Iraqi 
regime, according to radio 'Voice of the Iraqi People', 
monitored here today. 
  The radio said Iraq security forces have started inspecting 
houses of hundreds of persons suspected of removing the 
diskettes, and have arrested a number of employees of related 
departments. 
  It has not yet been clarified what data the diskettes 
contained, but the way the Iraqi regime is treating the 
suspects, the radio said it is likely that they might contain 
vital security information. 
  What's more concerning for the regime is that foreign 
embassies in Baghdad can get access to the diskettes. 
  The radio added that broadcast of the classified information 
contained in the diskettes by internationl radio stations might 
also be critical for the Iraqi regime. 
  Voice of the Iraqi People is an opposition radio operating 
from somewhere inside Iraq. It did not give further details.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad al-Jalabi, president of the Executive </F>
Council of the opposition Iraqi National Conference by Salim 
Badawi; date and place not given; from "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jalabi] With Saddam still in office, the 
sanctions cannot be lifted. Relief for the Iraqi people lies in 
the implementation of Resolutions 706 and 712. The 
international community has no confidence in the Iraqi regime or 
its compliance with resolutions. 
  [Badawi] Don't you agree, though, that the only party being 
hurt is the Iraqi people, of which you are a part, rather than 
the regime? Do you continue to hold that retaining the 
sanctions will topple the regime? 
  [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi people will not benefit from lifting 
the sanctions. The regime will use the ensuing income to 
purchase weapons and new tools of repression. Only the regime 
will benefit from lifting the sanctions. 
  [Badawi] There has been a relative and limited shift in the 
positions of certain major powers like France and Russia toward 
the Baghdad regime. How do you feel about that? 
  [Al-Jalabi] France and Russia seem to be misreading the 
situation. Russia seems to think that scrapping the sanctions 
will bring in money Iraq can use to pay the huge military debt 
it owes Moscow. As for France, important commercial interests 
there want drilling concessions in the Majnun oil field. These 
interests think extending support to Saddam at this point will 
help him survive, and then they will be in a position to clinch 
the oil drilling contracts. They are influencing their 
government. We think their influence is extremely limited. 
  [Badawi] If the Iraqi regime can capitalize on some positive 
shifts by certain world powers, you, as an opposition, will 
benefit as well. There are reports you receive financial 
support from abroad, especially from regional powers opposed to 
the Iraqi regime. Don't you think such an attitude makes you 
less credible as a patriotic opposition? 
  [Al-Jalabi] Saddam [words indistinct] and destroyed the 
Iraqi people's independent movement. We set up offices and we 
are working from inside Iraq. We have moved the opposition from 
exile onto Iraqi territory, where we are engaged in real, 
democratic, and open political action. We believe our 
credibility with the Iraqi people is strong. As for the reports 
about financial backing, I have no comment, you are not being 
specific. 
  [Badawi] In light of the present situation in Iraq, how do 
you see the country's political landscape developing? 
  [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi regime is now progressively losing all 
the requirements of a proper state. The regime is abdicating 
state functions, like securing food, protection and safety for 
the population. Thefts are rife, as are murders. The regime is 
doing nothing about them. The regime is growing weaker and 
weaker, and the people are poised to pounce on it. We are now 
mobilizing our resources to promote that end. 
  [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. al-Jalabi. 
  [Al-Jalabi] Thank you.

  [Text] According to reports received from special sources, 
the chauvinistic Baghdad regime deployed a military division 
inside Karkuk on 18 and 19 March, fearing an explosion of 
popular outrage in the city, especially during the days 
commemorating the anniversary of the liberation of this beloved 
Kurdish city and the Nowruz celebrations. 
  In their patrols of the streets and alleys of Karkuk, the 
regime's discipline men stand fully prepared and [words 
indistinct] to suppress any popular move in the city. The 
regime troops also searched the shops of Kurds in the city and 
caused many troubles for their owners.

  In a report from the marshes, our sources note that the

units, in preparation for the attack. The same sources add that 
the regime has beefed up its forces by sending units from the

large elements from the security and intelligence services, and 
units from the so- called Popular Army, which has been 
reestablished to confront popular protests against the regime.

  [Text] Zakho, Iraq, March 27, (AFP) -- Two Austrian UN 
guards were wounded, one of them seriously, when gunmen ambushed 
a bus they were travelling in Sunday [27 March] near Irbil in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, UN sources said. 
  The United Nations was trying to evacuate the wounded 
guards, 
said the officials in Zakho near the Turkish border. 
  The Austrians were in a bus taking 22 UN guards from Irbil 
to 
Baghdad at the end of their tour of duty. The guards are 
employed to protect UN personnel and vehicles. 
  UN organisations have been working in the Kurdish-controlled 
region of northern Iraq since the Kurdish uprising against 
Baghdad which followed the January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  Since 1992 UN personnel and offices in the region have been 
repeatedly attacked. 
  The Kurdish authorities blamed agents of the Iraqi 
government. 
  Baghdad has warned several times that it will not tolerate 
foreigners carrying out humanitarian work in the north of the 
country. 
  There have been 11 attacks this year, nine against the UN, 
one against a German humanitarian organisation and one against 
Swedish journalists, the UN's Inter-Agency Relief Coordination 
Unit reported. It said six people were injured but none killed.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has 
denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent statements in 
which he announced before the leaders of Jewish organizations in 
the United States that he and his government consider Jerusalem 
as the united capital of the Zionist entity. 
  In an article today, the paper notes: During his election 
campaign, Clinton competed with his predecessor George Bush to 
win Zionist votes by pledging never to forsake the Zionist 
entity. 
  The paper points out that this pledge included Clinton's 
readiness to support the Zionist entity by giving it loans and 
grants to finance the establishment of settlements in the 
occupied West Bank, and assurances that the Zionists will not 
find a better friend at times of war or peace. 
  The paper reviews some of Clinton's actions after he won the 
presidential elections. The most important of these actions are 
his disavowal of the statement in which he expressed his 
readiness to turn over a new leaf in relations with Iraq if Iraq 
complied with the UN Security Council resolutions, his missile 
attack on Baghdad, and the current scandals in which he and his 
family are involved. 
  The paper notes that the campaign against Clinton's 
reputation by the Republicans and certain Zionists is due to the 
fact that these circles are not satisfied with the White House 
President merely announcing openly that he supports the Zionist 
entity, they want him to prove, through words and deeds, that he 
will pursue this course, and show that any deviation from this 
course will result in blackmailing and exposing him, making him 
a lesson to others.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] As the inauguration of the new president of South 
Africa draws near, the relationship between outgoing President 
F.W. de Klerk and his likely successor, ANC [African National 
Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, has plummeted. 
  It appears from public statements that Mr Mandela is finding 
it difficult to contain his impatience and contempt for Mr de 
Klerk's handling of national affairs. 
  Tension between the leaders stems primarily from a 
disagreement as to who should dictate the course of action to be 
taken in the weekly crises that have been occurring during the 
pre-election period. 
  It was evident two weeks ago during the crisis in 
Bophuthatswana, and it showed itself again at a press conference 
in Pretoria on Thursday over the impending crisis in kwaZulu. 
  Mr Mandela made it quite plain two weeks ago that he was not 
satisfied with the agreement Mr de Klerk obtained from 
Bophuthatswana's former president, Lucas Mangope, that he would 
participate in the elections. 
  It did not follow that this implied co-operation in allowing 
free and fair elections to take place, he said. He was not 
satisfied, and insisted that IEC [Independent Election 
Committee] chairman Judge Johann Kriegler be sent to 
Bophuthatswana to secure these assurances from Mr Mangope. 
  As it turned out, Mr Mandela was right, and his concerns 
that 
Mr de Klerk dismissed so confidently were in this case justified. 
  Not only did Mangope start making noises that he would 
renege 
on his agreement on participation in the elections, but he could 
not give satisfaction to Judge Kriegler that he would co-operate 
with the IEC. 
  The handling of the crisis in kwaZulu has once again drawn 
the two men together -- to argue and to disagree. 
  On Thursday Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk could not agree on 
the 
course of action to be taken in the violence-ridden homeland. 
Mr Mandela wanted swift action; Mr de Klerk wanted to hold 
back a little longer. 
  After the meeting, Mr Mandela referred at great length to 
the 
attack that Mr de Klerk made on ANC secretary-general Cyril 
Ramaphosa, who had called for the TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council] to replace the kwaZulu government with an administrator. 
  "Unfortunately, Mr de Klerk has not acted like a state 
president who himself is interested in ensuring that there 
should be free and fair elections in that province," Mr Mandela 
said. "He has acted not like a state president but like a petty 
politician who is concerned with electioneering and is ignoring 
major national issues facing our country." 
  He also accused Mr de Klerk of refusing to address the 
question that the kwaZulu government was using state funds to 
destabilise the elections. 
  "We regard this statement as cheap politicking, and it is 
for 
that reason that I think the people of South Africa are 
determined to throw out the National Party in the elections," Mr 
Mandela said. 
  "I am completely disgusted," he continued. 
  "I have refrained from handling matters in a way that will 
complicate Mr de Klerk's own problems. I don't get a similar 
response and cooperation from him. I totally condemn the manner 
in which he is handling national issues." 
  Mr de Klerk has not responded to this latest attack.

<F P=106> [Address by AVF leader Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg at Church </F>
Square in Pretoria, date not given -- recorded; passages within 
slantlines in English] 
  [Text] The Honorable chairman, members of the Executive 
Committee, members of the National Representative Council, 
members of the council, representatives of member organizations 
of the Volksfront National Front, and honorable fellow citizens. 
This massive demonstration this morning is proof that a turning 
point has been reached in the history of South Africa. 
[applause] Ladies and gentlemen, this massive demonstration this 
morning has shown clearly and fearlessly that we are united in 
our attempt to preserve our freedom. Ladies and gentlemen -- 
that we are united in saying that we will not give up our right 
to self-determination, that we are united in our will to 
establish our own state and to govern that state. Friends, I 
think what has happened here this morning demonstrates to the 
world, which thinks that the Afrikaner nation has been 
flattened, but it is heartening to see the Afrikaner nation 
demonstrating here this morning. The people are standing up in 
its quest for freedom and in its quest for self-determination in 
its own state. 
  Sir, this is the uniting factor, which binds this nation 
together today, but there is more than this. There is another 
factor uniting us and this is the factor, and this is the most 
important, and this is the overwhelming one, that we are not 
only united in our quest for freedom, but we are united in our 
courage before the king of all kings, and this brings our nation 
together. 
  Sir, the freedom -- we have not stolen this from anyone. We 
did not get this at anyone's expense. This freedom is granted 
to every other nation in the world and now it is expected of the 
Afrikaner nation to voluntarily give up its freedom. The answer 
we give today is: It will never happen that we will give up our 
freedom. [applause] 
  Sir, even the United Nations, the whole world recognizes the 
right to self- determination of nations. In South Africa we 
have nations who have self-determination -- the Swazis, the 
Sothos -- in Africa we have nations with the right to 
self-determination, but the Afrikaner nation, the Zulu nation, 
the Tswana nation, and other nations have to be subjected 
because it does not fit in with communists' plans for these 
people to be free. 
  For this reason, Mr. Chairman, what we want to legally 
protect today is something we have. We are not on a campaign to 
conquer anything. We have our freedom and we are not a 
conquered nation, we have self-determination. We have a 
country. We are not conquering anything. We are here together 
to tell the world: Here stands the Afrikaner nation, and we are 
not an aggressive nation committing aggressive deeds. We are 
not a nation trying to establish anarchy. We are not a nation 
that has left a trail of blood behind us in this country, like 
the Americans and the Australians. We built up this land with 
patriotism, with love, with dedication, and sacrifice and sweat 
and blood, and we are here to protect that to which we are 
rightfully entitled, and not to give it up, and this we will not 
allow them to take away. [applause] 
  Mr. Chairman, we are gathered here today to tell each other: 
We are here to publicly show our united national will and to 
undertake to each other that we will protect this freedom and 
these rights with everything at our disposal until we die or 
triumph. This we undertake to each other. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the big question is -- one of the big 
questions: What is the threat to this nation. What is the 
threat to our nation, //and ladies and gentlemen, I would like 
to deal with this threat in English, because I've got in my 
possession a document of the South African Communist Party 
[SACP], and it deals with Operation Sunrise, which is an 
extension of Operation Vula. And in this document they say the 
dangers for them, one of the dangers, which will ensure that 
they do not achieve their goals -- if the agenda of the South 
African Communist Party is exposed to the international 
community, and therefore I challenge the press today. If you 
want a communist government in South Africa, then you must 
remain silent, but if you ... if you object, and if you want to 
resist to a communist takeover in South Africa then you must 
expose the plan of the South African Communist Party, not only 
to the inhabitants of South Africa, but to the whole 
international community [applause], because sir, this ... this 
plan is taking place and is developing in South Africa, and in 
this document it is stated. It deals with Operation Sunrise, 
under the heading, yes, danger for us and that you must expose 
to the world. 
  //Their aims: Our main objective which was and still is to 
seize power. Our underground structures -- their underground 
structures -- will have to deliver during this period. We must 
secure a two- thirds majority. A big event just before the 
elections will help greatly, perhaps similar to the death of 
Hani, will do it for us. The anger that such an event will 
precipitate amongst the people will serve as a powerful 
stimulus, say for instance the death of Mandela. If there is 
anything sinister about his death it would suit us at that stage. 
  //They say the South African Communist Party is firmly in 
control of the ANC [African National Congress]. We secure a 
leadership position in the ANC, COSATU [Congress of South 
African Trade Unions], SANCO [South African National Civic 
Organization], and in the Women's League and other 
organizations. The ANC will in actual fact be our shadow 
parliament. The ANC will be there. Their strategies: We at 
the same time launch Operation Sunrise, this strategy is based 
more or less on the Vula formula. Ciskei was to be a test 
ground for the insurrectionists within our party. The aim was 
to develop a domino effect, of partial interaction in Ciskei, 
Bophuthatswana, and kwaZulu. Venda and Transkei were ours 
already, and if we could manipulate events so that the other 
three collapsed, it would be possible to instigate a national 
insurrection.// 
  //It has happened. We have witnessed it. It has happened. 
They said: Destroy the security force, then we embark on a 
full program to weaken their security powers. Operation Hunter, 
inter alia, with Operation Hunter we hope to get rid of the bad 
elements in the police. That is happening in front of your eyes 
-- to establish a communist state in three phases. Phase one 
until after the elections, second phase will start right after 
the elections. Transformation from capitalism to socialism will 
take place during the second phase. Want to restruct in order 
to ... [pauses] The capitalists want to reconstruct in order to 
make profit. That is, of course, not our aim. We want to use 
reconstruction to transform South Africa into a worker state. 
Phase three, once the socialist struggle has been completed the 
third and final phase will start, in order to transform our 
socialist South Africa into a classless, communist state. We 
cannot allow farmers to own land that belongs to the people. 
The Afrikaner homeland will never be allowed.// 
  Sir, this is the strategy and this is the plan of the South 
African Communist Party, and it is being realized in front of 
your eyes, step for step, without any exception. What can we 
deduce from this? This revolutionary, communist takeover is 
unfolding according to plan, and now we ask the question: Why is 
the government allowing this? Because, Sir, if we have this 
information at our disposal then the government also has this 
information at its disposal. The reason it is allowing this is 
because it is a willing partner to the execution of this plan. 
Sir, and I challenge the government and the state president, if 
you want to be a willing partner why did you not at least inform 
the people of South Africa about this plan unfolding now, one 
which you must be aware of. Why did you not at least inform the 
people. Sir, we see in advertisements the electorate is 
supporting the ANC and the SACP, but the government has put them 
in this position, enabling them to make South Africa a communist 
state. 
  Mr. Chairman, with this plan they say a two-thirds majority 
with or without violence. If they can get it without violence 
then good, but Sir, to encourage protests and violence in order 
to intimidate people so that they can win the election -- for 
this reason there is no hope of a free and fair election in 
South Africa -- no hope. 
  For this reason I want to tell the state president: Sir, it 
is this constitution, it is this political dispensation he is 
busy with, it is these revolutionaries setting South Africa 
alight, and for this reason it is his duty to postpone this 
election because there will not be a free and fair election in 
South Africa, because there is still no solution. [applause] 
There still is no solution for South Africa. Sir, there is no 
solution, no dispensation which will bring peace. 
  Sir, I want to ask why the Goldstone Commission is not 
investigating these evil plans of the South African Communist 
Party. Why is it not investigating ... [pauses] Sir, in this 
document it is clearly stated: //The struggle against the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] in Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area must be intensified and it is 
taking place at this very moment. It is taking place.// But Mr. 
Chairman, the Goldstone Commission is not investigating this 
intensification of violence in Natal. No, he is keeping himself 
busy by discrediting honorable policemen, against whom no 
charges were laid. 
  Mr. Chairman, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei have already been 
destabilized. Now the charge is against kwaZulu and the 
question is Sir: The Goldstone Commission was responsible for 
this on two occasions -- for the destruction of the South 
African Defense Force and the South African Police's top 
management structure. Since 1992 a few hundred police and army 
officers, ranked as Colonels and higher, have been removed from 
the structures in this manner and the top structure has thus 
been destabilized. For this reason Mr. Chairman, not one of 
these men were ever found guilty. A legal, tested, valid 
complaint has not been lodged against any of them, but these 
things are happening, and the question now: Is it not time for 
the Goldstone Commission to be investigated for its role in 
South Africa. [applause] 
  Mr. Chairman, with this unfolding communist onslaught and 
threat to South Africa, the time has come for each person today 
to finally choose if he will resist this, if the Afrikaner 
nation will rise up, or if it will allow this takeover to take 
root. 
  For this reason, Sir, I want to say that the decision does 
not only rest with every farmer, it does not only rest with 
every housewife or every mother, it rests with every security 
force member in South Africa, it rests with every state official 
in South Africa. It is every worker in South Africa who will 
have to decide if we are to be led to the slaughter in this new 
South Africa, or if we will enforce our own free, rightful 
homeland in South Africa. 
  Sir, these men who marched a short while ago are the BC 
[Boer 
Commando] who were formed over a long period as a result of the 
suppression of the agricultural sector and as a result of the 
general security threat increasing in intensity. These men will 
not kneel down to communist domination and we say to these men: 
We stand with you. We will, together with you, not kneel down. 
These men have continually contributed to the expansion of the 
security system of this country and still forms the backbone of 
this system. They come from within the nation to the defense of 
the entire nation and in solidarity with our people in our 
cities. From Monday we will arrange for facilities to be made 
available at our National Front's head office, concerning 
registration of members of our nation who are prepared and 
willing to join this well-disciplined organization. 
  Mr. Chairman, every fellow countryman has now reached a 
crossroads. The choice is either freedom in the homeland or 
subjection in the new South Africa. That is the choice we have, 
Sir, and I say everyone must choose because one must ask the 
question, what is the fate of the policeman, the soldier, the 
civil servant, the worker, the farmer, the entrepreneur in the 
new South Africa? Mrs. Winnie Mandela said last week at 
Virginia: //The ANC will give priority to its supporters when it 
provides jobs after the April election. We will prioritize for 
our comrades. We are going to provide employment for all of 
you, starting with the comrades who served in prison for our 
(?cause).// Starting with the comrades, Sir, that is the 
situation facing our people, our workers. Not merit, not 
dedication, not skill, but //comrades who served in prisons in 
the cause of the South African Communist Party.// 
  Let me show you how this has been applied in Zimbabwe. In 
Zimbabwe there are now 26 permanent secretaries who are heads of 
departments. There are no whites among them. There are 73 
deputy secretaries, 3 of them whites. There are 147 under 
secretaries, with only 11 whites. Twenty-four ambassadors, not 
one of them white. 
  Job security, pensions... If there are people in South 
Africa today who ought to be concerned about their pensions, it 
is the civil servants. If there are people who have the right 
to demand the payment of their pensions -- and an ANC-SACP 
government has promised that they will use the pension funds for 
job creation -- then it is our people, those who will be losing 
their jobs, whose pensions will be used. They have the right to 
demand that their pensions be paid out. 
  Mr. Chairman, double standards are being applied. Our people 
who are in prison are not granted amnesty, but APLA [Azanian 
People's Liberation Army] and MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of 
the Nation; ANC military wing] members who are responsible for 
murder and terrorism, who are destabilizing Natal against the 
IFP and others, they are granted amnesty. 
  So, we say the Afrikaner nation is demanding that their 
people be granted amnesty, and that they be either charged or 
released. 
  Mr. Chairman, we choose the path of freedom in a homeland. 
We are not taking anything from anyone. We have had the lion's 
share in the building of this country, and we will not establish 
our homeland through anarchy. We have never been the aggressor, 
but we will defend our freedom and all that is justly ours. 
Sir, we prefer that the solution in South Africa be a peaceful 
one, but we will not allow ourselves to be forced into surrender 
by violence. 
  The Afrikaner has not lived selfishly in this country. We 
control the production of food. The civil service cannot 
function without the Afrikaner Boer nation. The factories and 
the mines cannot function without the Afrikaner Boer nation. 
The security forces cannot function without the Afrikaner Boer 
nation. So we demand that we be accommodated. We will not be 
satisfied with anything less than our rightful freedom and 
self-determination. If we are not accommodated, if we are 
pressured, we will not be the ones responsible for the chaos 
which will ensue. It will be those who are pressuring us. We 
will never bow to the communists. 
  Mr. Chairman, we have established our representative council 
to plan, coordinate, and act on behalf of our people. We are in 
the process of creating civic councils. These comprise one 
council with serving councillors elected by our people, and in 
areas where we do not have representation other people will be 
appointed. Their task will be to attend to the safety of our 
people because we are aware of the domino effect. First it was 
Bophuthatswana, then Ciskei, now it is kwaZulu's turn. The 
Afrikaner nation is next to be forced into submission through 
violence. So it will be the task of the civic councils to 
defend our people, to ensure that our taxes are used for the 
benefit of our people. If voters have problems, these must be 
attended to. Pressure must be exercised on the National Party 
and other councils to see that they act in the interests of the 
voters, and to set up civic councils in every town. A number of 
these councils are present here today -- Pretoria, 
Bronkhorstspruit, Brits, Breyten, Akasia, Verwoerdburg, 
Hartbeespoort, and others. 
  Our next task has to do with the voice of our people, Radio 
Pretoria. I ask you, do you accept responsibility for the voice 
of our people? Do you accept responsibility for its 
maintenance? Do you demand that that voice be heard? What is 
the answer? Do you demand it? It has been established with our 
money, with our skills. We did not ask for anything from anyone. 
  Our next step is to set up a security advisory council to 
see 
to the overall safety of our people. 
  We have adopted a constitution for our homeland. A 
constitution is not merely a document detailing a state's 
management structure. It is a living document which expresses a 
nation's character, its being, its deepest convictions, 
traditions, symbols, and ideals. That is why the French 
Constitution is different from the Germans. That is why our 
constitution differs from that of the new South Africa. The 
major features of our constitution are its commitment to 
Christianity, with the recognition of the freedom of religion; 
Afrikaans and English as official languages; a republican form 
of state; a national assembly consisting of representatives 
directly elected in general elections; a state president and 
executive council; independent courts; two levels of government 
consisting of the national assembly and the local council; 
citizenship for members of the Boer Afrikaner nation; 
citizenship as a precondition for the right to vote. 
Noncitizens are protected under international law and the bill 
of rights and duties contained in the constitution. Special 
majorities are needed to amend the constitution, and 51 percent 
of the members of the national assembly may call a referendum to 
amend the constitution. Disqualification of members of the 
assembly who act in defiance of their election mandate. The 
maintenance of the free market system. The right to private 
property [words indistinct] the flag and Die Stem [The Voice -- 
present national anthem]. 
  In order to maintain good relations with other nations, we 
seek a confederal system involving economic cooperation and 
political independence. 
  Mr. Chairman, I now move to the important matter of the 
right 
of the Afrikaner people to land in South Africa. Nations become 
independent on their own territory. Between the Second World 
War and the late eighties no nation became independent, no new 
state emerged. But since the nineties one new state after 
another has come into being because nations are becoming free in 
their own territory. 
  We have asked for a referendum to determine where the 
Afrikaners are who wish to be included in a homeland, and where 
those are who do not wish to be included in that homeland. That 
was the democratic way of doing things, but it was denied us. 
So we conducted our own surveys to determine the will of the 
people, and today we indicate to you soft borders -- not final 
borders -- of where our people wish to have their state. In all 
four provinces of South Africa people have indicated their 
desire to be part of a homeland. I say to you there are already 
parts of South Africa which belong to other peoples, which are 
independent states, self-governing states. There is also 
farming and urban land belonging to colored and Indian people. 
Those areas are not part of the Afrikaner Boer nation's land. 
There are also parts of the country which are already occupied 
by other nations, for example the urban areas around Pretoria, 
around Johannesburg. We do not lay claim to those areas. Then 
there are some of our people who have indicated that they do not 
want to be part of the homeland. Those are the people like Carl 
Niehaus of the ANC and Dawie de Villiers of the National Party. 
We do not wish to force them to become part of our homeland. 
We know they choose the new South Africa. To them we say, we 
grant you the new South Africa, but do not force it upon us, and 
we are only to eager to get rid of that baggage. 
  Mr. Chairman, our surveys have shown that the people of 
Natal, for example -- with the exception of northern Natal -- 
have said they do not wish to be part of the new South Africa; 
they want to share a new dispensation with the Zulus. The 
people of northern Natal have indicated that they wish to become 
part of a homeland. That matter will be negotiated with the Zulu 
nation. 
  But the Afrikaner Boer nation has an indisputable right to 
the internationally recognized Boer Republics of the Transvaal 
and the Orange Free State. We demand that right. It is our 
inalienable right. So with the exception of those areas which 
do not belong to us, and with the exception of those areas 
already occupied by other nations, as I indicated, and with the 
exception of those areas such as Johannesburg, whose people 
showed no desire in being part of this new republic of ours... 
Mr. Chairman, outside these historical areas there are large 
concentrations of Afrikaners, such as in the Cape Province, who 
have an age-old right to be part of our homeland. Just as there 
are people within the two historical republics who do not want 
to be part of the homeland, so too there are people in the Cape 
Province who want to be part of it. We say -- and our people 
have already decided so -- that Pretoria was historically the 
capital of the Afrikaner nation, and therefore it must be the 
capital of the Afrikaner nation's homeland. 
  In spite of reports in the newspapers, the majority of the 
people of Pretoria showed in the survey that they wish to be 
part of the Boer Republic. It is also a fact that in those 
areas outside the homeland where people have said they do not 
want to be a part of the homeland, one finds a minority of our 
compatriots who also want to be part of the homeland, but the 
overriding opinion of the communities there are against it. So 
what is their position? We believe they can be citizens of our 
state, and just as the Jewish nation has a refuge, Afrikaners 
around the world will have a refuge. They can embrace this 
homeland. We can serve them, we can negotiate on their behalf. 
We are going to maintain first-world standards in our homeland, 
and Afrikaners will have a refuge there. 
  We seek permanent peace and a permanent, peaceful solution 
for South Africa. But there is no such thing. It is not in the 
constitution, it is not on the negotiating table. Chaos is 
increasing. We want a permanent, peaceful solution. Matthew 
Chapter 5, Verse 9, reads: Blessed are the peacemakers, for 
they shall be called the children of God. What does the present 
constitution offer? It was drawn up by communists, its drafting 
was dominated by communists. It is a constitution for 
communists which totally rejects the authority of God, so we say 
it is not our duty to respect that which they have created. 
They are responsible for the chaos. Our task is to bring down 
the authority of the anti-Christ. Matthew Chapter 5, Verse 11 
reads: Blessed are you who are reviled and persecuted for my 
sake. That is why the Afrikaner has his back to the wall. The 
Afrikaner is not prepared to surrender his freedom. 
  Mr. Chairman, this constitution carries the germ of 
destruction. Wars are waged over land. Wars are waged over 
ethnicity. Wars are waged over religion. This constitution does 
not provide for these things. It does not provide land for our 
people or for others. It does not provide for the 
self-determination of peoples. It does not provide for us to 
serve our God in our own land. Provision must be made for this 
before there can be peace. And not only for our people. Our 
people and the Zulus want their freedom; others have been forced 
into submission. Our demands must be accommodated in order that 
there be peace in South Africa. 
  The final solution will not be achieved overnight, because 
they are moving in the wrong direction. If the rights of others 
to govern themselves are recognized, the stranglehold will ease 
and South Africa will achieve peace. We know we will again be 
free; when and how depends on the nation. We have gathered here 
today to demonstrate that our desire remains unchanged. We have 
demonstrated here today that we are continuing along the road to 
freedom, to self-determination in our own homeland. 
  Throughout the history of our struggle for freedom we know 
that no other nation has ever come to our assistance. Our 
people have always had only one refuge to turn to, and that has 
been the King of Kings. We seek no enmity with any nation or 
country, but we commit ourselves today irrevocably to the Holy 
Trinity. We know that, as in the past, under God's guidance, 
our people will arrive in our homeland, free under our own flag, 
as a free nation, to serve our Creator. 
  I ask you all, friends, that we accept this declaration of 
intent. We, as representatives of the Boer Afrikaner nation 
gathered here today, believe totally that God the Holy Trinity 
determines the fate of nations and therefore our fate. And 
because we believe, in accordance with internationally accepted 
norms and principles, that it is the God-given right of every 
nation and therefore our nation's right to be free; and because 
we are convinced that peace can only be assured if every 
peace-loving nation is allowed to govern itself; and because the 
Boer Afrikaner nation will never accept subjection, enslavement, 
or tyranny from any foreign authority; and because the nation is 
determined, with all the means at its disposal, even with its 
blood, to restore its freedom in its own fatherland: Therefore 
we declare here and now that it is our firm intention, if 
allowed, to peacefully govern ourselves before 27 April 1994 in 
our own8independent state through the structures already created 
for that purpose. 
  But at the same time, if we are not allowed to declare the 
freedom of the Boer Afrikaner nation in a peaceful manner, we 
commit ourselves, and undertake hereby, to reestablish and 
confirm the freedom of the Boer Afrikaner nation with whatever 
means at our disposal, against anyone who threatens the freedom 
of the nation or in any way whatsoever attempts to interfere 
with it. We declare this for and on behalf of the Afrikaner 
nation. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise [words indistinct] 
support me in this undertaking [words in distinct] attach it to 
the front door of the Old Council Chamber where our nation's 
government met, and where our nation's government will again 
meet in the future. I thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by G. Arde] </F>
  [Text] Pietermaritzburg March 26 SAPA -- Natal Midlands 
branch of the African National Congress [ANC] on Saturday warned 
that if drastic measures were not taken in Natal the province 
would be on brink of full-scale war. In a memorandum to the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] -- delivered by up to 
10,000 ANC supporters who marched to Loop Street police station 
-- the ANC also said it rejected any postponement of the April 
elections. 
  "We, the people of Natal, want to make it clear that any 
postponement of the elections (nationally or in Natal) would 
plunge this country into a disaster and turn it into a 
wasteland." 
  The ANC's memorandum went on to condemn the government for 
"continued sponsorship of the war in Natal by the South African 
Police through its very top generals". The memorandum was 
referring to recent disclosures made before the Goldstone 
Commission on political violence. ? The ANC's memorandum 
included a number of demands aimed at creating a climate for 
free politicking in kwaZulu/Natal. The organisation called for, 
among other things, the takeover of the kwaZulu Police by the 
SAP [Sout African Police], and an end to kwaZulu government 
paramilitary training camps. 
  Addressing supporters before the march, ANC Midlands leader 
Harry Gwala warned Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi that his days were numbered. "Gatsha should 
try to read events because he's only got 31 days to breathe and 
kwaZulu will be finished." 
  Mr Gwala also lashed out at the Democratic Party [DP] in 
Natal, which on friday called for a postponement of the 
elections because of the volatile climate in the province. He 
said the DP had "become spoilers like the IFP". 
  Mr Gwala warned of escalating violence if the elections were 
postponed, saying "there will be more violence because no-one 
can stop us from going forward to elections". "We want to decide 
who will govern this country," he said. 
  The ANC Midlands leader said his organisation wanted peace, 
but he urged his opponents in the IFP not to "play with fire" by 
denying political campaigning in Natal. 
  He also called on King Goodwill Zwelithini not to act as 
"the 
king of Inkatha" but as a Zulu monarch. 
  Addressing minority groups in the audience, Mr Gwala said 
voting for State President F W de Klerk's National Party was 
like "backing a dead horse". 
  Saturday's activities passed without incident, police said. 
ANC Regional Secretary Mr Sifiso Nkabinda said no reports of 
violence had been received by 3.30PM. However, three ANC 
supporters were seriously injured when the bus they were 
travelling on to pietermaritzburg overturned. 
  Traffic officials at the scene, on Duncan McKenzie Drive 
just 
outside Pietermaritzburg, said another 50 passengers were hurt, 
but none were seriously injured. The bus slipped on to its side 
coming around a bend. Police said enthusiastic passengers were 
jumping around in the vehicle, which may be caused it to 
overturn.

  [Text] Baghdad, 27 Mar (INA) -- His Excellency leader 
President Saddam Husayn has chaired a joint session of the 
Revolution Command Council [RCC] and the Iraq Command of the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP]. 
  The meeting reviewed the visit to New York by an Iraqi 
delegation led by Tariq 'Aziz, deputy prime minister and member 
of the RCC and the Iraqi Command of the ASBP, and the outcome of 
his contacts with the members of the UN Security Council. 
  After the meeting, an official spokesman made the following 
statement: 
  Our delegation noticed that there are circles in the 
Security 
Council that may grow into a majority that have begun to sense 
the harshness of the blockade to which the Iraqi people are 
being subjected. These circles are taking a positive outlook on 
Iraq's implementation of the obligations enshrined in Resolution 
687. The nations that represent this trend stressed the need 
for Rolf Ekeus to present a monthly report to the council about 
the Special Commission's relations with Iraq and for this to 
lead to the commission setting the beginning and period of what 
was called the test in order for the Security Council to move to 
the implementation of Paragraph 22, which should not take long. 
  Some council members mentioned six months as a suitable 
period to test the implementation mechanism. Other member 
nations wondered why the period could not be a little shorter or 
longer to make sure that Ekeus draws up his timetable on clear 
and practical grounds rather than be swayed by political goals 
that do not meet with the agreement of the council's members who 
moved from a new positive position in their approach to this 
issue. 
  This constructive and fair position was shared by France, 
Russia, and the PRC, along with other nations like Brazil, 
Pakistan, Nigeria, and Rwanda, among others. On the other hand, 
the United States and its supporters, or the countries that are 
influenced by its analyses and intentions, view things from the 
perspective of fabricating excuses to drag out the blockade on 
our people and avoid a commitment to a fixed date for 
implementing Paragraph 22, which allows Iraq to export its 
products, including oil, to the outside world 
  The conclusion we have drawn is that an important positive 
development has occurred in the position of important and 
influential circles in the Security Council. This development 
requires follow-up and encouragement in order to know for 
certain whether or not there is should be serious and imminent 
hope for the lifting of the injustice done to Iraq. The next 
two months will be important to make clear conclusions in light 
of what President Saddam Husayn announced in his address to the 
council of ministers on Sunday, 13 March 1994, the first day of 
the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. After two months, the ASBP command and 
the RCC will be able to make the suitable decisions. 
  The official spokesman said: On this occasion, we pay 
special tribute to the states whose positions were clear in this 
direction. These specifically included France, Russia, China, 
and Brazil. We appeal to these countries to develop their 
positions to become clearer and more influential within the 
Security Council and the circles in which they have influence. 
While following up all the details of these developments, our 
great people will not forget the fair stands of these states and 
whoever support this just position. It is obvious that the basis 
for the development in the stands of these countries vis-a-vis 
Iraq is the firmness and patience of our great people; their 
active social, political, and economic life; our people's strong 
adherence to their future; and their firm and unshakeable faith 
in their nationalism. 
  The ASBP command and the RCC adopted a series of 
instructions 
and resolutions to follow up the political and diplomatic move 
in the coming period and until the next Security Council review 
[of the sanctions on Iraq] in the second half of May.

the composition of his reshuffled government. General Idriss 
Nagri, the Army Chief of Staff, has been appointed Defense 
Minister. The 38-member cabinet does not include any 
representatives from the radical opposition, in spite of 
repeated appeals by President Bongo for a government open to 
other parties. Most of the ministers from the previous 
government remain in the cabinet. Jean Ping moves from the 
Mines Ministry to foreign affairs. He is replaced by Paul 
Toungoui, former Finance Minister.

  [Excerpts] The ceremonies marking the swearing-in of the 
deputies and ministers of the transitional period did not 
materialize today in spite of having been announced for today by 
the president of the Republic himself, Mr. Juvenal Habyarimana. 
He did not present himself at the National Development Council 
for reasons the director of the office tried to justify. Mr. 
Enoch Ruhigira, director of the Office of the President, [words 
indistinct] without difficulty that even if the problem of the 
Coalition for the Defense of the Republic that the president of 
the Republic used as a pretext found a solution, other reasons 
would arise. Mr. Enoch Ruhigira wanted to make people believe 
that the misunderstanding between the Republican Democratic 
Movement and Islamic Democratic Party could only be solved by 
the leaders of the factions of parties known to be hostile to 
the peace agreement. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister reiterated today that the president of 
the 
Republic remains the only known obstacle.

  [Text] The UN secretary general's special representative, 
the apostolic nuncio who is also the dean of the diplomatic 
corps, the facilitator's representative, and the ambassadors who 
were observers at the Arusha peace process met yesterday to 
study the obstacles to the establishment of the Transitional 
National Assembly and government. 
  They appealed to the Rwandan parties to show a spirit of 
compromise and to overcome outstanding obstacles. They stressed 
the urgent need for a solution in view of the political and 
economic timetable. After studying the agreements on power 
sharing, all political parties which were legal on the date of 
the signing of the protocol and the Rwandan Patriotic Front must 
be represented in the Transitional National Assembly, once 
formed, on condition that they respect the peace agreement. 
  It will be up to the commission on unity and national 
reconciliation to that each political force respects the code of 
political ethics. Violations are punishable by exclusion from 
the institutions, as decided by the supreme court. 
  They recommended that the commission be set up without delay 
after the establishment of the institutions and that it be 
charged with evaluating the behavior of parties represented 
within the institutions. They stressed that if this principle 
is respected by all parties, there should be no further cause 
for delay in the establishment of the institutions. Each 
political force should restrain itself from trying to create new 
problems among or within political parties. A constructive 
attitude is indispensable for the satisfactory conclusion of the 
ceremonies to establish the two broad-based institutions and for 
their efficient operation.

  [Excerpts] The ceremony for setting up the remaining 
broad-based transitional institutions, which were scheduled to 
take place this morning at the National Development Council 
[CND] has not taken place. [passage omitted] 
  As we have already stressed, no single part of the ceremony 
has yet taken place. President Habyarimana requested that the 
Islamic Democratic Party [PDI]-appointed deputy (Omar Ali) be 
replaced by his protege, Mr. Juma Kibata, and that candidate 
deputy Kamali of the Republican Democratic Movement [MDR] power 
[as heard] be among the 11 MDR deputies and, finally, that the 
Coalition for the Defense of the Republic [CDR] be allowed to 
sit in the broad-based Transitional National Assembly. 
  These conditions put forward by President Habyarimana, with 
a 
view to setting up the broad-based Transitional National 
Assembly, emerge in a letter which President Habyarimana 
addressed last night to Prime Minister Madame Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana. But it is worth noting that madame prime 
minister issued a list of deputies on 19 March, which President 
Habyarimana approved. President Habyarimana has therefore used 
double talk. That is why at the CND, where the swearing-in 
ceremonies were to have taken place, one could find two PDI 
candidate deputies for just one seat, one MDR candidate deputy, 
who was not mentioned on the list of deputies, and finally a 
representative of the CDR, whose name is Jean Bosco Barayagwiza. 
  Following these unexpected, last-minute problems, the 
institutions were not set up as scheduled. So, those who signed 
the Arusha Peace Accord: The Rwandan Government and the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] assisted by representatives of the United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda and friendly countries 
which helped in the Arusha peace talks, deemed it appropriate to 
hold a meeting to examine these three cases. 
  At the end of this meeting, Prime Minister Madame Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana stressed that after having examined the cases of 
the PDI and of candidate deputy Kamali of the MDR power [as 
heard], candidate deputies Mr. Juma Kibata and Kamali were 
advised to submit their cases to the relevant authorities, that 
is to say the judiciary, and await its decision. 
  Regarding the case of the CDR, the latter requests that it 
be 
given a seat in the broad-based Transitional National Assembly, 
which the RPF does not reject, however the peace accord should 
not be violated. Indeed, according to Article 51 of the 
protocol agreement on power-sharing, I quote: All political 
parties legally recognized in Rwanda on the date of the signing 
of the present protocol agreement, and the RPF, will be 
represented in the Transitional National Assembly, provided that 
they adhere to and respect the provisions of the peace accord. 
[passage omitted] 
  The CDR is far from meeting this preliminary condition, or 
from showing commitment to respecting the path defined by the 
Arusha Accord. This is demonstrated particularly by its 
sectarian practices. In this regard, the RPF thinks that it is 
still too early for the CDR to join the Transitional National 
Assembly. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Zaire, President Mobutu says he is prepared to 
govern with Etienne Tshisekedi, the prime minister who was 
appointed by the sovereign national conference. According to 
President Mobutu's personal adviser, (Muamba Tshisindi), the 
head of state said: I am prepared to appoint Etienne Tshisekedi 
as prime minister only if the political climate eases. The 
adviser says the High Council of the Republic would then be 
asked to continue the search for a consensus on a text based on 
political compromise. Mr. (Tshisindi) said other 
representatives from his country and he had been sent to present 
this plan to several foreign countries. Mohamed Youssoufou 
Saliou interviewed him in Paris yesterday. 
  [Begin recording] [(Tshisindi)] [Words indistinct] we would 
have settled our differences which are now making it impossible 
to organize free and fair elections. 
  [Saliou] As President Mobutu's adviser, do you think that 
the 
head of state is now ready to make all these concessions so that 
the situation on the ground can improve, and so that Etienne 
Tshisekedi becomes prime minister once again as intended by the 
sovereign national conference? 
  [(Tshisindi)] [Words indistinct] it all depends on 
Tshisekedi's political will. President Mobutu has already said 
that he will appoint whoever is chosen as transitional prime 
minister, including Tshisekedi. If Tshisekedi decides to 
present his candidacy and is able to obtain a parliamentary 
majority or consensus the head of state will appoint him prime 
minister. [Words indistinct] where we go through an interim 
government, if the differences are settled in the end, if the 
conditions set for Tshisekedi on the formation of a national 
union government are met, we will get back to the current 
position which is [words indistinct] in that case too, the head 
of state will appoint him prime minister. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The multinational forces from the Western countries 
and the United States, the last of whose soldiers left 25 March 
as planned, first arrived in the Republic of Somalia on 9 
September [as heard] 1992 to do something about the painful 
situation then prevailing in the country, to which the 
international community could not turn a blind eye. The varying 
reception accorded these forces by the Somali leaders opened the 
door to the arrival of many more troops, which at first greatly 
feared [words indistinct] among the entire Somali people. 
  The first forces to come to our country sought to save the 
[words indistinct] who were dying barely a mile away from our 
country's main port, which was full of food [words indistinct] 
looted by the bandits. These bandits ignored the starvation 
killing their brothers. The foreign forces came to protect the 
relief workers who were threatened by the bandits [words 
indistinct] who only wanted to loot the food. This was a 
difficult time for our country. It was surprising how quickly 
the forces took the food wherever it was needed [words 
indistinct]. 
  These welcome first steps taken by the forces from the 
developed world pleased the entire Somali people and revived 
their hope in the future, which had been undermined by the 
bandits throughout the country. 
  After these forces totally defeated the problems in the 
country [words indistinct]. In addition to delivering aid, the 
U.S. and allied forces [words indistinct] also did useful work 
in destroying the technicals used in looting and patrolling 
areas. They also helped advance peace in the country by 
stabilizing its political system, settling differences, 
organizing Somali aid and reconciliation conferences, resettling 
and assisting displaced people, streamlining reconstruction in 
the country, building welfare centers, creating a Somali police 
force and courts, opening schools and hospitals, and much more. 
  They did all this in an energetic and tolerant spirit [words 
indistinct]. While these forces were doing such good work, they 
unfortunately encountered mistakes as a result of which they 
suffered loss of life. The killing of the Good Samaritans who 
had come to help us shocked the people of the donor countries to 
the point they wanted to withdraw their troops, particularly 
when their good work was being replaced by civil war. 
  The withdrawal of the troops was first announced by the U.S. 
Government, to take effect within 16 months [as heard] and the 
Western countries followed suit, fearing difficulties with the 
Somalis. The United States left behind only 50 soldiers to 
guard its embassy in Somalia. All the forces made it clear they 
were sorry to leave at a time when there was not even a central 
administration. [Word indistinct] their departure coincided 
with a time when Somali leaders arrived at a peaceful agreement 
in Nairobi, belying the claim that Somalis will return to 
fighting. 
  The forces which left under the leadership of the United 
States have truly done important and praiseworthy work for the 
Somalis, who harbor affection for them and wish them peace and a 
safe journey. The Somali people are urged to participate in the 
reconstruction of the country.

  [Text] Leaders from various communities in Lower Juba 
region in Somalia last night signed an agreement in Nairobi that 
will end violence in the Lower Juba region. The agreement was 
signed through the facilitation of the UN Operations in Somalia, 
UNOSOM, after two weeks of negotiations. 
  The Lower Juba region, which has in the past few months 
experienced violence resulting in loss of property and human 
lives, is one area with great economic potential in Somalia. 
Following the agreement, a reconciliation conference for the 
region will be held in Kismaayo on 8 April. 
  Releasing the agenda of the conference today, the Somali 
leaders agreed that the principle of reconciliation should be 
based on dialogue, while all differences be settled through 
Somali ethics and traditions. Among other things, the Somali 
leaders stated was that a mechanism of restoring both mobile and 
immobile properties to the rightful owners should be established.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the 
president of the Republic of Somalia, called on the Somali 
people, to choose between two options: Either that the peace 
agreement signed in Nairobi should become a reality, or that 
peace should be finally realized at home, in Somalia [as heard] 
because this nation has gone through four years of civil war and 
destruction, and should not undergo more fighting and suffering. 
It is true that the Somali National Alliance should think about 
ways to bring about peace in the country. 
  The president said that he believes that 100 percent of the 
Somali people believe that peace should prevail, and hence he 
hopes that the politicians will respect the wishes of the 
people, since politicians are the servants of the people.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Farah Mohamed Dur Gube; read by Khadijah </F>
Mohamed Jim'aleh] 
  [Excerpts] Over 30 years ago Somalia achieved its 
independence from the European colonizers. Our country was 
ruled by various governments which were all oppressors and not 
founded on Islam. The last of these was that of the dictator 
Siad Barre. [passage omitted] Following these corrupt 
governments, Somalia underwent four years of chaos with no law 
and order, and was beset by many problems. [passage omitted] 
  Almighty and powerful Allah has prescribed a comprehensive 
constitution to govern the universe we live in. There is no 
doubt that whoever deviates from Allah's constitution in favor 
of a manmade one and follows the crooked path which Satan has 
made deceptively alluring will lose out and perish. [passage 
omitted] 
  How, then, can this 34-year old problem be resolved? It is 
simple. The solution is to follow the holy Koran, which is the 
constitution revealed by God to administer this world. There is 
no doubt that God will help and will save whoever follows his 
path and distances himself from the commands of the jinni and 
human devils. [passage omitted] Therefore, we should live and 
govern ourselves sincerely in accordance with Allah's book in 
order to achieve success both in this world and the next.

  [Text] Despite the awesome offensive that the People's 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] have launched 
throughout Angolan territory, the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] remains committed to the Lusaka 
peace talks. Inside Angola, though, it is war that is uppermost 
on the minds of Eduardo dos Santos' men, the only career they 
have been able to follow. 
  For Menongue, here in Cuando Cubango Province, the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] 
chief has ordered his troops to attack FAPLA's defense lines 
around Menongue. However, the courageous Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] have responded. According to a 
senior officer on the Menongue Front, the FALA forces will 
continue to defend their gains and force the MPLA-PT to 
understand that it is no more than a paper tiger and that it 
will not achieve anything through the force of arms. Dino 
Jorge, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
correspondent in Menongue, reports: 
  [Begin Jorge recording] In addition to targeting 
UNITA-controlled areas, the principal aim of that MPLA-PT 
offensive is to take Cuchi District. The enemy had advanced 
along three lines, with other units supporting them. It also 
enjoys cover from the FAPLA air force, which has been flying in 
from Lubango to bomb indiscriminately districts, communes, and 
villages. [end recording] 
  On 25 March, the FAPLA forces tried to attack Cuchi 
District, 
but they were halted by the glorious FALA forces, who kept them 
under intense fire when they tried to cross Chitato River, along 
the road between Menongue and Cuelei. One hour of intense fire 
was enough to put Eduardo dos Santos' military adventurers on 
hasty flight, leaving 77 soldiers killed on the ground, 
including Major Americo, commander of the 2d Battalion of 
FAPLA's 15th Regiment. Our forces also captured assorted war 
materiel. Dino Jorge reports: 
  [Begin Jorge recording] Our forces captured 28 weapons, 
including 21 AK rifles, four PKM submachine guns, three RPG-7 
rocket launchers, six RPG-7 shells, 4,000 rounds of ammunition 
for AK weapons, 1,000 rounds of ammunition for PKM submachine 
guns, and assorted documentation. We will be back with more 
details. [end recording]

Angola-Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] Riot Police engaged in intense 
fighting in Lunda Norte Province's Lucapa District, 150 km west

MPLA-PT soldiers and many civilians were killed in the clashes. 
According to sources quoted by the Voice of Resistance of the

of those clashes was that Riot Police agents had been diverting 
international aid and selling it at exorbitant prices on the 
black market for their own benefit.

  [Text] After the usual weekend break, the Angolan peace 
talks resumed in the Zambian capital today. It has become 
increasingly difficult to know what is going on in Lusaka 
because the information blackout [preceding word in English] has 
become more rigorous. Information from diplomatic sources reveal 
the mediator could ask the parties to bypass the discussions on 
the country's administration to the last point which is 
connected with elections. According to such sources, only after 
the conclusion of these discussions, would the parties resume 
discussions on the important point of the country's 
administration, within the framework of national reconciliation. 
Malian-born mediator Alioune Blondin Beye renewed his appeal to 
the negotiating parties to achieve a lasting peace as soon as 
possible.

  [Text] The negotiating crisis continues in Lusaka, Zambia, 
although the negotiating teams from the government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] held 
a plenary session today. In his continued efforts to prevent a 
break in the peace talks, mediator Alioune Blondin Beye decided 
to move to the last point on the working agenda -- the 
conclusion of the electoral process, which is viewed as a less 
polemical topic. All the same, the Black Cockerel's delegation 
does not seem ready to give its views on the issue. Our 
correspondent Pedro Manuel reports. 
  Good evening. The conclusion of the electoral process is 
being examined here in Lusaka. At a plenary session held here 
this morning, the mediator presented to the negotiating teams 
his views regarding the conclusion of the electoral process. 
This afternoon, the government team was examining the 
mediator's document and it will probably give a reply tomorrow. 
  There are people who say, however, that UNITA is already 
contesting the mediator's views. It does not want to discuss 
this issue now, because it says it is not ready to do so. The 
conclusion of the electoral process is the last point on the 
working agenda of this round of peace talks. 
  This does not mean, however, that agreements have been 
reached on all previous points. Alioune Blondin Beye decided to 
move forward and discuss the issue connected with the electoral 
process, while a formula is being sought to resolve the issue 
connected with the country's administration [words indistinct] 
to discuss all steps to be taken for the holding of the second 
round of presidential elections. 
  During the debates on the conclusion of the electoral 
process, the negotiators could reach an agreement on the date of 
the second round of presidential elections.

  [Text] Another military offensive by troops from the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] and mercenaries failed in Cuanza Sul Province. The 
Futungo de Belas troops had tried to recapture Quibala District, 
under the full control of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA]. According to Kapula Ndanda, 
correspondent for the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
[Vorgan], the MPLA-PT mounted from Conde a large-scale offensive 
from three points: Gabela, Ebo, and Waco-Kungo. The Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] have already 
inflicted heavy defeats on the MPLA troops since the beginning 
of the clashes in Waco-Kungo. Kapula Ndanda reports from Cuanza 
Sul. [passage indistinct] 
  In Menongue District, Cuando Cubango Province, Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos' troops carried out military actions with the aim of 
winning Cuchi District on 25 March and penetrating FALA 
defensive lines on the outskirts of Menongue. Vorgan 
correspondent in the region Abilio Jorge said the reply by the 
Angolan people's armed wing, FALA, was quick. They killed 77 
soldiers from the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola [FAPLA], including Major Americo, commander of the second 
battalion of the 15th [words indistinct], and captured a 
quantity of war materiel, including 21 AK's, four PKM's, three 
RPG-7's, six RPG-7 shells, tens of thousands of rounds of 
ammunitions and a number of documents. When carrying out the 
operations, FAPLA forces were supported by fighter planes coming 
from Lubango, which killed many civilians and destroyed villages 
and communes. 
  In Cuanza Sul Province, Eduardo dos Santos' regime has been 
killing defenseless civilians as a result of bombings by the 
Futungo de Belas aircraft. According to our correspondent Muti 
Yakivela, the MPLA-PT air force made up of Antonovs and South 
African-made Puma helicopters, indiscriminately bombed the 
residents of Cuio District at 1700 and 2200 on 22 March. The 
people killed include 12 innocent children. In the face of this 
tragic situation, the Angolan people ask Eduardo dos Santos what 
kind of democracy does he want to establish in the country with 
the massacre of innocent civilians and opposition sympathizers 
with savage bombings carried out by fighter aircraft?

  [Text] The People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola [FAPLA] have begun yet another military offensive in 
Cuanza Sul Province. Joint forces of the Futungo de Belas 
regime and mercenaries tried to take Quibala District, which is 
under the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's 
[UNITA) effective control. Capalandanda, the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent in the area, 
reports that the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] forces launched a major offensive 
along three lines -- Gabela, Ebo, and Waku Kungo -- from the 
area of Conde. Since the fighting erupted in the area of Waku 
Kungo, the FAPLA forces have already suffered heavy losses at 
the hands of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FALA]. 
  Capalandanda gives us a preliminary report from Cuanza Sul 
Province: 
  [Begin Capalandanda recording] [Words indistinct] this is a 
preliminary balance of the losses incurred by the enemy forces 
up to (?28) March. One (?BMP-1) was destroyed and 46 FAPLA 
soldiers were killed. Our forces also captured two 76-mm 
cannons, one 85-mm cannon, and two [name indistinct] vehicles 
captured [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Under the command of Lieutenant General Antas, the FAPLA 
forces have been suffering serious military defeats in Cuanza 
Sul Province. Hundreds of MPLA-PT soldiers are fleeing to the 
areas they have come from.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan was present 
this morning before the deputies at the National Assembly, where 
he presented the guidelines for the government's economic 
policy. Lazare Aka Saye has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Saye] [passage omitted] The National 
Assembly's second extraordinary session for 1994 began this 
morning in Abidjan. The session was summoned by its speaker, 
Charles Boza Donwahi, at President Henri Konan Bedie's request. 
Three main items are among those on the agenda for the session: 
A bill amending the 1993 budget bill, the 1994 general 
operating budget bill, and the 1994 Special Investment and 
Equipment Budget Bill. These three bills will be examined by 
the institution's economic and financial commission on 24 March. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his address, the speaker called on the government to 
reflect and act pragmatically, taking into account the present 
situation. According to him, the current situation is marked by, 
among other things, the CFA franc devaluation, a thorough 
revision of the tax system, rigorous management of state's 
affairs as a good head of family, and a reduction in 
unemployment through the reactivation of small- and medium-scale 
enterprises. It is also marked by the insertion of youth into 
the economy and the need to implement social measures to 
alleviate the concerns of workers, households, and the neediest 
in the social strata. These are the many real concerns to which 
the prime minister responded this morning in his statement on 
government economic policy for the years ahead. Let us listen 
to him: 
  [Begin Duncan recording] I will not forget the support 
brought by the National Assembly to the major economic and 
financial reforms which I presented on behalf of the government 
as minister in charge of economy, finance, and planning. By 
passing the bills related to these reforms, the National 
Assembly demonstrated its willingness to support our country's 
recovery efforts. Once again, I thank it for its support. It 
is in my capacity as prime minister and head of government that 
I am making today's policy statement to the National Assembly. 
On this occasion, I would once again like to say how honored I 
feel in assuming this responsibility, which was entrusted to me 
by President Henri Konan Bedie. It is under his highly 
enlightened leadership that the government's action was 
initiated, and it is already marking the country's life and 
giving a new impetus to our national policy. The change in the 
CFA franc exchange rate, the backup measures that have been 
taken, and the signing of the treaty creating the West African 
Economic and Monetary Union have deeply influenced our country's 
economic environment. 
  The government has adopted guidelines for the policy it is 
implementing, and I propose to explain the highlights of this 
policy to the deputies who, in fact, represent our compatriots 
at the National Assembly. Our policy is based on the 
reinforcement of national cohesion through solidarity and 
security, the continuation of a foreign policy whose uniqueness 
lies in seeking solutions through dialogue, in the 
implementation of a liberal economic policy which is resolutely 
aimed at restoring balance and sound, lasting growth. Peace, 
dialogue, fraternity, tolerance, solidarity, security, and 
balanced, lasting growth are in short the watchwords of our 
policy, the implementation of which I will strive to explain. 
  I will cover four sections concerning the consolidation of 
our economic and financial situation. The first section deals 
with our economic situation -- the change in the CFA franc 
exchange rate and the restoration of our economy's 
competitiveness, the restoration of public finance, the 
regularization of payments for domestic and external debts, and 
the resumption of investments. In order to make you understand 
the true importance of such a substantial change, I would like 
to briefly recall our past economic situation. What kind of 
economic situation have we had in the past? After years of 
progress, our economy, as each of us knows, was seriously 
disrupted -- important reforms were initiated to correct the 
situation. Cote d'Ivoire has been going through a difficult 
economic situation since the end of the 1980's, for reasons 
which are well known. Those reasons are: Deteriorating terms 
of trade, unstable exchange and interest rates, and internal 
management shortcomings which came to light after the economic 
boom was over. 
  The economic crisis was marked by a halt in growth, a sharp 
decline in state finances, dwindling revenues, a reduction in 
remunerated employment, a fall in public and private investments 
-- which accelerated the downward trend in economic activities 
-- and our economy's lack of competitiveness. The imbalances in 
our foreign accounts and in our state revenues prompted the 
drawing up of adjustment programs aimed at putting an end to 
this situation and correcting our structural shortcomings. 
These programs, initiated as early as 1981, involved the 
reorganization of the public sector, which underwent a shakeup; 
and the capital budget, which was drastically reduced. 
Unfortunately, as the world economic situation continued to 
deteriorate, we were obliged to pursue and expand our adjustment 
policy. 
  The program implemented in 1990 as part of the renovated 
institutions strove to reinforce the adjustment measures already 
taken and to widen the scope of reform. That program was 
comprised of two aspects. The first one was the stabilization 
of state revenues, which has almost been achieved as the budget, 
which showed a 224-billion-CFA franc deficit in 1989, was 
balanced in 1992. The second aspect comprised significant 
structural reforms aimed at favoring the return of growth. This 
is a very important element, because it enables our country to 
benefit rapidly from the new exchange rate of the CFA franc, 
coupled with comprehensive reforms in our economy and 
institutions. 
  Let me mention rapidly the main programs which were 
affected. 
They are the energy program, whose management was reorganized to 
create conditions for its development; the water system; the 
financial sector, which restored the solvency of our banks, put 
our insurance companies into order, and gave new impetus to the 
Abidjan Stock Exchange. Other programs initiated include human 
resources, which we are promoting by providing considerable 
support for the rehabilitation of the health and education 
sectors; the restoration of economic competitiveness, mainly on 
the basis of market rather than controlled prices; the 
liberalization of domestic and international trade; the easing 
up of labor laws, the granting of a more flexible tax package 
with a reduction from 50 to 35 percent in taxes on profit 
margins; the extension of the scope of the value- added tax with 
the abolition of taxes on services -- except those affecting 
bank interests; and a reduction from 11.5 to 2.5 percent in 1993 
in the taxes on salaries paid to Ivorian workers. 
  Under the 1994 draft budget, we are proposing that these 
taxes be completely abolished. Also abolished are other taxes 
such as the tourism development tax and a number of registration 
fees. Our relentless efforts to harmonize the tariff system by 
reducing the rates or streamlining docking duties has thus 
specifically benefited the importation of inputs for agriculture 
and textile industry, as well as for the chemical and metal 
industries. All these tax measures represent a revenue loss of 
more than 70 billion CFA francs, which demonstrates the 
significant support given to the manufacturing sector, and the 
sizable efforts required to offset the loss to state revenues.

  [Text] Tubmanburg, Liberia, March 28 (AFP) -- At least 80 
people died in three days of fighting between rival clans of the 
United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] in 
this town 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Monrovia. 
  The town was quiet Monday [28 March] following the clashes 
between Krahns and Mandingos which erupted Friday and raged 
around the headquarters of ULIMO, one of Liberia's armed 
factions. Some sporadic automatic weapons fire was audible from 
the bush nearby around mid-day. Forces loyal to ULIMO leader 
Alhaji Koromah had regained control of the town after Krahns, 
loyal to ULIMO military commander General Roosevelt Johnson, 
seized control from Kromah's Mandingo supporters following a 
dawn attack on Friday. 
  The final toll of the fighting could be much higher, with 
many decomposing bodies uncounted and strewing the streets of 
the town centre and outlying districts. 
  The Krahns and Mandingos are the two major ethnic groups 
within ULIMO. 
  Earlier this month a series of violent incidents between 
ULIMO members of the two rival clans left around 200 dead.

  [Text] There is no end in sight at the moment to the 
infighting at the top of Liberia's ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction. Earlier tonight the 
Mandingo leader, Alhaji Koromah, denied claims by his Krahn 
rival Roosevelt Johnson that Koromah's supporters have been 
driven out of their stronghold at Tubmanburg. 
  The allegations made on this program yesterday followed hard 
on the heels of claims that Johnson had joined forces with 
Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
faction, which have also been denied. And the ULIMO split has 
become the latest headache for Liberia's newly installed 
Transitional Council and for the ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Monitoring Group] peacekeeping force. Our 
Monrovia correspondent Ni Nartey Alison has just been to 
Tubmanburg to check the claims for himself. He telexed us this 
report [read by announcer]: 
  In Tubmanburg, ULIMO fighters loyal to Alhaji Koromah walked 
the streets brandishing assault rifles, and the odor of dead 
bloated bodies fills the air. Mohamed Dumbuya, Koromah's 
military chief told me: We are in complete control of this town 
and if Johnson claims he controls Tubmanburg let him come to 
visit his men. The town is virtually deserted with the few 
remaining residents holed up indoors as fighters strut along the 
streets. The city is also full of mass graves and the stench of 
decomposed bodies is virtually everywhere. 
  According to Dumbuya, each mass grave contains five bodies 
of dissidents and some civilians caught in crossfire during 
fighting in Tubmanburg last Friday [25 March]. Dumbuya claimed 
that over 200 Krahn forces were trapped and killed during the 
battle. He said Johnson will pay the price of those who have 
died since March 6 when the fighting started. He claimed that 
200 Mandingos were killed last week in Kakata and Bong Mine, a 
mining city 30 miles east of Tubmanburg, by Krahn forces. One 
Mandingo commander who identified himself only as Kolut told me: 
I sense that the Krahns will break away. This is why in the 
area I control, I reduce the number of Krahn men to 15. In 
fact, by now they are slaves. They are on my farm. 
  Meanwhile, more than 60 women, children, and young boys who 
fled the fighting last Friday have been rescued from hideouts in 
the surrounding forest.

  [Text] The Council of State has declared its intention to 
appeal to the West African peace monitoring group ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] to swiftly move into conflict areas to stop the carnage 
if current hostilities are not halted. Addressing a 
cross-section of citizens of Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, and Lower 
Lofa Counties in the palace of the executive mansion yesterday, 
the chairman of the Council of State, Professor David Kpomakpor, 
said since ECOMOG has the peace enforcement power under the 
Cotonou Accord, the subregional force can exercise this power to 
prevent an escalation of hostilities. 
  Prof. Kpomakpor, in his statement, expressed dismay over the 
continued fighting between the warring factions which, he noted, 
is claiming more innocent lives. He said it was disheartening 
for the factions to [words indistinct] hostilities after the 
signing of the cease-fire accord and the seating of the 
Transitional Government. The LNTG [Liberian National 
Transitional Government] chairman declared that the current 
fighting in Liberia was an exercise in futility and must be 
brought to an immediate halt. Prof. Kpomakpor emphasized that 
the Council of State will meet ECOMOG and ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] to discuss 
relevant matters pertaining to the current fighting in some 
political subdivisions of the country, following which 
appropriate actions will be taken. We have now reached a point 
in our history when Liberians must put aside all differences and 
resolve to work together in realizing the [word indistinct] 
aspirations of our people, Chairman Kpomakpor said. 
  On their part the citizens expressed concern over the 
prevailing rift among elements of the defunct [as heard] ULIMO 
in their area. The citizens are, therefore, calling on the State 
Council to ensure the speedy deployment of ECOMOG troops there. 
The citizens observed that the internal conflict in ULIMO 
borders on ethnic matters and requested the council to convene a 
meeting of the chiefs, elders, and leaders of the ethnic groups 
involved -- the Krahns and Mandingos -- to prevail on those 
fighting to stop the (?killing) and surrender their arms to 
ECOMOG. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] Fighting around ULIMO [United Liberation Movement 
for Democracy in Liberia] headquarters in Tubmanburg has put the 
Liberian peace process in serious jeopardy in the last few days, 
with plans to set up a transition council and to demobilize the 
warring factions being dealt a serious blow. The fighting 
appears to have been between two ULIMO factions -- one under 
Alhaji Koromah and supported by the Mandingo people; the other 
by Krahns, led by ULIMO's military wing chairman, Roosevelt 
Johnson. But there have also been reports that Charles Taylor's 
NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces were also 
involved in the fighting on Roosevelt Johnson's side. Well, 
today we spoke to Roosevelt Johnson himself, and on the line to 
Monrovia, Audrie Brown asked him what he knew about the fighting: 
  [Begin recording] [Johnson] Well, the fighting started early 
yesterday morning and died down in the evening. 
  [Brown] And, how many people were involved in this fighting? 
  [Johnson] Roughly, 2,000 something men went in to rescue the 
people there. 
  [Brown] Who are the people they went to rescue? 
  [Johnson] The relatives. The relatives and some other 
soldiers that were being held hostage there. 
  [Brown] What kind of losses did your side sustain? 
  [Johnson] Well, only two soldiers got wounded on the leg and 
they have been treated now in Bong Mines, and a few days ago my 
mother was slaughtered together with my two kids and my sister. 
  [Brown] You lost your mother and your children in this 
fighting? 
  [Johnson] Well, it was not actually in the fighting. They 
were coming to Tubmanburg, and they were captured by some of the 
Mandingo soldiers and they were slaughtered. 
  [Brown] So in this fighting your side are, I understand, 
Krahn soldiers and you are fighting Mandingos. Why are you 
fighting now? What is behind the latest fighting, this fighting 
that started on Friday [25 March]? 
  [Johnson] Well, it is because the Mandingo people, the few 
Mandingo people who are loyal to Koromah, continue to kill 
innocent people. Once you cannot speak Mandingo, they kill you. 
  [Brown] So when did they kill innocent people? 
  [Johnson] They have been killing them for the past three 
weeks, because as Koromah said we did not vote for Sheriff to 
become chairman on the Council, so that annoyed them and this is 
the reason why they have started disarming all other tribes, you 
know, within ULIMO, and that's when they started killing. 
  [Brown] Now, there are reports that you are fighting with 
Charles Taylor's NPFL. Can you confirm this? 
  [Johnson] This is not true. The information is completely 
misleading. I have had no connection with Taylor to get men 
from Taylor, or whatsoever connection. I don't have any 
connection with Taylor. The men that are fighting are purely 
ULIMO soldiers, and not only Krahn. What happened we.... 
[pauses] In the ULIMO we have all tribes there, and those 
soldiers that went in were not only Krahn. We have Grebo; we 
have Bassa, and other tribes mix with them. 
  [Brown] So are you in control of Tubmanburg now? 
  [Johnson] Definitely not. [as heard] Yes. I can tell you 
that my men on grounds now in Tubmanburg. 
  [Brown] If you have captured Tubmanburg, what have you done 
with the people who supported Alhaji Koromah who were still 
there? 
  [Johnson] Look, it is not our intention to kill anybody. 
Okay? So, even when we are fighting with NPFL, when we capture 
the NPFL soldiers we don't kill them. So I don't see why I 
should capture anybody from Alhaji Koromah's side and kill them. 
But the only thing is we had to move in militarily to bring the 
situation under control. 
  [Brown] So have you taken them prisoner? 
  [Johnson] Those that I have captured, yes, they are 
prisoners. 
  [Brown] So where do you go from now? You say you have 
captured Tubmanburg. Do you now want Alhaji Koromah to step down 
as the leader of ULIMO and you be leader or you choose another 
leader, or what do you want now? 
  [Johnson] We will decide that at a later date. We have to 
meet our men and listen to them, and listen to their suggestions 
before we can make comments on such a thing. 
  [Brown] So where is Alhaji Koromah now? 
  [Johnson] I understand he went to Guinea. 
  [Brown] And the rest of the ULIMO leadership, were they in 
Tubmanburg when the fighting started, and have you taken them 
prisoner? 
  [Johnson] They are in hiding. [end recording]

  [Text] Alhaji Koromah, the Mandingo leader of the ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in 
Liberia, has responded fiercely to allegations made on this 
program yesterday by his Krahn rival, Roosevelt Johnson. 
Johnson claimed to have driven Koromah's supporters out of 
their stronghold at Tubmanburg. It is the latest chapter in the 
squabble between the two men which held up the formation of the 
Liberian Transitional Council. Johnson and the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader, Charles Taylor, have been 
accused of joining forces in order to oust Alhaji Koromah. Both 
have denied the accusation and Roosevelt Johnson even claims 
that members of his family have been killed. Last night, Alhaji 
Koromah, who is visiting Guinea, responded with a completely 
different version of events. From Conakry, Foday Fofona, 
telexed this report. [read by announcer] 
  Alhaji Koromah vigorously denied claims by Roosevelt Johnson 
that forces loyal to him captured Tubmanburg, headquarters of 
ULIMO, over the weekend. Speaking at his home in Conakry last 
night, Koromah told me that he was thoroughly embarrassed that 
Roosevelt Johnson was using ULIMO fighters to kill each other. 
Koromah said that Roosevelt Johnson had been amassing arms and 
ammunition for some time and had moved his wife and children 
from Tubmanburg to Monrovia for safety. He said: It is a big 
lie that his mother had been killed. As of yesterday afternoon, 
his mother was very much alive in a town called Lofa Bridge. 
Visibly worried, Koromah told me: It is unfortunate that 
Johnson has become an agent of Charles Taylor and tried to use 
the Krahn tribe as a cover for his connections with the NPFL.

  [Text] Monrovia, 26 Mar (AFP) -- The fighting which broke 
out on 25 March in Tubmanburg (60 km north of Monrovia) between 
rival ethnic groups of the United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO, a Liberian armed faction), 
continued today, This disclosure was made to AFP by the head of 
ULIMO's Military high command, General Roosevelt Johnson, who 
described heavy losses on both sides. 
  The fighting is between the movement's two main ethnic 
groups, the Mandingos, who support ULIMO leader Alhaji Koromah, 
and the Krahns, who are loyal to Gen. Johnson. 
  Gen. Johnson and his supporters launched a dawn attack on 25 
March on Tubmanburg, the ULIMO headquarters, which he claims he 
has taken control of. 
  "We have total control over Tubmanburg and are currently 
dislodging the remnants of the Mandingo fighters who are still 
hiding there," Gen. Johnson stated. 
  According to him, the attack launched on Tubmanburg at dawn 
on 25 March aimed at preventing the Mandingos, Alhaji Koromah's 
supporters, from killing Krahns and other tribal group members. 
  These accusations were denied today by Major Sekou Kromah, a 
close associate of Alhaji Koromah. He also denied that Johnson 
has taken control of Tubmanburg and stated that "fighting is 
continuing there." 
  At the beginning of March, a series of clashes between the 
Krahns and Mandingos led to the death of about 200 ULIMO troops.

  [Text] The formation of the transitional government in 
Liberia is now long over and is in danger of becoming unstuck 
altogether as a split in the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement 
for Democracy in Liberia] widens. There have been reports of 
fighting around ULIMO's headquarters in Tubmanburg between 
Mandingos backing Koromah and the Krahns supporting Johnson. We 
received reports yesterday that Charles Taylor's NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia] was also involved in the battle of 
Tubmanburg in support of Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn wing of 
ULIMO, something Charles Taylor himself has strongly denied. 
Over there the UN called us up to give us their version of 
events. On the line to Monrovia, Audrey Brown asked General 
Daniel Opande, chief UN observer in Liberia, whether he could, 
in fact, confirm that NPFL forces had been involved in the 
fighting around Tubmanburg. 
  [Begin recording] [Opande] We have no evidence of NPFL 
having 
gotten themselves involved in helping a faction of ULIMO to 
fight another faction. That I can confirm. 
  [Brown] But are you stating this categorically or are you 
saying that you don't have any information of this? 
  [Opande] Well, the reason why I am saying categorically is 
because, if it is the fighting that is going on in Tubmanburg, 
we are deployed in Tubmanburg and we have a clearer picture of 
what is happening around there and the information we have 
through our own investigations confirm that there are no other 
factions from outside that organization who are involved in the 
fighting. 
  [Brown] So, is the fighting still going on now? 
  [Opande] No, Tubmanburg is very, very quite, you know, 
today. There was a fighting yesterday, you know, in fact, in the 
night until a little earlier in the morning. It died down and 
it has remained completely quiet. Life is returning back to 
normal and today is even much quieter. 
  [Brown] How many people were killed or injured in this 
fighting? Was it very serious? 
  [Opande] Well, from the information we have there may have 
been people injured, there could have been people killed, but we 
have no evidence of how many were injured and how many were, you 
know, killed. We don't have any firm information yet. 
  [Brown] Are you not involved in treating people who are 
injured and clearing away people who have been killed? 
  [Opande] When people are injured sometimes they report to 
our compound and ask for help. Yesterday none turned up. Our 
headquarters is very close to the only hospital which is in 
Tubmanburg. We have gone into the hospital and we have seen no 
new people who have been injured or any deaths reported there. 
  [Brown] So, what are you doing to prevent more flare up and 
more fighting amongst ULIMO factions? 
  [Opande] We have been in touch with ULIMO leadership -- both 
political and military leadership. We are in touch with them 
nearly every day and we are trying to encourage reconciliation 
so that there is no more fighting either within themselves or 
fighting between one faction and another. 
  [Brown] We have information that the Liberia Peace Council 
[LPC], which is another armed faction in Liberia, has overrun 
Zwedru in Grand Gedeh County. Have you information of this? 
  [Opande] We have had this information for quite some time 
now that there is activity between LPC and NPFL around Zwedru. 
They've been fighting for the control over that particular town 
and fighting is going on around that area but we have no 
confirmation that Zwedru has been taken over by LPC. Our 
information is that there is fighting going on around, you know, 
that town between NPFL and LPC. 
  [Brown] It does seem that there is altogether too much 
fighting going on in Liberia where you are supposed to be 
disarming people. Does this worry you that there is so much 
fighting still carrying on? 
  [Opande] Definitely, any fighting that is taking place at 
this time worries us a lot and we have been working right around 
the clock talking to all the factions and trying to see to it 
that the fighting is brought to an end. 
  [Brown] They don't appear to be listening to you, is it 
frustrating thus? 
  [Opande] It is very frustrating but we hope that they will 
come to their senses and they will stop this unnecessary 
fighting at this stage. [end recording]

  [Text] President Alpha Oumar Konare has addressed the 
nation to mark yesterday's third anniversary of the 26 March 
Revolution. Here is Mahamadou Kone with a summary of the head of 
state's message: 
  [Kone] The head of state emphasized that the date of 26 
March 
should invoke in everyone a strong sense of remembrance and 
fellowship transcending differences, preferences, and beliefs. 
This is a day to remember the martyrs and and the democratic 
movement and underscores that no single person has the right to 
lay claim to the noble struggle waged by all the Malian people. 
The common struggle should guide us in working for the higher 
interest of the nation. The head of state also reiterated that 
the Third Republic is not the work of anyone in particular. The 
virtue of a republican form of government is that it allows 
different political parties to gain power in accordance with the 
Constitution, which is the basis of all democratic principles. 
  President Konare reiterated his determination to use 
dialogue 
and consultations to solve all problems facing the country. He 
said: If I have always tried to rally the people and shown great 
political sensitivity in running state affairs, it is because I 
have always been convinced that the democratic movement of 26 
March is one big family of patriots. 
  He also discussed the country's economic situation, which 
was 
exacerbated by devaluation of the CFA franc. This, he said, 
must make everyone more disciplined and committed. Mali's 
salvation lies in mutual assistance and solidarity. To face the 
many challenges ahead, young people must pull themselves 
together and become more conscientious, because it is they who 
are the hope of our country. The head of state expressed concern 
about the serious youth employment situation as well as the 
education problem, which, he said, calls for sober reflection. 
Finally, President Konare paid tribute to all martyrs from 
Africa and elsewhere who died for freedom and justice.

  [Text] The Federal Government this evening said that 
Nigeria's claim over the Bakassi peninsula is supported by the 
history of the founding of the area and the population 
settlement. In another statement signed by the chief press 
secretary to the head of state, Mr. David Attah, government said 
it finds it absolutely necessary to give more information on the 
border feud between Nigeria and the Cameroon in order to put the 
facts straight. 
  According to the statement, historically, the Efiks of 
Nigeria in Cross River state, who migrated from (Uwan), now in 
Akwa-Ibom state, while searching for better fishing grounds, 
discovered (Udombi), which the early Europeans to the area later 
renamed Bakassi Peninsula. More specifically, (Udombi) or 
Bakassi was founded in the late 16th Century on the authority of 
the king and chiefs of Old Calabar. It was then too that 
fishing settlements were established at Ekang, renamed Archibong 
in Abana and Atabong out of south (Udomhi). 
  The statement has it that the Efiks and (?Efuts) declared to 
the British Council in 1884 that their allegiance was to the 
kings and chiefs of Old Calabar, the only authority approved by 
them for entry into a treaty with the British Council. British 
acceptance of the legal authority of the king of Old Calabar of 
(Udombi) led to the treaties of 1985 [as heard], 1890, 1893, and 
1906 between the UK and Germany. The treaties preserved 
(Udombi) as part of Old Calabar. 
  The implication of the treaty is that Germany, which had 
authority over the then Cameroon agreed totally that (Udombi) 
people are Efiks and the territory Nigerian, not southern 
Cameroon. Even when southern Cameroon passed on to the UN 
trusteeship after World War II, it did not alter the legal 
status of (Udombi) as an integral part of Nigeria. The 
statement goes on to assert that when the present Western 
Cameroon was part of Nigeria, (Udombi) area was administered 
from Eket on the authority of the former Eastern Nigerian 
Government. 
  The statement expressed the Federal Government's disquiet 
when Cameroon let loose its gendarmes into Nigeria's fishing 
settlement in Bakassi to harass, plunder, and murder at will 
Nigerians. Nigeria continued to remain calm despite the 
provocations, and sought dialogue with Cameroon, using 
established diplomatic machinery. 
  Nigeria's efforts would have resulted in a meeting between 
President Paul Biya and General Sani Abacha in Maiduguri in the 
northeastern part of Nigeria which has border with Cameroon. 
Government explained that, unfortunately, before the planned 
meeting, the Government of the Cameroon took steps to 
externalize the conflict with French connivance. The statement 
stressed that Nigeria's policy of accommodation should not be 
construed to mean inability to maintain Nigeria's territorial 
integrity in the face of violation of our rightful borders on 
land, sea, and air.

  [Text] Lagos, March 26 (AFP) -- Prince Yormie Johnson, a 
former Liberian warlord currently living in Nigeria, who was 
rushed to a hospital here after collapsing, is "recovering 
well," a Liberian embassy official said Saturday [26 March]. 
  The prince, who fainted Friday, had "regained consciousness 
and he is recovering well," the unnamed diplomat said. 
  The comments were the first official confirmation of 
Johnson's health status. 
  The diplomat refused to disclose the identity of the 
hospital 
for security reasons. 
  Johnson, who has been living in Nigeria for more than a 
year, 
collapsed Friday morning while taking his children to school. 
  Sources at the hospital said his ailment was linked to high 
blood pressure problems. 
  The former rebel leader had earlier this month expressed his 
wish to return home to participate in the peace process to end 
Liberia's long-running and bloody civil war. 
  Johnson, 43, was the former leader of the rebel Independent 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), a breakaway faction 
of Charles Taylor's rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia. 
  Johnson's soldiers captured ex-Liberian head of state, 
Samuel 
Doe, in September 1990 and tortured him to death.

<F P=106> [Joint communique issued by the leaders of the Action </F>
Committee for Renewal and Togolese Union for Democracy on 26 
March in Lome, read by CAR vice chairman -- recorded] 
  [Text] A delegation from the steering committee of Action 
Committee for Renewal [CAR] official met with a delegation from 
the steering bureau of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] on 
26 March from 1500 to 1700. The two delegations agreed to 
review the prevailing situation in our country and to adopt an 
official position on questions that are of interest to them, 
with the aim of clarifying the statements which had led to 
divergent interpretations in the past. The two delegations hope 
that this initial joint communique will serve to clarify all the 
dark spots and dissipate once and for all the doubts that might 
still subsist in the minds of some people. 
  1. Concerning their relations, the CAR expresses regret for 
any positions it adopted that might have disturbed its partners 
in the UTD. The UTD, which took an active part in the 
democratic struggle, solemnly reaffirms its unequivocal 
adherence to the parliamentary majority. The CAR reaffirms its 
desire to treat the UTD as a full partner, without which there 
would be no parliamentary majority, and is determined not to 
undertake anything on issues of common interest without prior 
consultation. The UTD is determined to work in collaboration 
with CAR for the triumph of democratic ideals, in line with the 
wishes expressed by the people during the 6 and 20 February 
legislative elections. 
  2. Concerning the leadership of the institutions, the UTD 
confirms the terms of the 23 March letter, in which it affirmed 
that the management of the people's victory must be done by 
consensus, notably when there is a question of choosing 
government and parliamentary posts. The UTD reaffirms that it 
has no intention of vying for any of these posts without 
reaching a prior understanding and consensus agreement with the 
CAR. 
  Consequently the two sides agree to clarify those points 
which might have led to divergent interpretations: 
  A. The CAR has officially chosen the post of prime minister. 
The UTD rallies around this choice; 
  B. Concerning the name of the CAR activist who is to occupy 
this post, official consultations have been held today between 
the two parties, a name has been proposed, and the UTD sees no 
inconvenience about this and accepts this choice; 
  C. Concerning the other posts, the same delegation will 
continue with their consultations; 
  D. The two delegation have agreed to have more contacts in 
order to harmonize their viewpoints on a permanent basis in line 
with the wishes of the people; 
  E. The two delegations pledge to eschew their war of 
communiques, media, and press attacks, either directly or 
through the offices of a third party. 
  Issued, in Lome on 26 March. 
  Signed, for the CAR by Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor, and for the UTD 
by Mr. Edem Kodjo.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Miranda has admitted in 
Luanda that the talks may have collapsed due to the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] demands. 
Minister Joao Miranda said that UNITA's behavior -- which 
hinges solely on its greed for ministerial portfolios -- shows 
that it wants to continue war because it is not ready for 
democratic coexistence. 
  [Begin Miranda recording] The talks are at a crucial point, 
at this stage, because they face the risk of collapsing. That 
is because UNITA is neither collaborating nor interested in an 
immediate end to the war. Decidedly, what it is in fact 
interested in are the ministerial portfolios that it has been 
demanding. UNITA presents those demands merely as a (?hobby), 
but it seeks greater goals, namely to create a space for itself 
because it is not ready to live in a democracy. [end recording] 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said this when he met 
Pak Myong-ku, his DPRK counterpart, whom he briefed on the 
postelectoral crisis in Angola. The visiting DPRK is scheduled 
to be in this country for a few days, during which he will meet 
Angolan officials to get acquainted with the situation in the 
country. He will be obtaining that information from officials 
such as Johnny Pinnock Eduardo, secretary of state for 
cooperation; Media Minister Hendrick Vaal Neto; and Lopo do 
Nascimento, secretary general of the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola.

  [Text] In Lusaka, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin 
Beye, has decided to leave behind the controversial point of the 
division of ministerial portfolios between the government and 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
and to move on to the last point on the agenda, concerning the 
conclusion of the electoral process. However, this alternative 
proposed by the representative of the UN secretary general in 
Angola does not seem likely to save the talks from collapse, 
even though a plenary meeting might occur today. Pedro Manuel, 
our correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: 
  [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. The 
negotiating sides may meet again today to discuss the document 
drawn up by the mediators and observers concerning the 
conclusion of the electoral process. Yesterday, the mediators 
decided to move on to the issue of the conclusion of the 
electoral process. Given that no understanding has been reached 
on it so far, the issue of the country's governance will be 
taken up again at a later stage. The mediators delivered their 
document on the conclusion of the electoral process to the two 
sides yesterday. The negotiators proceeded to analyze that 
document and may present their responses today. 
  However, there is talk that UNITA disagrees with UN Special 
Representative Blondin Beye's idea to drop the matter of 
governance for the time being and move on to the conclusion of 
the electoral process. It is said that UNITA is not ready to 
discuss that issue at this stage. In the interim, let us wait 
and see what the likely official response will be. 
  Within the context of discussions on the conclusion of the 
electoral process, the negotiators are supposed to put down on 
paper all the steps they would like taken concerning the second 
round of the presidential elections. [end recording]

  [Text] The head of state, President Henri Konan Bedie, 
granted an audience late this morning to a Cameroonian President 
Paul Biya's special envoy. The envoy is Cameroon's culture 
minister, who brought a personal message from President Biya to 
President Henri Konan Bedie. Noufe Nabi brings you this report: 
  [Nabi] Foreign affairs Minister Essy Amara and the 
Cameroonian ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire were present at the 
audience, which lasted about 30 minutes. Talks during the 
audience centered mainly on the Bakassi Peninsula border 
conflict between Cameroon and Nigeria. Professor Joseph-Marie 
Bipoun Woum, President Biya's envoy, reaffirmed Cameroon's claim 
to ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, and hoped that the 
current problem would be resolved peacefully. 
  [Begin Woum recording] Yes, Cameroon is confident of its 
rightful claim to this peninsula, and is engaged in the search 
for a solution to this problem by peaceful means. We advocate a 
peaceful solution to the conflict through regional and 
international intermediaries, as our claim over this peninsula 
is backed by a series of documents and legal instruments which 
date as far back as 1885 [words indistinct]. In all we have a 
total of 23 legal documents, including [word indistinct], 
protocols, agreements, declarations, and other documents 
established by our joint border commissions. So, these legal 
instruments cannot be disputed today and we are ready to defend 
them wherever necessary to back our legal claims. Naturally, in 
view of the broad outlook and global experience of President 
Henri Bedie, as well as the friendly and fraternal relations 
that have always existed between our two countries since their 
respective independence, Cameroon hopes that Cote d'Ivoire will 
contribute to efforts to find a peaceful solution to this 
conflict. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program, presented by Patricia Glyn] </F>
  [Text] [Glyn] We are joined now by a spokesman for the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party], Ed Tillet. Mr. Tillet, can you give us 
first up your reaction to this mayhem in town? 
  [Tillet] Good day to you, Patricia. I just wanted to correct 
some unfounded reports earlier on Newsbrief, linking today's 
march to the IFP. The march is in fact a Zulu march. It has 
been organized and initiated by Zulu headmen on the Reef. It 
has absolutely nothing to do with the IFP. 
  [Glyn] Do you therefore distance yourself completely from 
the 
behavior of the people down there? 
  [Tillet] Well, let me just say at the outset that we have 
rceived unconfirmed information from an intelligence source that 
there was a deliberate plot hatched to disrupt today's march, 
today's Zulu march, and that there were to be snipers positioned 
in various areas, and also individuals, agents provocateurs, 
planted in the march, that were intended to sow panic, mayhem, 
destruction, and to fire indiscriminately at marchers, so that 
it became impossible to know where the shots were emanating from. 
  [Glyn] But do you, Mr. Tillet, distance yourself from the 
kind of behavior we have seen from this crowd today? 
  [Tillet] We completely distance ourselves from all forms of 
violence whatsoever. It is very, very sad that there are agents 
provocateurs that have allegedly tried to disrupt today's march, 
evidently trying to provoke a counter-response. They have 
achieved exactly what they wanted to achieve -- to sow panic, 
mayhem, and destruction in central Johannesburg. 
  [Glyn] Our reporters there, Mr. Tillet, seem to indicate to 
us that there are an awful lot of IFP supporters down there. 
Should they be responsible for the violence, what will your 
course of action be? 
  [Tillet] Well, I would like to ask your reporter on what 
basis he or she comes to the conclusion that they are IFP 
members, but, of course, we do concede that there must be some 
overlapping between the Zulu marchers present and IFP members 
and supporters among them. There's no doubt about that. But the 
IFP as a political organization cannot be held responsible for a 
march which has been organized and initiated by the Zulu headmen 
in the Transvaal in support of their Zulu king's demands. 
  [Glyn] Are you suggesting that the IFP has no influence over 
the Zulu nation in this part of the world? 
  [Tillet] Yes, it does have an influence, but you know, I 
don't think that anybody was expecting the kind of sabotaging of 
today's march. It's highly unfortunate and regrettable what has 
happened, and I think that there will have to be an 
investigation, a very senior police inquiry, into the events of 
today that culminated in this morning's mayhem. 
  [Glyn] Well, when you were informed of the intention of 
these 
people to go on the march, did you make any kind of request to 
their leaders for them to leave all their traditional weapons at 
home? 
  [Tillet] Well, Zulus are perfectly entitled to bear their 
traditional weapons. Those are cultural weapons, and I don't 
think that that has got anything to do with it. I think that 
that is a red herring and a smokescreen that is raised by 
political opponents of the IFP and of the Zulu nation. 
  [Glyn] But given the explosive nature of a situation like 
this, do you not think it would have been a good idea to make a 
plea to these people to come unarmed? 
  [Tillet] Well, I think you are diverting the focus. Instead 
of focussing on the agents provocateurs that allegedly started 
the shooting, you are now focussing on individuals who are 
exercising their democratic right to participate in a march in 
support of their king's demands, albeit with traditional 
weapons. Those traditional weapons have been handed down 
through centuries. I cannot see how the IFP or any other 
organization, for that matter, including the state, can expect 
Zulus to abandon their traditional cultural heritage. 
  [Glyn] Ed Tillet, thank you very much for joining us today 
on 
Newsbrief. Mr. Tillet is a spokesman for the IFP.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- Two shots were fired 
from buildings on the corner of King George and De Villiers 
Streets near the African National Congress' [ANC] Johannesburg 
headquarters at about 1.30 PM shortly before police arrived to 
cordon off the area with razor wire. 
  ANC Senior Legal Representative Penwell Maduna told SAPA an 
agreement with police had been reached to cordon off the area. 
The bodies of the nine people killed nearby had already been 
removed. 
  Internal Stability Unit members aimed their guns at the two 
buildings until the situation seemed normal while pedestrians 
and journalists sheltered behind pillars and in doorways. 
Running battles continued at a nearby taxi rank. About 200 
people armed with sticks and wooden planks entered the taxi 
rank, shouting "ANC, ANC". Almost immediately at least eight 
armoured SADF [South African Defense Force] personnel carriers 
pulled up and troops were deployed from the vehicles. A shot 
was fired and the crowd dispersed only to regroup soon 
afterwards. A peace monitor intervened to calm the situation. 
  SADF Witwatersrand Command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said 
army units had been called out to assist the police in 
Johannesburg to restore calm in the city centre. Soldiers were 
gathering at a Witwatersrand Command rallying point and "were 
awaiting further orders", Maj Visser said. Maj Visser declined 
to give details on the number of troops in the area.

  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- A top-level meeting 
involving President F W de Klerk, African National Congress 
[ANC] President Nelson Mandela, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini 
is on the cards. 
  Teams representing the three parties were meeting on Monday 
afternoon to set up the four-way summit. "Preparations for the 
summit are in progress," a spokesman for Constitutional 
Development Minister Roelf Meyer's office said. 
  Mr Meyer was involved in discussions with ANC Secretary 
General Cyril Ramaphosa. 
  The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] management 
committee adjourned early on Monday afternoon to allow 
participants to take part in planning meetings. 
  A TEC management committee source said the discussions were 
one prong of a two-pronged strategy to ensure there were free 
and fair elections in Natal/kwaZulu. The other was security 
force action. 
  The Mandela/De Klerk/Buthelezi/Zwelithini summit will be the 
first face-to-face meeting of the four leaders. 
  It is being seen as a high-level attempt to arrest the 
deteriorating security and political situation in the country 
just one month short of the April election.

  [Text] Police have warned the members of the public to stay 
away from Louis Botha Avenue as thousands of Zulus are returning 
to Alexandria via this route. Members of the public have been 
asked to avoid Wolhuter and Koch Streets. At least 2,000 Zulus 
are currently gathering at the George Goch Station where they 
are being addressed by Zulu leaders. Another large group of 
marchers are waiting for trains at the Jeppe Station. 
  People believed to have been injured during the march are 
streaming into Johannesburg and Hillbrow Hospitals, and the 
situation in both hospitals is said to be chaotic. A spokesman 
for the Johannesburg Hospital said the victims were suffering 
from gunshot and sjambok wounds, and multiple injuries. 
  Altogether 42 people were admitted by the casualty section 
of 
Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto following violence in the area. 
A spokesperson said 30 of those admitted had bullet wounds and 
three people were in a critical condition, the other 12 were 
stabbed, beaten or had been struck by motor vehicles.

  [Text] The chairman of the National Peace Secretariat, Dr. 
Antonie Gildenhuys, says a cease-fire should be declared 
immediately in Johannesburg. He said what had happened showed 
how a small group of people could upset the entire peace 
process. Dr. Gildenhuys also announced that the National Peace 
Secretariat would meet in Durban tomorrow to discuss the 
situation in Natal. A member of the secretariat, Mr. Rupert 
Lorimer, said the events in Johannesburg were directly related 
to the situation in Natal. He added that the peace structures 
had not been officially informed of the march and only found out 
about it yesterday. Mr. Lorimer confirmed receiving calls from 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members claiming they had received 
reports that agent provocateur would be infiltrated into the 
crowds to begin shooting and causing chaos.

  [Text] Durban March 28 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] on Monday said it deplored attacks on Zulu marchers and 
bystanders in Johannesburg's city centre earlier in the day. 
"We request the Goldstone Commission to investigate the 
massacre as an urgent priority and to appoint both local and 
international investigators," read a statement issued by Ed 
Tillett on behalf of the IFP. "Zulu marchers in support of King 
(Goodwill) Zwelithini's declaration of Zulu sovereignty were 
fired upon by unidentified gunmen," it continued. 
  "Reports have also been received that shots were fired on 
marchers from assassins who concealed themselves within the 
ranks of march participants. The marchers were also fired upon 
by strategically positioned rooftop snipers. Their presence was 
confirmed by a large number of independent witnesses. The 
attacks were clearly well planned and added a sinister new 
dimension to political violence in this country. The majority 
of the shooting victims were Zulus. 
  "Earlier today the IFP received information of an alleged 
African National Congress plot to infiltrate agent provocateurs 
among Zulu marchers. These elements were instructed to fire 
randomly on march participants with the intention of triggering 
a violent counter-response in order to discredit its (Zulu) 
organisers and link the accompanying chaos to the IFP." 
  The statement continued: "In the wake of the attacks, the 
IFP believes the ANC is attempting to create a climate of fear 
and hysteria in the country which would justify a Transitional 
Executive Council-led crackdown against those standing outside 
of the ANC and National Party-defined transition process."

  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel put the blame for Monday's violence in central 
Johannesburg squarely on the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]. 
"Inkatha's excuse that the meeting from which the violence 
erupted was a gathering of Zulus and not an IFP meeting must be 
dismissed as a transparent political ploy," said Mr Kriel. 
  He also called on the Goldstone Commission to urgently 
investigate what triggered off the day's violence. 
  Mr Kriel said IFP leaders, many of whom were present at the 
event, should have foreseen the possibility of violence, 
especially in the light of the volatile political situation. 
"They should have taken the necessary steps to avoid bloodshed." 
  He added that Monday's deaths were "yet another warning that 
political intolerance -- not only of the IFP, but also the 
supporters of other organisations -- and lack of control over 
supporters are the single biggest threat to free and fair 
elections".

<F P=106> [From the "PM Newswrap" program] </F>
  [Text] We have reaction to the happenings in Johannesburg 
today from the Chief Minister of kwaZulu and Inkatha Freedom 
Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  [Begin Buthelezi recording] We were very much saddened by 
the 
news that we have received, that when some people passed near 
Shell House, which is the ANC [African National Congress] 
headquarters, some people in Shell House shot at these people 
and one person died and others were injured. Then when they 
proceeded to the meeting it appears that more people were killed. 
  Mr. Themba Khoza phoned me to inform me that they had heard 
information yesterday that some of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- 
Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] cadres intended mixing 
with the people in order to start a riot and in fact as soon as 
they had got to the venue of the meeting, I'm then informed that 
they were shooting from some of the -- ANC people, as they had 
described them here -- from the top of buildings, surrounding 
buildings, the result of which 16 people have been killed. 
  So I wish to say that it is quite clear that there are 
people 
who really intend having some kind of mayhem in this country, 
and I am saddened by the fact that the Zulu subjects of the 
king, who intended doing no more than just demonstrate their 
stand with their king, you know, in the matters that he has 
raised, have been attacked in this way. It seems to me that the 
issue of reconciliation in this country is something that is 
going to be with us for a long time because it will not be 
accomplished, because the bitterness caused by these kind of 
attacks on innocent people, who meant no harm to anyone except 
to take a stand with their king and to demonstrate their loyalty 
to their king, should be attacked in this way. 
  And I really wish to condemn this attack on the Zulu people 
on their way to the march and also at the march in the strongest 
possible terms, and I do really hope that the attention of the 
state president and the president of the ANC will be drawn to 
this kind of merciless killing of our people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by S Denny] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- State President F W de 
Klerk has criticised the organisers of the Zulu march in 
Johannesburg on Monday in which at least 20 people died and 276 
were injured. "According to present information, insufficient 
care was taken by the organisers of the march to prevent 
violence and to discipline participants," Mr de Klerk said in a 
statement in Pretoria. 
  "There can be no excuse at this critical stage in the 
political process for provocative and potentially violent 
actions such as we have seen today (Monday). It not only 
endangers the elections and reform process, but also the very 
fabric of society," he said. 
  Mr de Klerk called on all political leaders to exercise 
control and restraint over their followers, to ensure there was 
no repetition of Monday's events and to avoid any action which 
could lead to violence. "The time has arrived for the urgent 
consideration -- by the Transitional Executive Council, 
government, the Independent Electoral Commission and others -- 
of additional measures or steps which can prevent a repetition 
of what has happened today and on recent similar occasions. The 
government intends discussing these matters with the relevant 
institutions. Obviously, such measures or steps should not 
prevent political parties from campaigning peacefully and 
democratically," he said. 
  He expressed his condolences to the families of the dead.

<F P=106> [Report by L Elias] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The mood of the Zulu 
marchers was "very reasonable" and did not look as if the 
protest was going to erupt in violence, Democratic Party [DP] MP 
and PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Peace Secretariat 
member Rupert Lorimer told SAPA on Monday evening. He said he 
was at the meeting at the Library Gardens when the shooting 
started. 
  Both Mr Lorimer and National Peace Secretariat Chairman Dr 
Antonie Gildenhuys had marched through the middle of the crowd 
on its way to the rally and "the crowd was at that stage in a 
fairly good mood", Mr Lorimer said. "There was nothing that we 
saw that could have induced shooting. 
  "Suddenly, out of the blue, shooting started. I did not know 
where it came from. Some of it was from the ground and some 
from the buildings around the gardens," Mr Lorimer said, adding 
that police then trained their fire on buildings, breaking many 
upper storey windows. The crowd took cover and Dr Gildenhuys 
and I ended face-down in flower beds in the gardens while an 
impi [Zulu word for warrior] ran over my back," he said. 
  Although Mr Lorimer was not at the scene of the carnage at 
the African National Congress head office, Shell House, where 
eight people were killed, he said the shooting there was not a 
Zulu attack. 
  According to people Mr Lorimer spoke to, someone started 
firing from buildings opposite and around Shell House and the 
crowd retaliated, he told SAPA. 
  Mr Lorimer also believed there were agents provocateur in 
the 
crowd, as he had been warned by the IFP before the march. He 
said both the Peace Secretariat and the police had difficulty 
placing their men in the crowd because both organisations were 
operating on rumours about the march. 
  Mr Lorimer said he had seen a large number of "sticks, 
assegais [jabbing spear] and homemade spears, but no firearms 
among the marchers".

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- Zulu marchers were 
picked off and then attacked en masse by snipers in surrounding 
buildings as they sat listening to their leaders in 
Johannesburg's Library Gardens on Monday afternoon, according to 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] Transvaal organiser Themba Khoza. 
"The attacks were well-calculated, planned assassinations," Mr 
Khoza told a press conference at the Inkatha Freedom Party 
offices Monday night. 
  Questioning the role of the security forces in the 
afternoon's mayhem, he said the IFP had received information on 
Sunday evening that the African National Congress (ANC) meant to 
attack the march and he had personally passed this on to the SA 
Defence Force and the police. They had telephoned the IFP on 
Monday morning to confirm this was true but it was too late to 
stop the march even if he had wanted to, said Mr Khoza. 
  The trouble allegedly started as the march -- about 10,000 
Zulus massed in support of King Goodwill Zwelithini and his 
demand for Zulu sovereignty -- moved past ANC headquarters. 
"They sniped at us from the building. One of our leaders was 
killed on the spot and others were seriously hurt," said Mr 
Khoza. 
  Later when the marchers were gathered in Library Gardens "a 
hail of bullets came down from the buildings". 
  According to police and press reports, it now appears that 
up 
to 18 people were killed during, before and in the ensuing chaos 
which followed this incident. 
  Mr Khoza said the question was why the security forces, 
already warned by the information passed on to them by the IFP, 
had not prevented the sniping. "And if that is not enough 
several of our people were also shot and killed by the police." 
  The people who had been killed were the same who the 
Goldstone Commission had accused him of supplying with arms, Mr 
Khoza noted. "Nothing has been said about the ANC and their 
caches. No amount of killing will fade our hearts. It is 
freedom we are committed to...the struggle continues. But at 
the end of the day we are left with bitterness and stress and a 
wish that it does not happen again, not to anyone."

  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has laid the 
blame for today's killings squarely at the door of the SAP 
[South African Police] and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
leadership. Addressing a news conference a short while ago NEC 
[National Executive Committee] member Terror Lekota said the ANC 
had warned the police yesterday about possible violence. He 
said the police had undertaken to set up road blocks to disarm 
the Zulus but had failed to do so. 
  [Begin Lekota recording] The ANC made every conceivable 
effort to obtain adequate policing measures around its premises 
from the earliest hours of today, in order to avert clashes and 
to avoid any loss of life. What is puzzling is the complacent 
attitude of the police who refused to cordon off streets or 
divert armed demonstrators away from possible flash points. [end 
recording] 
  Mr. Lekota said the 10 policemen who were deployed in front 
of Shell House left their posts because of the threat to their 
lives. Security measures were left in the hands of the ANC's 
security personnel and according to Mr. Lekota they acted with 
restraint and patience and only fired when their lives were 
threatened.

<F P=106> [Report by M Schnehage] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg Mar 28 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] on Monday blamed the earlier killing of Zulu 
marchers outside the ANC's head office, Shell House in 
Johannesburg, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the South 
African Police [SAP]. 
  Thousands of Zulus surged through Johannesburg's streets on 
Monday and eight marchers were shot dead outside the ANC's head 
office. 
  The ANC claimed at a press conference the police had been 
told armed marchers planned to advance on the ANC's offices. 
  A statement issued at the conference said Police 
Commissioner 
Gen Johan van der Merwe had been told on March 27 "of the 
dangers, and he undertook to ensure adequate measures were taken 
to protect life and property". 
  The ANC said agreement had also been reached with Gen Koos 
Calitz who had agreed to erect roadblocks to prevent armed 
marchers from entering the central business district. 
  ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Chairman 
Tokyo 
Sexwale said the failure to erect these roadblocks had allowed 
armed people to enter the city, which ultimately led to violence 
and loss of life. 
  The ANC said police were deployed outside Shell House before 
the shootings but had "disappeared" by the time firing started. 
  The organisation denied claims its members shot at marchers 
from high-rise buildings in the central business district. 
Journalists, peace monitors and witnesses claimed throughout 
the day that marchers frequently came under sniper fire from 
tall buildings. 
  The ANC said its regional offices in Jeppe Street had come 
under fire early on Monday and security personnel had returned 
fire. It claimed its Shell House head office came under fire 
several times from Zulu marchers. 
  ANC officials said their security personnel initially fired 
warning shots and then shot at a group of armed marchers when it 
became evident they planned to attack the building. The ANC's 
security personnel said they saw other Zulu marchers remove the 
weapons of the slain men in full view of the police. 
  The ANC defended its security personnel's actions and said 
although it regretted the shootings "our security personnel 
behaved with impeccable forebearance and patience in the face of 
extreme provocation". 
  The organisation claimed Monday's incident was part of a 
"general campaign to destabilise the PWV region and to revive 
the climate of terror and violence that plagued this region over 
the past four years". 
  It claimed the "purpose of its perpetrators are crystal 
clear 
-- to make it impossible to hold free and fair elections which 
will clearly demonstrate whom the people of South Africa want as 
their government". 
  The ANC also questioned the "timing of this fresh campaign 
of 
violence" which it said followed closely on the heels of the 
exposure of the so-called "third force". It also suggested the 
role played by the IFP's regional leadership in the day's events 
could not be seen as "accidental".

  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk, 
African National Congress President Nelson Mandela, Inkatha 
Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini are to meet in an historic four-sided summit on 
Wednesday and Thursday. The meeting will be the first to bring 
together the four leaders at the centre of the unfolding 
political drama. 
  It is understood the chaos that racked central Johannesburg 
on Monday triggered the urgent attempt to bring the leaders 
together. 
  ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister of 
Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer left a scheduled 
Transitional Executive Council management committee meeting on 
Monday afternoon to join the IFP's Joe Matthews and the 
kwaZulu's Ben Ngubane for talks on the summit.

<F P=106> [Report by N Lewis] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- Minister of Law and 
Order Mr Hernus Kriel on Monday night declared 11 districts in 
the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] as unrest areas 
with immediate effect in the wake of the mayhem that shook South 
Africa's commercial heartland earlier in the day. 
  The areas are Johannesburg, Alberton, Boksburg, Benoni, 
Germiston, Kempton Park, Krugersdorp, Randburg, Roodepoort, 
Springs and Westonaria. 
  Unrest regulations took effect at 10PM on Monday. 
  South African Police spokesman Maj Louis le Roux said the 
unrest regulations granted additional powers to security forces 
to contain violence. These included powers dealing with arrest 
and detention, the prohibition of the carrying of certain 
weapons and objects, the power of entry, search and seizure and 
allowances for the police commissioner to promulgate further 
orders. 
  Giving his reasons for the declaration of unrest areas at a 
press conference earlier on Monday evening, Mr Kriel said in 
Cape Town the carnage during the Zulu march in Johannesburg had 
been "a terrible turn of events". 
  The declaration had been cleared with the sub-council for 
law 
and order of the Transitional Executive Council which, he said, 
also realised the urgency of the situation. "This will give 
more powers to the South African Police and other security 
organs to handle the situation." 
  Mr Kriel said he would like to see mass action stopped as a 
whole. "In a society as polarised as South Africa, mass action 
leads to death. I blame political parties organising this for 
political advantage and not taking the lives of people into 
account."

<F P=106> [Interview with SAP Colonel Dave Bruce by CCV announcer </F>
Reggie Morobe on the "Newsline" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Morose] Colonel Bruce, good evening. 
  [Bruce] Good evening to you. 
  [Morose] Let me say, from yesterday, there were reports that 
there was intimidation which was a build-up to the march. What 
did the police do? 
  [Bruce] Well, you're quite correct. A number of incidents 
did take place from late last night right through the night 
until this morning. And consultations were again held with both 
political parties involved, that is to say the IFP and the ANC 
this morning. Our fears were obviously expressed to the 
leadership of the IFP regarding what could possibly take place. 
We asked for assurances, as we were given in the beginning, 
that's on Friday when application was made for the march to take 
place. And assurances were given that this march would be 
peaceful. 
  [Morobe] Is this the time for assurances, taking the 
volatile 
situation. We saw the pictures from Ulundi where AK-47 
gun-pointing people were running with. We know the volatile 
situation. Do we just need just assurance? 
  [Bruce] No, you don't need just assurances, but I think one 
has to realize that the political leaders and the organizations 
of parties that wish to hold demonstrations and gatherings of 
this nature really have a tremendous responsibility to ensure 
that the assurances given to them which motivate the reason for 
the march are indeed kept, and obviously it is up to them to 
ensure that their followers do not come to these gatherings 
armed. 
  [Morobe] Now today we saw what happened. Assurances did 
nothing. Now it's within the city where people are going to 
work, there's shopping, the normal day should go on amid the 
march, what precautions, measures, did you take as the police? 
  [Bruce] Well, the South African Police [SAP] were there in 
great numbers, we had close on 700 policemen in the Johannesburg 
area to monitor this particular gathering. We expressed our 
problems regarding this particular march as well, we gave ... 
  [Morobe, interrupting] What were your problems? 
  [Bruce] Well, because of the problems that took place during 
the night, we felt that there was a possibility that violence 
could break out, and we had, specifically, talks with the 
African National Congress on this matter this morning, and 
assurances were given that we would police this particular 
march, but it must be understood that we could only ensure that 
public order is kept, we could not ensure that we're going to 
carry out the law to the letter of the law, because that would 
be futile. If I can put it very, very simply, it is just not 
possible for 700 policemen to disarm 10,000 persons of their 
weapons, it is absolutely impossible, and it's time that people 
took note of this. 
  [Morobe] Was the route cordoned. Was the route to the 
Library cordoned with a wire fence? 
  [Bruce] As far as possible, yes, it was certainly done. I 
can't tell you where each and every, or which each and every 
area was cordoned off and so on, but certainly the razor wire 
was used, the police were there, they cordoned off certain 
areas. I don't think that anybody can expect the South African 
Police to cordon off each and every street within the city. 
However, we maintained a very strong presence in that area. 
  [Morobe] As strong as in Durban that we saw over the 
weekend? 
  [Bruce] Oh, I couldn't tell you what happened in Durban, I 
couldn't tell you that. 
  [Morobe] Because the contingent was far larger than in 
Johannesburg, and taking again the volatile situation from 
Soweto, intimidation was reported, and from early in the 
morning, gunshots were reported, couldn't police act swiftly, 
700, did it do its job, is the police now having problems in 
terms of controlling (?violence)? 
  [Bruce] Those are questions. And I must really state that 
it's very, very early in the day to answer questions of that 
nature. I can assure you that an investigation, and I mean an 
in-depth investigation is taking place, and I will not be 
surprised if there is actually an inquiry, a commission of 
inquiry, into today's happenings that will be conducted. And I 
can assure you, if the police were found wanting, or did not 
plan strategically, that will come out, but that is not the 
question that we should discuss tonight. What we should really 
be looking at is the fact that at least 18 persons, human 
beings, have died, and the fact of this particular aspect is 
that it was the IFP who asked to do a march, to hold a 
gathering, and it was their followers that were partly 
responsible for this. Also one must take into account that 
shots, automatic gunfire were fired from within the African 
National Congress' headquarters, which also resulted in deaths. 
These are the things that one has got to look at, and you know 
to apportion blame now, one way or the other is not going to 
solve this particular problem. 
  [Morobe] On that note, the IFP, Themba Khoza, has just said, 
they actually gave a report that they were made aware that there 
will be an infiltration, if I should use the word, of the MK 
[Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] 
within the group, and also on the security, to ensure that 
people are killed today. Did you get such a report? 
  [Bruce] No, not from the IFP. Let me stress that had any 
reports of that nature been available to the South African 
Police before the march, obviously, then one could reconsider 
the decision to grant the march. However, I must point out of 
course the march was okayed by the chief magistrate on Friday 
already. These, as I pointed out, are aspects that have to be 
drawn to the attention of the persons investigating these 
occurrences, or the commission of inquiry which will result out 
of this particular happening. 
  [Morobe] But it's reported Cyril Ramaphosa called you, the 
police, at 7:45 and it took only up to 10 o'clock for the 
arrival of the police. What takes so long in such a volatile 
situation? 
  [Bruce] I cannot say what Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa reported. What 
I can tell you, that at the time that these shots took place 
from within the ANC headquarters, our regional commissioner 
General Calitz, was actually in Shell House himself, so I can 
assure you note has been taken of exactly what took place, but 
for anybody now to point fingers at the South African Police, I 
think at this very early stage it's astounding that anybody can 
come to a conclusion that one party or the other is at fault. 
This is what will emanate from an investigation. 
  [Morobe] Now, at the court, the garden itself, it's reported 
a minibus came and showered bullets. I'd like to believe from 
what you say that the presence of police was there. How can 
such a thing happen, and what action are we going to see from 
the police? 
  [Bruce] I think you have to realize that at the Library 
Gardens, that was an estimated 9,000 or 10,000 persons. And for 
anybody now at this stage, and I must state it again, at this 
early stage, to actually say what took place is impossible, we 
really can't, these are things that will receive attention, and 
will be investigated, and will be made known to the public. 
  [Morobe] And finally, is the police, South African Police, 
able to maintain law and order? 
  [Bruce] I think that the South African Police, and indeed, 
any policemen in the world is able to maintain law and order 
under reasonable circumstances. We are able to police marches 
and demonstrations, and so on, but when it degenerates into what 
we saw today, which essentially was an example of the political 
conflict which is taking place in South Africa, then it makes it 
very difficult for anybody to police that. I think South 
Africans should take note now that what we saw today is what has 
been taking place in the rural areas, and the inaccessible areas 
for quite some time. Perhaps it's coming as a bit of a shock to 
South Africa to see what reality is. 
  [Morobe] On that note we leave it there as we have run out 
of 
time. Thank you for availing yourself to us? 
  [Bruce] It's a pleasure.

<F P=106> [Report by Norman Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- A Mmabatho 
(Bophuthatswana) situation could easily develop in Johannesburg 
because of a number of factors, Freedom Front [FF] leader and 
former South African Defence Force [SADF] Chief Gen Constand 
Viljoen warned on Monday. 
  He told a press conference in Pretoria that Johannesburg's 
street battles represented an intensification of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP]/African National Congress [ANC] war. The 
clashes occurred because the government and ANC were pressing on 
with the constitutional process and elections while Zulus, like 
the Afrikaners, had not yet been politically accommodated. He 
hoped the election would be postponed. 
  Gen Viljoen added there was "no hope" of the police and the 
defence force solving the problem unless there was solidarity in 
the security forces. One could not break down the morale of the 
police and that of South Africans, as had happened, and still 
think one could control security. 
  The defence force was already experiencing problems because 
of the low response rate, as little as five per cent, to call-up 
orders. In this type of war there could be no military 
solution, but only a political solution. 
  -- There had been much progress in negotiations with the 
government and the ANC on the establishement of an Afrikaner 
"volkstaat" [homeland], and Gen Viljoen said he had asked 
President F. W. de Klerk on Monday for a further round of 
trilateral talks to obtain clarity on the concept of 
self-determination so that people voting for the FF knew what 
they were voting for. 
  The FF released its election manifesto at the conference. It 
stated the FF rejected any notion of a unitary state subjugating 
the Afrikaner people, or any form of communism. 
  The FF sought a confederal dispensation for South Africa.

Development and of Communication on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 
28 March] 
  [Text] Delegations of the South African Government, kwaZulu 
government, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the African National 
Congress [ANC] met in Pretoria today. The delegations were led 
by Minister Roelf Meyer, Dr Ben Ngubane, Mr Joe Matthews and Mr 
Cyril Ramaphosa. 
  The delegations agreed to make the following proposal to 
their respective principals: 
  That a meeting between the state president, Mr F. W. de 
Klerk, the king of the Zulu nation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, 
Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi of kwaZulu and the president 
of the ANC, Mr Nelson Mandela should as a matter of extreme 
urgency take place on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning 
(30 - 31 March 1993) to address the following: 
  -- The current escalation of violence and the appalling 
killing 
  of people in our country; 
  -- The necessity of creating a climate under which free 
and fair 
  elections can take place; and 
  -- The need to find urgent solutions to the political 
differences 
  which underlie the current tensions such as the position of 
  King Goodwill Zwelithini under the new constitutional 
  dispensation. 
  The meeting was appalled by the killings which occurred in 
Johannesburg today and call for an immediate cessation of 
violence and a commitment to lawful and democratic means of 
solving problems.

<F P=106> [Media statement issued by the Office of the State President </F>
on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 28 March] 
  [Text] The state president, Mr F. W. de Klerk, has 
expressed his extreme concern over the incidents in Johannesburg 
this morning in which a number of people were killed and 
injured. According to present information insufficient care was 
taken by the organisers of today's march to prevent violence and 
to discipline participants. He has requested a full criminal 
investigation into the incidents with a view to ensuring 
prosecution of anybody who has acted in conflict with the law. 
  There can be no excuse at this critical stage in the 
political process for provocative and potentially violent 
actions such as we have seen today. It not only endangers the 
election and reform process, but also the very fabric of society. 
  He has issued an urgent appeal to the leaders of all parties 
and organisations to exercise maximum control and restraint over 
their followers, to ensure that there is no repetition of this 
kind of incident and to avoid any action or strategies which can 
lead to violence. 
  The time has arrived for the urgent consideration -- by the 
government, the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], the IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] and others -- of additional 
measures or steps which can prevent a repetition of what has 
happened today and on recent similar occasions. The government 
intends to discuss this question with the relevant institutions. 
Obviously such measures or steps should not prevent political 
parties from campaigning peacefully and democratically. 
  The state president has expressed his condolences to the 
families of all those who have been killed.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples 
Organisation [Azapo] on Monday blamed the mayhem in Johannesburg 
earlier in the day on the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], saying 
its members should return to their senses. 
  It added, however, that the African National Congress was 
also to blame for the general political rivalry as both it and 
the IFP did not adhere to the democracy they often preached. 
"The IFP has acted irresponsibly and cowardly by killing 
innocent black people, especially children and pensioners. The 
power struggle between the IFP and the ANC is causing many black 
lives to be lost. What they are doing is not benefiting black 
people but dividing them," said Azapo Central Wits 
[Witwatersrand] region Chairman Jeff Seitshiro.

  [Text] Ventersdorp March 28 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] has challenged 
the Goldstone Commission to search the African National 
Congress' [ANC] headquarters following Monday's shooting during 
a Zulu march in Johannesburg. 
  "In the past he (Mr Justice Richard Goldstone) has not 
hesitated to raid sensitive military and state installations, 
and has also not hesitated to condemn white right-wing activists 
before they have even appeared in court," said a statement by 
the AWB's Executive Council on Monday evening. It added that 
the AWB had taken note that peace monitors present had observed 
that the Zulu march had been peaceful until AK-47-wielding 
gunmen opened fire without provocation. 
  "Let today's events be a warning to the world: the proud 
Zulu nation shall not be subjected to communist domination, 
either in the form of the ANC or the National Party," the AWB 
said. 
  "Likewise the Boer nation will also not rest until it has 
won 
freedom in its own land."

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] should stop 
and consider the catastrophic consequences of their violence, 
Democratic Party [DP] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
leader Tony Leon said on Monday. 
  In a statement responding to killings during a Zulu march in 
the city centre earlier in the day, Mr Leon said: "All parties 
should now consider the national interest of this country before 
pushing South Africa over the precipice into a Bosnian-type 
civil war. It is intolerable that the commercial heartland of 
South Africa should be paralysed by mass action of this sort. 
It is equally clear that not enough is being done to foster a 
breakthrough on the kwaZulu issue, and mob tactics of the type 
witnessed today take us even further away from a solution." 
  Mr Leon said the DP understood ANC security guards had taken 
it upon themselves to fire live ammunition into the crowds and 
said this was "both illegal and grossly irresponsible". 
  "Both the IFP and ANC should pull back and consider the 
catastrophic consequences of their campaign of mutual violence."

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- At least 31 people 
died in violence in central Johannesburg on Monday and 276 
people were injured severely enough to warrant hospital 
treatment. 
  A total of 31 bodies related to Monday's violence have been 
accounted for by the Hillbrow mortuary. At least seven people 
died in Soweto on Monday, but not all the deaths have been 
directly linked to the Zulu march on Johannesburg. 
  Johannesburg and Soweto hospitals treated 276 people for 
injuries sustained in the running street battles.

  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] 
has condemned the carnage and mayhem in central Johannesburg on 
Monday, saying such chaos made an all-inclusive political 
solution less attainable. 
  "We deplore the fact that a whole city could be held hostage 
by political organisations who cannot solve their disputes 
peacefully and responsibly," said NP director of information Mr 
Marthinus van Schalkwyk. He added, however, there were too many 
differing viewpoints to form a definite picture of who started 
the carnage.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- Bands of armed men 
were on Tuesday morning reportedly entering Johannesburg city 
centre. On Monday a march by tens of thousands of Zulu 
royalists in the city centre ended in many deaths and hundreds 
of injuries. Some reports put the death toll at 31. 
  On Tuesday morning, about 100 men with spears and assegais 
poured out of a train near Newtown, scattering panicked 
commuters. Minibus taxis blocked roads into the area and traffic 
turned back. But the armed men soon vanished. Many Soweto 
commuters were left stranded again on Tuesday as minibus 
services came to a halt. 
  There were unconfirmed reports of another group of armed men 
moving into the city from Booysens. 
  An SAP [South African Police] spokesman said police had gone 
to Newtown. He said police had received reports of South 
African Communist Party supporters gathering for a march, but 
details were unclear. 
  A police search of a train at New Canada railway station on 
Monday night yielded three AK-47 rifles and 10 pistols. Nine 
people were arrested.

  [Text] Durban March 29 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini has requested a postponement of this week's meeting 
with State President F. W. de Klerk, African National Congress 
[ANC] leader Nelson Mandela and Inkatha's Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  In a faxed letter to Mr de Klerk on Monday, the Zulu monarch 
said he was experiencing difficulties with the days proposed for 
the meeting. King Zwelithini said it would be "inappropriate" 
for him to talk about the future of his kingdom before victims 
of Monday's violence in Johannesburg were buried. He also 
expressed fears about an appropriate and safe venue. 
  The Zulu king further said he was concerned about 
"commencing 
very difficult discussions and negotiations during this week 
which is a holy week in the Christian calender". 
  "There is also the fact that the kwaZulu Legislative 
Assembly 
has risen until April 7." He proposed that the meeting be 
postponed until "the week after Easter" provided violence abated 
sufficiently and simmering anger in Zulu communities subsided.

<F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban March 29 SAPA -- King Zwelithini said 
Monday's violence in Johannesburg had "further compounded 
problems", explaining that his subjects' anger "is such that an 
early meeting is quite out of the question". 
  "I must, I think, call for a moratorium on all negotiations 
about the future of the kingdom until people have been given the 
opportunity to bury their dead, and until such time as the 
fierce anger in their breasts has abated somewhat." 
  The king said he also feared for his safety after Monday's 
events. His advisors would be reluctant to put their king in 
the hands of "those whom they believed killed them" and in the 
hands of a government which had been powerless to do anything to 
prevent Monday's tragedy. 
  Reacting to the king's request, a spokesman for the state 
president's office said Mr de Klerk felt the present situation 
warranted the holding of the meeting before the weekend. 
Efforts to hold the summit as soon as possible would continue 
and Mr de Klerk was trying to get in touch with King Goodwill 
about the matter, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 
radio news quoted the spokesman as saying. 
  ANC [African National Congress] Spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa 
said 
his organisation had not been formally notified of the king's 
requests. Mr Mamoepa said it would be unfortunate if the 
meeting, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, was postponed 
"given the gravity of the current situation in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and Natal". He said the 
situation demanded the leaders meet urgently "to ensure the 
whole democratic process moves forward". 
  "It's crucial and critical that all players must be 
involved... To bring about a stable situation to ensure our 
people participate freely in the forthcoming elections," he said.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service] </F>
  [Text] The government remains passive, De Klerk fiddles 
while Natal burns! The violence throughout Natal/kwaZulu 
escalates, while the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] fans the 
flames. While Chief Minister Buthelezi prattles on about 
"principles," "sovereignty" and "federalism," his supporters are 
receiving the hidden sub-text of his message: prevent by all 
possible means a free and fair election! Venues for publicly 
advertised election rallies are being denied to the ANC by gangs 
of armed Inkatha intruders. Throughout the province, homes of 
known supporters of Inkatha's opponents are being torched, and 
their occupants driven to flight by armed IFP gangs. Men, women 
and children are being gunned down in orchestrated gang attacks 
and in terrorist 'drive-by' shootings. Buthelezi, the kwaZulu 
government and kwaZulu Police wash their hands of any 
responsibility of complicity. 
  This situation cannot be allowed to continue, it is bringing 
the province to a state of low-intensity civil war, which is 
broadening out beyond the provincial borders - vice todays 
IFP-inspired terror on the Witwatersrand. Here citizens going 
about their business in central Johannesburg have been 
terrorised by roaming bands of armed Inkatha gunmen, shooting at 
random, ANC headquarters at Shell House have come under attack 
with firearms, and our leaders and administrators besieged; and 
forced to return fire in self defence. Unknown numbers of people 
are dead and wounded in this bloody aftermath to what the IFP 
claimed was a "demonstration of loyalty" to Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini. 
  Unrestrained IFP gangsterism is destroying the hopes of the 
majority of our people for our first-ever free vote to determine 
the nature of our own next government. It is allowing the gangs 
and bully-boys to disrupt the course of democratic change, and 
to elevate the rule of the armed mob above the majority will of 
the whole South African population. 
  Buthelezi claims to be motivated by high principles of 
"federalism" and Zulu "sovereignty." Such `principles' were 
never in evidence during the years when his power in kwaZulu 
derived from patronage from the apartheid state. They only 
emerge now to sanitise his efforts to prevent government power 
passing finally from the minority NP [National Party] government 
which installed, upheld and subsidised him in power. 
  Buthelezi's frenzied opposition to the whole electoral 
process is not based on principle. It is based purely on 
expediency and fear. Every public opinion poll taken in the 
province points conclusively to a decisive election-day defeat 
for the IFP. That is a verdict substantiated by the hundreds of 
thousands of Zulus who turned out at last weekend's rallies and 
marches in Durban and Pietermaritzburg, in support both of the 
ANC and of the right to vote on April 27th. Buthelezi and the 
IFP dare not face the verdict of the voters. 
  On his part, De Klerk claims to be inhibited from action to 
stabilise the Natal/kwaZulu turmoil, by considerations of 
caution, and fear of creating worse disorder. His motives too 
are suspect. He purports to be acting as a responsible head of 
state. But he also has one eye to advancing the NP election 
campaign whose main electoral plank is that it can "stop the 
ANC". Buthelezi's ambitions and De Klerk's run parallel. The 
vicious IFP campaign of murder and mayhem in Natal is also 
designed to "stop the ANC". 
  It is time to call a halt to this conspiracy against the 
people of Natal and kwaZulu. 
  There are only four weeks to the election. Neither the 
thuggery of the IFP nor the indecision and lack of leadership 
from the government can be allowed to dictate the outcome. 
  If the government will not act, the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] must. It must act firmly and without delay. 
  The SADF [South African Defense Force] must now be deployed 
throughout Natal/kwaZulu in sufficient strength to bring the 
bandit gangs under control. 
  All members of the kwaZulu Police [KZP] who have been 
implicated in or trained in the secret "3rd force" camps 
identified by the Goldstone Commission, must be immediately 
disarmed and stood down. 
  The remaining members of the KZP must be brought under SADF 
command and control. 
  All units of the SA Police Internal Stability Units must be 
withdrawn from the province, and their duties taken on by the 
SADF and deployed members of the National Peace Keeping Force. 
  The financial subsidies to the kwaZulu administration should 
be suspended immediately, until full compliance by the kwaZulu 
administration with the requirements of the Independent Election 
Commission [IEC] for free campaigning and voting. 
  Conditions must now be created to enable the IEC to commence 
setting up polling stations throughout Natal/kwaZulu, under full 
protection of the national security forces. 
  The IFP attempt to frustrate the will of the overwhelming 
majority of South Africans can not be allowed to continue. The 
IFP can not be allowed a veto over the rights of all others. 
The TEC must step in without further delay.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- African National 
Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela was on Monday given a 
clean bill of health by prominent Johannesburg medical academic 
Prof Harry Seftel. 
  Prof Seftel said he had been authorised to release limited 
details on Mr Mandela's medical condition. 
  Mr Mandela's "sore throat" had correctly been diagnosed as 
laryngitis and the laryngitis had responded to treatment. 
  Prof Seftel had seen Mr Mandela about 3PM Monday and also 
gave him a general examination. 
  The ANC leader was generally "in good physical shape -- 
particularly taking into account his age and punishing schedule". 
  Mr Mandela had also appeared "very calm" in the face of the 
violence that broke out in Johannesburg on Monday, the professor 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with kwaZulu Chief Minister Dr. Mangosuthu </F>
Buthelezi by SABC announcer Freek Robinson in Ulundi; followed 
by response by Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Justice 
Johann Kriegler with SABC announcer Max Du Preez in the 
Johannesburg studio, from the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Before I introduce my questions, 
introduce a few observations, firstly to say that the questions 
I'm putting to you are questions that I picked up from various 
people, to put to you so that we get some clarity. Secondly, I 
am not in a position to understand Zulu cultural ... culture at 
its heart, and therefore I would really like you to give us some 
clarification. Can I start by asking you: If the king says he 
advises his people not to vote, what does it mean in practice? 
Does it mean that he is actually ordering them not to vote? 
  [Buthelezi] No, I think that the king is expressing no more 
than a dissatisfaction, because in fairness to the king I think 
that you must recall that on the 17 January we went to see Mr. 
De Klerk about these concerns and he also saw Mr. de Klerk on 14 
February, and also on 1 February -- and 14 February and 22 
February -- and each time he said that he wanted Mr. De Klerk as 
the de facto and de jure head of state to fix up or to put right 
that which he asked him to put right as far as the sovereignty 
of his kingdom is concerned, before the elections, so that 
therefore, when he speaks like that I think he is saying no more 
than the fact that he cannot be positive towards elections if 
elections in fact are removing from the table, these very deep 
concerns about the monarchy itself as an institution and also 
about the kingdom of KwaZulu. 
  [Robinson] But the question specifically that I put to you 
-- 
let's put it a different way: Would people on the ground, 
ordinary folk in the street, interpret the king's advice as 
being actually an order not to vote? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, he has not put it as an order really, as 
far as I have heard him, but he says that most of the ... 
[changes thought] many Zulu people agree with the king -- I 
think many of his subjects agree with him, and therefore, 
because he believes that if this matter is not sorted out before 
the elections, which is not just the opinion of the king -- I 
think yesterday in the talks that we had with Mr. de Klerk it 
seems to me that at long last Mr. de Klerk himself appreciates 
that something must be done about this and possibly that a 
meeting is needed either between himself and the king and Mr. 
Mandela to try and sort this out as soon as possible, possibly 
this week, so quite clearly the king is saying to his people, 
that you know, if there is going to be a unilateral imposition 
of this 1993 constitution, which doesn't say anything about his 
kingdom, doesn't say anything about the sovereignty of kwaZulu, 
shared sovereignty or even full sovereignty, then he means that, 
therefore, he cannot recommend to them that they should 
participate in an election which literally expunges the Zulu 
nation from the South African map. 
  [Robinson] Let's leave that for a moment. Can I get back to 
the meeting that you have had with State President de Klerk 
yesterday. What does it mean when you say jointly that 
mechanisms will be put in place to ensure free and fair 
elections? What does it mean? 
  [Buthelezi] I suppose that it is just another word, of 
saying 
that booths will be set up where it is possible -- facilities 
will be made available to the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC]. That's how I understand that to mean. 
  [Robinson] Does it mean in practice that you are giving your 
full cooperation in a process to ensure free and fair elections? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, Freek, from the very word go when the 
judge 
came to see me in Ulundi on the 17 of last month, I actually 
assured him that I regarded it as a democratic right for 
citizens of South Africa who want to participate in the 
elections to do so. In the same way the converse of that coin 
is that those who do not want to participate have a democratic 
right not to participate, and that has alway? been my guideline 
as far as that is concerned, and from the very word go, in fact, 
I asked the judge on the 17th to set up mechanisms as soon as 
possible. It was my suggestion, not even his. Therefore, I just 
don't understand, you know, I am being badgered by the question, 
will you give him full cooperation, because even the resolution 
that was passed by the cabinet of kwaZulu, in fact, makes it 
very, very clear that we have prepared, wherever it was possible 
to do so, to give the Independent Electoral Commission full 
cooperation. 
  [Robinson] But it seems to me, Dr. Buthelezi, on the basis 
of 
what the IEC has said, that they did not get the impression that 
the members of the Legislative Assembly were in the mood to give 
that cooperation. In fact, they have said, the IEC, that the 
proceedings had been stage managed to humiliate them. 
  [Buthelezi] I don't know -- anyone with anything between 
their ears would really have a very low opinion of me and my 
colleagues to say that we could stage manage any humiliation of 
the judge and the Independent Electoral Commission. Let me just 
say, by the way, that I have known the judge for more than 20 
years. In fact at one time he represented, as an advocate, the 
interests of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] when one of our 
publications was banned by the government, so therefore, I have 
always held him in high esteem, and then, let us go to the 
question of how the judge came to Ulundi. The Judge was here on 
the 17 February, and then he -- suddenly he requested, you know, 
another meeting with me -- not only with me, he wanted a meeting 
with the king. He wanted a meeting with members of the Assembly. 
He wanted a meeting with Amakhosi [chiefs]. He wanted a 
meeting with senior officials of the government. So therefore 
... 
  [Robinson interrupting] Dr. Buthelezi ... 
  [Buthelezi continuing] So, therefore, I had to put together 
a 
meeting where he could deliver a message to all these people, 
and therefore, the resolution of the cabinet was actually read 
out to him before others spoke, and to say in those 
circumstances, when I did just what he wanted by bringing all 
those people together, that he wanted together, is nothing but 
sheer poppycock, from my point of view, with all due respect to 
him. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, I have been told by our technical 
staff in Johannesburg that we have limited time but may I at the 
same time also appeal to our colleagues at FCC [expansion 
unknown] to try to give us a few extra minutes since we have had 
these problems. Could I put it to you, now just to come to very 
practical terms: What are you going to do, to ensure from your 
side, that your cooperation will mean, in practice, that there 
will be free and fair elections? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, the judge asked for facilities from us. He 
asked for schools. We told him the number of schools that are 
available to the government will be made available to the 
Independent Electoral Commission. We made a distinction between 
those schools which are actually government schools and schools 
that are actually the property of communities -- in our 
communities, and that, therefore, we have no authority over 
those. We told the judge that all government buildings, whether 
it's courts or police stations, that belong to us, we have made 
available. So all the facilities that he wanted from us, which 
it was possible for us to make available for election purposes, 
we said we would make available, so I really don't know what 
more was expected of us. 
  [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, can I attend to something else: Do 
you align yourself with the declaration by the king for 
sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom? 
  [Buthelezi] Let me say this -- the king never raised this 
subject before when we were trying to negotiate a federal 
formula, that the self-determination of the Zulu people would be 
exercised through a federation, but when they failed to deliver 
that federation, when the king then raised these subjects 
because he became anxious when realizing that we were being 
pushed into a unitary state, whereas we came into the Union of 
South Africa willy nilly, in fact, through the barrel of the 
gun, therefore, as a loyal subject of the king I said I was 
disarmed. I think in one interview by the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] TV I said that I was completely 
disarmed when the federation was rejected, because what can I 
say to the king when he says -- what about my future? What 
about the [words indistinct] as an institution? What about the 
kingdom of KwaZulu institution, because after all, KwaZulu was a 
sovereign state, was an independent sovereign state and which 
was not ordained by God that we should be part of one South 
Africa. But all along I have always said myself that history 
had made us that and that, therefore, I preferred a system where 
we could continue to be part of South Africa. 
  [Robinson] Now, can I put it, since you quoted it in those 
terms, that you said in an interview earlier, some years ago 
that there is nothing ordained by God which forces apartheid and 
the ideals for self-determination on human society. At the time 
you were actually very scathing about the idea of 
self-determination. 
  [Buthelezi] I was talking about self-determination as 
spelled 
out by the apartheid regime. I mean self-determination is 
recognized by the United Nations. I was not talking about self 
... [pauses] Self-determination is not something, you know, that 
I regarded this day, but in that context it was the self- 
determination through the ideology of apartheid. 
  [Robinson] Could I put it to you Doctor, with great respect, 
some people say the mere fact that the king has proclaimed 
freedom and sovereignty for the Zulu kingdom is in fact a device 
to ensure for himself, and for you as his Prime Minister, 
continued power without contesting elections. 
  [Buthelezi] The king doesn't need to contest an election. 
The king doesn't have to beg for his sovereignty -- or 
sovereignty of his state or of his people from anyone. The king 
doesn't need to do that. The king -- in fact that sovereignty 
is not compared by any person because we were a sovereign 
people, and when now you come and say that well, now we are 
putting right that what was wrong, by allowing everyone in the 
country to be free, to decide what form of state he wants, the 
king has every right to do so, and it's nonsensical to say, to 
suggest that, you know, the king is doing this to ensure power 
for himself and so on, I mean, there are kingdoms right on the 
border of KwaZulu, one in Lesotho and one in Swaziland, of 
nations that we respect very much but which are smaller than the 
Zulu nation, now if we take the absence of any federation, the 
king has every right to say that he wants to know what sort of 
future that he and his people will have. 
  [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Buthelezi, unfortunately I'm being 
told by the people in Johannesburg that we don't have any more 
time, but I would like to continue our conversation and record 
it so that we can still broadcast it at a later stage. Thank 
you very much for your cooperation, and I pass over to 
Johannesburg. 
  [Du Preez] Judge Kriegler, a quick reaction from you on what 
Mr. Buthelezi had said. 
  [Kriegler] I heard what chief minister said. I didn't hear 
what I wanted to hear, namely, that there will be real, 
meaningful, on the ground cooperation -- ostensible cooperation, 
protestations of willingness, simply will not enable us to do 
our job, and I'm appealing to the chief minister, and I hope 
Freek Robinson can record it in the rest of the evening, that 
they will settle down and talk real business to us and not have 
ostensible cooperation and actual frustration. 
  [Du Preez] Thank you Mr. Justice Kriegler. That's it for 
tonight.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  THE CITIZEN </H5>
  ANC Instigates kwaZulu Showdown -- "KwaZulu is heading, we 
are afraid, for a showdown instigated by the ANC [African 
National Congress] and its allies," points out the page 6 
editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25 March. 
Justice Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral 
Commission (IEC), "whose visits to Bophuthatswana preceded the 
toppling of Mr Mangope, has descended on Ulundi to demand the 
cooperation of the kwaZulu Government in the running of the 
election." "Clearly the ANC is plotting what it calls a popular 
uprising to get rid of Chief Buthelezi; the government is 
sending more troops into Natal in case of trouble; Mr Justice 
Kriegler is intent on getting the election run the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] way, and Chief Buthelezi and 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] are making concessions, but not 
enough to stave off intervention" from the TEC. 
<H5>  THE STAR </H5>
  Zwelithini Can Establish Cooperation in Kwazulu -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28 March in a page 14 
editorial believes the "dire situation in kwaZulu/Natal has come 
about primarily because Buthelezi and his Cabinet will not use 
their power to ensure a free vote and a free boycott. The chief 
minister's reassurances to the contrary are mocked by armed 
supporters occupying stadiums; the situation is untenable. 
Something is going to have to give, and the question is not 
whether an election will take place in the province, but at what 
cost." THE STAR believes Zulu King Zwelithini can establish the 
"requisite degree of stability and co-operation" in kwaZulu "if 
he were to make an independent and visionary intervention, 
persuading his subjects to allow those who want to vote to do so 
freely, and those who wish to stay away to exercise the same 
freedom of choice, peacefully." 
<H5>  BUSINESS DAY </H5>
  TEC Must Intervene 'Legally' in Kwazulu Issue -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 March in a page 6 
editorial says "KwaZulu seems likely to have freedom imposed on 
it this week. The question will be whether government and the 
Transitional Executive Council can do so legally and relatively 
peacefully before ANC revolutionaries do it for them." "It is 
probably too much to hope that the TEC will admonish ANC leaders 
for their increasingly militant threats to take matters into 
their own hands. It is not just the hotheads in the ANC Natal 
leadership who are threatening to overthrow KwaZulu leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. And Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's senior TEC 
representative who announced the decision to depose the 
Bophuthatswana administration, leaves no room for doubt that the 
ANC's demand is free political activity or else." BUSINESS DAY 
believes Buthelezi's continued rule in the "kwaZulu homeland 
will depend on the degree to which he, his administration and 
his party assist the democratic process." However, securing 
political freedom in Natal should be through orders "given by 
civil authority, not militants and revolutionaries." 
  Eroded Police Morale, Need for Restructuring -- "Police 
morale is being eroded on two fronts -- at the top, where 
long-serving, mostly right-wing officers worry about their 
future under a new government, and in the lower ranks, where 
policemen are frequently killed or injured in the many-sided 
political conflict," notes a second editorial on the same page. 
Now, if the Goldstone interim report implicating senior 
policemen in gun running and hit squad activities are is upheld 
by the international inquiry, "the way will be open for a purge 
and substantial restructuring." In the restructuring there are 
"strong reasons to support the suggestion by Institute of 
Defence Policy executive director Jakkie Cilliers that the 
police's public order function should be transferred to a 
separate arm of the new national defence force. The SAP [South 
African Police] can then devote itself to community policing and 
fighting crime, which have been badly neglected because of the 
force's quasi-military role in the political turmoil." 
<H5>  SOWETAN </H5>
  De Klerk Must Take Necessary Steps in KwaZulu Issue -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 28 March in a page 12 
editorial says President de Klerk is "naive" to believe the mere 
assurances of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will ensure free and 
fair elections in kwaZulu and the rest of Natal. "The IFP's 
political options have been reduced to the far-fetched concept 
of a sovereign Zulu kingdom and the hope that international 
mediation would deliver on its constitutional demands. A 
successful poll in Natal next month would mean a guaranteed ANC 
victory and a power shift away from Ulundi. The wrecking of the 
elections in Natal is therefore an imperative for the IFP." "De 
Klerk's political dilemma is understandable. He does not want 
to be seen as a pawn in an alleged ANC scheme to make kwaZulu 
ungovernable. His responsibilities as head of Government, 
however, demand that he takes the necessary steps to ensure free 
and fair elections and end the bloodshed in Natal."

  [Text] In Cameroon, there has been a fresh wave of 
inter-ethnic clashes in the extreme north of the country. 
According to the Red Cross, more than 1,000 Cameroonians have 
crossed the border to find refuge in a Chadian village. 
Christophe Champain reports: 
  [Champain] There have been unprecedented clashes over the 
last few days in several villages of the Logone et Chari 
department in the extreme north of Cameroon, while the 
Cameroonian Army has been trying for two months now to put an 
end to the activities of the infamous roadblockers. According 
to official sources contacted today in Kousseiri, it is 
precisely the attack by roadblockers on the village of 
(Kounzayakou) near the Logone river, on the border with Chad, 
which led to this flare-up. Given the confusion in the region 
at the moment, it is difficult to know precisely what happened 
during the ensuing days. However, according to the prefect of 
Kousseiri, the main town in the department, people erecting 
roadblocks have invaded and looted several other villages in the 
districts of (Klangwa) and Makari, close to the Chadian border. 
The Cameroonian Army went to the scene three days ago in order 
to try and restore order. However, the situation remains tense 
in the zone where the clashes took place, and only the military 
have access to it for the time being.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Cameroonian soldiers have been on alert for the last 
three days in the far north of the country on the border with 
Chad as part of an operation codenamed Scorpion. They have been 
sent in after a series of armed bandit raids thought by the 
Cameroonian authorities to have been carried out by Chadian 
bandits. The attacks have inflamed the existing ethnic tensions 
between Kotokos and Arab Choas in the north and hundreds have 
been forced to flee the area. From Yaounde, William Wallace 
reports: 
  [Begin Wallace recording] At least a thousand people have 
fled into neighboring Chad from the region of Logone and Chari 
in the last few days. Their flight, according to official 
sources in Kousseri, the main town in the region, has been 
caused by an unprecedented series of attacks on villages carried 
out by armed bandits. Three days ago, the Cameroon Army was 
called into the affected districts of (Blondjoua) and Makari, 
situated between the banks of Lake Chad and the River Logone, in 
order to restore order. But according to a local magistrate who 
I talked to this morning, the situation remains extremely tense. 
  The fighting started 10 days ago when a group of armed 
bandits attacked the village of (Kounze Akou) situated on the 
River Logone which forms the border between Chad and Cameroon. 
A bullet fired by the bandits reached the Chadian village of 
(al-Deby) on the other side of the river, wounding one woman. 
Members of the Chadian Army based there crossed over in a 
pirogue [canoe] and, in an exchange of fire, killed four of the 
bandits who, according to some reports, were identified as 
Chadian rebels loyal to the now deceased dissident, Abass Koty. 
Of the remaining bandits, six Chadians were said to have been 
executed on the spot and a further 10 Cameroonians were arrested 
and taken to Chad. 
  Following the incident, at least five more villages have 
come 
under attack, amongst them the Kotoko village of (Enganatia), 
which, according to the local prefect, was burned to the ground 
by bandits. When I asked the local prefect, Delphon Zono, if he 
could confirm reports that fighting had broken out between the 
long-term rivals, the Arabs and the Kotokos, he said that it was 
not impossible but that today the area had been too risky to 
enter and the exact motive of all the attacks was still unclear. 
  He attributed the conflict to the massive presence of armed 
criminals from the area, many of them from Chad, but he did not 
exclude the possibility that the bandits were being aided by 
members of the local population. He said that those who have 
fled the area in panic are from both the Arab and Kotoko 
communities as well as Nigerians and Chadians resident in 
Cameroon. The exact numbers of dead and wounded following the 
attack have yet to be confirmed and according to local sources 
many of the bodies have still to be found and identified. [end

  [Excerpt] The Chad-Libya conflict over the Aozou Strip is 
not relevant to the issue of national reconciliation in Chad. 
This clarification was made by the Chadian National Liberation 
Front in a communique datelined in Lagos. 
  At the moment, a Chadian delegation is in Tripoli to 
negotiate the modalities for the withdrawal of Libyan troops 
from the strip, annexed 21 years ago by Libya, as stipulated in 
the verdict handed over on the issue by the International Court 
of Justice. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Several weeks after the proclamation of the 
results of the legislative elections which saw the emergence of 
a parliamentary majority, Togolese still do not know their 
future prime minister. After a long controversy over the choice 
of the new head of government, the parliamentary majority, 
formed by a coalition of the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] 
and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], recently declared 
that they have agreed on a name for the post of prime minister. 
However, since then the people have been waiting. How does the 
Office of the President of the Republic react to this impasse? 
Tonight we have invited Koffi Panou, spokesman for the 
Presidency of the Republic. He is interviewed by Kodjovi 
Gbadayi: 
  [Gbadayi] Mr. Koffi Panou, good evening. 
  [Panou] Good evening. 
  [Gbadayi] You surely heard our colleague Koffiblah's 
introduction. Do you have any clarifications to make on this 
statement? 
  [Panou] Yes, certainly, I am going to do that right now. On 
the afternoon of Wednesday, 25 March 1994, the head of state 
received a letter from the chairman of CAR requesting a meeting 
with the two leaders of the parliamentary majority, Mr. Yaovi 
Agboyibor and Edem Kodjo, to discuss the condition for the 
appointment of a prime minister. The head of state accepted 
this request, but he could not get a hold of the two leaders. In 
lieu of the meeting scheduled between him and the chairmen of 
CAR and UTD to collect their views on the person to be appointed 
prime minister, it was through a UTD-CAR joint communique issued 
on 26 March 1994 and broadcast on the radio that the head of 
state learned that the CAR had officially chosen somebody for 
the post of prime minister and that the UTD had agreed to this 
choice. 
  Yesterday, Monday, 28 March 1994, it came to the attention 
of 
the head of state, through a statement jointly issued by the CAR 
and UTD on 26 March 1994, that they had agreed on the following: 
  1. The person proposed by the CAR for the post of prime 
minister and which was agreed upon by the UTD is Mr. Yaovi 
Agboyibor. 
  2. A joint delegation of the two parties composed of (Mr. 
Egbor Gahoujor) of CAR, (Georges Ahidame), CAR, (Yao Fegni) of 
UTD, and (Atchiabesson Ajavon) of UTD have been charged to 
transmit the name agreed upon to the president of the Republic. 
  The head of state regrets to say that the two leaders of the 
parliamentary majority did not deem it necessary to meet with 
him so that together they can collect their viewpoints on the 
conditions for the appointment of a prime minister, because, 
according to the provisions of Article 56 of the Constitution, 
the prime minister is not appointed by the parliamentary 
majority, but is appointed by the president of the Republic from 
among that majority. This calls for a constant dialogue between 
the head of state and the two leaders. 
  It is within this context that, during the recent 
discussions 
the president had with the two leaders of the majority, the two 
leaders were asked to propose several candidates from whom a 
prime minister could be appointed in accordance with the 
Constitution. Consequently, the president of the Republic deems 
it indispensable that consultations should continue to be held 
directly between him and the two leaders of the majority.

  [Text] The peace talks are continuing in Lusaka, Zambia. 
Today, the negotiating team of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] met with Faustino Muteka's 
delegation to study methods to be used in discussing the topic 
of dealing with the second round of presidential elections. The 
parties had to move to this topic because of the intransigence 
and arrogance demonstrated by the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party. Basing its arguments on the 
so-called electoral victory after the rigged elections, it 
refuses to make important concessions. Faced with an impasse, 
Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary 
general in Angola, decided to move on to the electoral issue, 
which appears to be less polemical.

  [Text] There was gunfire in Malange today. A military 
source said this happened when government troops tried to break 
through the defensive lines of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the region. The source also 
said that in the face of this provocation, the UNITA Armed 
Forces reacted with intense gunfire, forcing the enemy's 
immediate retreat. During the clashes, many government soldiers 
lost their lives. The situation is presently calm.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on 29 March on the SAPA PR Wire </F>
Service] 
  [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] demonstration in 
central Johannesburg on Monday March 28th has been widely 
described in the media as "a Zulu march". It was nothing of the 
sort. Though the IFP constantly claims to speak for "the 
Zulus", every opinion poll of Zulu opinion has shown that a 
clear majority of Zulus reject the IFP and support the ANC 
[African National Congress]. Monday's events were not a Zulu 
affair but solely and simply an IFP adventure. Nor was there a 
"march", the so-called march was simply a cover for a preplanned 
assault on the ANC apparatus in Johannesburg. 
  Well before the IFP mobs gathered in central Johannesburg, 
the ANC had intelligence information of an aggression against 
the ANC planned to take place during Monday's demonstration. 
This information was formally passed to the South African 
Police [SAP] on Sunday, and a formal request was made for the 
SAP to control the route of the demonstration and to cordon off 
streets around the ANC buildings. The SAP failed to do either, 
until after the attacks had taken place. 
  This was a clear dereliction of duty by the responsible SAP 
officers. Even after the IFP began to spread panic by random 
shooting and assaults in the streets of central Johannesburg, 
police took no steps to control the marchers' routes, or to 
cordon off ANC headquarters. Early on in the day, it must have 
been clear to the police that the advertised venue for the 
demonstration at the Library Gardens had been a diversion. 
Groups of marchers who had gathered at various places in the 
city began to move away from the Library Gardens towards Shell 
House to the west. Whether police shepherded them or ignored 
them is still not clear. Whatever the truth, the SAP will have 
to explain themselves. Their present excuse of "insufficient 
forces" is not acceptable in the light of the explicit 
fore-warnings they had been given. 
  There is a stark contrast between the SAP actions in 
Johannesburg on Monday, and their actions during the much larger 
ANC march through the centre of Durban on the Friday before. 
The Durban march of some 100,000 passed off completely 
peacefully. The ANC supporters were completely unarmed. The 
route had been agreed between the SAP and the ANC; it was 
adhered to. Yet the entire route was cordoned off with razor 
wire before the march began to prevent incursions by 
provocators. The SAP will have to explain why the Johannesburg 
route was not similarly controlled. And more pertinently, why 
there was no attempt to disarm the IFP bands before the 
Johannesburg march was allowed to proceed. 
  It can scarcely be coincidental that the IFP marchers were 
being co-ordinated by Themba Khoza, recently named by the 
Goldstone Commission as one of those involved inter alia in 
gunrunning for the IFP, in collusion with certain SAP senior 
officers of the so-called 3rd force. Khoza returned from Natal 
immediately before the march. His spurious claim that the 
shooting in the streets was done by ANC members who infiltrated 
the Inkatha ranks, seems to be a total fabrication. The ANC 
states categorically that there were no ANC snipers anywhere in 
Johannesburg, and all ANC security personnel operated at Shell 
House on the ground floor. If Khoza knew in advance about the 
presence of such `snipers' -- as he apparently claims -- the 
real question is whether they did not originate from the 3rd 
force? 
  The Johannesburg events which led to the unnecessary deaths 
of at least 25 people and the wounding of hundreds more have 
been variously described by reporters, few of whom were on the 
scene of the actual shootings when they occurred. Many reports 
have been assembled at second hand from accounts of casual 
by-standers, often in state of shock, and untrained to observe 
and report. As a result, incidents from one place have been 
concertina-ed into incidents from another, and times of one 
event conflated into times of another. The SABC, for example, 
in a televised opinion of DP [Democratic Party] Peace 
Secretariat member Rupert Lorimer of a "crowd...in a fairly 
peaceful mood", related to a scene at the Library Gardens; but 
his comment was placed against TV coverage of carnage at Shell 
House -- a different place and a different time. 
  Those who were on the scene of the violent confrontation at 
Shell House were the ANC staff, and the ANC security personnel 
who were deployed around the building from an early hour. 
<H5>  The Events As Witnessed From the ANC Premises </H5>
  Reports had been reaching Shell House since around 8AM of 
armed demonstrators attacking people around the ANC regional 
office in Jeppe Street; innocent passers-by seeking shelter in 
the offices were being pursued. No police had been deployed. 
ANC security personnel were compelled to fire warning shots 
into the air to prevent a massed attack on the building. Police 
arrived at the office later, and checked that all arms held by 
the ANC security staff were licensed shotguns. They then 
withdrew. The demonstrators returned to the attack shortly 
after 9AM, attempting to enter the building through the garage. 
Warning shots were again fired by security staff. So far as is 
known there was one person injured in the first shooting 
incident, and no one in the second. 
  After this second incident, ANC Regional Secretary Paul 
Masitile phoned General Callitz of the SAP, who promised to 
deploy police personnel in the area around the regional office. 
At about the same time, NEC [National Executive Committee] 
member Joe Nhlanhla phoned General Beukes of the SAP in Pretoria 
to ask for urgent action to cordon off Shell House. Ten 
policemen under the command of a sergeant were deployed at 
around 10.15AM. 
  At around 11.20AM IFP marchers, moving from the west -- that 
is away from the Library Gardens area -- reached the vicinity of 
Shell House. They divided into two groups, one moving to the 
back of the building while the remainder assembled on the 
pavement opposite the entrance to the building. As this group 
advanced on the building, ANC security personnel stationed 
outside the entrance fired warning shots in the air. The IFP 
group retreated. A second group of attackers, led by a man 
carrying an AK-47 assault rifle appeared from the west side of 
the building, firing as they came. The ANC security staff 
withdrew from the pavement into the building, firing a second 
volley of warning shots. At this stage, no police personnel 
were visible. 
  The IFP bands began to coalesce, and to advance on the 
building for what appeared to be a concerted frontal assault on 
the entrance. Shots were heard, apparently from automatic 
weapons somewhere west of the entrance. ANC security personnel 
fired into the advancing ranks, inflicting a number of 
casualties, the IFP gangs broke and fled. 
  Despite reports to the contrary, no ANC security personnel 
were stationed above ground floor level on any of the upper 
levels of the building. Nor were any ANC personnel stationed on 
the roof of Shell House or any other building in the vicinity. 
  The ANC considers that its security personnel behaved in a 
thoroughly disciplined and professional manner. They made every 
effort to alert the police to the danger of an IFP attack well 
in advance of the event. They acted with the utmost restraint, 
firing in the air in order to warn off the attackers even when 
they themselves were under fire. Their presence in the 
building, and their right to carry arms for defence of the large 
staff employed here, had long since been established with the 
police. Their final decision to prevent the attack by direct 
fire was fully justified by the provocative behaviour of the 
attackers. 
  The ANC regrets deeply the loss of life and the injuries 
suffered by innocent victims of IFP adventurism, both outside 
Shell House and at other places in and around central 
Johannesburg and in the surrounding townships. None of this was 
fortuitous. It was the inevitable outcome of the insane 
determination of the IFP's leaders to destabilise South Africa 
regardless of the human cost, and so prevent the holding of free 
and fair elections on April 27th. 
  They must not be allowed to succeed. They must not be 
allowed to cover their responsibility for Monday's bloodshed by 
blaming it on a shadowy group of `indunas.' They must be held 
fully accountable for their reckless attempts to plunge the 
whole country into anarchy and civil strife. And so must their 
police accomplices in the 3rd force, and those other police 
officers whose neglect of their public duties on Monday 
contributed directly to the mayhem on the streets. 
  The response to them all will still be given on April 27th, 
by a resounding and overwhelming public vote for a new 
democratic government, committed to equal rights and 
opportunities for all. The gangsters will not be allowed to 
wreck the national future.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- At least 53 people 
died as a result of violence that flared in Johannesburg on 
Monday [28 March], police said on Tuesday. A police statement 
said an investigation into the killings had begun under the 
leadership of Brig Louis van der Westhuizen. The police said 
permission for the Zulu meeting had been applied for and 
granted; the meeting had been peaceful until shooting started; 
chaos and violence followed when "groups of persons" at the 
meeting proceeded into different parts of the city; and one of 
these groups proceeded to African National Congress headquarters 
at Shell House. "Shooting with automatic weapons from within 
Shell House left eight persons dead and 20 persons injured," the 
statement said. "No automatic firearms were found among the 
dead or injured outside Shell House. Two handguns, one of which 
was homemade, were found among these persons."

  [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- Panic and rumour 
abounded in Johannesburg on Tuesday [29 March] in the wake of 
violence that wracked the city during a march in support of Zulu 
King Goodwill Zwelithini on Monday. The running gunbattles in 
the CBD [central business district] that left as many as 36 
people dead and hundreds injured affected the equilibrium of 
Johannesburg's normally stoic central city business people. 
  Rumours of a regrouping of marchers led to several shops 
shutting on Tuesday morning and as sirens from ambulances, on 
their way to routine calls, sounded on the downtown streets 
pedestrians scurried for safety and shopkeepers closed their 
doors or rolled down their metal window covers. Rumours of 
driveby shootings came in from all over the city and although 
there was sporadic gunfire in the CBD, the reaction to it was 
exaggerated. Streets became congested as people jostled for 
positions in the traffic in a bid to flee central Johannesburg. 
  Police were able to confirm one driveby shooting on Tuesday 
at the ANC's [African National Congress] headquarters, Shell 
House. Witwatersrand police spokesman W/O Andy Pieke said the 
occupants of a white car reportedly fired shots at shell house 
at about noon. Police rushed to the scene but found no one 
injured. Gunfire had broken a car's windscreen, he said. 
Police found no trace of the car allegedly involved in the 
shooting. 
  The ANC said Shell House had came under fire from snipers in 
opposite buildings. "The building was similarly occupied by 
snipers on Monday during an aborted attack on the ANC head 
office by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters," the ANC said 
in a statement. 
  The area was cordoned off by police and traffic officers. 
According to people in the vicinity of the shooting a white 
minibus fired at the entrance to Shell House and there was 
gunfire from buildings opposite the ANC headquarters. ANC 
security guards returned fire, SABC radio news reported. The 
occupants of the white vehicle allegedly fired random shots at 
pedestrians and beat up passersby, traffic officers said. No 
one was seriously hurt. 
  Office workers in at least one highrise block near the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange said their management had decided to 
evacuate the building in the mid-afternoon on the advice of John 
Vorster Square police who said "bad elements" were in town. The 
decision drew criticism from some senior personnel working 
frantically to make up time lost during Monday's violence. One 
manager said it appeared both police and management were working 
on the basis of rumours.

<F P=106> [By Raphael Banda] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- A free and fair 
election was possible in South Africa, including in kwaZulu and 
Natal, Indepent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice 
Johann Kriegler said on Tuesday [29 March]. He told a news 
conference a working committee had been established on Monday 
night to explore the possiblility of holding the election in 
kwaZulu, where more than 100 people have been killed in the past 
week. 
  "The Angolan experience indicates that in a society 
infinitely more riven than ours they actually did conduct free 
and fair elections. If they can do it in Angola we can do it 
anywhere in this country, including kwaZulu and Natal," he said. 
  In Angola, rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi rejected the result 
of the internationally monitored election, which his UNITA 
movement lost, and returned to civil war. 
  The IEC also announced at the news conference that there had 
been 305 complaints of infringement of the Electoral Act and 15 
summonses had been issued. Mr Justice Kriegler said two 
elections officials travelled to Durban on Monday night and had 
talks with representatives of the kwaZulu government and the 
Transitional Executive Council on implementation of the IEC's 
mandate in kwaZulu. 
  The meeting agreed to create a working committee that would 
include police to look into the feasibility, "under the current 
political climate, to mount an election in kwaZulu" as a matter 
of urgency, Mr Kriegler said. 
  The committee began its work on Tuesday morning and is 
expected to report on its findings by April 5, Mr Justice 
Kriegler said. If the committee concluded that an election was 
not possible in kwaZulu, it would be up to political leaders to 
find a solution. "As far as the IEC is concerned, that will be a 
political impediment. It will be for the political role players 
to resolve the issue and to remove any poltical impediments," he 
said. 
  The IEC visit to Durban followed talks between President F. 
W. de Klerk and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who 
had pledged to allow the IEC to work in his region. Mr 
Buthelezi's supporters have occupied at least two venues for 
African National Congress rallies in the region, sparking fears 
of a bloody run-up to the election. 
  Political violence has soared in kwaZulu and Natal, leaving 
more than 100 people dead and scores injured in the past week. 
A Zulu march in central Johannesburg on Monday to demand a Zulu 
kingdom erupted in vicious gunbattles that left at least 31 
people dead and hundreds injured. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said planning for the election in 
kwaZulu/Natal was going ahead. He said the IEC on Tuesday 
morning began identifying and securing voting stations 
countrywide. Asked whether the violence in central Johannesburg 
on Monday could have an effect on the election, he said: "It 
does not seem to impact directly on free and election. It may 
have serious political implications later." He added the IEC 
was in regular contact with security forces on plans to ensure 
adequate safety for voters.

<F P=106> [Report by P Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria March 29 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] was looking into greater security force powers 
that would amount to a state of emergency being declared in 
Natal/kwaZulu. TEC Executive Secretary Mac Maharaj told the TEC 
on Tuesday [29 March] that security force action had already 
been stepped up in the territory as violence continued to 
escalate. He said the TEC's law and order sub-council was 
devising regulations to give security forces greater powers. 
These regulations would mean declaring unrest areas or a state 
of emergency in the province, Mr Maharaj said. The actions were 
intended to secure a free and fair election in the territory. 
  The TEC resolution commits the TEC to co-operating with the 
security forces and the South African Government in intensified 
security operations to secure free and fair elections in 
Natal/kwaZulu. The TEC mandated its joint executive secretaries 
and its sub-council on law and order to "interact with 
governmental structures in the drafting of regulations providing 
special powers for the security forces needed to secure the 
safety of voters, the election process and reasonable 
electioneering through party- political activity". The 
resolution recommends in principle that "as soon as may be 
necessary these regulations be put into operation in 
kwaZulu/Natal, under the legislation that may be appropriate at 
that time, that is the declaration of a state of emergency or of 
unrest areas". The TEC said the special powers would be kept 
under constant review by the government, the TEC and the 
Independent Electoral Commission.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 30 SAPA -- The Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] was going ahead with arrangements to 
declare a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu, a TEC source said 
on Wednesday [30 March]. The emergency will remain an option for 
the TEC and President F W de Klerk if the security situation 
continues to deteriorate in the province and if political 
initiatives fail to produce results. The other option is the 
declaration of unrest areas in selected magisterial districts. 
  The TEC on Tuesday agreed in principle to a state of 
emergency to ensure that election preparations went ahead and 
that the security situation was stabilised. Troops were already 
being deployed on an "incremental basis". 
  The TEC's Law and Order Sub-Council, TEC legal advisers and 
government representatives were meeting in Pretoria on Wednesday 
afternoon to draw up the regulations in terms of the public 
safety act. 
  The preparations would be completed by Thursday afternoon, 
putting President de Klerk in a position to introduce at the 
stroke of his pen draconian security measures last seen in the 
province when the state of emergency there was lifted in October 
1990. 
  The TEC source said there would be a state of emergency 
"unless there is major movement on the political front". 
  "The emergency will be held as a sword of Damocles over 
kwaZulu," the source said. 
  Meanwhile, negotiating teams representing the African 
National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party were due to meet 
in Johannesburg on Wednesday afternoon to put the finishing 
touches to preparations for international mediation to resolve 
their outstanding constitutional differences. The mediation 
process could get underway next week. 
  And the four-sided summit involving President de Klerk, ANC 
President Nelson Mandela, IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi and 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is due to take place next week. 
  The TEC source said the emergency regulations may be held in 
abeyance until the outcome of the summit.

<F P=106> [Studio debate with National Party Transvaal leader and </F>
Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha and ANC National Chairman 
Thabo Mbeki chaired by SABC announcers Lester Venter and Tim 
Modise, assisted by panelists "Agenda" announcer Freek Robinson, 
CCV TV announcer Leslie Mashokwe, SABC radio news announcer 
Ferial Haffajee, and RAPPORT journalist Anna-Marie Mischke, on 
the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Modise] On a day of tragic events in Johannesburg, 
we bid you welcome and good evening to this preplanned special 
broadcast on Radio Sesotho, Radio Metro, and TV 1's Agenda. I'm 
Tim Modise. 
  [Venter] And I'm Lester Venter, good evening. Tonight, we 
bring you an election debate between Thabo Mbeki, national 
chairperson of the African National Congress [ANC], and Pik 
Botha, Transvaal leader of the National Party [NP]. 
  [Modise] Lester and I will moderate the debate and we are 
joined by a panel of four journalists who will put the 
questions. They are Anna-Marie Mischke of RAPPORT, Ferial 
Haffajee of the SABC radio news, Leslie Mashokwe of Newsline, 
and Freek Robinson of Agenda. 
  [Venter] Earlier, the two parties drew lots to determine who 
would make the opening statements and who would have the last 
word. Mr. Botha's name came up first, so he will have the first 
three minutes in which to make his opening statement and then 
Mr. Mbeki will do the same. Both candidates will have an 
opportunity to make closing statements of three minutes, and Mr. 
Botha will make his, last. 
  [Modise] Let's go to the ground rules briefly. Freek 
Robinson will ask the first question of Mr. Botha, and Mr. Botha 
will then have two minutes in which to reply. 
  [Venter] Mr. Mbeki will then have two minutes to respond. 
Mr. Botha will then have the floor for one more minute and Mr. 
Mbeki will have another minute to reply. 
  [Modise] The second question will then go to Mr. Mbeki and 
the same rules apply. Candidates will begin speaking on the 
green light which is in front of them, a yellow light will flash 
at 30 seconds before time up, as a warning, and time up is when 
the red light flashes. 
  [Venter] Those are the rules of the game, so without any 
further ado, Mr. Botha, you have three minutes to make your 
opening statement. 
  [Botha] Thank you very much. We are indeed meeting here and 
participating in this event under the somber and depressing 
cloud of the events that occurred in Johannesburg today. I 
would first of all wish to express, and I think everybody here 
present this evening would wish to express our condolences to 
the bereaved families and friends of those who died, 
irrespective of which party or political persuasion they belong 
to. I believe that the most important issues, matters of deep 
concern -- there are many but the most important ones comprise 
the following, first of all, the violence I believe is uppermost 
in the minds of just about all our people. Secondly, I believe 
the high crime rate -- because despite the multitude of deaths 
that have occurred because of political motive -- I understand 
that 90 percent of the violence is still attributable to crime, 
coupled with that, unemployment, no jobs, not sufficient jobs 
for our people, and then education and training, better 
education, better training to equip our people for the strenuous 
circumstances that the New World Order will require of South 
Africans, and then of course housing, proper housing, the 
provision of housing, as well as medical and health care. Now 
let me make it very straight: The one party that is not involved 
in violence is the National Party. The only party that has been 
advocating that the leaders should get together is the National 
Party, and the Goldstone Commission has made a very clear and 
categoric finding as to the main cause of the violence. It is 
the war between Inkatha and the ANC. As far as crime is 
concerned the ANC would now like rapists to vote. They would 
like the gangster of Cape Town, if caught and found guilty, to 
vote. 
  [Venter] Thank you Mr. Botha. I'm afraid gentlemen we are 
going to have to be inflexible with our time allotments. 
  [Modise] Well, the first opportunity went to Mr. Pik Botha 
there. The opening statement this time around will be made by 
the national chairperson of the ANC, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] Well, let me say this, that our country has reached 
a 
decisive point in its history. We are very close to the point 
where the political order in this country should be changed, and 
that's important. This is an objective for which many people 
have sacrificed. Thousands of people have died. Thousands of 
people have been injured to produce a united, nonracial, 
nonsexist democracy. It's an important moment in our history, 
and we believe that such is its importance that all South 
Africans need to be involved in bringing about that kind of 
South Africa. Now there are many challenges to that process, 
some of...some of which were demonstrated today. There are 
people who are opposed to change, who don't want democracy, who 
want a perpetuation of apartheid, a white minority rule. We 
believe that all of us as South Africans ought to join hands to 
solve that problem, not to say this one is to blame, the other 
is to blame, I'm innocent -- but to say as South Africans, what 
do we do in order to ensure free and fair elections. As South 
Africans what do we do to ensure peace. That's important, 
because apart from ensuring free and fair elections part of what 
we've got to do is to create the circumstances, when it would be 
possible for us to rebuild the economy of this country. You 
can't rebuild it in conditions of violence and instability, and 
it doesn't help -- it doesn't help that anyone of us in 
responsible positions blame the other. What we should be doing 
is to say: What should I do? What should my party do to 
contribute to this climate of peace? That's very important. 
It's going to be very important that we have a program to 
create an economy which provides jobs, which provides housing, 
which addresses these enormous imbalances that exists in South 
African society, apartheid imbalances, whether they are racial 
or gender or regional. All of that has to happen. Now I'm 
saying that in the end, here you have an African National 
Congress, which for eight years plus has fought for these ideas. 
We are at the point where we are saying that that victory for 
which so many people have sacrificed is about to be scored, and 
I do believe that a party and organization such as the ANC, 
which for more than 80 years has sacrificed people in pursuit of 
these objectives -- this is an organization that should be 
trusted. 
  [Modise] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much and now time for 
us...[crowd jeers] time for us to take the first question. Mr. 
Freek Robinson of Agenda, and the question to Mr. Pik Botha. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Pik Botha, I want to relate my question to 
the 
events of the day and not about policy matters. You have 
referred to violence as a major problem in the country today. 
Mr. Thabo Mbeki referred to the fact that we must have all the 
people of this country involved in the process and to ensure 
that there will be free and fair elections, but I want to put it 
to you that people in the right-wing and Inkatha supporters say 
that you are in an unholy alliance with the ANC, and that you 
are going to stick to an arbitrary election date, irrespective 
of the cost to lives and that you are doing so for political 
expediency, to get a few more votes. Will you therefore, in the 
climate that we have today, consider postponing the election so 
that temperatures can come down and we can have the conditions 
for free and fair elections with an inclusive political 
settlement? 
  [Botha] The decisive question is: Will it become better? 
Will the circumstances in this country be better if the 
election is postponed? That is a very, very important question. 
I doubt it. With the cycle of violence rising as it does, I 
have severe doubts that the climate will be better after 27 
April, so it would seem to me at this moment of speaking to you, 
that the sooner we get the election behind us the better, 
because perhaps a lot of the stress and strain and tension can 
be attributed to the fact that the country has not had an 
election -- and then this date was not an arbitrary date. This 
date was set long ago when all the parties of this country had 
the opportunity to make a contribution and had an opportunity to 
make suggestions as to a proper date. It is not our fault if 
parties did not make use of the opportunities that were open and 
available to them at the time, and this day was decided upon, 
and the whole world is expecting us to stick to it. The whole 
world is expecting South Africans now to come to peace with each 
other, otherwise the world will turn its back against all of us, 
and then it wouldn't matter who wins the election, or it 
wouldn't matter what will happen next year. We will be 
marginalized. The world will lose interest in us. The world 
will say, you've had your chance. You have been negotiating for 
three years. You cannot make peace with yourself. You are like 
Yugoslavia. As a matter of fact, you are a doomed country. 
[applause] 
  [Modise] And this opportunity now goes to Mr. Thabo Mbeki of 
the ANC. 
  [Mbeki] Let me say this also. I agree with Mr. Botha that 
elections.... [crowd jeers] I agree with Mr. Botha, the 
elections must go ahead as planned and as agreed, but in order 
to ensure that the elections go ahead as planned and as agreed, 
there are certain responsibilities that fall on all of us -- to 
create the climate so that those elections are free and fair. 
Now you cannot have, you cannot have a situation where the ANC 
books a stadium, legally, pays its deposit, does all of that, 
and some people come and occupy that stadium with arms the 
previous day. The result is that the ANC can't use the stadium. 
Mr. Botha's government does not say to the security forces of 
the country: You cannot allow that kind of thing to happen. Mr. 
Botha is correct. The election must go ahead but I am saying 
that the responsibility is on the part of government, to ensure 
that this climate for free political activity exists. It has to 
happen. It's their responsibility. The statement is correct, 
but the actions, the actions, the actions are undermining the 
possibility -- the actions of the South African government are 
undermining the possibility for free and fair elections. That 
has to be addressed. 
  [Modise] Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. And another 
response from Mr. Pik Botha to what Mr. Mbeki has said. 
  [Botha] The point is just that there is now a Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC]...[applause] on which we have agreed, 
and there is a subcouncil on law and order, and one on defense. 
It is not the responsibility of the government any longer 
alone. It never was the government's responsibility alone. 
[crowd jeers] The United Nations and the whole world and the 
international observers here will make it clear to you that they 
expect all parties.... President de Klerk is thrown against his 
head with a stone, President de Klerk can't address a National 
Party meeting, the National Party can't open offices in Transkei 
and what is happening about it? Nothing. There is uneven 
handedness and the TEC should attend to this matter urgently and 
seriously. Judge Kriegler should not only fly to kwaZulu. He 
should also fly to Umtata. He should also talk to the other 
leaders. There is now structures. There is a structure in this 
country to take care of this. 
  [Modise] Mr. Pik Botha, thank you very much. Another 
minute...[crowd jeers] Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] The lights here, they are already showing red. What 
I'm saying is this. If somebody comes and occupies Umlazi 
stadium illegally, with guns, the commissioner of police should 
say to the police force, if necessary to the defense force: Can 
you please go and remove those people so that the meeting that 
was permitted can take place. That's simple, straightforward. 
The TEC cannot instruct Gen. Johan van der Merwe because you 
insisted that when the TEC was set up it was not replacing the 
present government. Government must instruct Johan van der Merwe 
to say: Remove those people and that has not happened, and we 
have the crisis we have today. [crowd jeers] 
  [Venter] Just before we go to the next question, which will 
be from Leslie Mashokwe of Newsline, may I remind our 
encouragingly lively audience that the candidates have no 
flexibility in the times allotted to them, whatsoever. Bear 
that in mind with your responses. You are taking their time 
away. Leslie, it's your turn. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, the ANC speaks of jobs, peace, and 
stability. If you look at today's action, particularly the 
action of the security personnel around [ANC headquarters] Shell 
House, one wonders whether it would contribute towards creating 
a climate of job creation, peace, and stability, if we look at 
how they reacted to whatever pressures that faced them. 
  [Mbeki] Leslie, there are many outstanding problems in terms 
of the political process. It's been our view that whatever the 
problems are that any of the parties have, those problems need 
to be resolved through negotiations. The IFP walked out of the 
negotiations. We nevertheless said, never mind that, to find a 
solution, let's talk to them. The Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front, AVF] walked out of the negotiations. We said, 
nevertheless, let's sit with them and find a solution. It is 
our genuine belief that, let's find a peaceful negotiated 
settlement. The matter of the king, the king of the Zulus -- we 
have not met, up to now, the delegation of the king. Not 
because we didn't want to, but that delegation hasn't come. We 
are ready to discuss each and every single question that is an 
obstacle to a peaceful resolution of their problems facing the 
country as a starting point. You can ask anyone of these people 
that I'm talking about. You can ask [former Bophuthatswana 
president] Lucas Mangope what he wants, where he is now. We sat 
with him in five meetings, to resolve whatever issues that he 
had. Now, we wanted a peaceful resolution to these matters. We 
want a peaceful resolution to the questions that the IFP faces. 
What happened today had nothing to do with any of that. We 
would have thought, given the fact that even today there was a 
tripartite meeting -- the South African Government, IFP, and the 
king, and ourselves -- [as heard] that it was not necessary to 
march on ANC offices in Johannesburg. ANC headquarters, Shell 
House, is at least eight blocks away from the venue of the 
rally.... 
  [Venter, interrupting] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much. Mr. 
Botha, a two-minute response. [crowd jeers] 
  [Botha] Jobs will only be created if this country attracts 
sufficient capital, if new factories, mines, and job 
opportunities are created. The South African economy does not 
have in itself, healthy as it is at present -- and it has 
recovered remarkably, as we are now following the conditions of 
the International Monetary Fund -- but it's as simple as that. 
To create more jobs, you're going to need increased training. 
You are not going to get money unless....[pauses] Overseas 
investors are scared and frightened by the violence and by 
statements made, inter alia, also by senior ANC members -- not 
Mr. Mbeki, I agree, but this is what Mr. Ben Turok said: A new 
South Africa will need to defend its interests against the 
predating actions of international capital and its institutions 
like the IMF and World Bank, etc. Their intentions to the Third 
World are clear enough; to instal bourgeois democracy and a new 
world order which recolonizes, integrates, subordinates, the 
Third World in a system of so-called free market. I say this 
with all respect to my ANC friend: Stop talking like this. This 
is Marxist-communist talk. Stop talking like this. [crowd 
jeers] This is what is chasing away investment, in addition to 
the violence. We must first overcome the violence, but then we 
must get in line with the IMF, because African countries who now 
subscribe to the conditions of the IMF have shown economic 
growth; those who did not, show economic decline. [applause] 
  [Venter] Mr. Mbeki, you have a one-minute response to that. 
  [Mbeki] Mr. Botha, let's not move away from the question 
that 
was posed. The question that was posed was events today which 
might have an impact on jobs, peace, and stability. What I'm 
saying is that what happened today was not necessary. The 
reason it happened was, you have people who are not intersted in 
peace, who are not interested in the creation of the conditions 
which make that investment possible. People were supposed to be 
demonstrating halfway across the town, were never supposed to 
have been at the ANC headquartes. They came to cause trouble. 
Second, the police were warned on Sunday to say, this was going 
to happen, and no action was taken to block these people, to 
disarm them, and you had the problem that you had. We want 
peace, we want jobs. I was saying this. We've been bending over 
backwards to find resolutions.... 
  [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Botha] I spoke to.... 
  [Venter, interrupting] Sorry, Mr. Botha, we have to move to 
the next question. Forgive me. 
  [Mbeki] He's got one minute. Give him his minute. 
  [Venter] Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake. 
  [Botha] You see what has become of the SABC? [laughter] 
  [Venter] You have me there, Mr. Botha. Your minute, please. 
  [Botha] No, Mr. Mbeki is absolutely right in saying what 
happened today was unnecessary, but it's more complicated. It 
is almost impossible for the police when, in a march, a group 
splits up into other groups. You can't have police on every 
street corner. What I want to say emphatically this evening -- 
and we have said it before -- mass action in general is not 
needed. If the ANC feels that it has such an overwhelming 
majority, then why should it resort to mass action? If they 
believe they have such an overwhelming majority, help us to 
arrange the election peacefully and you can prove your 
overwhelming majority. Where there's intimidation, there are 
threats. It is this fight between Inkatha and the ANC that must 
stop. The mass action by both parties must stop. 
  [Venter] Mr. Botha, thank you. 
  [Modise] Thanks to Mr. Pik Botha there. Now the opportunity 
will go to Ferial Haffajee of the SABC Radio News to pose a 
question to Mr. Pik Botha. Ferial? 
  [Haffajee] Mr. Botha, just to move way from the events of 
today. The homelands are collapsing like dominoes. They cost 
many billions to create. Do you agree that it was a foreign 
policy failure, and did any good come from the homeland system? 
  [Botha] No, its not a foreign policy failure, it's an 
internal policy failure. The Department of Foreign Affairs 
never created the independent states. [laughter] Those which 
have collapsed, yes, I believe today that had they followed 
different policies they would have been in a better position 
because, even if they had never got independence, then still you 
would have to administer the areas, they still would have needed 
hospitals, clinics, a police force, road building, agriculture, 
they would have needed to have dams built in those regions. I 
predict here today that the cost of administration of the region 
would perhaps exceed the cost of administration of the 
independent states. Not that I prefer the independent states; 
we have long ago decided that all of them should return to the 
jurisdiction of South Africa, because of the economic 
integration and the reality of our situation. What happened in 
those two states is that the public service turned against the 
governments of the day, and although a lot of instigation and 
intimidation might have taken place, I think I must put the 
record straight, and that is, that also National Party 
supporters in Bophuthatswana were intimidated by members of the 
Mangope government, and in the case of Ciskei, I'm surprised 
that it took so long before we could make the change. [laughter] 
  [Modise] Thank you. Right now the opportunity goes to Mr. 
Mbeki to respond. 
  [Mbeki] What has happened in this particular area is an 
illustration of the wrongness and the bankruptcy of the system 
of apartheid. The bantustans, the homelands, whatever name you 
want to give them, are very typically apartheid, and what we've 
seen happen is a general rebellion -- the minister is correct. 
The civil service and other people said, We don't want this 
thing, in much the same way as the overwhelming majority of the 
population doesn't want apartheid. [jeers and applause] No, no, 
it's true. The minister and myself have spent a long time 
talking together. He has been administering these areas. 
[laughter] He has been financing them, but at least he has the 
decency to say, This thing has failed. 
  [Modise] Thanks, Mr. Mbeki, and we give another minute to 
Mr. 
Pik Botha. 
  [Botha] Yes, the big danger facing South Africa is that 
South 
Africa as a whole may fail if the policies are followed of the 
Communist Party in this country, and there are elements within 
the ANC who would wish to do exactly like that. Writing in THE 
GUARDIAN yesterday or the day before, it was stated 
categorically that what the Communist Party wants to do is to 
set up a completely centralized, totalitarian regime. That is 
the surest way to get this country into a catastrophe 
economically speaking. The country has done well economically 
over the past year, despite its isolation position. It has the 
strongest economy south of the Sahara. There are investors who 
are interested, but they wil only.... 
  [Modise] Mr. Pik Botha, thank you very much, and another 
minute...[jeers]...a final comment on this issue from Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] Minister, the Communist Party did not create the 
bantustans. [laughter] The National Party created the 
bantustans. That's a matter of fact, you don't have to dispute 
that. What the people of this country are saying is that 
they're against apartheid. It's not South Africa that will 
collapse, it's apartheid that must collapse, and our common 
responsiblity is to create a nonracial democracy. 
  [Modise] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Venter] Our next question is from Anna-Marie Mischke of 
RAPPORT. 
  [Mischke] Mr. Mbeki, during the past decade or even a bit 
longer the ANC, and before it the Mass Democratic Movement, have 
abundantly and very often, very effectively, used mass action as 
an instrument to get what it wants. We have seen examples of 
this during the past week once more, in the toppling of some of 
the homeland governments. But after 27 April, we're going to 
have, presumably, a democratically elected government, most 
probably with the ANC as a majority party in that government. 
[jeers, applause] If this culture of mass action and what we 
more and more see, political intolerance, is going to prevail 
after the election, what is the ANC's attitude going to be to 
mass action, not only from your own people but from other 
parties who obviously are following the example? 
  [Mbeki] Anna-Marie, it's very important to protect, in any 
political settlement, the rights of the people to take peaceful 
action. The ANC will say, and insist on this, that even when it 
is government, all conditions must be created, such that the 
people can take such mass action as they wish. If they are 
opposed to what an ANC government is doing, they must take that 
action. So it is a fundamental democratic right. It's a right 
of the people to go out into the streets and say, We protest, we 
demand the following... [jeers] No, no, no. No, you say AK-47? 
Let me tell you what happened. In Durban, a huge demonstration 
over the weekend, and what happened? The police put barbed 
wire, and ANC people walked up and down very peacefully. 
Nothing happened...[jeers]...and you had a demonstration in 
Johannesburg today, when the government and the police were 
warned that it was going to be violent, and people came into the 
center of Johannesburg, as demonstrators with guns. ANC people 
didn't come with guns in Durban...[jeers] Anna-Marie, what I'm 
saying is that we shall defend the right of everybody to engage 
in mass action against an ANC government. It's a fundamental 
democratic right. [jeers] 
  [Venter] Thank you very much. May I remind the audience of 
their obligation to the candidates. Mr. Botha, you have two 
minutes. 
  [Botha] I do not doubt the good intentions of Mr. Mbeki. 
What I say is, that those intentions are not translated into 
reality in practise. The fact of the matter is that we have 
warned time and again both Inkatha and the ANC that in a tense 
atmosphere you should not organize mass action, because criminal 
elements are joining this mass action, innocent people are being 
attacked, cars are being burned, human beings are being burned, 
and then it's too late to come and say, later, that this was 
intended to be a peaceful march. But let us look at the overseas 
commentators. I invite the SABC to make a summary of reports in 
all the influential newspapers all over the world, of the past 
two to three weeks. Then you will get the answer, and that 
answer is simply this one, that the ANC and Inkatha are to blame 
for the violence. Yes, you have a right to protest, but 
ordinary citizens also have a right to be protected. You cannot 
march and then burn down people's cars. You cannot march and 
then break into shops and steal goods from shop owners. And as 
I said before, if the ANC is so sure of victory -- and someone, 
I think you, implied that most probably they weren't -- we have 
not yet had the election. Let us first have the election. The 
National Party has every intention to come out as the strongest 
party, and the way the ANC now conducts itself, we will come out 
as the strongest party...[jeers] 
  [Venter] Thank you very much, Mr. Botha. Thank you very 
much. We appreciate a lively audience. I remind you that a 
courtesy would be to give the candidates the time that's still 
alloted to them. Mr. Mbeki, you have 1 minute left. 
  [Mbeki] Mr. Botha, we need to understand, the NP needs to 
wage a campaign to win elections. I understand that. But let's 
look at the actuality. You know, the actuality of this country 
is like what, for instance, the Goldstone Commission said. You 
know, there are very serious charges that have been made about 
who is behind this violence. [jeers] No, really, seriously, who 
is behind this? The Goldstone Commission does not make those 
charges lightly. I think we need to address those questions 
seriously. I concede the objective you have of battling to win 
elections. That's fine, but we must not, in the process of 
that, turn our backs on the truth. 
  [Venter] Your final minute, Mr. Botha. 
  [Botha] There is all over the world, in all responsible 
circles, today, it's accepted that apartheid is gone. That is 
why the Nobel Peace prize was awarded also to President de 
Klerk. That is why the UNESCO peace prize was awarded also to 
President de Klerk, that is why the Philadelphia Peace Medal and 
Liberty Medal was also allocated or awarded to President de 
Klerk, In other words, it is only the ANC -- I think they feel 
extremely sorry that apartheid was abandoned, because they've 
lost their platform. Certainly the Communist Party feels that 
apartheid should have continued a little longer. I have now 
reached the stage where we must really objectively analyze our 
situation. Unless we fall in line with the modern and 
successful industrialized economies of the world, it wil not be 
a pleaseant thing to govern this country, and the ANC have not 
yet taken that step. 
  [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Botha. 
  [Modise] Again, the opportunity to ask the next question is 
still with Anna-Marie Mischke of RAPPORT newspaper, and this 
time the question goes to Mr. Pik Botha. 
  [Mischke] Mr. Botha, four years ago when the ANC and the 
SACP 
were unbanned, one of the reasons that were given by your 
government was that the communist threat had disappeared, or 
diminished to such an extent that you felt free to unban them, 
because of what happened in Eastern Europe. Now, very soon, 
members of your party will probably be in the same cabinet as 
some communists. But suddenly a campaign against the Communist 
Party and against communists has become a very definite feature 
of your election campaign. What I'd like to know now: Has the 
National Party had second thoughts about the communists? 
[laughter] Or is it just very useful to take the old bogeymen 
of the total onslaught years back from under the bed, where you 
have always had the reds? What is the situation around the 
communists in the National Party? 
  [Botha] No, we have never had second thoughts about the 
South 
African Communist Party [SACP], but the moment you decide to 
legalize an organization, then you need not change your view -- 
you need not start liking them. You then put your hopes in the 
people of the country to reject it. That is the democratic way, 
and that was the basis of our decision. Our concern now is that 
we were challenged by the SACP -- here I must say, not the ANC, 
but the SACP -- to prove that more than 16 of the candidates on 
the ANC's national list are communists, and we did so; 25 of 
them are, and this is of major concern -- not suddenly -- to the 
South African Government. Professor Johnson, an Oxford 
academic, wrote three days ago in the LONDON TIMES that the SACP 
had too strong an influence on the ANC, and that is posing a 
danger for South Africa's economic growth. This is coming from a 
well known and reputed expert on southern Africa. But what is 
more, IMF economists share the same view. So this is not just 
something that the NP suddenly have drawn into the debate. This 
is there all the time, and our concern is that not even the ANC 
will be able to resist this firm grip which the SACP now has on 
the ANC... [jeers] ... and that will preclude investment. 
There's not a single country in the world today where a 
communist party is participating in an election. This is the 
point I want to start making. The ANC has the wrong ally. We 
shed apartheid. We got rid of that burden. We admitted the 
mistake that it was. I'm waiting for my ANC friend to take the 
same bold step. 
  [Modise] Mr. Botha, thank you very much. We give a 
two-minute opportunity to Mr. Thabo Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] The problem.... Can I appeal...? 
  [Modise, interrupting] Let me appeal to the members of the 
various organizations, please, give the representatives of your 
organizations the opportunity to state their cases, please. 
Thank you. 
  [Mbeki] Can I appeal to the NP? Can you listen to what I'm 
going to say? If you disagree with it when I've said it, please 
object, but please listen. You see, the problem about this 
issue is that the NP has gone back to old ways. It's gone back 
to old ways. The NP does not say: This is what we find to be 
wrong and communist in the program of the ANC -- which would be 
legitimate -- to say we believe that what you say about this or 
that or the other is communist, and therefore bad for the 
country. The NP does not say that, which you can then debate. 
The NP says: You've got secret files which show the following 
about people. I'm saying, it goes back to what it has always 
done, and what it's trying to do. The NP is, I think, very 
unfortunate. It's trying to demonize the ANC, to say to the 
people out there, its constituents, that this is a demon which 
must be destroyed. That is precisely what produced the killers 
that we have on our streets. [jeers] Brian Mitchell, who was 
responsible for Trustfeeds, said: We did what we had to do 
because we were told that it was an anti-Christ, and we had to 
destroy it. The NP, without a shred of evidence in terms of 
policy, is saying that the country is going to disaster 
because.... 
  [Modise, interrupting] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much, and 
now the next minute's opportunity is for Mr. Pik Botha. 
  [Botha] I would like to repeat Mr. Mbeki's appeal also. Give 
us a chance to put our viewpoints, and then disagree or agree. 
I do not need to rely merely on NP points of view on communism; 
it's a failed system the world over. It created misery in 
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, in Bulgaria, in Albania, in the 
15 republics of the former Soviet Union. It is a failed system. 
It has brought misery to millions of people, economic misery, 
and social misery, and misery in every sphere of life. So I need 
not defend the NP policy in this respect. We say it is 
inherently a bad policy, just as apartheid was one, and we are 
strong enough and bold enough to say: Apartheid was wrong. We 
shed it, we're thrown it off, and now we say to South Africans: 
Please, let us move forward. 
  [Modise] Mr. Pik Botha, thank you very much. Your minute is 
up. [jeers, cheers] Last opportunity, this minute to Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] Minister, you have absolutely every right to talk 
about Poland and Bulgaria and this and that and the other. What 
I'm saying is: I haven't heard one single thing said by the NP 
to say: In terms of the ANC policy as we understand it, this 
element is communist, that element is communist, the other is 
communist. Nothing. All that is happening is that the NP is 
going back to its old ways; the new NP is going back to its old 
ways, demonizing, invoking fear in people, without a single 
shred of evidence to say: This is the communist policy that the 
ANC is going to implement, because it's not there. That is not 
true. 
  [Venter] Our next question from Ferial Haffajee of SABC 
Radio. 
  [Haffajee] On to money matters, Mr. Mbeki. This country's 
debt burden is well over 114 billion rands. We pay 1 billion 
rands a month in interest alone. How are we going to pay our 
debts and create jobs, and build schools, and improve health 
care? 
  [Mbeki] You are quite correct, there are enormous challenges 
that face us as a country, because we inherit an economy that 
has been in decline for a long time. It is an economy that made 
millions of people unemployed, an economy that's made millions 
of people homeless, an economy that makes children die of 
hunger. Now, central and critical to what has to happen to this 
economy is, we've got to ensure that new investment, 
considerable investment, takes place. Part of what you've got 
to do with regard to that issue is, you've got to create the 
political circumstances, the peace and the stability. That's 
important. You've got to create the economic policies which say 
to the investors? This is a safe place to invest. You've got 
to bear in mind that South Africa is in competition with the 
rest of the world in terms of foreign investment or investment 
generally, including domestic investment. That's a matter on 
which we've got to focus -- to create the political and economic 
climate for that investment to take place. That's the first 
thing, and that is what we're battling now. You've got to 
create the policies, and that's the policies that the ANC is 
putting forward, in terms of an economic policy framework which 
makes that investment possible. And then you've got to address 
this issue of the millions of the people who are deprived, so 
that they feel comfortable with this change, it's bringing them 
something. I'm saying it's possible to do it. 
  [Venter] The time has caught you, Mr. Mbeki, I'm sorry. Mr. 
Botha has a two-minute response. 
  [Botha] The fact of the matter is that South Africa, this 
bad place, this bad place is producing 40 percent of the GDP of 
sub-Saharan Africa consisting of 42 countries with a total 
population of 500 million. The fact of the matter is that the 
economy of this country is the envy of the whole of Africa. The 
fact of the matter is that when General Obasanjo, a Nigerian 
leader who landed here for the first time, and he flew the 
helicopter over Pretoria, Witwatersrand area, when I greeted 
him, he said to me: I am suffering from shock, I am suffering 
from shock. I didn't know such a wonderful industrial area 
existed south of the Sahara. The fact of the matter is that ANC 
members who go to other parts of Africa can confirm this. They 
can confirm that this country is the hope of Africa. Africa 
wants us to succeed. Africa said we have achieved so much, and 
the fact of the matter is the removal of apartheid alone will 
not bring stability and economic growth. Only sound policies 
and being in line with the industrialized economies of the world 
today, and this the National Party can do, and only the National 
Party can do this. That is why government delegations one after 
the other say to me, unless the National Party continues to have 
a decisive role and a strong position after the election, South 
Africa will not attract any investment. That is a simple fact. 
[applause] 
  [Venter] Allow Mr. Mbeki a minute's comment, please. 
  [Mbeki] The fact of the matter is that we have in this 
country a higher infant mortality rate than Botswana has. It is 
a fact of the matter. The fact of the matter is that Zimbabwe 
has got more black engineers than we have here. That is a fact 
of the matter. The fact of the matter is that this economy. with 
all the potential that it has, has produced, I was saying, at 
least 5 million unemployed people [laughter]. I wouldn't 
consider that a success. I think it is failure. It has got 
potential. Despite what the National Party has done, despite 
what the National Party has done. It has the things that the 
minister says it does, because, in reality, this economy is much 
larger than any of these other economies. 
  [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. Mr. Botha, could you wrap 
that up? 
  [Botha] I would just like to give the facts as they exist: 
adult literacy rate for sub-Saharan Africa 45 percent, South 
Africa 76 percent; life expectancy at birth -- sub-Saharan 
African 52 years, South Africa 63 years; infant mortality 
rate--sub-Saharan Africa 107, South Africa 56. The fact is that 
we have not made 5 million unemployed. Across the world, you 
have world tides of recession, etc. The fact of the matter is 
we have 2 million citizens from our neighboring countries that 
have flocked to this country for jobs, for training, for 
education, for a better life. If we have to send back those 2 
million, we would virtually have no unemployment problem. The 
fact of the matter is the world and Africa is waiting for this 
country to produce a success story. The world opinion today is 
that the National Party and President de Klerk is essential if 
South Africa is to survive. They are essential to play a 
decisively important role in the next election and that is why 
the people, particularly the black people, must vote for 
President de Klerk. That will ensure for them a better (?life). 
[jeers] 
  [Modise] Thank you again, and right now the opportunity to 
ask the next question goes to Mr. Leslie Mashokwe of NEWSLINE, 
and the question to Mr. Botha. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Botha, you narrated the occurrence of 
violence 
in this country and you were stating categorically that the 
National Party was not involved in that. The question is: Which 
government is in place? Is it the National Party government 
whose police generals are now implicated in third force 
activities by the Goldstone Commission. Who is in charge of the 
security process in South Africa. It would appear that whilst 
you are busy wooing votes from black people you forget that they 
are important and they need to be protected, seemingly you would 
want dead bodies to vote for you. That is how your political 
foes regards your views with regards to this. 
  [Botha] I'm very glad you put this question because I think 
it is a question uppermost in the minds of many of our people, 
particularly our black brothers. The fact of the matter 
is....[laughter] No, but this is a serious matter, and if you 
are really seriously concerned, you will heed Mr. Mbeki's appeal 
and mine. The commission found and said it would like to stress 
that the persons named in this report have not been found guilty 
of the allegations made against them. Not me saying it, Judge 
Goldstone. The evidence, much of it strong remains prima facie 
until proven by a normal judicial process, but then commission 
went on to say this: The commission earnestly appeals to all 
South Africans to recognize and appreciate that as serious as 
the alleged misconduct by some members of the SAP may be, there 
are over 100,000 members of the police force, without the 
courage and honesty of Majors van Vuuren and du Plessis, 
Brigadier Schoeman and Colonel Piet Botha -- not all the Botha's 
are that bad [laughter] -- the commission would have been unable 
to discover the evidence pointing to the network of criminal 
activity. In other words, what I am saying is: there is only 
one police force. The majority are not white policemen. We are 
not going to have two police forces. And I am saying here this 
evening, I appeal, like the judge, let us not, because of a 
report implicating and not yet proving, not yet proving in the 
words of the judge, condemning the whole police force. They are 
there to protect all of us, and this is what the judge said and 
I want to emphasize that here this evening -- we have been 
demoralizing the police by doing this sort of general accusation 
and condemnation of the South African Police. [applause] 
  [Modise] Thank you, Mr. Botha, and now two minutes response 
to Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] The problem is implied in the question. The problem 
is that government has not done what it is supposed to do. The 
government today was supposed to issue an instruction that the 
police would set up roadblocks so that nobody comes in the 
Johannesburg city center carrying weapons. That was not done. 
[jeers] People occupy stadia in order to block meetings from 
taking place. The government does not say: Please go and 
remove those people so that we can have a climate of free 
political activity. It doesn't happen. Yes, indeed, yes, 
indeed, we are quite certain, very many police, people -- men 
and women -- very many members of the South African Defense 
Force are very conscious of their duties and very committed to 
ensuring that this change take place, but what happens, day in 
and day out is that the government does not discharge its 
responsibilities to protect this process of a peaceful 
transition to a democratic South Africa. It doesn't give the 
proper direction. It doesn't give the necessary instructions. 
It does not support this honest Botha in the police. [laughter] 
And that's the failure. And there's a real, real serious 
problem: The third force issue that we raised for many years 
was denied by government: No it doesn't exist. As a result of 
this government did not move when it should have moved. Then we 
would not have had this crisis. That's the problem. [applause] 
  [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki, and a minute to Mr. Botha. 
  [Botha] I am afraid I totally disagree. This is again 
typical of the ANC blaming everybody else. The common 
denominator in all violent activities in this country is the 
ANC. It is the ANC and APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]. 
It is the ANC and DP. It is the ANC and Inkatha. Always, the 
common denominator is the ANC. The fact of the matter is they 
have a responsibility, and I think this evening the minister 
declared 10 districts in Johannesburg to be under unrest areas. 
The moment he wants to do that, the ANC is against it. The 
police does need certain powers, but we must act in terms now of 
the TEC legislation. Every time the police needs additional 
powers it is denied them. Why are these powers denied? It is 
because the ANC sees some sinister motive in some of these 
additional powers. And you may well reach the stage where we 
may have to give far more powers to the police, but then it must 
be done in terms of the TEC. 
  [Venter] Mr. Botha, thank you very much. Your minute is up. 
And this time, an opportunity to Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] Part of the problem with this discussion is the 
minister is avoiding the specifics. What I am saying, having 
discussed this matter yesterday with the government about what 
was likely to happen in Johannesburg today and having agreed 
that roadblocks would be put and people searched so that they 
could come and demonstrate without weapons -- why was it not 
done? Having discussed all matters of things for government to 
say: There must be free political activity. People must not 
occupy stadia with guns. They must be stopped. Why is it not 
done? I am saying that any number of specific instances where 
there has been failure of government -- as a result of which 
people have died, and that is reality. 
  [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. Well, a final question then 
from Freek Robinson of Agenda to Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Mbeki, my first question: I have tried to 
come 
down to the underlying reasons for the violence and it is clear 
to all of us basically that this political framework in which we 
operate, including the basis for the elections and the basis of 
the government in the next two years after the election, it is 
something that is contested by other people. There are many 
fears among the smaller parties, in particular about the 
constitution and what might happen after the elections. The 
fear is that you might win the election convincingly, even with 
a two-thirds majority, and that you might scrap the interim 
constitution completely. Can you give me a clear indication 
tonight what exactly is it that you would like to change in that 
constitution, delete, or add to it? 
  [Mbeki] The first thing that I need to say, Freek, is that 
the ANC, with regard to these constitutional matters that you 
raised, the ANC is bound by two documents which were agreed in 
the multiparty negotiations. One of them is the Declaration of 
Intent that was agreed right at the beginning of this multiparty 
process. We are bound by that document. Secondly, there are 
constitutional principles which are contained in the interim 
constitution. The ANC is bound by those principles. What do 
they do? That first document and the second one, they spell out 
a united, democratic, nonracial, nonfascist South Africa, 
entrenched human rights for everybody, regular elections, a 
multiparty political system, an independent judiciary, all of 
these questions. That is what they spell out, all of these 
provisions. That is what the ANC bound to. Now, the interim 
constitution that we have is a product of the process of 
negotiations. It does not reflect, necessarily, ANC views, but 
I am saying that the ANC would be bound to those basic 
principles. It would also be bound to the notion that we need 
to take the country, not just ANC supporters and ANC members, 
that is to draft a constitution, it must be based on acceptance 
by the majority of the people in the country, so that, even if 
the ANC got a two-thirds majority it would want to proceed in a 
manner that takes national consensus. Clearly, there are many 
things in the constitution that need to be looked at. There 
have been many debates about many issues. There is an 
outstanding debate.... 
  [Venter, interrupting] Thanks, Mr. Mbeki. I am sorry, Mr. 
Botha now has a two-minute reply to it. 
  [Botha] I am aware of the fears, the concerns, particularly 
the smaller parties and of certain communities, and not 
necessarily white communities, also black communities of this 
country. They say to us openly at times: We were ANC. We know 
them. But fact of the matter is we believe it is a good 
constitution, and all constitutions the world over, it is not 
the end of constitutional development. As far as I am 
concerned, it is beginning of the new era. That is what 27 
April means and I have the firm belief that the international 
community, this new world order, with its new conditions, will 
simply not allow the future South African Government, and we are 
going to be part of that government, not because of favoritism 
but that is the agreement between us and the [laughter] -- no 
but it's a fact -- we are going to be part of it and a strong 
part of it because a vast number of black people are of the 
conviction, yes, they would like to vote for the ANC, I say this 
openly, but they also say: But then the National Party must be 
part. An overwhelming majority of black South Africans want a 
government of national unity in this country and this is 
important, but the constitution, basically, is a good 
constitution. It is a reasonable constitution. It does 
recognize a federal system and it does make it possible for all 
the provinces to retain a large measure of autonomy and to be 
federal states and to preclude the interference of the central 
government in those matters which have been allocated to the 
provinces. This is how we must start. There is no other way. 
We must now go into the elections, test our relative support 
and start the new South Africa so that we can get investments on 
condition that the National Party is still part of the 
government. 
  [Venter] Sorry, to cut you off Mr. Botha. Mr. Mbeki, you 
have a one-minute reply. 
  [Mbeki] As far as the small parties are concerned, we have 
throughout this process made sure that they were party to these 
decisions. The whole multiparty process has involved them. If 
you look at, for instance, what is now called the ANC election 
list you'll see many small parties there and part of the reason 
they are there is so that we can ensure that they are 
represented in Parliament. If they stood on their own they 
would not win, but precisely to make sure that their voice is 
heard we put them on our own list. So I am saying the ANC -- 
Mr. Pik Botha is correct, the National Party will be a minority 
party. [laughter] But we are saying that never mind that it is a 
minority party, it ought to be part of this new government 
because it is important that they make a contribution on the 
construction of this new South Africa. 
  [Venter] Thank you, Mr. Mbeki. Mr. Botha, you have one 
minute to close the issue. 
  [Botha] I sincerely believe that the best thing that can 
happen to South Africa is that there should be no majority party 
after the elections, that all of us must not only be -- if I may 
put it this way -- be forced by the constitution to form a 
government of national unity. But it must always be the choice 
of the majority of South Africans that there should not be one 
strong dominating political party, and that is why I say again: 
There is only one way to achieve that in the elections and that 
is to vote for the National Party and to ensure that this 
country will not be dominated. But I do not share those fears. 
As I said before, the new world order will not allow the future 
South African Government, in my opinion, to do as it likes. 
What is the danger is that irresponsible elements within the 
ANC might exercise too strong an influence in the ANC. 
  [Venter] Mr. Botha, thank you very much. That closes off the 
question section of this debate. Thank you. [applause] 
  [Modise] Well, obviously, very enthusiastic members of the 
political parties who are here tonight. Right now, we are 
coming to the end of the program. We are giving the 
opportunity, a three-minute opportunity to Mr. Thabo Mbeki to 
make a statement on various issues that he feels need to be 
known. 
  [Mbeki] Well, I really need to say this that, as I was 
saying 
at the beginning, the country is faced with a great opportunity 
and a great challenge. We understand the heats that gets 
developed around election campaigns, but we believe that it is 
the common responsibility of everybody, who in the country 
consider themselves a leader of any significant section of the 
population of our country, to approach these matters in a 
responsible manner. We do indeed believe that we need to 
develop a national consensus around a number of basic issues. 
One of those issues has to be that it is a right of every South 
African to vote, to elect a government of their choice. 
Therefore, it cannot be permitted that there is somebody out 
there who considers themselves part of a leader of some people 
who wants to block that process. I think the country needs to 
unite to say nobody should be blocked from exercising that 
democratic right to decide what government they want. That is 
an important thing. The question of violence. The question of 
violence is important. We need all of us, I am saying again, to 
act together to resolve this matter so that the ANC has the 
responsibility to say to its own members: This is not allowed. 
Any other party that is involved needs to do the same thing, 
but also the government. 
  The government needs to approach this matter to resolve the 
issue and not tie it to party political advantage, to say it is 
always the ANC and the IFP that are fighting if they meet and so 
on. Why are the police allowed to watch as people are killing 
themselves, simply because this matter is defined as party 
political. There is an intervention by government that has to 
be made. I am saying that is a common national responsibility, 
wherever the violence comes from, whether from the ANC people or 
whoever, that we must all of us act very firmly and decisively 
to address this issue. I think, finally, I do not know what my 
time is like, I think it is fundamentally wrong, fundamentally 
wrong to say of an organization, like the ANC, that it's a 
demon. It is the same ANC that has stood for nonracialism, for 
democracy, and all of these things which must bring the majority 
of the people of this country into the settlement, to turn round 
and say they are a demon, because what you are doing, you are 
creating a situation where we will not be able to resolve the 
problems of this country. If you take that attitude toward the 
ANC, you will then get that demon. I think it is 
irresponsible... 
  [Venter, interrupting] Mr. Mbeki, thank you very much. Mr. 
Botha a similar three minutes. Thank you. 
  [Botha] It is quite clear to me that South Africans have a 
stark choice to make on 27 April, a stark choice between those 
parties, and particularly the ANC that finds itself in alliance 
with the wrong party, an ANC that cannot discipline its own 
followers -- cannot control them during mass actions, an ANC who 
allows individuals to attack the industrialized nations of the 
world, to attack the industrialized economies of the world, and 
to say derogatory things about the IMF and the World Bank 
because in the new world order that is coming the ANC would have 
no choice -- and Mr. Mbeki quite rightly, earlier on, about 
specifics -- the whole issue of the mineral rights that must be 
restored to the state of the people -- I wonder whether the ANC 
realizes what that has done to the economy of this country and 
to investment of this country. I want to warn the ANC: A 
government cannot run a mine. Stay out of it, but in the end I 
am encouraged by the news that there might soon be a meeting 
between President de Klerk, Mr. Mandela, the king of the Zulus, 
and Dr. Buthelezi, and that I see that in the spirit in which 
Mr. Mbeki offered -- with that I agree. We are all South 
Africans. We only have one South Africa. Let us come to peace 
with ourselves and let us pray that these four leaders will find 
a way to reduce the tension that has been created in this 
country and let us pray for that and hope and hold thumbs that 
that meeting will be successful. We all need it. We have only 
one country and we are going to share it and history will 
condemn all of us if we do not share this responsibly. There, I 
agree with my friend and colleague, Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Venter] Thanks to Mr. Pik Botha there. Before we leave the 
debate, we are going to ask each of the candidates for a quick 
impression of the discussions we have just had, starting with 
Mr. Mbeki. 
  [Mbeki] Well, Lester I think we should say congratulations 
to 
the SABC for affording this kind of opportunity. I don't think 
there is sufficient time given for real debate. I hope that it 
would be possible to organize so that we do indeed have real 
debate, so that I talk to my friend Pik Botha there, so, instead 
of promoting the National Party, actually debates issues. 
  [Venter] Thank you very much, Mr. Mbeki. Can we come back to 
Mr. Botha, please? 
  [Botha] I am glad this could take place in that we could 
openly canvass our views, but perhaps, I don't know, perhaps we 
should do it in a more relaxed atmosphere. I do not want to 
reduce the enthusiasm of the audience, but I think we tend to 
lose some of the value of arguments on both sides if the two 
speakers cannot really be heard. It is not a complaint. And 
then lastly, those who are supporters of the National Party 
please drive carefully home. Those who are not, who am I to 
tell you how to drive. 
  [Venter] Thank you very much for participating, Mr. Mbeki 
and 
Mr. Botha. 
  [Modise] And before we say good night the leaders of the two 
parties, the National Party and the African National Congress, 
Mr. F.W. De Klerk and Mr. Nelson Mandela will meet in a debate 
similar to this one on 14 April. 
  [Venter] Don't miss that. Good night.

<F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela to the ANC Business </F>
Summit on 30 March in Johannesburg, read on his behalf at the 
summit by ANC economic adviser Trevor Manuel; issued by the 
African National Congress on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairperson, distinguished participants 
  This summit departs from tradition in more ways than one. 
  Firstly, in the hustle-bustle of a hard-fought election 
campaign, it stands out as a forum for calm, rational debate 
about the challenges business that the ANC [African National 
Congress] face. 
  Secondly, we are confident that this summit will serve as a 
ray of hope, a spur to major economic players to act with 
decision to resolve the complex problems that beset our country. 
  Since 1990, we have often said that South Africa has entered 
a new terrain of debate. In Dakar, Davos, Paris, and on 
countless occasions within the country, we sought occasions to 
understand one another. 
  This summit is no different. Today, we are continuing along 
the same road in search of meaningful partnership; raising our 
discourse from one premised on ideology to one that derives from 
a common identification of national needs and goals. 
  We thank you all for finding the time in your busy schedules 
to be here with us. We particularly want to congratulate FINANCE 
WEEK for its keen sense of timing and organisational capacity. 
  During the course of the day, the experts will share with 
you 
the evolving detailed policy positions of the ANC. Mine is the 
relatively easy task of talking in beneral terms. 
  Important historical moments always have their surprises. I 
will try to fit the bill by sharing with you some information 
the ANC has not made public. And I trust you will come to my 
rescue when I am castigated by constitutional structures of the 
ANC. 
  I deliberately refer to "evolving" details of policy. 
Because 
we would not have been the movement we are, if we did not temper 
our approaches to take account of the views of those we consult. 
At the end of this summit, we will summon all the ANC experts 
present here to find out how they and the ANC have benefited 
from this encounter. 
  For any organisation to govern it should appreciate the 
needs, aspirations and fears of the nation as a whole. For, to 
govern means translating varying viewpoints into a harmonious 
national effort. We do not pretend that we are capable of 
ironing out all differences. The contradictions will always be 
there. But we are duty-bound to act in a manner that 
demonstrates sensitivity to the needs of society as a whole. 
  The ANC is confident that South Africa will make it. We have 
been part of a historic paradigm shift among forces which were 
at each others throats -- in politics and in economics -- to 
understand that national consensus is possible. 
  Over the past year or so, such an emergent consensus has 
found expression in many areas: within the national economic 
forum, the housing forum, the TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council] sub-council on finance, and in the joint missions 
abroad. There, we have acted as South Africans first and 
foremost, pursuing a common national agenda. And there is no 
doubt that, if we get our act together, we will achieve a great 
deal for the nation as a whole. 
  This is of course conditional on one central factor. That 
is, 
our ability to resolve our political problems in a manner that 
our people and the international community can say: there is a 
legitimate arrangement to support. 
  No matter how hard we try to convince potential 
international 
investors and financiers about the discrepancies between TV 
screen images and reality; no matter how loudly we proclaim our 
commitment to find lasting solutions; as long as we are not seen 
to be acting together on these issues, their doubts will persist. 
  Every rational person appreciates that our country is on the 
verge of fundamental change, the most important expression of 
which will be the elections on 26, 27 and 28 April. 
  The country has successfully negotiated rules of the 
transition which will culminate in the drafting of a new 
democratic constitution. These rules, encapsulated in the 
interim constitution and electoral laws, might have their 
defects. But central to these rules are basic principles of 
democracy and a constitutionally-guaranteed mechanism for 
working together in a government of national unity. 
  Much has been made of the pet subject of federalism, turning 
words upon themselves until they lose all meaning. Most 
unfortunately the telegraphic nature of news reports on the 
debate the fundamental issue that what we have now is an interim 
arrangement is all too often missed. 
  We have already made numerous adjustments to provincial 
powers as a means of accommodating the white extreme right. But, 
to the extent that the new constitution will be drafted in a 
context of elected structures, it will be much easier to examine 
these questions in a more rational manner. 
  Let me pause to share a secret. In my discussions with our 
regions and the provincial candidate premiers, I have found a 
persistent leaning towards ensuring that the powers of the 
provinces are amplified -- not as a tool for blocking national 
programmes, but to facilitate national development closer to 
where the people are. 
  What we are saying is that it is highly irrational to make a 
life-and-death issue of the interim constitution. This interim 
constitution makes room for the political approaches of the 
widest spectrum of parties, including the possibility of a 
volkstaat [homeland]. Of course, what it does not do is to 
guarantee any political leader or party a status independent of 
the will of the electorate. 
  It would be wrong to compel anyone to take part in elections 
if they choose not to do so. But our argument is that even those 
who choose to abstain should not seek to undermine this national 
consensus by means of violence. 
  There is a serious danger that by being silent on these 
problems, we might be seen by the perpetrators of violence, by 
our own people and by the outside world as succumbing to the 
ancient dictum that might is right. Especially for the private 
sector, it is not helpful to the national economic consensus we 
seek, that a perception takes root among the majority, that 
while business appears keen to challenge the ANC on issues such 
as the double ballot; it fails to speak out when major obstacles 
to the transition are created. 
  The past fortnight has witnessed some of the most dramatic 
developments in our political history. There was the uprising in 
Bophuthatswana, the events in The ciskei and the revelations in 
the Goldstone Commission report. 
  I do not personally have a penchant for uprisings or 
exposes. 
I had personally hoped that the Bophuthatswana government would 
co-operate with the transitional process and find a respectable 
role for itself. The objective of free political activity and 
the whole transition in this area could have been attained 
without unrest or bloodshed. 
  Except for local structures which kept in touch with events, 
there was no direct ANC participation in the fall of President 
Mangope. That is a matter of record. Until the eleventh hour we 
had hoped that negotiations and the phenomenal offers we were 
making to the Bophuthatswana administration would resolve the 
problems. However, our life-line was rejected and the Bop 
administration became victim of its own intransigence. 
  I would want to commend leader of the Freedom Front General 
Constand Viljoen for his maturity. We profoundly disagree with 
him on the issue of a volkstaat and we shall continue to differ 
with him in coming negotiations. But he has had the foresight to 
seek a peaceful settlement. 
  To the ANC, what is at issue is not whether a particular 
administrator stays in office for another few days or not. The 
question is ensuring free and fair elections. 
  We remain very apprehensive about the unfolding events in 
kwaZulu-Natal. As everywhere else, we would prefer the 
administration to accept the people's right to express their 
political views either way. An attempt to postpone the elections 
or drown them in blood cannot be countenanced. Allowing such an 
eventuality would be sending a terribly wrong signal about 
ourselves as a leadership and as a country: that might is right. 
  The ANC will continue seeking the least painful solutions 
to the crisis. We are aware of the genuine fears of the Zulu 
king and we shall continue seeking a meeting with him to clarify 
what we believe is a misunderstanding about his future status 
and role. 
  We do appreciate that the kwaZulu administration is 
different. Now this is no secret. The most recent report of the 
Goldstone Commission helps to piece together what has been more 
or less an enigma to many. If we recall, the motivation of the 
security police who engineered Inkatha funding in 1990, was that 
the apartheid state could not afford co-operation between 
Inkatha and the ANC during the transition. The revelations about 
co-operation between generals at SAP [South African Police] 
headquarters and this party confirms society's worst fears. This 
is what makes the kwaZulu administration different, not the 
anthropological analyses that seek to take us to pre-historic 
times. 
  Decisive steps need to be taken without delay. The South 
African Government should exercise its jurisdiction to end the 
carnage and ensure normal political activity. 
  We should build a provincial consensus in Natal, a consensus 
that includes business, political parties, religious leaders and 
others, for a right of choice. If the forces of peace act 
together, we might yet be saved from what would be a 
mutually-debilitating conflict. 
  The ANC is convinced that such initiatives are in the 
interest of the country in general and our economy in 
particular. As politicians, we accept our responsibility to 
create the conditions in which the economy can thrive. 
  The thrust of our programme is to forge the emergent 
consensus into a dynamo for a national effort to build a better 
life for all. 
  There are many problems that we have collectively and 
variously identified that need resolution in the medium and 
long-term. Often, we set each other up for acrimonious exchanges 
by the ideological manner in which we identify these problems. 
  Our country suffers from: 

  -  an unacceptable under-utilisation of its productive 
capacity; 
  -  an underdeveloped human resource base; 
  -  a structural dependence on the mining industry; 
  -  an underdeveloped manufacturing sector which is in no 
position 
to compete internationally; 
  -  a skewed agricultural sector that relies in the main on a few 
enterprises while the majority are condemned to chronic debt and 
landlessness; 
  -  a sharp urban-rural divide which is bound to explode in even 
worse urbanisation crises; 
  -  an industrial and commercial structure that is top-heavy and 
views small and medium-size enterprise with derision. 

    We could go on and on. The sum-total of it all is the 
disparity and attendant socio-political problems. We need to 
kick-start the economy in a joint national effort. This should 
be within a clear framework with national goals. It should be 
people-centred. 
  This is the premise of the ANC's reconstruction and 
development programme: our public works programme, education, 
health, housing and other policies. 
  In the past we have often engaged in what is essentially an 
academic debate: what comes first, growth or delivery? But it is 
now part of the national consensus that these processes must 
proceed together and should in fact complement each other. 
  It is also part of our common understanding that these 
problems cannot be resolved in a shotgun manner: Let everyone 
fly in their own direction hoping they will reach some target. 
  We believe that the state should set the framework allowing 
for private, autonomous activity. It has an important role to 
create the environment within which business can thrive. It has 
an important role to ensure that there is full national 
participation in the economy, including the creation of 
opportunities for small business. It should direct public 
finance towards more investment spending rather than consumption. 
  The ANC's plan is conscious of the need for macro-economic 
balances. We emphasise more efficient utilisation of resources 
and thinning down the bureaucracy of apartheid duplications, 
closing the gaps for corruption, and ensuring an efficient tax 
collection system. In government, effective and open performance 
auditing will be the priority. 
  And to share with you the real secret that even top leaders 
of the ANC do not know: minimal as its contribution would be, we 
intend to ensure that political leaders themselves set an 
example. Going through the salaries and perks current 
politicians pocket, leaves a sour taste in the mouth. This 
applies to the presidency, ministers and parliamentarians. And I 
intend to ask my colleagues in the ANC executive and 
parliamentary lists to consider reducing these salaries and 
ensuring that everyone pays tax. The time has come that politics 
should be seen as a service to the people rather than as a means 
to self-enrichment. 
  The ANC's approach to tax is that we should examine the 
system as a whole, foster the rule of law and recognition of 
rights and responsibilities. All this has to be conducted within 
acceptable macro-economic balances. The aim should be to ensure 
increased revenue through growth and efficiency rather than 
increasing the tax burden. In particular we do not seek to 
increase central government funding above its current level of 
25 percent. Government borrowing should not rise above current 
levels. 
  Our proposal for a reconstruction fund should be implemented 
in a manner that does not stifle individual business initiative. 
Emphasis will be on elements of the reconstruction programme 
that can generate funds. 
  What about a reconstruction levy, prescribed assets and 
foreign exchange controls? The ANC does not want to be 
prescriptive. Our preference is that, if national consensus on 
economic goals and a partnership between business and government 
take root, then goverdment laws and policing should become 
redundant. 
  As the ANC, we are committed to creating a macro-environment 
for economic growth and to assist business to be competitive 
internationally. We will pursue sound monetary policies, 
guarantee the independence of the reserve bank and improve South 
Africa's credit rating. Our programme sets out broad parameters 
which we believe should stimulate the thriving of enterprise and 
initiative. 
  The fundamental question is, how the private sector proposes 
to play its role in this national effort? We would strongly 
argue that partnership between business and an ANC government 
should find expression in a commitment from the private sector 
to the country's future. This means investing in the country and 
developing its human resources. It means working together in 
various sectorial forums to help build the economy and add to 
national wealth. 
  We believe that such a partnership is possible. Especially 
if 
we both shed the ideological baggage that has so undermined 
national debate, and pursue things as they are, not as 
interpreted in some manuals. 
  This should be the message that together we send out to 
society. On both sides of the apartheid divide, people wish to 
see practical efforts to improve the situation for all South 
Africans. 
  That is why we are concerned about some of the distortions 
we 
are coming across in the election campaign, aimed at 
exaggerating ANC support. 
  This is a particularly clever and dangerous campaign. The 
aim 
is to create a hung Parliament and a government unable to 
implement reconstruction programmes. 
  The ANC does not pursue a two-thirds majority as a matter of 
principle. We are committed to ensuring that policies are worked 
out in consultation with all role players which genuinely seek a 
solution to the country's problems. 
  It makes sound economic and business sense to say that South 
Africa needs a decisive government and that governmental 
paralysis will naturally result in an unguided drift and 
continued economic hardships. We believe that it is in the 
interest of business that the reconstruction and development 
programme, tempered by our consultations, should be implemented. 
  I hope that this encounter will bear the kind of results 
that 
will move us from debate to practical action. There is a common 
challenge. Let us work together to find a common solution.

  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has begun 
an investigation into reports of people under the age of 18 
years being in possession of temporary voter cards. The IEC 
said the irregularities had allegedly occurred in Natal. Two 
Scotland Yard officers are assisting in the investigation. The 
IEC said steps had been taken, in cooperation with the 
Department of Home Affairs, to tighten procedures for obtaining 
temporary voter cards. It said that possible strategies were 
being investigated to filter out underage holders of temporary 
voter cards before the elections.

  [Text] Pretoria March 29 SAPA--The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] has proposed the cities and towns where the nine 
provincial legislatures could convene within seven days of the 
elections, SABC radio news reported on Tuesday. It said in 
Pretoria, however, these centres would not necessarily be the 
provincial capitals. 
  The cities are: Cape Town for the Western Cape; Johannesburg 
for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region; 
Bloemfontein for the [Orange] Free State; Mmabatho for the North 
West Region; Kimberley for the Northern Cape; Pietermaritzburg 
for kwaZulu/Natal; and Nelspruit for the Eastern Transvaal. 
  It suggested both King William's Town and Bisho for the 
Eastern Cape and both Pietersburg and Lebowakgomo for the 
Northern Transvaal.

  [Text] Port St Johns March 29 SAPA -- Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] warlord Gwebentlazi Mposelwa was killed in a 
shoot-out with Transkei security forces at a roadblock on 
Tuesday [29 March]. This followed a siege on his home on Monday 
night after earlier running gun battles between Azanian People's 
Liberation Army [APLA] cadres, members of Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation, MK; ANC military wing] and Transkei 
security forces in Port St Johns. 
  Mr Mposelwa's nephew described how he and his three small 
daughters huddled in his uncle's home as bullets flew above them 
in a night of terror. "I was thinking of dying," said a shaken 
Mr Mongi Hongana. "It's lucky for me I am still alive." 
  Speaking at the Port St Johns police station, where he and 
his family took refuge early on Tuesday, Mr Hongana said he 
worked on one of his uncle's smallholdings near the town. 
  Mr Mposelwa, accompanied by several armed bodyguards, 
fetched 
him from the farm about 3.30pm on Monday. As they drove through 
Port St Johns men in a bakkie [pickup truck] opened fire on them 
and Mr Mposelwa's bodyguards shot back. 
  Mr Hongana, who jumped off the bakkie in terror, made his 
way 
through the bush to Mr Mposelwa's house where he was living with 
his wife Patricia and three daughters. After dusk the house came 
under heavy fire. 
  He, his wife and their daughters Orienda, 10, Patience, 6, 
and Unathi, 5, huddled in the dark in a corridor at the back of 
the house which was not directly exposed to gunfire through 
windows. 
  Mr Mposelwa and his bodyguards were also there, he said. 
  "The children tried to cry, but we said no, no, because we 
were hiding." 
  Early on Tuesday he ran to neighbours who arranged for the 
police to fetch him and his family. He did not know where his 
uncle went, he said. Nor did he know who was responsible for 
the shooting. He had arrived from East London only three months 
ago and had devoted his attention to the farm. "Because I'm new 
here I don't know what is happening," he said. 
  "When I first came here my uncle told me someone wants to 
kill him." No one in the house returned fire on monday night, 
he said. 
  The front wall of the house, which is only a few hundred 
metres from the police station and overlooks the sea, was 
riddled with bullet marks and plaster was gouged out from bursts 
of automatic fire. Some bullets had passed through two closed 
doors and lodged in the wall of the passage where the Honganas, 
Mr Mposelwa and his bodyguards sheltered. 
  In the lounge a charred radiogram stood against one wall, 
apparently set on fire by a stray bullet. Above it, a melted 
plastic clock had stopped at 8.43, presumably the time of the 
attack. 
  A Transkei Defence Force team arrived from Umtata to inspect 
the scene on Tuesday afternoon. 
  Mr Hongana said he was expecting to be escorted to Umtata by 
police.

  [Text] Port Shepstone March 30 SAPA -- Four suspects were 
arrested for illegal possession of several firearms and 
ammunition in Port Shepstone on the Natal lower South Coast on 
Tuesday [29 March], Durban police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo 
said. The suspects are believed to be African National Congress 
[ANC] officials. 
  A ANC peace desk official confirmed the arrests, adding he 
had "no clue" as to why they were detained. 
  Maj Naidoo said a vehicle was stopped in Port Shepstone on 
Tuesday morning and police recovered an AK-47 rifle and 
magazine, 20 AK-47 rounds, and a 9mm Luger pistol with rounds. 
  "The local offices of a political party", were subsequently 
searched and a 9mm CZ pistol and a police camoflauge cap were 
found, said Maj Naidoo. The men are due in court soon.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  ANC To Escalate Mass Action in kwaZulu/Natal--Johannesburg 
THE CITIZEN in English on 28 March in its page-6 editorial notes 
that according to pollsters "there is no doubt that the ANC 
[African National Congress] will win hands down -- and might 
even get a two-thirds majority. Sadly, the ANC has become 
arrogant and intolerant." ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa 
has announced that the ANC would "escalate its rolling mass 
action" in kwaZulu/Natal "until Chief Buthelezi guarantees free 
political activity in the region. The danger that the low-key 
civil war there could flare into a full-scale conflict does not 
worry the ANC -- it is not going to give up its plan to topple 
Chief Buthelezi and it will proceed whatever the consequences." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  State May Have To Consider State of Emergency -- Referring 
to 
the violence that erupted in the wake of the Zulu rally in 
Johannesburg on 28 March, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 29 
March in a page-14 editorial says: "Any parties, or leaders 
playing a political role -- as Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is 
playing in this period -- have to ask themselves two questions 
among others. First, will our planned action have the 
effect of being provocative, and placing lives at risk? It 
is no defence to say this was not the intention. Second, have 
we ensured that none of our supporters is armed? Again, it is 
not good enough to say one didn't know. If political leaders -- 
from whatever party -- are not prepared to honour these basic 
responsibilities, then they invite inevitable illiberal censure: 
the temporary prohibition of some or all high-risk 
demonstrations." "A reversion to state of emergency politics 
would inevitably open the door to political abuse, and it would 
tragically mar the birth of the new South Africa. But if 
politicians are so cynical as to actively explore the Bosnia 
option, then it is a step that might have to be considered." 
  Only SADF Can Impose Free Political Activity in Natal -- A 
second editorial on the same page believes that if all else 
fails "one thing would stand between South Africa and a descent 
into utter chaos -- the presence of an effective and apolitical 
Defence Force." The South African Defense Force (SADF) has been 
called on recently to restore order in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, 
and Lebowa. "The SADF could yet face its stiffest challenge in 
kwaZulu. As matters there deteriorate, pressure is building up 
for a deployment of troops. Both ANC secretary-general Cyril 
Ramaphosa and the organisation's kwaZulu/Natal premiership 
candidate, Jacob Zuma, have called on the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] to send troops into the region. It is no 
longer a far-fetched prospect, and nor is it one to relish. But 
if free political activity has to be imposed, only the SADF can 
do it." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Attempts To Overthrow Kwazulu To Have `Horrendous Costs' -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 March in a page-16 
editorial also refers to the rally "called by traditional Zulu 
leaders in support of their king." 
  "The Johannesburg chaos, it should be noted, was not 
exceptional compared with the violence that has afflicted black 
residential communities on the East and West Rand, and in many 
parts of Natal, with the loss of thousands of lives. Strife of 
this magnitude rarely comes to the city centres, so for those 
not used to life in the townships it was particularly alarming." 
The events in Johannesburg "are evidence that ANC attempts to 
overthrow kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and 
Buthelezi's apparent resistance to a political settlement which 
may cost him his office, will have horrendous costs, possibly 
more than the economy can afford. The election must go ahead. 
But the chances of it being universally free and fair are 
declining. And it is almost too late to halt the spiral." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Editorial Blames IFP for Johannesburg Rally Violence -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 29 March in a page-8 
editorial places the blame for the deaths linked to the protest 
march in Johannesburg "squarely on the leadership of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP]. Nobody is fooled by people changing names 
at the drop of a hat -- one minute they are IFP leaders and the 
next they are `Zulus' protesting rather strenuously that they 
are not speaking for the IFP." SOWETAN also believes the 
violence "could only have been premeditated. First, there has 
been war talk from the leadership of the IFP; then there was the 
turning of a blind eye on the weapons that were displayed during 
the march; and finally there was the glaring absence of marshals 
to control the huge crowds."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Advance for Democracy -- "The decision by Transkei's 
military 
regime to allow the National Party [NP] to open offices in the 
homeland is belated but welcome. There ought never to have been 
any question about the NP Operating in Transkei. That is the 
democratic right of all parties," notes an editorial in 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 30 March on page 18. "The 
ANC [African National Congress] and its allies have been enraged 
by Buthelezi's resistance to allowing his opponents to organise 
or even to help faciliate the right to vote in the April 
election," but they have remained "conspicuously silent about 
their `favored militay dictators' Holomisa" and Ramushwana of 
Venda. "A similiar reticence marks their attitude to corruption 
in Lebowa and kwaNdebele." "The use of South African troops to 
help srabilise" the government in Qwaqwa "is another welcome 
development. It shows that the SADF [South African Defense 
Force] is capable pf pre-emptive stabilising action, and will 
not be called upon to mop up once violence has already run its 
course." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  A Fateful Choice -- "Monday's events in Johannesburg in 
which 
more than 30 Zulu royalists were killed, must fall into the same 
category as the shootings at Boipatong and Bisho and the 
assassination of Chris Hani, as far as their impact on the 
transition process is concerned," an editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 30 March on page 14 states. "Each of 
these events had the potential to derail the process," but each 
also produced a "countervailing force -- prompting renewed and 
more determined efforts." "The same two possible scenarios lie 
ahead now -- intensified conflict or a new successful phase of 
negotiations." "It is becoming increasingly apparent that an 
election in Natal can be no more than a stopgap measure, if 
that. A comprehensive political settelemnt before the end of 
April is impossible." "Even though Inkatha does not have a hope 
of winning a `struggle to the end,' it doubtless has the ability 
-- like Angola's UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] or Mozambique's Renamo [Mozambique 
National Resistance] -- to hamper or even render impossible 
South Africa's attempts to democratise and develop." The ANC, 
NP and others "might be on the point of deciding that the only 
way to secure a relatively free election is to neutralise 
Inkatha now through mass action, emergency rule and, ultimately, 
brute force. No one dare take that fateful step before every 
other action is tried." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Postmortems -- The "finger pointing" and postmortems 
concerning the "spectacular" events in Johannesburg have already 
begun, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 
30 March on page 10. "Two important things can result from the 
event. The first is that the security situation before the 
elections has got to be tightened up and made more effective. 
The second is the calling of the summit of major political 
leaders." "We are afraid the time for political point-scoring is 
fast becoming real" and we are "sickened by the manner in which 
ordinary people are used in a battle for power that has very 
little to do with the future of South Africa."

  [Text] In Lusaka, the mediators and the observers are still 
trying to reach an agreement on various issues that separate 
negotiators from the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The ad hoc commission has 
been meeting behind closed door. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel 
reports from Lusaka. 
  Good evening! The Ad Hoc Commission for the Conclusion of 
the 
Electoral Process continues to work for an agreement. What the 
negotiators are doing is to define all issues connected with the 
second round of presidential elections. So far, there is total 
secrecy and nothing is known about the discussions, although 
observers feel this issue will be easy to resolve. 
  This afternoon, while the commission was carrying out its 
work, the remaining members of delegations from the government 
and UNITA decided to meet alone, without third parties, 
somewhere here in Lusaka. The objective of the meeting is not 
known, but this is not new. Even in Abidjan, during situations 
of impasse, the delegations met at secret venues in search of an 
agreement. Taking this into account, it is very probable that 
today's meeting was connected with the country's governance. 
Although the parties are presently working on the conclusion of 
the electoral process, the truth is that there is an impasse 
with regard to the country's governance.

<F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan] </F>
  [Text] Durban Mar 29 SAPA -- Monday's [28 March] killings 
in Johannesburg marked the start of a struggle to the end 
between the African National Congress [ANC] and the Zulu nation 
unless the April election date was postponed, Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Tuesday. "The 
whole question of the sovereignty of the kingdom of kwaZulu must 
finally be resolved before there can be an election," he said in 
a hard-hitting statement from Ulundi. 
  Mr Buthelezi directly blamed the ANC for Monday's violence, 
describing the shooting of Zulu marchers outside the ANC's head 
office as the "Shell House massacre". April 27 -- the initial 
election date -- should be declared a "national Zulu day of 
mourning", to remember those killed on Monday, said Mr 
Buthelezi. He added that there were reports of Zulus massing at 
Johannesburg hostels while others were travelling to the Reef to 
support their kin. "If we do not take action as elected 
representatives of the Zulu people and as grassroots leaders, 
there is no saying what the people will do in taking the law 
into their own hands." 
  "The only way to be sure of avoiding the degeneration of the 
South African situation into one of ungovernability and violence 
beyond control is to suspend the election date, and to seek to 
establish a proper basis for a free and democratic election. 
Very unfortunately what has thus far taken place in kwaZulu and 
in the Transvaal are only precursers of what will yet come," 
said the Inkatha Freedom Party president. 
  Mr Buthelezi's comment that there could be no effective 
negotiations on Zulu sovereignty within the framework of the 
present election timetable apparently ruled out his 
participation in this week's planned summit with State President 
F W de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela. King Goodwill 
Zwelithini earlier on Tuesday also pulled out of the summit, 
citing Monday's violence as the main reason. 
  Mr Buthelezi charged Monday's killings made it clear the ANC 
remained committed to its "pre-prepared plans to destroy the 
kwaZulu government and the kingdom. We can now see that the ANC 
is very serious in the attempts it is making to destroy the 
kwaZulu government and to take all Zulus into an ANC-dictated 
future by the force of violence that they are capable of." He 
alleged there could be no doubt the ANC was fully aware of the 
consequences of what "they planned and executed". 
  "They know that the Zulu resistance to what they are 
attempting to do constitutionally and politically will now lead 
to a flash flood of demands for retribution running through Zulu 
society. The pretext that most of the Zulus support the ANC in 
kwaZulu is now shown to be ridiculous. One does not do to your 
supporters what the ANC did to people who were doing no more 
than marching to express their solidarity with their king's call 
for the recognition of the sovereignty of the Zulu people. The 
Shell House massacre shows that we have now entered a final 
struggle to the finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation, 
unless there is the extension of the voting date deadline." 
  Mr Buthelezi alleged "the same ANC which perpetrated the 
Zulu 
massacre" controlled the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. 
The world was now witness to what the TEC's intentions were. 
  He charged ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa's call for 
the disbanding of the kwaZulu government was a call which "the 
TEC will back with ANC political violence and state violence". 
  The IFP had called for an immediate Goldstone Commission 
investigation into Monday's bloodletting Mr Buthelezi said, but 
claimed the commission was perceived to be partial to the ANC. 
"If it is to correct the negative image it has, now is the time 
to do so." But, Mr Buthelezi added, the police had to act 
against the ANC and arrest those behind Monday's violence. "It 
is now time that the state president came to his political 
senses. In agreeing to the election in the present climate of 
violence, and ignoring the fact that many millions of ordinary 
people are opposed to the election, he has agreed to a course of 
events, and to an election, in which it is not the will of the 
people that will determine the results, but the Machiavellian 
planning of the ANC and the capacity they have to unleash 
violence that will decide the election." 
  Mr Buthelezi said international mediation on the 
constitutional deadlock should now take place in the wider 
context of the election being staged in an atmosphere charged 
with violence. Had the IFP's bottom line amendments to the 
interim constitution been met, Monday's events and "other events 
yet to come" would not have taken place, Mr Buthelezi claimed.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- A planned police raid 
on the African National Congress [ANC] headquarters at Shell 
House in Johannesburg on Tuesday [29 March] morning was 
cancelled by the government, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
Transvaal director Themba Khoza claimed. In a statement, Mr 
Khoza said the reason given to police officers who were to 
conduct the raid was that a search of Shell House could have 
damaging repercussions because it would harm "the political 
relationship between the government and the ANC". 
  However, police were told raids on hostels were to go ahead, 
Mr Khoza said. 
  "The Transvaal IFP leadership wish to express their shock 
that the community service expected from the police force is 
clearly dependent on the political relationship of the 
government and the ANC." 
  Witwatersrand police spokesman Lt Jan Combrink said he had 
no 
comment on Mr Khoza's claim. 
  Mr Khoza added: "Today's revelation provides damning and 
irrefutable proof of the level and extent of National Party 
government/ANC/South African Communist Party [SACP] collusion. 
"It provides final vindication of the widely-held belief that 
State President F W de Klerk is a `lame duck' president who 
takes his instructions from the ANC/SACP alliance."

  [Excerpt] Security in Burundi: The Interior Minister 
Leonard Nyangoma, currently in Brussels, has sounded the alarm. 
He has asked the international community to send a 5,000-man 
buffer force to his country to put an end to inter-ethnic 
clashes. Leonard Nyangoma was interviewed by Anne-Marie 
Mouradian: 
  [Begin Nyangoma recording] The mission of this force would 
be 
to guarantee the security of institutions and the population. 
It could also contribute to the reorganization of the national 
army, because our army is no longer capable of guaranteeing the 
security of institutions and the population today. I do not 
think the OAU can undertake such an operation on its own. The 
West has come to the aid of Uganda, Somalia, and Sarajevo, why 
shouldn't it do the same for Burundi? [end recording] [passage

  [Text] Bujumbura, March 30 (AFP) -- Leaders of Burundi 
distanced themselves Wednesday [30 March] from Interior Minister 
Leonard Nyangoma, who appealed for an international buffer force 
to help end ethnic violence. 
  In an official statement, the government and the offices of 
the president and prime minister said they were "shocked" by 
Nyangoma's declarations, made Tuesday during a trip to the 
former colonial power Belgium. 
  The Burundi authorities were "informing national and 
international opinion that this proposal involves only (the 
minister) and in no way reflects the government's point of 
view," the statement said. 
  Nyangoma, speaking at a press conference in Brussels, asked 
for a 5,000-strong force to end the fighting that has claimed 
tens of thousands of lives. 
  "Western countries intervened in Somalia, Rwanda and 
Sarajevo, let them do the same for us," he said. 
  Burundi appealed for an international buffer force in 
November 1993. 
  An estimated 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi in 
clashes between the majority Hutu tribe and the minority Tutsis, 
which control the army, and another 700,000 have fled the 
country since October's failed army coup in which Burundi's 
first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed. 
  Last week at least 400 people were killed in Bujumbura in 
clashes between the army and civilians. 
  Nyangoma, from the ruling Burundi Democratic Front (FRODEBU) 
of President Cyprien Ntaryamira, accused the army of disarming 
only the majority Hutus and of ignoring orders from the 
Hutu-dominated government. 
  He also criticised the UN envoy for Burundi, Ahmedou Ould 
Abdallah, saying he sided openly with the army. 
  In Wednesday's statement, the government said it had "faith 
in the declarations of loyalty repeated several times by the 
Burundi armed forces, but remains worried by cases of fighting 
and indiscipline on the part of certain elements in the army and 
police." 
  Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, member of the opposition 
Tutsi-dominated Unity for National Progress party (UPRONA), told 
AFP his government had asked the Organisation of African Unity 
to send an "observer mission" but Nyangoma "has no mandate to 
speak on the subject."

  [Summary From Poor Reception] "President Felix 
Ange-Patasse this morning signed a treaty on the harmonization 
of business law in Africa." Senegal was represented by "Justice 
Minister Jacques Baudin, who is Senegalese President Abdou 
Diouf's special envoy. The ceremony took place at the 
Renaissance Palace in the presence of Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Mandaba, government officials, and the head of state's adviser. 
The signing of this treaty took place a few hours after the 
head of state received the Senegalese minister. On this 
occasion, President Felix Ange-Patasse made a statement in which 
he touched on the importance of true African integration." 
  [Begin Patasse recording] "Mr. Minister and special envoy 
from my brother, President Abdou Diouf, we receive you here 
today joyfully to sign this treaty on the harmonization of 
business law in Africa. We are now signing this treaty, because 
the Central African Republic was absent at the CFA franc zone 
talks held on the sidelines of the francophone summit in 
Mauritius. During our visit. During our visit to Dakar, 
President Abdou Diouf asked me if he could send the minister of 
justice" to sign this treaty, which is one of the elements which 
can promote cooperation among African countries. "We have 
signed this treaty because we believe in the real integration of 
Africa." There are clauses that must disappear because 
businessmen cannot settle in this or that country because their 
respective laws are not the same or because these laws portray 
nationalistic feelings. "African countries are faced with 
difficulties because they do not have complementary 
legislation." The moment has come for Africans to unite. 
Europe is united. The United States is united. Asia is 
united. But Africa is always late. Instead of giving priority 
to consultations and dialogue for a real takeoff, we are groping 
around. [end recording]

  [Text] Libreville, 26 Mar (AFP) -- On 26 March, official 
sources disclosed that Mrs. Pascaline Mferri Bongo, President 
Omar Bongo's daughter and former Gabonese foreign minister, was 
appointed permanent undersecretary to the Presidency in charge 
of francophone affairs by presidential decree on 25 March. 
  Mrs. Mferri Bongo joined the government in June 1991, when 
she took over the post held by Ali Bongo, another one of 
President Omar Bongo's children. 
  In the cabinet formed by Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba on 
25 
March, former Mines Minister Jean Ping became the new foreign 
minister. However, the title of his post is simply "minister of 
foreign affairs and cooperation," while that of Mrs. Mferri 
Bongo used to be "minister of foreign affairs, cooperation, and 
francophone affairs."

  [Text] Kinshasa, 31 Mar [date as received] (AFP)--The High 
Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] this 
evening adopted a completely new "constitutional act" for 
governing Zaire's democratic transition towards the Third 
Republic. 
  This particular act defines relations between the government 
and the Presidency of the Republic and also entrusts the HCR-PT 
with the task of overseeing the government's activities. It 
fixes the duration of the transition at 15 months, during which 
time a constitutional referendum, as well as presidential and 
legislative elections, must be organized. The Parliament 
earlier on had adopted Article 76 of this act, over which the 
presidential group and the radical opposition had been divided 
for the past seven months. 
  The Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, USOR, did not 
succeed in having Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi recognized as the legal 
prime minister, because he was elected by the Sovereign National 
Conference, CNS. The conditions for the appointment of a prime 
minister do not make any reference to the CNS, but simply say 
that he must be appointed by the opposition "after consultation 
with the political class." 
  Several members of the USOR delegation left the HCR/PT in 
protest, and three of them were expelled from the room for 
disorderly behavior. Since voting was carried out by a raising 
of hands, it was not possible know which members of the various 
parties forming the USOR voted for the adoption of the text, 
which was contested by the hardliners of the radical opposition.

  [Text] Supporters of President Yoweri Museveni secured an 
early strong showing in Uganda's first true experiment with 
democracy. With more than 20 percent of ballots counted from 
Monday's [28 March] votes for a new assembly, government 
ministers had good backing and Museveni supporters fared 
particularly well in south and southwest. President Museveni 
did not stand for any of the 214 seats in a new Constituent 
Assembly. 
  The commissioner of elections, Mr. Stephen Akabwai, said 
voting was continuing yesterday in Iganga and Kabarole 
Districts, the only ones which failed to complete polling on 
Monday out of 39 across the country. He said there were no 
major problems in the other areas and voting went on safely, 
adding that he expected results for more than half of the 
country to be compiled by yesterday evening and a complete list 
by today. 
  Nominators said President Museveni's supporters did 
unexpectedly well in the east, traditionally a stronghold of the 
opposition.

  [Text] There is no progress at the peace talks in Lusaka, 
Zambia. Here in Luanda today, Joao Lourenco, National Assembly 
deputy and information secretary for the Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], once again said the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is not acting 
in good faith. 
  On the possible breakdown of the peace talks in Lusaka, the 
MPLA information secretary said that, if that happens, the 
government will not take the blame. He spoke of the many 
violations carried out by UNITA. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] The government will never be the 
one to blame for a possible breakdown. We cannot say the same 
about UNITA, whose history has been characterized by a series of 
treacheries and violations of the agreements it makes. I would 
like to recall that it was UNITA that violated the (?Madrid) 
Accord. It was UNITA that seriously violated the Bicesse 
Accords by resuming war. It was UNITA that violated the Namibe 
meeting, 48 hours thereafter, by capturing Uige. UNITA was to 
blame for the failure of the meetings in Addis Ababa and 
Abidjan. Today again, it is this same UNITA that is to blame 
for the impasse being created at the Lusaka peace talks. [end 
recording] 
  The government has no intention to give ministries or 
provinces to UNITA in their entirety. The provinces or 
ministries offered to UNITA will not entirely be led by them. 
The MPLA information explains: 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] What the government intends to 
offer is only the post of governor in certain provinces, only 
the post of governor. When we speak of Uige, Lunda Sul, and 
Cuando Cubango, only the governor will belong to UNITA. It does 
not mean that the government will hand the entire province to 
UNITA. The same is the case with the ministerial posts at the 
level of the central government. When we say that we shall 
offer UNITA the Ministry of Culture, for example, it does not 
mean that the entire ministry will be led by UNITA. It means 
that only the minister will belong to UNITA. This being the 
case, this UNITA minister will not, for example, be able to 
appoint as deputy minister an individual who also belongs to 
UNITA. This must be very clear. People think the government is 
offering UNITA complete regions -- the whole of Uige, Lunda Sul, 
and Cuando Cubango Provinces. That is not true. [end recording]

  [Text] National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] and Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party experts are meeting at the Mulungushi Conference Center in 
Lusaka for the second consecutive day today to discuss issues 
relating to the second round of Angola's presidential elections. 
Yesterday, the sides met on their own. Today's meeting is being 
mediated by the United Nations. 
  UNITA has already submitted a document to Alioune Blondin 
Beye calling for the replacement of the National Electoral 
Council [CNE] which conducted the September 1992 elections. A 
UNITA diplomatic source said this issue is not negotiable. 
UNITA has also asked for a more substantial and [words 
indistinct] role for the United Nations and a larger UNITA 
participation in the new CNE. Once this issue is dealt with, the 
negotiations will tackle national reconciliation, the future 
status of the president of UNITA -- the largest opposition party 
-- and the reciprocal return of property owned by the warring 
sides.

  [Text] Dr. Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating team, 
said in Lusaka yesterday that the talks were continuing at the 
right pace, contrary to what has been reported. Dr. Valentim 
once again reiterated UNITA's willingness to reach a peace 
agreement with the Luanda government. The proof that the 
negotiations are continuing is that the two sides are discussing 
holding the second round of presidential elections. 
  [Begin Valentim recording] I would like to assure the 
Angolan 
and international communities that the talks are continuing. 
They are not on the verge of collapse. There is no impasse. 
We are dealing with an extremely delicate issue relating to the 
final point of the national reconciliation agenda. This has 
forced us to make an in-depth assessment of the situation, like 
a submarine underwater, without much publicity. So, an in-depth 
work is under way. We are dealing with the second round of 
presidential elections. The issue was raised at a plenary 
session in which the two sides met face to face. It was a very 
positive meeting. The talks are continuing with the mediator. 
Today we had a very fruitful session with the mediator, lasting 
for hours. There is hope. A great deal of patience is required 
to hold a very frank debate. That is what we are doing right 
now, not undiplomatically, but in the interest of Angola. [end

  [Text] on 28 March, UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] armed forces repelled yet another 
attempt by Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party troops to occupy Amboiva, a UNITA-controlled area 
southeast of Vila Nova do Seles. The commune was defended 
during clashes that went on throughout the night. The enemy 
suffered heavy human and material losses. Our correspondent in 
the area reports: 
  War materiel captured by UNITA includes one RPG-7, one 60-mm 
mortar, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and hundreds of 
shells. The enemy, which abandoned 21 People's Armed Forces for 
the Liberation of Angola soldiers killed, fled in disarray.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] continues with its offensive actions, stepping up 
its shelling of the city of Malange. A military source said 
UNITA yesterday used heavy artillery to shell the Malange 
regional airport. The previous day, UNITA infiltrated a number 
of units into the Catemba Ward, killing five civilians and 
destroying a house. Two hours later, UNITA shelled the outlaying 
areas of Malange, killing seven civilians and wounding 23 others. 
  Meanwhile, more UNITA troops are deserting their ranks. The 
Northern Front reported the surrender of 46 UNITA soldiers 
during the first quarter of 1994. Francisco Manuel, a UNITA 
young soldier who surrendered in Ambriz District a few days ago, 
said people desert mainly because of famine, uncertainty about 
the future, intimidation, and harassment.

  [Text] From 28 to 29 March, the Luanda government's air 
force attacked the (?Luembe), Mona Quimbundo, and Cacolo, and 
(?Muriege) regions of Lunda Sul Province, killing 47 civilians, 
including 27 children. This action reflects the warmongering, 
bloodthirsty, and unpopular nature of the Futungoland Creoles 
who have opted for a military solution to the conflict, despite 
the ongoing Lusaka negotiations. 
  The command of the patriotic and revolutionary Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola in the northeastern region wishes 
to inform the Angolan and international communities that it will 
not tolerate the MPLA-PT's [Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola-Labor Party] armed provocations and will not be 
responsible for the consequences. UNITA is ready to negotiate, 
but will never give in to the MPLA-PT, a totalitarian, Marxist, 
and undemocratic party.

  [Text] Russian-made aircraft were recently impounded by the 
Namibian authorities for carrying lethal and nonlethal equipment 
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] from South Africa. In Luanda today, the Russian Embassy 
denied the involvement of private Russian citizens in the 
alleged assistance to UNITA. In an exclusive interview with 
Radio Nacional de Angola, (Anatoliy Korunov), minister counselor 
at the Russian Embassy in Angola, said such involvement is 
absurd, but admitted the possibility of Russian aircraft leased 
by certain South African companies having been used for other 
goals. 
  [(Korunov)] We have heard that two Antonovs have been 
impounded in Namibia. One was an An-26 with a Russian crew, 
seized on 5 March. Yet, it has been confirmed that the aircraft 
was not carrying anything for UNITA. Moreover, no complaint has 
been made to us. The second aircraft had a foreign crew. 
Obviously, we know nothing about it. Unfortunately, we lack 
information to take action against such violations. 
  [Correspondent] Are you saying that Russian aircraft 
can be leased for a variety of purposes? 
  [(Korunov)] I think so. 
  [Correspondent] Even if it may compromise Russia's 
integrity? 
  [(Korunov)] Undoubtedly, that can happen. 
  The Russian diplomat said if it is confirmed that Russian 
aircraft are being used to supply UNITA in southern Angola, his 
government will take stern action against the culprits because 
they would be violating international and Russian law. 
  [(Korunov)] As far as we know, no Russian aircraft has 
carried (?weapons) for UNITA because that would be in violation 
of international and Russian laws. We will take stern action if 
we have concrete evidence. 
  The Russian diplomat reiterated that Moscow adheres 
scrupulously to sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council on 
UNITA. 
  [(Korunov)] There is a UN Security Council resolution 
on sanctions against UNITA. The Russian Government has approved 
special legislation on the violation of sanctions. It makes it 
compulsory for every Russian to adhere to the sanctions.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, president of the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo], wants a national unity government 
for the country after the elections. Dhlakama says the idea 
does not mean the October elections will not be held, stressing 
that Renamo wants the polls to take place as scheduled. Afonso 
Dhlakama explains his idea: 
  [Dhlakama] In the first phase of a democratic system in 
Mozambique, I do not believe that it should be Renamo, Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front] or any other party to rule the 
country alone. Other parties ought to be made to feel at 
ease. 
  Meanwhile, Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, one of the 
government representatives at the Supervision and Control 
Commission, has reacted to Dhlakama's suggestion. 
  [Hunguana] I do not know what Mr. Dhlakama means when 
he says each party should establish such a principle, in 
addition to the principles enshrined in the Constitution and in 
the General Peace Accord. Does he want to add any other 
principle to the Constitution and the Peace Accord? He would 
better clarify his position. 
  A number of opposition parties favor the establishment of a 
multiparty forum that would define the principles of a national 
unity government with a view to establishing them in the 
Constitution. The Renamo leader said that is not what matters 
right now. 
  [Dhlakama] I do not think it is very important to have 
an agreement before elections are held. In fact it could be 
construed as if we were not ready for elections. It would mean 
that we would be discussing (?the number of votes) from the 
onset. It would be a very complicated issue because one could 
say: I will win and will require so many ministers from this 
and that party. 
  Asked to give the government's view on a multiparty forum, 
Hunguana said: 
  [Hunguana] Well, I think they are putting the cart 
before the horse. We need free and fair elections to establish 
democracy in this country. We need to have elections that would 
lead to the creation of a forum where the country's future is 
debated and defined. By proposing the establishment of such a 
forum before elections are held, I think they are putting the 
cart before the horse. Do they want to decide the future of the 
country for the electorate? That has very little if anything to 
do with democracy. 
  Teodato Hunguana noted that if Frelimo wins the elections, 
it 
would look into the possibility of establishing a national unity 
government. He said Frelimo will search for every possible 
solution to ensure peace, stability, democracy, and justice. He 
questioned, however, whether the other parties would be able to 
form a national unity government if they win the elections.

President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Velayati, who arrived 
here Tuesday after a stopover in Chad, also held talks with 
Sylla and Guinean Minister of Natural Resources Toumani Dakoum 
Sako. He also attended a large gathering of Guinean Muslims at 
the Jame' Mosque in Conakry where he called for expansion of 
bilateral ties in all grounds. 
  Waving the flags of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
carrying 
pictures of the father of the Islamic revolution, the late Imam 
Khomeyni, and the present leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
'Ali Khamene'i, Guinean Muslims in Conakry warmly welcomed the 
Iranian delegation. 
  Velayati is to visit Burkina Faso on the second leg of his 
six-nation tour of African states which will also take him to 
Zimbabwe, Uganda, Kenya and Namibia.

  [Text] The ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy 
in Liberia] High Command says it is willing and ready to accept 
the deployment of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] in Tubmanburg and other 
areas as part of the disarmament process provided this will be 
done simultaneously in other parts of the country. 
  The ULIMO field commander, General Mohamed Dumbuya, 
addressing a news conference on Monday [28 March] in Tubmanburg, 
said ULIMO is fully committed to the ongoing peace process and 
said they want the deployment of ECOMOG troops to be done 
simultaneously so that no one side will be put at a disadvantage. 
  The LIBERIAN NEWS AGENCY [LINA] correspondent who traveled 
to 
Tubmanburg quoted Gen. Dumbuya as saying that ULIMO will do 
nothing to jeopardize the current peace process and regretted 
the current infighting which is causing more hardships for the 
residents. Gen. Dumbuya said Bomi, Lower Lofa, and Grand Cape 
Mount Counties are now calm and he appealed to humanitarian 
organizations to resume relief operations in those areas. 
  The LINA correspondent said residents of Tubmanburg are 
yearning for deployment of ECOMOG troops in the city, 
considering the hardship being experienced in that area. The 
correspondent says Tubmanburg is hard hit by acute shortage of 
food, drugs, and other medical supplies as a result of the 
recent fighting.

  [Text] The Nigerian Army says it has uncovered the real 
objective behind the recently concluded Franco-Beninese joint 
military exercise. A statement from the director of Army public 
relations says the level of participation and the manner in 
which the weeklong exercise was conducted showed that it was a 
preparation by France to eventually intervene on the side of 
Cameroon should the Bakassi dispute escalate. 
  The statement said about 544 officers including four 
colonels, two lieutenant colonels, and three majors left France 
with a lot of sophisticated armament and weapon systems for the 
exercise, and that some of the weapons were left in Benin 
Republic at the end, parts of which could be diverted to 
Cameroon for possible use against Nigeria. The Army says that 
military observers from neighboring countries including Nigeria, 
who were invited to witness the exercise, were not given any 
chance to see the arms and equipment used but were encouraged in 
tourism and ceremonial matters. 
  The statement points out what it called the clandestine and 
questionable role of France in the Nigeria-Cameroon problem as 
against Nigeria's genuine efforts toward a peaceful resolution 
of the conflict.

  [Text] Lome, 30 Mar (AFP) -- The Togolese Supreme Court has 
invalidated the election of one of the opposition deputies who 
won his seat in the February legislative elections, it was 
learned today. Furthermore, it has given itself up to 1 April 
to decide on the appeals for cancellation filed against seven 
other deputies from the opposition coalition formed by the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for 
Democracy [UTD]. 
  The CAR with 36 deputies and UTD with seven have won the 
absolute majority of the 81 seats of the National Assembly. 
Under the Constitution, this situation forces the head of 
state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, to appoint the future prime 
minister from within this majority. The election of Bemba 
Bahissa, a UTD member who won in the second constituency in Oti, 
470 km northwestern Lome, was invalidated, because "his 
alternate did not meet the conditions concerning residence in 
Togo as provided for by the electoral laws," the source added. 
Bahissa defeated the CAR candidate in the constituency during 
the second round of the elections. Under the electoral laws, a 
new election is to be held within one month following the 
Court's decision. 
  The discussions for the appointment of the prime minister 
have been going on since 15 March between President Eyadema and 
the two opposition leaders, namely Yaovi Agboyibor of CAR and 
UTD of Edem Kodjo. The two leaders agreed to propose the 
candidacy of Agboyibor, but yesterday, Gen. Eyadema announced 
that he would prefer to choose among many personalities, 
claiming that the prime minister should not be "appointed by the 
parliamentary majority," but by himself "from within" it.

  [Text] Elections will be held again in Oti constituency, 
the first constituency. The constitutional chamber of the 
Supreme Court of Togo, which met on 25 March, invalidated the 
election on 6 February of Bemba Bahissa, the candidate of the 
Togolese Union for Democracy. The reason given by the Supreme 
Court is that his alternate, Tiamoko Seydou, did not meet the 
conditions concerning residence in Togo as envisaged by the 
electoral code. The protest was filed by (Assabou Gyabite), 
candidate of the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. According 
to the electoral code, a new election must be held within one 
month at the latest. In the same judgement, the Supreme Court 
rejected other demands for annulment -- a total of 20 -- which 
were made by the RPT, the Union for Labor and Justice, the Union 
for Renewal and Development Party, and the Togolese Democratic 
Party following the first round of the legislative elections. 
  The Supreme Court will also have to deliberate the RPT's 
contesting of the results of the second round of the legislative 
elections in seven constituencies. The probable deadline for 
the verdict is 1 April.

  [Text] Singapore, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong left here today for Beijing on a two-day 
working visit to China. 
  During his stay in Beijing, the prime minister and the 
Chinese Premier Li Peng are to attend and witness the signing of 
the Suzhou software transfer agreement. 
  The agreement will be signed by Singapore Senior Minister 
Lee 
Kuan Yew, who arrived in Beijing on Friday [25 February], and 
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing. 
  The Suzhou project is believed to be the largest cooperation 
project so far between the two governments. 
  According to the agreement between the two countries, 
Singapore will invest a total of 20 billion U.S. dollars in the 
next 10-15 years to develop an industrial town covering 70 
square kilometers in Suzhou, and transfer Singapore's economic 
development and management experiences to Suzhou, a medium-sized 
city near Shanghai. 
  Lee Kuan Yew said here on Tuesday to XINHUA that the reason 
why Singapore chose Suzhou to be the venue of the joint 
government project is because Suzhou is located in the Chang 
Jiang delta and close to Shanghai, the dragon's head of the 
Chang Jiang valley, one of the fastest developing areas in China. 
  Lee said the prospects of the Suzhou project are "good," 
adding that though a well planned township in Suzhou would 
proceed at a slower pace than Shenzhen, "the long-term results 
will be better." 
  According to a press statement from the Prime Minister's 
Office, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew will meet Chinese leaders 
during their stay in Beijing. 
  During the prime minister's absence, Deputy Prime Minister 
Lee Hsieng Loong will be the acting prime minister, the 
statement said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- China and Singapore 
signed an agreement here today on the joint development of 
Suzhou industrial park. 
  The accord was signed by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and 
Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng and Singapore Prime Minister Goh 
Chok 
Tong, who arrived here this afternoon for a working visit, 
attended the signing ceremony. 
  Under the agreement, both sides support Suzhou municipality 
and the Singapore consortium to form a joint venture to develop 
an industrial park (township) in Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu 
Province. 
  The area for the first-phase development is eight square 
kilometers. The project is designed to develop a modern 
industrial park of considerable size, with modern industries as 
the main structure, and new and high-tech as the leading 
sectors, complemented by service industries and public welfare 
services. 
  After the ceremony, Li Peng and his wife met with Prime 
Minister Goh, Senior Minister Lee and his wife. 
  The decision by the two governments to develop the Suzhou 
industrial park constitutes a major event in Sino-Singapore 
ties, Li Peng told the guests. 
  This has provided a new pattern for the economic cooperation 
between the two countries, Li Peng noted, adding that it is of 
great significance in deepening the bilateral cooperative ties 
of friendship. 
  Calling Goh and Lee old friends of the Chinese people, Li 
Peng voiced appreciation of their efforts in promoting the 
development of these bilateral ties of friendship. 
  In the past two years, Li Peng said, the relations between 
China and Singapore have been developing smoothly and the two 
countries have conducted fruitful cooperation. 
  The conclusion of the agreement in a relatively short period 
of time demonstrates the sincerity of both sides, Li Peng said, 
adding that there will be much to be done after the agreement 
was signed. 
  The Chinese premier referred to the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou 
area as a place propitious for giving birth to great men, with 
favorable investment environment and labor of good quality. 
  He voiced the conviction that with the support of the two 
governments, the industrial park would achieve fruitful results. 
  Briefing the guests on China's economy, Li Peng said that 
since last year, the country has received an unprecedented 
amount of foreign investment, with an increasing part going to 
infrastructure and some expanded into the service industries. 
  China is opening its market even wider to the outside, Li 
Peng said, adding that it welcomes cooperation of every kind 
with entrepreneurs from Singapore and other countries. 
  Goh said that he was pleased to attend the ceremony here and 
meet Premier Li Peng. 
  The signing of the agreement reflects the common aspirations 
of the two sides and marks the new development of the bilateral 
economic cooperation, Goh said. 
  Singapore hopes the park will yield concrete fruits soon 
after its operation and that it is willing to make joint efforts 
to this end with the Chinese side, Goh said. 
  Also in the afternoon, the two sides signed an agreement on 
the adoption of Singapore's economic and public administration 
experience in the development of the industrial park. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore's Senior 
Minister Lee attended the signing ceremony. 
  In the evening, a consolidated commercial agreement for the 
industrial park was signed. Jiangsu Governor Chen Huanyou and 
Senior Minister Lee were present at the occasion.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 26 (XINHUA) -- The development of 
China will exert great influence on that of Asia and the world 
at large, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore senior minister said here 
today. 
  He told local journalists that he was confident of the 
future 
of China's long-term development. 
  Lee also expressed optimism on the prospect of 
Sino-Singapore 
ties, saying that great potential exists in bilateral 
cooperation since the economy of the two countries is 
mutually-complementary. 
  He said that since Singapore is short of land, and the labor 
costs are very high, it needs to export its capital, technology 
and management expertise. 
  Thus, Lee added, to develop friendly cooperation with 
foreign 
countries, including China, is part of Singapore's overall 
strategy. 
  Lee and his party arrived here on Thursday [24 February]. 
  Yesterday, Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin, gave Lee a brief 
introduction to the development of this largest industrial city 
in north China. 
  Lee also visited Tianjin's technology development zone and 
Tianjian port.

  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese top 
legislator Qiao Shi said here today the signing of the agreement 
on the joint development of Suzhou Industrial Park marks the 
further enhancement of economic cooperation between China and 
Singapore. 
  It is also of great significance to the expansion of the 
Sino-Singaporean ties, he said, adding that "China is ready to 
cooperate with Singapore and make the project a success." 
  Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese 
National People's Congress (NPC), made these remarks during a 
meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew here this morning. 
  China and Singapore have enjoyed long-term traditional 
friendship and are linked with deep-rooted cultural origins, 
Qiao said. This provides favorable conditions for the two 
countries to increase their cooperation. 
  In recent years, the bilateral ties of friendship in every 
field have gained smooth development, with trade increasing 
steadily and mutual investments expanding. 
  Recalling his trip to Singapore last July, Qiao said, "the 
visit was short, but we learned a lot." 
  The delegation was impressed by Singapore's successful 
experience in rapidly developing its economy with capital and 
technology imported from the West, while retaining its own 
oriental cultural features, Qiao said. 
  During today's meeting, Qiao briefed the guests on China's 
economic development and economic legislation. 
  Prime Minister Goh told Qiao that he came here to 
participate 
in the signing of the agreement on the joint development of 
Suzhou Industrial Park and was very pleased to meet Qiao again. 
  Though Singapore is to jointly develop with China the Suzhou 
Industrial Park, its investment is not limited to Suzhou alone, 
Goh said. 
  Citing its fruitful economic cooperation with China's 
Shandong Province, Goh said Singapore would also like to have 
active cooperation with other parts of China. He also expressed 
his appreciation of China's rapid economic growth. 
  Earlier, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with Goh. 
  Referring to it as a major event in Sino-Singaporean 
relations, Li said that the agreement on the joint development 
of Suzhou Industrial Park bears significance even to China's 
cooperation with other countries. 
  The park is open to the world and welcomes investors from 
other countries to join in the project, Li noted. 
  With the support from the governments and leaders of the two 
countries, Singapore is confident in the project's success, Goh 
said. 
  Goh is scheduled to leave here for home this afternoon.

  [Text] Hanoi, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- Do Muoi, general secretary 
of the Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV], SRV President Le Duc 
Anh, SRV Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, and CPV Central Committee 
adviser Pham Van Dong met separately with the visiting Chen 
Yuan, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, and his party 
on 21 and 22 February. 
  During the meeting, Do Muoi stressed that it is very 
necessary for Vietnam and China to expand and strengthen their 
cooperation in all fields of endeavor. 
  Do Muoi said: Science and technology have enjoyed rapid 
development in China in recent years. China's machinery 
equipment is very suitable for Vietnam. At present, economic 
construction is the central task of various work in Vietnam. 
Vietnam and China should seize the opportunity and should 
successfully conduct trade and economic cooperation as quickly 
as possible. It is beneficial for both countries. 
  Do Muoi also spoke highly of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as of 
the successes achieved by China in economic reform. 
  During the meeting, Le Duc Anh stated that developing 
friendly Vietnamese-Chinese relations is in keeping with the 
historical trend and is a necessity as a result of the 
development of the situation. He expressed the hope that banks 
of the two countries will strengthen cooperation, and he 
expressed his support for the two countries' further developing 
trade and economic relations. 
  During the meeting, Chen Yuan said: China and Vietnam have 
tremendous potential for trade and economic cooperation. 
Chinese and Vietnamese banks exchanged views during the

unanimously agreed to strengthen cooperation between themselves. 
  The People's Bank of China delegation led by Chen Yuan

  [Text] During their bilateral talks, the Republic of China 
and the United States held extensive discussions concerning 
profits generated by the government's tobacco and liquor 
monopoly. Although the U.S. side was concerned about the 
transparency of our country's formula for calculating profits 
generated by the monopoly, as well as a restructuring of the 
monopoly system, it did not demand specific readjustments. The 
two sides will continue discussions in future rounds of talks. 
  Vice Economic Minister Hsu Ko-sheng indicated: The U.S. side 
believes that the lack of transparency regarding our country's 
formula for calculating profits generated by the monopoly has 
resulted in unfair competition for U.S. manufacturers. We 
stressed, however, that the calculation of profits generated by 
the monopoly is not opaque because it is subject to supervision. 
Also, our side revealed that the plan for readjusting the 
monopoly system would be finalized by the end of June 1995. In 
principle, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau's 
management rights will revert to the central government, and the 
collection of profits generated by the monopoly also will come 
under the taxation system. 
  Also, we will introduce adjustments in accordance with 
GATT-specified principles. Vice Minister Hsu said: 
  [Begin Hsu recording] Our future restructuring means that we 
will no longer adopt the so-called monopoly profit calculating 
method but rather will bring the collection of profits generated 
by the monopoly under the taxation system. This means we will 
collect import and excise taxes and take other measures as 
necessary. Under our future reversion to the taxation system, 
we will definitely comply with GATT's so-called principle 
governing the transparency of national income. [end recording]

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA) -- Taipei's top negotiator 
to the U.S.-Taiwan tariff reduction talks Saturday denied 
reports that the ROC [Republic of China] would sign an agreement 
on government procurement one year after Taiwan is admitted to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu said the reports, which 
appeared on the front-page of local newspapers Saturday, 
misrepresented his statement following the end of discussions 
Friday. 
  He said the ROC delegation had agreed only to negotiate with 
the U.S. on the issue one year after Taiwan is given GATT 
membership. The 14-member American delegation is headed by 
Dorothy Dwoskin, an assistant U.S. trade representative. 
  Taiwan applied to GATT in 1990 under the name of "Customs 
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," and was granted 
observer status in September 1992. The present round of talks 
mark the beginning of a series of consultations with GATT 
members. 
  Few results were reported during the second day of talks 
although the U.S. described the consultations as "productive." 
  Friday's consultations centered on the General Agreement on 
Trade in Services (GATS) and on the Tokyo round agreement, which 
the U.S. side stressed in a news release "must be part of 
Taiwan's GATT obligations." 
  Since Taiwan did not participate in the Uruguay Round, the 
U.S. side spent considerable time briefing the ROC delegation on 
GATS, which the U.S. negotiators claimed will require Taiwan to 
liberalize its service sector, including banking, securities, 
audio-visual, telecommunications and professional services. 
  "This service liberalization, which will be confirmed in 
Taiwan's schedule of services commitments, will make Taiwan more 
internationally competitive and more attractive to foreign 
investors," the U.S. statement said. 
  According to Sheu, the U.S. is scheduled to provide Taiwan 
with a specific and detailed services request after April. 
  Meanwhile, Lin Yi-fu, deputy director-general of the Board 
of 
Foreign Trade and also a member of the ROC delegation, said 
another round of talks will be needed as the two sides were 
still divided on tariff issues during the talks on Saturday 
morning. The present round will end Saturday. 
  A Ministry of Finance official, who requested anonymity, 
said 
Taiwan may lower tariffs on 94 percent of the 2,786 items 
presented by the U.S. but only 14 percent of the cuts would meet 
the U.S. recommendations. 
  The U.S. has insisted that Taiwan's tariffs should not 
exceed 
20 percent on agricultural imports and 10 percent on industrial 
products.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] will sign a special exchange agreement with the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) either before or after it 
is admitted to the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body, a 
ranking official said Saturday. 
  Peng Huai-nan, general manager of the Foreign Exchange 
Department of the Central Bank of China, made the statement 
after meeting with American delegates who were here for tariff 
reduction talks with Taiwan trade officials under the GATT 
framework. 
  Peng said Taiwan is prepared to sign the GATT special 
exchange agreement, which is a necessity for GATT membership if 
a contracting party is not a member of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). Taiwan is not an IMF member. 
  Under the special exchange agreement, a contracting party is 
required to avoid payment restrictions on current account trade 
and discriminative currency practices, to provide currency 
exchange information, to allow exchange of a national currency 
held in foreign countries and to hold consultations with other 
contracting parties on existing international financial accords. 
  During his talks with the U.S. officials, Peng expressed the 
ROC's willingness to abide by all GATT and IMF currency exchange 
regulations. 
  Peng also asked the U.S. to allow Taiwan to adopt temporary 
foreign exchange controls under certain special conditions. "The 
U.S. negotiators have agreed to our request," Peng said. 
  Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 and is expected to be 
admitted to the body by the end of this year. 
  The 14-member American delegation, headed by Dorothy 
Dwoskin, 
an assistant U.S. trade representative, is scheduled to end 
three days of talks with Taiwan negotiators on tariff 
reductions, market opening and other GATT-related issues later 
this evening.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) -- Delegates from Taiwan and 
the United States Monday began three days of negotiations on the 
protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in Taipei. 
  Discussions are expected to focus on inspection of Taiwan's 
software exports and proposed revisions to the trademark and 
patent law, according to Lin Yi-fu, head of the Taipei 
negotiating team and deputy director-general of the Board of 
Foreign Trade. 
  Lin said that Taipei will explain to the U.S. side the 
measures it has been taking and the results of its efforts on 
IPR protection. 
  Taiwan has invested a lot of money and manpower in 
implementing a software export inspection system at the request 
of the U.S., he said, but the inspection operation has 
inconvenienced Taiwan software exporters and benefited only a 
few American software makers. 
  Lin said he will call for the termination of the inspection 
operation during the talks. 
  Meanwhile, Economics Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang noted that 
the U.S. is expected to review its special 301 priority watch 
list at the end of March and the talks offer Taiwan a chance to 
try to relieve the imminent threat of U.S. sanctions. 
  Chiang said that Taiwan has performed well on the IPR issue 
and should be removed from the priority watch list. 
  He added that his ministry and concerned government 
departments have prepared a "position paper," which details 
Taiwan's efforts and results toward IPR protection over the past 
one year, to persuade the U.S. to remove it from the list. 
  But Economics Ministry officials are not so optimistic about 
Taiwan's full removal from the list. However, they said it may 
be possible for Taiwan to be downgraded from the special 301 
priority watch list to the watch list.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) -- Taiwan is seeking 
cooperation from Russia for the joint management of Taiwan's 
nuclear waste, a UNITED DAILY NEWS report from Moscow said 
Monday. 
  Deputy Manager Lin Ying of the state-run Taiwan Power 
Company, who is currently heading a Taipower nuclear energy task 
force on a fact-finding tour of Russia, said Russia's 
established nuclear expertise and facilities could serve as an 
example for Taiwan. 
  Lin also said that Taiwan is seeking approval for processing 
and storage of high-level radioactive waste in Russia. He noted 
that the proposed plan could proceed after discussion of issues 
including shipping and processing charges. 
  Waste incinerators in Russian nuclear power plants are 
fueled 
with high temperature and low pollution plasma rather than oil, 
a technology superior to that used in the United States, Lin 
said. 
  Taipower is under strong pressure to develop a nuclear waste 
management policy. Government laws stipulate that Taipower must 
finalize its nuclear waste policy and present for government 
review by 1997. 
  Currently, low-level radioactive waste from Taipower's 
nuclear power plants is incinerated on-site before being sent to 
Lanyu Island for storage. 
  However, Lanyu villagers have protested against the storage 
and Taipower's planned expansion of storage facilities on the 
island. 
  Taipower has also proposed the storage of nuclear waste at 
more than 30 spots around Taiwan, but the company is facing 
enormous opposition from environmentalists and residents of 
proposed waste sites. 
  The opposition has forced Taipower to seek waste storage 
sites overseas and the company is now planning to ship low-level 
radioactive waste to several sites in Zhejiang and Guangdong 
Provinces on the Chinese Mainland, the newspaper reported.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, 
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central 
Committee, today called for extra efforts to combat corruption, 
in order to boost the flesh and blood bonds between the party 
and the people. 
  Cases of corruption, especially those major and serious ones 
that have already been exposed, must be thoroughly investigated 
and severely dealt with, Jiang said. 
  The party chief made the remarks here today at the Third 
Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection, calling upon party committees and governments at all 
levels to attach more importance to the anti-corruption drive. 
  He said the fight against corruption, an important means to 
guarantee economic reforms, opening to the outside world, 
development and social stability, has achieved marked results 
since the convening of the second plenary session of the 
commission last August. 
  Jiang pointed out that the current anti-corruption campaign 
must agree with and serve the basic principles of the party and 
be conducted in line with the overall situation of the country. 
  The work must be carried out firmly and more effectively, 
Jiang stressed. It can't be expected that the anti-corruption 
drive will be completed in a single battle. It will be a 
long-term and arduous task, the party chief noted. 
  Pointing to the seriousness of corrupt phenomena that have 
been exposed, Jiang vowed that the party has the might and 
determination to carry the struggle forward to the end. 
  He said "the ideology of long-term fighting should be kept 
in 
mind without a bit of slackening, and an `amiable environment' 
for corrupt activities is by no means permitted." 
  The general secretary also summed up the experiences of the 
previous period in the anti-corruption campaign as trusting and 
relying on the broad masses, and joining the mobilization of 
people in exposing indications of criminal activity and 
investigations by judicial departments and party discipline 
inspection bodies. 
  Members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing and 
Hu Jintao attended today's meeting.

<F P=106> [By Liu Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), Central People's </F>
Broadcasting Station reporter, and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 
1627)] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng had 
an informal meeting in Zhongnanhai this afternoon with comrades 
from grass-roots political and legal affairs departments, 
enterprises, institutions, and relevant central authorities in 
Beijing. During the meeting, Li Peng solicited their views on 
how to improve the comprehensive management of public security 
and build an environment in which people can live and work in 
contentment -- issues that are to be discussed in the government 
work report (draft for soliciting comments) that he will soon 
present to the second session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress for deliberation. 
  When the meeting began, Li Peng said: Public security is an 
issue of public concern. We all want a stable environment in 
which to work and live. While we have achieved certain 
successes in this regard, there are still areas with which 
people are not satisfied. I hope that you will say anything that 
you wanted to say with regard to improving the comprehensive 
management of public security and building a better democratic 
and legal system. 
  Those attending the meeting actively presented their views 
and suggestions about the actual state of public security. 
[passage omitted] 
  They said: The problems that affect the comprehensive 
management of public security today are theft, highway and train 
robberies, a lack of order in certain urban districts, and 
troubles caused by ruffians and other evil forces. This being 
the case, party and government departments' attention and 
support are essential for the better comprehensive management of 
public security, and they must take up the responsibility of 
ensuring local peace by following through on Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's strategic thought that firm efforts must be made to 
promote material construction and socialist ethics at the same 
time, by providing stronger leadership over the comprehensive 
management of public security, by firmly cracking down on crimes 
that jeopardize people's lives and property as well as the 
modernization drive, and by waging deep-going struggles against 
what is socially vile. 
  Li Peng thanked them for their opinions, which were needed 
for the revision of the government work report. He also 
indicated that he would improve and replenish the report in 
accordance with their views and suggestions. 
  Li Peng said: Improving the comprehensive management of 
public security and safeguarding public stability is an 
important task of the CPC and the government this year. Not 
only is this the demand of the people, but it is also a 
responsibility that party and government departments -- and 
especially political and legal affairs departments -- must not 
evade. Party and government departments must consider this task 
a routine assignment. He pointed out: The most essential 
requirement for accomplishing this assignment is to integrate 
the handling of special projects with the mass line. This is to 
say that we must fully arouse the initiatives of the masses, all 
social sectors, and relevant departments, and must broadly 
mobilize and organize the masses to take an active part in the 
comprehensive management of public security, giving full scope 
to the roles of all departments in maintaining social stability 
so that the problem can be solved with combined efforts. 
Comprehensive management cannot be effective unless the 
strength of all quarters has been rallied. 
  Li Peng stressed: While managing public security 
comprehensively, we must pay special attention to properly 
handling all types of contradictions among the people during the 
new period. We must be good at mediating disputes, alleviating 
contradictions, dissolving negative factors, and nip in the bud 
all problems affecting public security. Meanwhile, people's 
governments must always keep in mind the need to serve the 
people wholeheartedly; give top priority to hearing the people's 
voices, showing concern for their interests, and solving their 
plight; and serve the people with more good and practical 
services so that there will be closer flesh-and-blood ties 
between the party and the government on the one hand and the 
people on the other, and so that our work can win the masses' 
support. 
  Li Peng said: To do an even better job in carrying out the 
comprehensive management of public security, governments at all 
levels must improve their analysis of the state of public 
security, give priority to preventing and cracking down on 
special crimes at the same time, and deal with the root causes 
as well as the symptoms. [passage omitted] 
  Among those present at the meeting were Ren Jianxin, member 
of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and chairman of the 
Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public 
Security; and Luo Gan, State Councillor and vice chairman of the 
Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public 
Security.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and his 
wife Zhu Lin, Vice Premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing, and other 
leading comrades joined members of the Preliminary Working 
Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
Preparatory Committee this evening to mark the Lantern Festival 
held at the Hong Kong and Macao Center. 
  The center, which is located on the second floor of a 
building on the East 40th Street, was decorated with lanterns 
and colorful streamers and was permeated with laughter this 
evening. The get-together sponsored by PWC members from Hong 
Kong opened at 1830 [1030 GMT] under the chairmanship of Zhu 
Youlin, a PWC member from Hong Kong, and Ni Ping, a celebrated 
presenter from China Central Television. After PWC Vice 
Chairman An Zijie gave a welcoming speech, Premier Li Peng gave 
an extemporaneous speech. He said he was very glad to be able 
to join PWC members from Hong Kong in marking the Lantern 
Festival, and he wished all PWC members good health, successful 
careers, and happiness for their families. 
  Speaking on the current situation in Hong Kong, Li Peng 
said: 
The China today is not the China of more than 150 years ago. 
Today, China's political situation is stable, its economy is 
developing, and we are full of confidence in the future of our 
motherland. He said: No matter what may happen, the Chinese 
Government's determination to reinstate its sovereignty over 
Hong Kong will not change, and Hong Kong certainly will witness 
a stable transition of political power and long-term prosperity 
and stability. 
  Under the current circumstances, Li Peng said, the PWC's 
burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and 
greater. He urged all PWC members to work harder and make even 
greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability and 
prosperity and the motherland's prosperity. 
  The 50 or so PWC members from Hong Kong and China, members 
of 
its secretariat, and friends from the press watched a brilliant 
performance given by literary and art workers in the capital. 
The pleasure-filled get-together, which lasted more than two 
hours, reached a climax when Lu Ping, director of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Office, and Fang-huang Jiwen, a 
PWC member from Hong Kong, sang the songs "I Am A Chinese" and 
"Tomorrow Will Be Even Better."

  [Text] Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng will stress 
stability and central authority in his Government Work Report to 
be presented to the National People's Congress when it opens on 
March 10. 
  While the final draft of the 15,000-character report is 
still 
being fine-tuned, informed sources said the premier would urge 
the nation's officials and citizens to strike a balance between 
reform, development and stability. Top priority will be put on 
shoring up the centre's authority in the macro-level adjustment 
and control over the economy, a point that had been made by 
senior leaders Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun in Shanghai last month. 
  The sources said barring 11th-hour changes, Mr. Li would 
recommend a GNP growth rate for 1994 of nine per cent, with the 
rates for industrial and agricultural development fixed at 
respectively 15 percent and at least 3.5 percent. Inflation 
should be kept within 10 percent. 
  The premier will reiterate the national goal for 1994 that 
had been laid down by the Politburo recently: "Seize the 
opportunities; deepen reform; expand the open door policy; 
promote development, and guarantee stability." 
  An informed source said: "The accent will be on stability, 
ensuring that reforms already unveiled late last year would be 
implemented without exacerbating socio-political problems." 
  "There will not be any new exhortation to quicken reform or 
development in view of the leadership's fears that too heady a 
pace might precipitate hyper-inflation, unemployment and 
challenges to the administration." 
  Following the recent remarks by Mr. Deng and Mr. Chen, 
premier Li will draw attention to the fact that "without central 
authority nothing can be achieved (in economic development)". 
Mr. Li will call on the regional leaders to put the overall 
national situation before local concerns. The premier will 
specifically warn against provinces and cities competing with 
each other in boosting their already very ambitious development 
targets. 
  Chinese economists who have seen parts of the draft report 
said it would be divided into seven sections. They will include 
the state of the economy and the political situation; economic 
reforms that will be carried out this year; the priorities for 
development with special emphasis on agriculture, the 
relationship between the centre and the regions, the need to 
balance economic reform with the construction of spiritual 
civilisation; reforms of the political and administrative 
structures; social objectives, particularly developments in 
education and technology; international affairs, including 
policy towards Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  A senior economist said: "Li Peng will not mention new 
economic reform initiatives beyond those already unveiled at the 
party Central Committee plenum last November. However, in view 
of the fact that reforms, including the new taxation system, 
have been bogged down because of opposition from regional cadres 
and other power blocs, the premier will underscore Beijing's 
commitment to their forceful implementation." 
  Areas of economic reform that will receive special emphasis 
include putting into place a modern enterprise system and 
rationalising the investment and banking system. "Premier Li 
will give further support to market experiments, particularly 
the conversion of state enterprises into shareholding 
companies," the economist said. "However, in view of the fear 
of rising unemployment as a result of state concerns laying off 
workers to improve efficiency, he will underscore Beijing's 
readiness to go on supporting those government enterprises that 
are not yet ready to undergo radical restructuring." 
  In his report, the premier expresses confidence that the 
overhauling of the investment and banking system will cure the 
problem of excessive fixed-assets investments by both local 
governments and enterprises. 
  He will reiterate that the limit for fixed-assets 
investments 
of all levels for 1994 will be 1,300 billion yuan (HK$ 1,154 
billion), and that "the ceiling absolutely cannot be breached". 
  New initiatives will be unveiled in the fight against 
inflation, deemed the prime problem of the economy. The 
measures will include regular inspections of price levels, 
punishments against speculators and the setting of price 
guidelines for essential commodities including grain and staple 
foodstuffs. 
  Pride of place will be given to agriculture, with a revival 
of the old goal of putting grain production as the key link of 
the economy. Mr. Li will reassure the nation's farmers of 
increased state investment as well as the fact that as a result 
of factors including the raising of the procurement price of 
produce, per capital income in rural areas will be boosted by at 
least five percent. The premier will urge local administrations 
to devote more resources and acreage to farming. He will 
strongly attack the phenomenon of the reckless decimation of 
farm land for the creation of a unrealistically large number of 
industrial and real-estate development zones. 
  In view of the dramatically rising crime rate that the heads 
of the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate 
will detail in their efforts to the NPC, Mr. Li will pledge that 
more resources be devoted for fighting crime. 
  The report underlines the importance of a strong defence and 
security apparatus in view of the fact that while the Cold War 
has ended, regional flashpoints have been on the increase and 
that infiltration into China by hostile foreign forces has gone 
on unabated. The premier is expected to recommend a budget 
boost for the People's Liberation Army of about 13 percent. 
  Chinese sources said there would be a sub-section on Hong 
Kong policy, where the premier was expected to reaffirm 
Beijing's commitment to maintaining the territory's stability 
and prosperity after the total collapse of talks with the Hong 
Kong-British administration on political development. 
  The premier is expected to call for the strengthening of the 
role of the Preliminary Working Committee as well as quickening 
the pace of its work in uniting patriotic forces in Hong Kong 
and ensuring a smooth transition to 1997. 
  Throughout the report the premier salutes Beijing's firm 
commitment to developing Mr. Deng's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the construction of a socialist 
market economy. 
  However, the patriarch's instructions on a high-speed model 
for reform and development have been shelved.

XINHUA reporter Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- On Lantern Festival 
night, the Great Hall of the People was decorated with colorful 
lanterns and was filled with good cheer and laughter. Jiang 
Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, 
Rong Yiren, and other leading comrades, as well as more than 200 
prominent figures from Beijing's intellectual circles, joyfully 
gathered at the Eastern Main Hall to celebrate the jubilant 
occasion. 
  The Eastern Main Hall was graced by red lanterns, was 
permeated with the fragrance of narcissus, and was filled with a 
jubilant atmosphere. Jiang Zemin, other comrades, and prominent 
figures from the capital's literary, art, science and 
technology, education, theoretical, and journalistic circles -- 
who were seated around round tables -- exchanged Spring Festival 
greetings while enjoying fine tea and chatting cheerfully. 
  Amid the smiling faces, Hu Jintao stepped up to the podium 
and, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended his 
festival greetings and cordial regards to the comrades and 
friends in the hall and to comrades and friends of the country's 
intellectual circles. He thanked everyone for making 
outstanding contributions to the country's reform, opening up, 
and socialist modernization. 
  Hu Jintao said that he hoped everyone, under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, would 
further unite and work even harder to take a new step forward, 
score new achievements, and make new contributions to the 
development of socialist literature, arts, sciences, technology, 
education, theories, and journalism. He expressed his hope that 
the great motherland will become more dynamic and prosperous, 
wealthier, and stronger. 
  The soiree was preceded by the song "The Moon of the 15th of 
the Month." Artists attending the soiree performed vocal solos, 
instrumental solos, instrumental ensembles, Beijing opera songs, 
vocal duets, and a magic show, winning sustained applause. 
  Jiang Zemin and other comrades, while viewing the 
performances, chatted with scientists, educators, and artists at 
their respective tables, and cordially inquired about their work 
and lives. While listening to the pipa [Chinese musical 
instrument] solo "The Lantern and the Moon Shine on Each Other," 
Jiang Zemin said, "The pipa is our national art; we should 
promote our national arts." While the "Song of the Guerrillas" 
was being played, Jiang Zemin said, "This is an immortal work." 
  The one hour, 40-minute soiree ended amid the song "Singing 
the Motherland." Hu Jintao wished everyone a happy Spring 
Festival, good health, family happiness, and a successful career. 
  Leading comrades also attending the soiree, included Li 
Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wen Jiabao, Lei Jieqiong, Wang Guangying, 
Buhe, Song Jian, Luo Gan, Wang Zhaoguo, Zhao Puchu, Hu Sheng, 
and Qian Zhengying.

  [Text] The forthcoming National People's Congress (NPC) 
will enshrine the position of Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji 
as economic czar and possibly the most important member of the 
cabinet. 
  Chinese sources said barring last minute changes, Mr. Zhu 
would replace premier Li Peng as the host of the press 
conference to be given to the domestic and international press 
when the plenary legislative session ends around March 25. 
Joining Mr. Zhu at the press event will be vice-premiers Zou 
Jiahua and Li Lanqing. 
  Mr. Zhu, who has been the major economic policy maker since 
late 1992, will present Beijing's case for boosting macro-level 
adjustments and controls. 
  Informed sources said premier Li would this year drop his 
annual practice of hosting a press conference after each NPC 
session, which he began when he became head of the Government in 
1988. They said the spotlight on Mr. Zhu reflected the fact 
that he had recovered from his relatively weak position at the 
height of the austerity programme late last year, when he was 
under attack from regional cadres and liberal economists. 
  The sources added it was very likely Mr. Zhu would hold on 
to 
his concurrent position of Governor of the People's Bank of 
China until later this year. While upon assuming the post last 
July, Mr. Zhu had indicated it would be a temporary arrangement, 
it is understood he recently decided he had to hang on to the 
position to ensure the success of banking and fiscal reforms. 
  No major personnel changes are expected to take place during 
this NPC, analysts in Beijing said. 
  Two other major press conferences, to be hosted by 
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and First Vice-Chairman of the NPC, 
Tian Jiyun would be organised in the course of the 
fortnight-long congress. Mr. Qian, who as Foreign Minister 
heads the Preliminary Working Committee handling the transition 
of Hong Kong to Chinese control, will take questions on Hong 
Kong. He will also discuss Macao and other international 
affairs. 
  Mr. Tian will elaborate on the legislative agenda and put 
emphasis on the NPC's growing powers of supervision over the 
Government. 
  In addition, journalists will be able to meet ministers, 
provincial and non-communist party leaders and entrepreneurs.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Third Plenary 
Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection 
[CCDI] of the CPC opened in Beijing this morning. The main 
items on its agenda were: to comprehensively implement -- under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the 
party -- the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to 
review and sum up -- in accordance with the principle of 
"seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability" that serves as 
the general requirement for the work of the whole party and 
pursuant to the Central Committee's requirements for deepening 
the drive against corruption -- the implementation of the 
decision of the Central Committee on the tasks of the 
anticorruption drive in the near future since the CCDI Second 
Plenary Session; and to study and make plans for the tasks of 
the anticorruption drive in 1994. On behalf of the CCDI Standing 
Committee, Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau and the 
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the 
party CCDI, delivered a report entitled: "Conduct In-Depth and 
Persistent Struggle Against Corruption and Make the Drive Serve 
Reform, Development, and Stability." 
  Wei Jianxing first reviewed and summed up the implementation 
of the anticorruption drive since the CCDI Second Plenary 
Session. He said: In accordance with a directive of the 
Central Committee, the CCDI Second Plenary Session set out the 
specific tasks of stepping up the anticorruption drive, 
improving the party's style of work, and building a clean and 
honest government in the near future. In taking the 
anticorruption drive seriously, party committees and government 
at all levels have immediately swung into action and have done a 
great deal of work. Over the past six months, we have made fair 
progress in implementing the anticorruption drive and have 
achieved varying degrees of success in the three tasks set by 
the Central Committee. Some of the regions and departments that 
have been more conscientious have achieved marked results in 
some areas. Many negative and corrupt practices have abated 
somewhat. All in all, the momentum of the anticorruption drive 
is good, and progress has been healthy. We have, by and large, 
achieved the results expected of us by the Central Committee. 
Our efforts have been quite helpful to safeguarding political 
stability, to advancing reform and opening up, and to 
guaranteeing the execution of the tasks of macroeconomic 
regulation and control. 
  Wei Jianxing said: Following the CCDI Second Plenary 
Session, party committees and government at all levels have 
conscientiously implemented -- and scored fairly good successes 
in -- the five-point regulations for observing clean standards 
and self-discipline by leading officials at and above the county 
(division) level in party and government organs. The provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the 
central government as well as the various ministries and 
commissions -- state organs at the central level -- have 
convened meetings on democratic activities. By carrying out 
self-examination and self-rectification, the overwhelming 
majority of leading cadres have enhanced their sense of 
observing clean standards and self-discipline. The problems 
uncovered by many cadres themselves through self-examination 
have been handled in accordance with the relevant regulations. 
Some localities and departments have even formulated rules and 
regulations in regard to observing clean standards and 
self-discipline. During this time, localities and departments 
have concentrated their resources on the investigation of a 
number of major cases. Compared to the corresponding period in 
1992, the number of major bribery cases involving over 10,000 
yuan that were investigated nationwide from September to 
December last year rose by 2.1 times, the number of cases 
involving economic offenses by leading cadres at the county 
(division) level rose by 6.8 times, and the number of cases 
involving cadres at the department and bureau level rose by 11 
times. From September to December last year, 42,195 persons 
were punished by party sanctions and 16,169 were punished by 
administrative sanctions nationwide. The masses became more 
aware and took a more active part in the anticorruption drive, 
resulting in a sharp increase in letters and visits to 
authorities reporting irregularities. Compared to the 
corresponding period in 1992, the number of such letters, 
visits, and tips received by the nation's discipline inspection 
and supervision departments between September and December last 
year rose by 78.5 percent. Many of the informants used their 
real names, and many of the reports targeted leading cadres, key 
departments, and major irregularities. Localities and 
departments have also made progress in handling special projects 
and in rectifying various unhealthy trends. With the approval 
of the State Council, the Finance Ministry and the State 
Planning Commission have, in two separate pronouncements, 
abolished 143 illegal fees. The 30 provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities directly under the central 
government have announced the abolition of 5,227 illegal fees. 
The localities and departments have also cracked down on 
government-funded sightseeing tours abroad and have stopped some 
1,600 unqualified groups from taking tours abroad. Competent 
departments in many key sectors took steps to deal with the 
major problems in their respective sectors; some sectors such as 
the railways have done comparative well and have made rather 
remarkable progress. Many other negative and corrupt 
manifestations -- such as using public funds to entertain guests 
and give presents -- have also been curtailed somewhat. 
  Wei Jianxing said: Judging from the country as a whole, 
the anticorruption drive has developed unevenly, with some 
localities failing to achieve concrete results. While affirming 
the achievements of the drive so far, we must also notice that 
negative phenomena and corruption remain serious and require us 
to continue to make painstaking efforts without the slightest 
lowering of our guard. 
  Wei Jianxing said: The implementation of the anticorruption 
drive so far has fully testified that the Central Committee's 
plans to fight corruption are entirely correct. In the course 
of practice, we have explored a number of effective measures, 
which can be summarized mainly as the following: We must 
understand and grasp the importance of the anticorruption drive 
from the height of reforms, development, and stability; although 
the anticorruption drive is a protracted strategic task which 
cannot be accomplished in one stroke, we must imbue ourselves 
with a realistic sense of urgency and carry out the drive step 
by step to continuously score periodic achievements; we must 
adopt an overall view of the anticorruption drive and adhere to 
the pattern of the three tasks set out by the Central Committee 
in order to achieve the comprehensive effects of the drive; we 
must not only clearly and specifically decide on the tasks and 
goals for the various stages of the anticorruption drive but 
also must strengthen the supervision, inspection, and guidance 
from the top and from below; the whole party membership and both 
party and government organizations must be mobilized in the 
anticorruption drive; and to create a macroclimate, the 
anticorruption drive must be strongly supported by public 
opinion. 
  In discussing the tasks for 1994, Wei Jianxing said: This 
year will be crucial for comprehensively implementing the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and expediting 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure to 
bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. It will also be a year in which we will see 
the largest-scale reform measures launched in more than a decade 
and in which we will face arduous tasks in reforms, development, 
and stability. The new situations will require us to more 
steadfastly implement the strategic principle of grasping two 
links at the same time, more firmly and thoroughly carry out the 
anticorruption drive, and step up the efforts to improve the 
style of the party and promote clean government, so as to 
provide the conditions and a guarantee for reforms, development, 
and stability. 
  Wei Jianxing pointed out: In line with the Central 
Committee's instruction, the overall pattern of the three 
anticorruption tasks will remain unchanged but will be enriched 
with new content based on the special features of circumstances. 
  As far as requirements for leading cadres to be honest and 
self-disciplined are concerned, leading cadres at and above the 
county (division) level in party and government organs must 
strictly observe the various regulations formulated by the party 
Central Committee and the State Council for improving the 
party's style and promoting clean government, and must continue 
to unremittingly implement the five regulations on the honesty 
and self-discipline of leading cadres formulated by the Central 
Committee last year. In addition to these regulations, the 
following requirements for this year are listed and reiterated: 
1) Nobody is allowed to violate regulations and to buy or 
change to imported and luxury cars; or to use one's power to 
exchange and borrow cars from subordinate enterprises and units, 
or to collect money from them to buy cars; nobody is allowed to 
buy cars for leading cadres with loans, money collected from 
people, and funds for special projects; county (city) leading 
party and government organs and units which still owe wages to 
staff members are not allowed to buy cars. 2) Nobody is allowed 
to operate counter to the regulations of the State Council on 
reforming the housing system and to buy houses at prices lower 
than promulgated; or to abuse power to provide preferential 
treatment for spouses, children, relatives, or friends to buy 
houses; or to decorate private houses lavishly with public 
funds. 3) Leading cadres should attend domestic public 
activities without fanfare; their accommodations should not 
exceed the local criteria for being received; and no special 
dance parties should be organized for them. 4) Nobody is allowed 
to organize lavish activities and to spend without restraint on 
occasions of marriages, funerals, changes of jobs, birthdays, 
and moving to new housing, either for oneself or family members. 
Using public funds and materials for such activities or earning 
money through these occasions are especially forbidden. 5) 
Nobody is allowed to abuse power and to refuse to return public 
funds; or to buy or build houses with public funds for oneself, 
one's relatives and friends, or to engage in profit-making. 
  In investigating and handling cases, this year attention 
should continue to be focused on violations of the law and 
discipline by leading party and government organs and their top 
officials, by judicial and administrative law-enforcement 
departments, and by economic management departments and their 
functionaries. Efforts should be concentrated on probing and 
handling major and serious cases, paying particular attention to 
leading cadres who embezzle, take bribes, or abuse power for 
personal gain; and law- and discipline-enforcement personnel who 
bend the law to benefit relatives and friends or who take 
bribes, or who violate the law and discipline while enforcing 
them; as well as to violations of the law and discipline by 
corporations. It is necessary to select typical cases and to 
publish the results of investigations for the benefit of the 
masses so as to improve the social benefits of investigations. 
  This year we shall focus attention on strengthening 
supervision over the work of rectifying unhealthy practices 
found in government departments and in trades and professions 
and shall vigorously carry out this work. First, we shall 
continue to vigorously stop the unwarranted collection of fees. 
Meanwhile, we shall earnestly solve the problem of the abuse of 
power by party and government organizations and by their working 
personnel to requisition enterprises' vehicles, computers, and 
communications equipment without making payment for them and to 
transfer enterprises' funds under various pretexts to their own 
small coffers and to provide services to their staff members and 
workers. The unhealthy practice of exacting donations from 
enterprises under various pretexts must be stopped resolutely. 
We must continue to do a good job of lightening peasants' 
burdens. Second, we must continue to rectify the unhealthy 
trend of using public funds to go abroad for reasons of tourism, 
and we must put an end to going abroad on routine official 
business and for routine training. Third, all areas and 
departments must continue to make efforts to succeed in handling 
the task of rectifying unhealthy trends and to solve one or two 
conspicuous problems in a down-to-earth manner. While rectifying 
unhealthy trends, we must address the problem by looking into 
both its root cause and symptoms; attach importance to studying 
how to solve the profound problems involved with the 
rectification of unhealthy trends and the consolidation of 
discipline; persist in closely integrating the anticorruption 
drive with deepening reform, improving the party's style, and 
strengthening the building of a clean and honest government; and 
persist in closely integrating honesty with industriousness in 
the performance of official duties. 
  Wei Jianxing stressed: This year's task of fighting against 
corruption is still arduous. It is very difficult. Party 
committees and governments at all levels must conscientiously 
strengthen leadership and expend time and effort on guiding the 
drive to unfold in depth and on producing concrete results in a 
bid to achieve phased successes. 
  Wei Jianxing pointed out: While paying attention to 
successfully launching the anticorruption drive, discipline 
inspection organs at all levels must further strengthen 
supervision over law enforcement, conscientiously supervise the 
implementation of democratic centralism, strictly enforce 
political discipline, and ensure the smooth transmission of 
government decrees. They must carry out supervision over law 
enforcement at focal points and in a planned way by making their 
efforts revolve around the implementation of a series of 
important policies and measures adopted by the CPC Central 
Committee and State Council on deepening reform, developing the 
economy, and maintaining stability. 
  Finally, Wei Jianxing pointed out: This year is important 
for our implementation of the resolution adopted by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee to enable 
China's economy to maintain a good momentum of development. It 
is a crucial year for us to shift the economic system to a new 
track. As such, our tasks are very great. The broad masses of 
cadres of discipline-inspection organs shoulder a glorious and 
sacred mission and face a good opportunity to temper themselves. 
They must rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, surmount difficulties, work 
hard, and make positive contributions to more effectively launch 
a sustained, in-depth anticorruption drive; to improving the 
party's style and strengthening the building of a clean and 
honest government; to promoting economic construction, reform, 
and opening up; and to maintaining political stability in a 
sense of urgent political responsibility and under the guidance 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as well as of the party's basic line. 
  CCDI Deputy Secretary Hou Zongbin presided over today's 
meeting. Altogether, 103 CCDI members attended the meeting. 
Persons in charge of discipline inspection organs in all 
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, all the 
departments under the central authorities; the People's 
Liberation Army, and armed police forces, together with persons 
in charge of relevant departments, attended the meeting as 
observers.

<F P=106> [By Cui Yanming (1508 1693 2494): "Mao Zedong Thought and </F>
Deng Xiaoping Theory"] 
  [Text] Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping and using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole 
party is a fundamental task put forth by the 14th CPC National 
Congress for strengthening party building during the new period. 
For this reason, it is necessary for us to theoretically 
clarify relations between Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to 
increase our understanding, dispel misgivings, enhance our 
consciousness, and sharpening our sense of urgency for 
strengthening our study, so that we can grasp in a still better 
way the origin and essence of the theory. 
  1. Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is the latest product of the integration 
of Marxism and the practical reality in China. It is an 
inheritance of Mao Zedong Thought under the new historical 
conditions, and Marxism in contemporary China. 
  Our party is a vanguard of the working class, which takes 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding thought. In 
the past, now, and in the future, we unswervingly regard 
Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding thought of 
the whole party. However, in the course of historical 
development, and in different historical stages, Marxism -- as a 
unified ideological system -- has different theoretical 
manifestations. The integration of Marxism with the reality in 
Russia gave rise to Leninism. The integration of Marxism with 
the reality in China gave rise to Mao Zedong Thought. The 
continuation of the development of Mao Zedong Thought has 
inevitably given rise to a new theoretical summation. This is 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. This does not mean that the latter negates the 
former, or that they are completely the same. This can only 
mean that the latter inherits and develops the former, so that 
Marxism, as a comprehensive ideological system, can constantly 
enrich and improve itself, and is full of vigor and vitality 
with the development of practice. 
  Proletarian revolutionary teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and 
Mao Zedong successfully expounded and solved the problem of how 
the proletariat must seize state power. Due to restrictions of 
historical conditions, the problem of building socialism, and, 
in particular, the problem of how to consolidate and develop 
socialism in countries which are economically and culturally 
backward, has not yet been solved well. 
  Chinese communists of the new generation, represented by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, have shouldered this important historical 
task. They respect practice, the masses, and their pioneering 
spirit. They have scientifically summed up the experience and 
creativity of the masses. They have inherited the experiences 
of their predecessors, broken with outmoded conventions, and led 
us to successfully carry out reform, opening up, and 
modernization. In the process of making great achievements, 
they have gradually formed and established their socialist 
theories with Chinese characteristics. For the first time they 
have systematically and initially answered a series of basic 
questions, including the road of socialist development, stages 
of development, fundamental tasks, motives for development, 
leading force, the force which must be relied upon, external 
conditions for building socialism, political guarantees, 
strategic steps, unification of the motherland, and so on. They 
have pointed out the way to carry out socialist construction, 
consolidate and develop the basic principle of developing 
socialism, and the way forward. They have inherited and 
developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. 
  2. It is imperative to correctly comprehend how Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism inherits and develops 
Mao Zedong Thought, and corrects Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes 
committed during his remaining years to enhance our 
consciousness in implementing the party's basic line. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Since the Third Plenary 
Session, we have restored those correct things of Comrade Mao 
Zedong. In other words, we have accurately and comprehensively 
applied Mao Zedong Thought. This still remains our basic point. 
Now we are doing things which Comrade Mao Zedong raised, but 
had not completed. We should advocate matters which he wrongly 
opposed, and do things which he failed to accomplish. For a 
fairly long period of time in the future, we must still do these 
things well. Of course, we must develop, and continue to 
develop them." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks have actually 
revealed the three relations between the inheritance and 
development of Mao Zedong Thought by the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the correction of 
the mistakes committed by Mao Zedong during his remaining years. 
  Let us first talk about inheritance. Inheritance means 
receiving a valuable legacy from predecessors. Inheriting and 
receiving can be traced to the same origin. For example, 
seeking truth from facts is our party's ideological line. Both 
Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Deng Xiaoping actively advocate 
this line. This is a main line linking Mao Zedong Thought and 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I believe in 
seeking truth from facts advocated by Chairman Mao. In the 
past, we relied on it to fight the war. Now we must also rely 
on it to carry out construction and reform." He added: 
"Seeking truth from facts is the essence of Marxism. We must 
advocate this, but not book worship." Let's look at another 
example. The mass line is our party's basic working line. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping leads the whole party to inherit and 
persist in pursuing this line which Comrade Mao Zedong advocated 
and followed. In the meantime, he arouses the enthusiasm and 
creativity of the broad masses of people through reform and 
opening up. This has enabled our country to considerably 
develop productive forces, and greatly improved the living 
standard of the people. Attaining the target of common 
prosperity is no longer an invisible dream. It is precisely 
because Comrade Deng Xiaoping inherited from Comrade Mao Zedong 
the fine tradition and work style of the mass line -- and that 
he is good at applying a good method of summing up the 
experiences of the masses and refining, processing, and 
developing them into theories -- that the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is close to life and is 
welcomed and accepted by the masses, just as Mao Zedong Thought 
was. There is one more example. Independence and initiative is 
our party's basic principle for developing itself and handling 
external relations. It is an important component of Mao Zedong 
Thought. It is also a spiritual fulcrum and theoretical 
prerequisite for the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics created by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and has 
enabled China to take a road of development different from those 
taken by other socialist countries. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
repeatedly told the whole party: "Combining the universal truth 
of Marxism with the practical reality in China, taking our own 
road, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a 
basic conclusion drawn from our long-term historical 
experiences." 
  In addition, Mao Zedong Thought also includes rich contents 
of upholding the socialist road, the people's democratic 
dictatorship, the communist party leadership, and 
Marxism-Leninism. With regard to the issue of the four upholds, 
Comrade Mao Zedong's firm conviction and systematic guidance 
educated the Chinese communists of the entire generation well. 
It is Comrade Deng Xiaoping who has inherited this spiritual 
legacy well, and constantly injected contents of the new era 
into it, and carried it forward. 
  Thus it can be seen that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics has fully inherited the 
living soul of Mao Zedong Thought. Without such an inheritance, 
the party history will be cut off, or even negated. We will 
thus lose our basic foothold, and get lost. 
  As far as development is concerned, it means opening up and 
blazing new trails. It also means that in front of the new 
situation, we study the new issues, sum up new experiences, 
generalize new viewpoints, and establish new theories. This 
shows that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics tops Mao Zedong Thought. Since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our 
country has entered a new historical period, and great changes 
have taken place in both the domestic and international 
situation. The new situation and practice has provided us with 
unprecedentedly favorable conditions and new experiences. This 
has laid a firm and practical foundation for the development of 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and the new theory as well. 
For instance, with the deepening of reform, our party has put 
forth a series of relevant new viewpoints and theories. They 
mainly include: The full development of the commodity economy 
is an insuperable stage of the development of the social 
economy; the planned economy is not tantamount to socialism, and 
the market economy is not tantamount to capitalism; socialism 
can also pursue the market economy, and the aim of our country's 
economic structural reform is to establish a socialist market 
economic system, and so on. In the development of Marxist 
theory, they have theoretically solved, for the first time, the 
issue of combining commodity economy with market economy and 
socialism so that we can make a major breakthrough in 
understanding relations between planning and market. This has 
brought about unprecedented and fundamental changes in the 
socialist economic pattern. Revolution means emancipation of 
productive forces, and so does reform. Reform is also a 
profound revolution, and the only way for emancipating and 
developing productive forces under the socialist conditions. In 
the history of the development of Marxism, they have, for the 
first time, correctly pointed out the driving force for the 
development of socialism. This negates the theory which has 
always taken class struggle as a driving force for the 
development of socialism. This has enabled us to find a road 
for rapidly developing socialism and making our country powerful 
and strong. The essence of socialism is the emancipation and 
development of productive forces, elimination of exploitation 
and polarization, and eventual attainment of common prosperity. 
This is a major supplement and correction of the previous 
standards on socialism. 
  Lastly, let us talk about correction. Correction means 
correcting a few inferences wrongly drawn by Comrade Mao Zedong 
during his later years due to historical conditions, and which 
have been proved by practice that they no longer conform with 
the demand of the new era. It means amending, supplementing, 
and improving certain viewpoints which can no longer conform 
with the new situation due to changes of conditions. This shows 
that the latecomer (Deng's theory) is highly responsible for the 
old timer (Mao Thought), the masses, and history. For example, 
with regard to the issue of concentrating our efforts on 
developing productive forces, Comrade Mao Zedong realized this, 
because it is a common knowledge of Marxism. This was also a 
problem which he strived to solve all his life. However, owing 
to the fact that he made a wrong estimation of the class 
situation in our country and the political situation of the 
party and state, he adopted a wrong method to deal with it. In 
this connection, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly told the 
whole party that we must concentrate our efforts on developing 
productive forces, and treat this as the most fundamental task 
of the entire party. 
  In a word, Deng Xiaoping theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristic has inherited the living soul of Mao 
Zedong Thought and developed Mao Zedong Thought and has, through 
practice, found the road of reform and opening up for the 
Chinese people with an aim of making their country powerful and 
strong. The nucleus of the theory is "one center, two basic 
points," and its nature and essence are emancipating the mind, 
seeking truth from facts, and everything proceeding from 
reality. The nucleus of the theory is our political line, and 
the party's unshakable basic line in the entire initial period 
of socialism. The essence of the theory is our cognitive line, 
and an ideological line which our party must stick to under all 
circumstances. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, let 
us strive for a new victory in reform, opening up, and 
modernization!

<F P=106> [Report: "Mainland Dissidents Have Been Warned Repeatedly; </F>
Wei Jingsheng Refuses To Yield to Pressure, His Present 
Whereabouts Are Unknown"] 
  [Text] Before the visit to China by U.S. officials 
responsible for human rights affairs, THE NEW YORK TIMES 
published a report saying that Wei Jingsheng, a famous champion 
of democracy in China, and Yu Haocheng, another famous dissident 
in China, recently had received warnings from the public 
security authorities, who required them not to continue 
contacting foreign reporters and publishing articles in the 
foreign press. Both of them, however, explicitly rejected these 
warnings. MING PAO tried to contact Wei Jingsheng, but people 
in his family said that he would not be at home these few days. 
  Wei Jingsheng was arrested and jailed in 1979 for publishing 
articles criticizing the authorities' antidemocracy policy. He 
was released last September. According to yesterday's report by 
THE NEW YORK TIMES, Wei Jingsheng received a string of warnings 
from the authorities this month. He was warned against further 
discussing democracy with foreign reporters and against 
publishing in an overseas arena a book about his 14 years of 
prison life. According to Wei Jingsheng, between 1 and 10 
February he had received three warnings, and since he left 
prison last September he had received seven warnings. Each 
time, however, he rejected the warning and declared that he 
"would not yield to excessive and unreasonable warnings." 
  According to the report, Wei Jingsheng took concrete action 
against the warnings. THE NEW YORK TIMES said that he sent a 
letter to the International Olympic Committee last week, 
demanding that it impose sanctions against Beijing because of 
the authorities' jailing of dissident Qian Yongmin, who opposed 
China's hosting of the 2000 Olympic Games. 
  Qian Yongmin is one of the drafters of the "Peace Charter." 
He was sentenced, without an official trial, to two years' 
detention in a labor camp. Wei Jingsheng said in his letter to 
the International Olympic Committee: "The detention of a person 
for his opinion regarding the Olympics showed that the Olympic 
spirit has gone rotten in China." 
  Yesterday, MING PAO tried to place a long-distance call to 
Wei Jingsheng, but he was not at home. According to people in 
his family, Wei Jingsheng was often out, and this time, he had 
been out for several consecutive days. "We do not know where he 
is now and do not know when he will return." When this MING PAO 
reporter mentioned that Wei Jingsheng had been warned several 
times by the public security authorities, people in his family 
said that they did not know about this. 
  Yu Haocheng, another firm dissident, is a law expert. In the 
1980's, he was a responsible person of the Qunchong Publishing 
House under the Ministry of Public Security. He was detained 
between 1989 and 1990, and was then prohibited from going 
abroad. Last October, he received an invitation to a symposium 
on human rights in Hong Kong, but he still could not attend it. 
His speech was published there, anyway. His recent application 
for overseas travel again was turned down by the authorities, 
and he was warned that if he continued to publish human rights 
articles in overseas arenas, he would be punished. Last week, 
he firmly claimed that the Chinese Constitution gives him the 
right to publish writings. 
  It is expected that China's human rights conditions once 
again will become the focus of the mass media's attention. In 
two days, Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human 
rights affairs, will visit Beijing and discuss the human rights 
issue with Chinese officials. In March, U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher also will visit China in order to assess the 
improvement of human rights there as a prelude to President 
Clinton's final decision on whether to extend China's 
most-favored-nation trade status.

<F P=106> [By reporter Huang Tian (7806 3944): "Wang Dan Is Forced by </F>
the Authorities To Withdraw Invitations Issued to 200 Democratic 
Activists To Attend His Beijing Birthday Party"] 
  [Text] Wang Dan, leader of the student-led democratic 
movement in 1989, celebrated his 24th birthday yesterday. 
However, following the mainland authorities' intervention, 
nearly 200 people who had taken part in the democratic movement 
in 1989 and who received invitations could not attend his 
birthday party. They were replaced by Wang Dan's former 
schoolmates, relatives, and family members who had nothing to do 
with the 4 June Incident. If this gathering had been realized, 
it was believed it would have been the largest meeting of 
democratic activists who have been banned by the Beijing 
authorities since the 4 June Incident. 
  A democratic activist who was invited to Wang Dan's birthday 
party said: The authorities attached great importance to the 
"mass gathering of democratic activists" for fear that Wang 
Dan's birthday party would develop into a political rally. 
Departments concerned interrogated Wang Dan after learning that 
heavy-weight democracy activists who had been arrested by the 
CPC in the 4 June Incident -- such as Zhou Duo, Liu Xiaobo, and 
Bao Zunxin -- were included in the list of nearly 200 guests to 
whom invitations had been sent, as well as other people involved 
in the democratic movement in 1989. 
  A friend of Wang Dan said: The day before yesterday, CPC 
departments concerned talked to Wang Dan for a whole day to try 
to persuade him to reset the guest list for his birthday party, 
otherwise Wang Dan would bear all the consequences. However, 
Wang Dan said the party was a form of celebrating his birthday, 
and as a citizen, he was entitled to make any choice. 
  During the one-day talk, the departments concerned stressed 
that the mere gathering of these people was politically tinted 
and that he could not but acknowledge this fact. They told Wang 
Dan: You now have only two choices. The first is to change the 
list of your birthday party guests; none of the people involved 
in the 4 June Incident may attend. The second choice is to 
cancel the birthday party, and everything must be handled in a 
low-key manner. At last, Wang Dan said that he was willing to 
cancel the invitations to nearly 100 "sensitive figures." 
Instead, he celebrated his 24th birthday with about 30 former 
schoolmates, relatives, and good friends. 
  It was understood that Wang Dan was very careful in setting 
the invitation list. For example, Wei Jingsheng, the democratic 
fighter who was released not long ago, and a number of even more 
sensitive figures were not included on the list. 
  A Beijing scholar said: It is no surprise that the CPC has 
taken this move, and Wang Dan should have been psychologically 
prepared for it right from the beginning. For the CPC, this is 
the eve of the opening of the plenary sessions of the National 
People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese 
Political People's Consultative Conference, and so foreign 
reporters -- particularly those from Hong Kong and Macao -- have 
arrived in Beijing one after another. If this party had not 
been stopped promptly, similar gatherings might have been many 
times, and then the authorities might find them more difficult 
to control. Hence, this incident also helps test the extent to 
which the CPC can put up with democratic activists. Wang Dan's 
birthday party was held in a restaurant on the opposite side of 
Hotel (Merdia) in the western suburb of Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Association of Science and Technology (CAST) must work hard to 
promote the application of scientific results to production and 
the improvement of the country's science and technology, both a 
senior Chinese leader and a top CAST head said today. 
  Alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China Wen Jiabao and CAST 
Chairman Zhu Guangya voiced the requirement at a national 
conference of CAST, which began here today. 
  The tasks set for the non-governmental scientific 
organization this year include: improving the production 
technologies and management of large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, developing new products and new 
technologies, enhancing agricultural technologies, and doing 
research work on major regional and inter-regional development 
projects. 
  According to an investigation conducted in 17 provinces, 
autonomous regions and cities, 1.1 million scientists and 
technical experts last year participated in 9,000 projects in 
transforming scientific results into productivity. 
  "The economic turnover amounted to 3.23 billion yuan (about 
660 million U.S. dollars then)," CAST's Zhu Guangya said. 
  Zhu said his association, a link between the government and 
the nation's scientists and technicians, will also provide the 
government with advice and opinions on national policies and 
development plans. 
  He said that CAST will strengthen its efforts in running 
scientific institutions and enterprises to better equip itself 
to fulfill its social responsibilities. 
  Wen Jiabao asked CAST to promote the establishment of 
China's 
new scientific and technological framework. 
  The new system should be suited to the development of a 
socialist market economy and the law on scientific and 
technological development, and characterized by a close union 
between the economy and science and technology, Wen said. 
  Wen said the Communist Party of China and the government 
have 
always been ready to listen to the opinions and requests of 
intellectuals, to bring their initiative and creativity into 
full play. 
  CAST, a national scientific association for the public good 
established in 1958, now has 4 million members across the 
country.

Li Xiuqing (2621 4423 3237)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- The simulated satellite 
successfully launched into space by the carrier rocket "Long 
March 3-A" on 8 February was officially named the "Star of the 
Hualing Group" at the China Institute of Carrier Rocket 
Technology today. It was the first time in our country's 
aerospace history that a man-made earth satellite was named 
after an enterprise. 
  Guangzhou's Hualing Limited Company Group mainly produces 
Hualing-brand refrigerators and other household electrical 
appliances, and is one of "the country's top 10 enterprises that 
produce household electrical appliances." To support our 
country's aerospace service, the company donated 500,000 yuan to 
the aerospace industry before the "Long March 3-A" rocket was 
launched. To express its gratitude, the rocket technology 
institute painted the Hualing group's business emblem on the 
satellite's cowling and placed inside the satellite a model of 
the national gold medal awarded to the company.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The China Great 
Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) and the U.S. Hughes 
Communications International, Inc. signed a contract here today 
for the launching of the Optus B3 communications satellite. 
  Liu Zhixiong, deputy-president of the CGWIC, said that Optus 
B3 will be sent into space aboard a Long March 2e launch vehicle 
at the Xichang satellite launch center in Sichuan Province in 
the second half of this year. 
  Liu said that the launch services contract was finalized by 
both parties after more than one year of discussions and joint 
efforts. 
  In addition, both parties also signed a long-term 
co-operation agreement today for the launching of an additional 
ten Hughes-built communications satellites in the coming 12 
years. 
  Hughes is a well-known manufacturer of communications 
satellites, occupying some 60 percent of the worldwide 
commercial communications satellite market. It was one of the 
earliest Western satellite manufacturers to do business with the 
CGWIC. Its products, Asiasat-1 and an Australian-owned 
communications satellite, have already been successfully 
launched by the CGWIC. 
  The two sides have contracted to launch the Hughes-built 
Apstar-1 and Apstar-2, as well as the Optus B3 this year, and 
hope to extend their co-operation in the space field in the near 
future.

<F P=106> [By Gao Jinan: "China Lifts the Secrecy Shrouding </F>
Aerospace"] 
  [Text] China has raised the veil of secrecy around its 
space industry by inviting international investment in a diverse 
package of projects. 
  This is the first major step taken by the China Aerospace 
Corp (CASC) to lure foreign investment since it was founded last 
June. 
  At that time the Ministry of Aerospace Industry was split 
into two independent enterprises -- China Aerospace Corp and the 
Aviation Industry of China -- to sharpen the competitive edge of 
the space and aviation industries. 
  While announcing the investment opportunities last week, 
Wang 
Liheng, Vice-President of CASC, also disclosed that 
breakthroughs in the manned space programme are expected by the 
end of this century or early next century, but gave no details. 
  CASC is seeking co-operation in 93 projects covering 
satellites, electronics, machinery, and automobile and real 
estate development. Implementing all of them will require 1.28 
billion yuan ($147 million). 
  Wang said CASC is willing to cooperate with any foreign 
partner and would explore all forms of assistance in developing 
the space industry, including joint ventures and technological 
exchanges. 
  Economic co-operation would be shared equally by the 
partners 
and would yield mutual benefits, Wang said. 
  CASC has set aside 60 million yuan ($6.9 million) and $10 
million as start-up capital for the projects. 
  The corporation will stage four international exhibitions 
this year to publicize the projects: In Chicago, the US, in 
March; in Melbourne, Australia, in May; in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia, in July; and in Beijing in September. 
  Five of the projects are related to satellite applications 
and require 77.5 million yuan ($8.9 million) Wang said. 
  The Hunan Aerospace Corp, for instance, is seeking a foreign 
partner to jointly manufacture satellite TV receiving systems. 
The required investment is estimated at 15 million yuan ($1.7 
million). 
  The corporation now produces 2,000 sets for home use, but 
needs capital to expand production to meet expanding demand. 
  Market surveys show that current demand for satellite TV 
receivers is about 100,000 each year, and will grow to 300,000 
to 500,000 by the turn of the century. 
  The four other satellite projects involve communications 
ground stations, a digital communications network, a weather 
information platform, and a communications monitoring system. 
  CASC had devoted itslelf to developing and manufacturing 
launch vehicles, spacecraft, and strategic and tactical missiles 
before shifting to civilian purposes in the late 1970s. 
  Civilian production now makes up about 70 per cent of the 
industry's output. 
  Wang said his corporation will concentrate on three markets: 
satellites, automobiles and computers. Most of the 93 projects 
are in these three fields. 
  He said Chinese satellites have improved to the point where 
they will be good enough to export by the year 2000. 
  China has signed space-related agreements and protocols with 
a number of countries, including Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, 
the US, Pakistan India, Russia and Brazil.

  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- China plans to send 
a research team to the Arctic in a year's time, according a 
scientist in charge of the research program here today. 
  At the first seminar on Chinese scientific research in the 
Arctic, Wei Menghua, director of the research preparatory group, 
said that the team will set off in mid-February, 1995, and is 
expected to reach the North Pole in early May. 
  He said the team's priority will be global change research 
in 
the Arctic, covering fields such as meteorology, maritime 
biology, glaciology and environmental science. 
  The researchers plan to get to the Arctic area via Russia, 
Wei said, noting that nine out of 11 successful expeditions 
internationally to the North Pole since 1909 went via Canada. 
  "It does not make much sense to follow passes others opened, 
as we are an Asian country and it's the first research team from 
China to the Arctic," explained Wei. 
  To ensure success, Wei said, members of the group will 
undergo simulated training at the end of this year along the 
Heilongjiang in north China. 
  According to Wei, the North Pole is ideal for conducting 
scientific research on space, earth and atmosphere, oceans, and 
the structure of the earth, especially on global change. 
  The International Arctic Science Committee, a 
non-governmental international organization, was set up in 1991 
to encourage cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research. 
Fourteen countries have so far joined it. Wei said China is 
going to promote cooperation with these countries through its 
scientific research.

  [Text] Hangzhou, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China will resume 
its halted exploration of manganese nodules in the Pacific Ocean 
in the near future, according to the No. 2 Institute of 
Oceanography under the National Bureau of Oceanography. 
  In the early morning of May 2 last year, Xiangyanghong 16, a 
Chinese scientific exploration ship heading for the Pacific 
Ocean for a 187-day research mission, was involved in a 
collision with a foreign ship. The exploration ship and 
millions of dollars worth of instruments and documents sank to 
the bottom of the ocean. 
  Soon after the accident, China decided to resume the 
mission. 
Over the past year, necessary equipment was purchased, produced 
and installed. Xiangyanghong 09, the sister ship of 
Xiangyanghong 16, was transformed and test-navigated for the 
mission.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Feb (XINHUA) -- China has achieved new 
results in geological prospecting of the Nansha [Spratly] 
Islands: The 1993 geophysical survey was completed in an 
all-round manner, and so was the structure appraisal of the six 
traps in the Wanan Basin, thereby providing invaluable data for 
the further prospecting of oil gas resources on the islands. 
  The Nansha Islands are located in the southern part of the 
South Sea, having a total of 193 named reefs, shoals, submerged 
reefs, and hidden shoals. The results of the survey show that 
the islands are composed of atolls of coral reefs and shoals. 
The rings run from northeast to southwest, covering 560 
nautical miles from north to south -- from the Liyuetan at the 
northernmost to Zengmuansha at the southernmost -- and 400 
nautical miles from east to west in the vast waters within 
China's traditional boundary. Since 1987, China's geology and 
mineral resource department has successively dispatched "Ocean 
No. 4" and "Struggle No. 4" prospecting ships on geological 
survey missions in Nansha waters. The ships completed 
comprehensive geological and geophysical survey plans in Zengmu 
and Wanan basins on four voyages; and conducted 20,000 km 
seismogram and related fathoming, gravity, and magnetic tests, 
obtaining some survey and research results. The Chinese Academy 
of Sciences' South Sea Oceanography Institute also carried out 
some geophysical surveys in the waters. 
  It is understood that a series of Cenozoic sedimentary 
basins 
with different structures and rich oil and natural deposits have 
developed in the Nansha waters. Of these basins, Wanan, Zengmu, 
Wenlai-Shaba, Balawang, and Liyue have the greatest potential. 
The basins falling within China's traditional boundary total 
290,000 sq [square] km in area. Zengmu, a large foreland-type 
Cenozoic sedimentary basin, has developed thick marine 
fragmentary deposits and carbonate deposits. The basin, where 
the thickness of deposits generally ranges from 4,000 to 7,000 
meters with the thickest part reaching 11,000 meters, has 
several fine combinations of oil gas formation and reserve 
covers [you qi sheng chu gai 3111 3049 3932 0328 5556]. So far 
foreign petroleum companies have already discovered and 
exploited some 40 oil gas fields and oil-bearing structures. 
Wanan, a medium-large shearing pull-apart Cenozoic sedimentary 
basin, has also developed thick continental and marine deposits, 
with the thickness generally ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 meters; 
and the basis has several fine combinations of oil gas formation 
and reserve covers, too. During the 1991-92 physical and 
seismic general surveys, China successively discovered 17 large 
and medium partial structural traps. Results of seismic surveys 
conducted on six of the traps last year have laid a fine 
foundation for marine drilling and prospecting in the future.

<F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified XINHUA commentator: "Develop </F>
New Industries, Nurture Modern Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- With the passage of time 
and the development of economic and scientific and technological 
trends worldwide, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's call for "developing 
high technology and achieving industrialization" has revealed 
more and more foresight and strategic vision, especially in the 
two years since the publication of Comrade Xiaoping's speeches 
made during his southern tour. Over the past two years, China's 
scientific and technological undertakings have advanced by leaps 
and bounds. While a stable contingent of scientists are 
devoting themselves to basic science and high-tech research and 
are tackling key scientific and technological projects, a large 
number of research institutes and academies have sent talented 
scientific and technical personnel to various national economic 
sectors to contribute to China's economic construction and to 
push the country to the forefront of international science and 
technology. 
  The prosperity of the nation and the enhancement of the 
overall national strength hinge on scientific and technological 
progress. High tech, represented by electronic information 
technology, new energy technology, biotechnology, and new 
materials technology, is one of the mankind's greatest 
accomplishments in science and technology in the 20th century. 
In recent years, a number of high- tech research projects based 
on the latest scientific achievements have flourished and have 
been quickly transformed into practical productive forces, 
exerting a profound influence on economic and social development 
and becoming the core of overall national strength and the focus 
of international competition. Whoever has an edge in high-tech 
industries holds the initiative in political, economic, 
military, and social development. Because China is currently at 
the crucial stage of developing new and high-tech industries, 
how to develop new industries and energetically nurture modern 
enterprises has become an especially pressing issue. 
  The industrialization of new and high technology and the 
application of advanced science and technology in traditional 
industries are the two major trends in economic development 
today. The establishment of a socialist market system will 
create a very favorable environment for the industrialization of 
new and high technology. Many of China's high-tech enterprises 
have been founded and developed through the support of domestic 
and international markets. The science and technology market, 
which is a major component of the socialist market system, 
includes technology markets, markets of scientific and technical 
personnel, and markets of high-tech products. We should 
cultivate and promote in a selective way the science and 
technology market, which can play a comprehensive role in 
traditional industry, and we should make the market become the 
"incubator" of high-tech enterprises and industries. 
  In developing new industries and nurturing modern 
enterprises, we should use scientific and technological advances 
to tackle difficult and pressing problems in various national 
economic sectors. We should combine overall plans with 
breakthroughs in key areas, closely combine the science and 
technology development plans of the central and local 
governments as well as departments, and concentrate funds and 
talented personnel to tackle key scientific and technological 
engineering projects. We should nurture a new industrial 
pattern before the year 2000 by selecting and concentrating 
efforts on several projects from the "863 Program" which can 
become leading industries and which can exert a significant 
influence on the national economy. 
  In developing new industries and nurturing modern 
enterprises, we should conduct preliminary studies and 
verification of leading new industries targeted by China for the 
next century, so that science and technology can play a visible 
role in readjusting the industrial structure, improving product 
quality, increasing value added, strengthening market 
competitiveness, and raising enterprise efficiency. We should 
attach importance to cultivating several points of growth for 
modern enterprises, such as high-definition television, 
digital-sound broadcasting, optical-fiber visual communication, 
and superintegrated circuits. Science and technology 
departments should adopt various measures to promote the 
commercialization, industrialization, and internationalization 
of high-tech research results by doing everything within their 
capability to introduce new and high technology to large and 
medium enterprises as soon as possible. 
  In view of the formation of new industries and the emergence 
of a growing number of high-tech enterprises with modern 
mechanisms, we should expedite the reform of the science and 
technology management system, strengthen the intensity of the 
reform of scientific research departments, and accelerate the 
implementation of the strategic plan of "holding fast to one end 
and leaving the whole field open." Meanwhile, we should attract 
talented personnel, capital, and key technology and equipment; 
expand scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation 
with foreign countries; and nurture a group of young scientists. 
  Seizing the opportunity to catch up with the advancing pace 
of high tech in the world is a pressing task of China's economic 
development, as well as the inevitable choice for the Chinese 
nation to become stronger in the world.

  [Text] Kunming, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's 
meteorology work has made new progress during the past year in 
medium-range forecasting and artificial influencing of the 
weather, according to meteorological officials attending a 
meeting in this capital of Yunnan province. 
  China's first gigantic computer, the "Yinhe No. 2", is used 
to forecast medium-range weather conditions, so that China has 
become one of the few countries to provide effective weather 
forecasts four to five days ahead. 
  A ground reception system in coordination with the "Fengyun 
No. 2" meteorological satellite has begun to receive and handle 
data from the satellite, the officials said. 
  The feasibility report of an automatic atmosphere monitoring 
system has been drawn up, and a preliminary plan to organize a 
state climatology center has been approved and regional branches 
have gone into operation. 
  Nationwide, 331 remote computer terminal stations had been 
set up by the end of last year, together with 15 ocean 
meteorological stations and 14,750 stations at township level. 
  The central and local meteorological departments also gave 
accurate reports of some disasters last year, such as sand 
storms, typhoons and torrential rains. 
  In addition, the departments made great efforts to aid the 
growing and harvesting of crops, and the handling of plant 
diseases, insect pests, soil conditions, and forest fires. 
  Meanwhile, meteorological departments in 23 provinces and 
autonomous regions induced artificial rain and prevented hail 
over an area of more than two million sq km.

  [Text] Dhaka, February 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today expressed his total 
satisfaction with his four-day official good-will visit to 
Bangladesh. 
  "It is a short-time but a fruitful visit", the Chinese 
foreign minister said, adding his talks here would immensely 
help further develop the close bilateral ties between China and 
Bangladesh. 
  Qian Qichen replied to a volley of questions at a crowded 
press conference here this morning. 
  Replying to a question on "the South Asia nuclear-free 
zone", 
Qian Qichen noted that domestic situations in most South Asian 
countries are now turning to stable. The relations among 
countries of the region have been improving and regional 
cooperations have also been developing, he said. 
  However, the foreign minister said, "there are still some 
destabilizing factors in South Asia. There are still some 
differences among the countries of the region". 
  "We don't want arms race in the region. Because, any arms 
race in South Asia will be no of benefit to peace and stability 
in the region", he said. 
  Qian Qichen noted under the present international situation, 
the security of a country will mainly depend on the economic 
development of the country and that is the conception of 
"economic security". 
  If the developing countries could not achieve their economic 
development and fail in improving the living standard of their 
people, "it will be very difficult for them to have security", 
Qian said. 
  Replying to a question on the improvement of bilateral ties 
between China and India, Qian said Sino-Indian relations were 
developing but made it clear that this should by no means affect 
China's friendly cooperations with other countries of the region. 
  About Bangladesh's share of the water from India, the 
foreign 
minister said it was natural that Bangladesh would ask for its 
rightful share in the waters of the rivers coming through other 
countries. "We hope that the issue could be resolved through 
bilateral discussion and negotiation between India and 
Bangladesh", he added. 
  As regards the Kashmir issue, Qian Qichen stressed that 
"China's position on the issue remained unchanged". China hopes 
that India and Pakistan could settle the dispute left over by 
history through peaceful negotiation taking into account the 
United Nation's resolutions and the relevant agreements reached 
between the two countries.

  [Text] Dhaka, 27 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held a news conference in the 
(Podema) State Guesthouse here today. He answered reporters' 
questions about the international and regional situation and 
China's relations with South Asian nations. 
  Replying to a question on the idea of a nuclear-free zone in 
South Asia, Qian Qichen pointed out: The domestic situations in 
most South Asian countries are stabilizing. The relations among 
countries in the region have been improving, and regional 
cooperation is also being developed. However, there are still 
some destabilizing factors in South Asia. There are still some 
differences among the countries of the region. He said: China 
supports the proposition of a South Asia nuclear-free zone. 
China also hopes that an arms race would not occur in the 
region. An arms race will not benefit peace and stability in 
the region. 
  On Sino-Indian relations, Qian Qichen said: Since the 
normalization of Sino-Indian relations, we have been satisfied 
with the development of bilateral relations. We hold that the 
development of Sino-Indian relations should by no means affect 
China's friendly cooperation with other countries in the region. 
We hope that the development of Sino-Indian relations will aid 
the development of China's cooperative relations with South Asia 
as a whole. 
  Qian Qichen emphasized: Tibet is an inalienable part of 
China's territory, and the Indian Government has more than once 
openly acknowledged this fact. China hopes that India will 
handle some existing questions in accordance with this principle. 
  As regards the Kashmir issue, Qian Qichen said: China's 
policy on the issue remains unchanged. China hopes that India 
and Pakistan can resolve the problem through friendly and 
peaceful negotiations in accordance with the United Nation's 
resolutions and the relevant agreements reached between the two 
countries.

sympathy to the families of the innocent victims," the spokesman

obstacles and create proper conditions for accelerating the 
peace talks in the Middle East, so as to achieve a comprehensive 
peace in that region at an early date," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Cairo, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Friday's [25 
February] killing of Palestinian worshipers in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank has been greeted with anger and 
condemnation throughout the Arab world. 
  Official and media reactions have been very strong since as 
many as more than 60 Palestinians were killed and a lot more 
wounded in a single day, the worst bloodshed since Israel seized 
the Arab lands in 1967. 
  Arab governments and public opinion, Palestinians in 
particular, have held the Israeli Government responsible for the 
massacre. They demanded effective measures be taken to protect 
the Palestinians under Israeli occupation, disarming of Jewish 
settlers and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. 
  In downtown Amman, a huge rally was held today to protest 
against the massacre. Jordanian parliamentarians expressed 
their indignation, saying the appalling crime posed a serious 
challenge to peace in the region. 
  Jordan has also announced a three-day mourning for the 
victims as of today upon the directive of King Husayn. 
  The Palestinian leadership has decided to recall all its 
negotiators in Cairo and Paris for consultations on future 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in the wake of the massacre. 
  In Lebanon, Palestinians closed their refugee camps and 
burnt 
tires today in protest against the massacre. 
  In Beirut's Shatila and al-Burayj refugee camps, Palestinian 
demonstrators carried a coffin draped in the Palestinian flag in 
a symbolic funeral for the victims. 
  In Saudi Arabia, a government spokesman denounced the 
"regrettable incident, which is characterized by extremism, 
fanaticism and non-respect of human rights." 
  Oil-rich gulf newspapers today condemned "the horrible 
massacre." 
  An article in "AL-KHALEEJ," a daily of the United Arab 
Emirates, said the conscience of the world must not skip over 
"the direct responsibility" of the United States for "this 
horrible massacre" since the United States is "the cherisher of 
Israel." 
  In their editorials today, Qatari newspapers called on the 
international community to "inflict on Israel a due punishment 
appropriate to the size of the aforesaid crime," urging 
Palestinian leadership to "suspend negotiations with Israel." 
  The English-language Qatari newspaper "GULF TIMES" said that 
the declaration of principles signed by the Rabin government 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization has not changed 
"Israel's policy of protecting Jewish terrorist settlers." 
  A Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Israeli 
Government should be responsible for the killing since it 
sponsored Jewish settlements inside the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  The spokesman said sheer denunciation is not enough. 
Decisive measures are needed more than ever before to protect 
the Palestinian people. 
  He also said that Kuwait, while offering condolences to the 
Palestinian people, calls for international efforts to ensure 
the rights of the Palestinian people to statehood on their own 
land.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China has decided 
to wipe out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and 
clothing shortages for its existing 80 million poverty-stricken 
citizens, a senior Chinese official announced here today. 
  Speaking at a national conference on poverty reduction, 
State 
Councillor Chen Junsheng said that the ambitious seven-year plan 
includes raising the annual net income of the majority of the 80 
million people to 500 yuan according to 1990 constant prices. 
  According to the plan, China will begin from this year to 
improve infrastructural construction in poor areas, solving 
drinking water shortages for the people and their domestic 
animals, making electricity available to most poor towns and 
connecting remote areas with national or regional road networks. 
  As part of the plan, China will improve the cultural, 
educational and public health levels in backward and poor areas, 
wipe out illiteracy among the young and middle-aged population, 
offer professional training to grown-ups and hold the natural 
population growth rate under the official limit. 
  "The realization of the plan will be of great significance. 
It will mean that the rights to subsistence of the Chinese 
people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population, 
will have been secured," said the state councillor, who is in 
charge of agriculture as well as China's poverty reduction 
efforts. 
  Chen described it as a major event in the history of China 
and a magnificent feat in the history of human development. 
  Most of the 80 million people are distributed throughout 
remote mountainous regions, rocky regions, Loess Plateau areas 
and remote deserts. The regions are characterized by a paucity 
of natural resources and adverse natural environment, such as 
severe shortages in drinking water or cultivable land, which 
make it difficult for local people to produce enough food. 
  Chen said that in order to achieve the poverty reduction 
target, China should reduce the poverty-stricken population by 
an average 11 million each year in the coming seven years, 
nearly twice as quickly as it has done in the past seven years. 
  During the 1986-1992 period, poverty was eased among about 
45 
million poor people, an average of 6.8 million each year. 
  He stressed that the present poverty reduction tasks are 
more 
arduous than ever before, but are achievable, since the current 
conditions are favorable for poverty alleviation. 
  The Chinese leadership has attached great importance to 
poverty reduction, a guarantee of success in the poverty 
elimination cause, he noted. 
  He disclosed that China will increase its investment in poor 
areas and has designated 582 counties as priority targets for 
poverty elimination. 
  The Chinese Government has decided to increase its 
investment 
in the "work for food program" by five billion yuan and in 
discount loans by one billion yuan each year during 1994-2000. 
  In addition, the current reforms in China, including the 
effort to establish a socialist market economy, have provided 
the poor regions with unprecedented chances for economic 
development, the official said. 
  Because of the open policy, many remote, backward inland or 
border regions, which used to be sealed off from the outside 
world, have taken forward positions in China's opening drive and 
opened important trading ports with neighboring countries. 
  The opening drive has promoted economic and trade 
development 
in the poor areas and uplifted the living standards of the 
people. 
  The booming national economy has also created enormous jobs 
for the poor regions, which are rich in labor resources. 
  Last year, the expanding labor market in and outside of 
China 
absorbed about 10 million laborers from sichuan, China's most 
populous province, which earned about 10 billion yuan, Chen told 
the meeting. 
  Thanks to the reform of commodity circulation systems and 
gradual lifting of controls over prices, the poor areas will 
earn much more through exploiting their rich natural resources 
than before. 
  According to statistics from the State Planning Commission, 
China has used about 30 billion yuan worth of industrial goods 
and food to finance development programs in poor regions since 
it launched "the work for food program" a decade ago. 
  During each year of the past decade, the Chinese Government 
itself allocated five billion yuan to poor regions in aid or 
soft loans. 
  China's poor have decreased from 125 million in 1986 to 80 
million in 1992.

<F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Trade Minister Optimistic on Rejoining GATT] </F>
  [Text] The 16th session of the Gatt Working Party on 
China, scheduled for April, is expected to help ease China's 
re-entry into the world trade body, according to the 
government's top trade official. 
  Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation 
(Moftec), said China has virtually met the demands of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 
  Speaking at a ministerial-level seminar in Beijing over the 
weekend, Wu urged different ministries to speed up preparations 
for rejoining Gatt. 
  China should resume its Gatt contracting party status before 
the final package of the Uruguay Round of Gatt agreements -- 
which curb protectionism and expand world trade -- takes effect 
next year. 
  By then, all Gatt members will become founding members of 
the 
World Trade Organization (WTO), the free-trade successor to Gatt. 
  Being a founding member of WTO will benefit China's foreign 
trade, Wu said. 
  The service trade, the investment field and intellectual 
property rights will be major concerns of WTO, Wu said. 
  She added that issues concerning the service trade will be 
key items for discussion at the 16th meeting, to be held in 
Morocco. 
  Compared with the US, 80 per cent of whose trade stems from 
the service sector, China's service industry is still in the 
initial stages. 
  The service trade is included among the conditions for 
China's re-entry into Gatt. Others involve tariffs and 
non-tariff duties. 
  China's re-entry into Gatt will help stabilize its overseas 
markets and help it tap new ones, Wu said. It will also help 
reduce trade discrimination and its regulations on multilateral 
trade will help put developing countries on a more equal footing 
with Western countries. 
  Although rejoining Gatt will challenge some domestic 
industries, Wu said, the government will try to help them. 
  Long Yongtu, a director general in Moftec, said that the 
meeting in Morocco will confirm the rules on reentering Gatt as 
well as on joining the WTO. 
  A WTO administration commission will be set up at the 
meeting, Long said. He added that about 20 countries and 
regions are applying for entry into the world trade body. 
Besides the Chinese mainland, they include Russia, Bulgaria, 
Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. 
  Nearly 40 ministers attended the weekend forum in Beijing. 
The Venezuelan trade minister described Venezuela's entry into 
Gatt and representatives from the United Nations explained the 
influence WTO will have on China. 
  Gatt, together with the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank, are the three pillars of the world economic system. 
The volume of trade among its 115 members accounts for more 
than 90 per cent of the world's total. 
  China, on the other hand, is a fast-rising economic force. 
Its 1993 trade totalled 195.7 billion yuan ($22.5 billion). In 
the past 15 years China has received $60 billion in foreign 
investment and has been one of the fastest growing economies in 
the world.

  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- China's economic 
growth has advanced at double-digit speed for the past two years. 
  The country's inflation rate climbed to 13 percent 
nationwide 
last year. When the central government unveiled its fiscal 
reforms and unified the exchange rate at the start of 1994, it 
declared war against inflation by repeated pledges of tighter 
control on credit and money supply as well as on investment in 
fixed assets. 
  The question is, however, will China's battle against 
inflation be successful? 
  The inflationary pressure is obvious with last year's 1,300 
billion yuan spent on fixed assets, excessive money supply over 
the past few years and the bigger-than-ever stride in price 
reforms in 1993. 
  Meanwhile, higher production costs will force some 
enterprises to raise the prices of their products in order to 
maintain a balanced book. A vicious cycle is thus set. 
  The biggest pressure comes from local enthusiasms to start 
more construction projects, and with last year's projects to be 
continued and new ones started, the central bank faces mounting 
pressure to issue more money. 
  But this year the central government indicates a strong 
determination to fight against inflation. It must do so because 
it wants the economic boom to continue. It also needs a good 
economic and social environment to push ahead reforms in other 
fields, including state enterprises, investment system as well 
as finance. 
  Therefore, the central authorities target this year's growth 
at around 9 percent, hoping to achieve a "soft landing" of some 
kind. 
  Meanwhile, the central bank has repeatedly vowed to keep a 
tighter rein on credit and money supply in the new year. 
According to central bank sources, the total money supply for 
1994 will not exceed last year's level; the increase in bank 
lending will be kept on a par with that of last year, which 
means a reduced rate of credit increase. 
  Recently, a senior official of the central bank disclosed 
that the central bank had no intention of making changes in 
interest rates in the foreseeable future. 
  After two rises in 1993, the interest rate for one-year 
deposits stands at a relatively high level of 10.8 percent. 
  A month earlier, the State Council issued a circular, 
demanding a strict grip on fixed asset investment. It stressed 
that the government would, in principle, not allow new 
construction projects to start this year. 
  Coupled with the State Council's move, the central bank has 
worked out a set of rules for banks across the country to 
follow, which feature tougher conditions for extending loans for 
fixed assets investment. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also 
the central bank governor, told the banks not to provide loans 
to unauthorized projects, while the credit quotas must not 
exceed the planned figure. 
  To reach an understanding between the central government and 
different areas, "keeping the general balance in demand and 
supply while maintaining a relatively high growth" is expected 
to become one of the main points of discussion during the 
National People's Congress due to open on March 10. 
  This year, the government will limit bond issuing by 
localities and enterprises. The securities authorities have 
also banned enterprises from issuing shares to their employees. 
Therefore, all fund-raising activities will become more 
difficult in 1994. 
  As part of reform efforts, starting this year, the state 
treasury deficits can only be made up by issuing state bonds, 
instead of overdrafts from the central bank; the establishment 
of policy-oriented banks will leave little ground for the 
specialized banks to ask for more money supply under the excuse 
of extending loans to state designated projects. Both these 
measures will help reduce the central bank's money supply. 
  Observers here say that in building up a market economy, the 
top leadership is assuming a stronger macro-regulatory role in 
fine-tuning the economy. The successes of last year's 
macro-economic control and the prompt intervention of the 
central government in stabilizing grain prices in December 
proved that the authorities have the will and the means to keep 
the economic development on a right track. 
  Most economists in Beijing expect that the momentum of price 
increases will be gradually reduced when the state 
anti-inflation measures are implemented. 
  Hyper-inflation can be avoided if agriculture enjoys another 
bumper harvest this year and there is no sharp fluctuation in 
the renminbi exchange rate, economists agree. 
  "The central government's anti-inflation efforts will have 
paid off if the year-round inflation rate can be contained 
within 12 percent in 1994," analysts said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Last year saw new 
progress in implementing the policy of reform and opening to the 
world, marked by a continuous national economic growth and 
improvement in people's living standards. 
  This was stated by Zhang Sai, director-general of the State 
Statistics Bureau, at a press conference focusing on a 
communique on the 1993 national economic and social development. 
  According to the official, the country's gross domestic 
product (GDP) last year reached 3,000 billion yuan, an increase 
of 736 billion yuan, or 13.4 percent over the 1992 figure at 
comparable prices. 
  This was the highest annual growth since 1985, Zhang said. 
  The output of key industrial and agricultural products was 
all-time high and the infrastructure facilities were improved 
further, thus creating favorable conditions for the sustained 
development of the national economy, he added. 
  Zhang also said that in 1993, China's scientific and 
technological capabilities continued expanding, and that the 
foreign exchange reserves increased. 
  On people's living standards, he noted that in 1993, 
household income registered further increase. 
  The per capita income of urban residents that could be used 
as living expenses was 2,337 yuan, and the per capita income of 
rural residents was 921 yuan, a real growth of 10.2 percent and 
3.2 percent, respectively, if the increase in prices was 
excluded. 
  The living conditions in both urban and rural areas further 
improved, Zhang said, noting that 266 million square meters of 
new housing were completed in urban areas and another 570 
million square meters of new houses were built in the 
countryside. 
  The scope of household consumption widened. Following 
possession of durable goods such as refrigerators, color TV 
sets, VCRs and hi-fi systems, some families were targeting 
telephones and automobiles as new items of consumption, Zhang 
said. 
  By the end of 1993, he continued, private telephone 
subscribers had reached 7.826 million, 3.672 million more than a 
year ago. Seven percent of the urban households had installed 
telephones. Pagers and mobile telephones were becoming 
increasingly popular. 
  On China's economic reforms, he noted that in 1993, reforms 
that focused on the establishment of a socialist market economy 
developed in depth. 
  The official cited progress in the rural reforms and reforms 
of the state-owned enterprises, the labor and wage system, the 
social security system, the housing system, the macro-economic 
regulation system and the pricing system. 
  Major breakthroughs were made in two aspects, he said. 
  On the one hand, the price system was straightened out, and 
this helped raise the unduly low prices of basic products and 
infrastructure facilities and promote the formation of market 
mechanisms. 
  On the other, while breaking away with the traditional means 
of macroeconomic regulation, experiments were made in using 
various regulatory approaches at proper timing with appropriate 
strength. Positive results were made and good experiences 
accumulated as a result. 
  In 1993, Zhang said, China continued its opening policy in a 
comprehensive, in-depth and multi-facet way. Foreign trade 
further expanded, with improved structure of import and export. 
  The utilization of foreign capital registered significant 
increase, and new record was set both in the number of new 
contracts signed for using foreign capital and in the value of 
foreign capital actually used, he said. 
  The official also noted what he called "noticeable progress" 
made in economic and technical cooperation with foreign 
countries and in international tourism. 
  According to Zhang, major problems that remained in China's 
economic performance included: a decline of living standards 
for some households as a result of the high price increases, two 
large a scale of the investment in fixed assets under 
construction, and failure of the development of basic industries 
and the infrastructure to meet the requirements of the high 
economic growth. 
  In summary, Zhang said, the economic development in 1993 was 
encouraging, and new changes took place in all fields, thus 
creating favorable conditions for implementing the guideline for 
1994 economic work -- seizing the opportunity, deepening the 
reforms, widening the opening of China to the outside world, 
accelerating development while maintaining stability.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- A working 
conference on organizational work of the Communist Party of 
China (CPC) held last week called on party committees at all 
levels to make investigations and strengthen macro-guidance to 
help a smooth shift to the market economy. 
  Lu Feng and Zhao Zongnai, the head and deputy head of the 
Organizational Department of the Central Committee of CPC 
addressed the conference, which was held in Wuxi in East China's

Department, was convened to explore effective solutions in 
organizational work for problems appearing in the current reform 
drive, so as to guarantee the country's economic development and 
social ability. 
  Lu said that leading bodies should have a clear 
understanding 
of their roles under present conditions and should further 
emancipate the mind to deepen the reform of the personnel system. 
  He stressed that making investigations and studying and 
strengthening macro-guidance are fundamental to enhancing 
efficiency and improving work-style in the field. 
  Lu urged leading officials to be bold in carrying out reform 
and to be realistic in conducting investigations and study in 
order to find practical solutions. He also urged them to put 
stress on problems waiting for immediate resolution. 
  In his speech, Zhao hoped that leading bodies will transform 
the findings from investigations and study into regulations, 
rules and concrete measures. 
  He reaffirmed that the main task in the field is to offer an 
organizational guarantee for the establishment of the 
market-oriented economy.

such as Jiangsu, Shanghai and Beijing, introduced their work 
experience. And the conference participants also set new tasks 
for themselves there.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baihua] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- President of the 
Bank of China [BOC] Wang Xuebing here today described the 
unification of RMB [renminbi] exchange rates as successful and 
predicted that there would be no drastic changes in the yuan's 
rate in the foreseeable future. 
  "Everything has been going smoothly since the unification of 
yuan exchange rates at the start of this year," said Wang, who 
took the post as the top leader of the country's biggest foreign 
exchange dealer two months ago. 
  The bank's business in foreign exchange settlement has not 
been affected by the unification. Hard currency earners, most 
of which are foreign trade firms, have sold all their foreign 
exchange certificates (FEC) to the bank according to state 
regulations. 
  "The working capital of foreign exchange in our bank has 
remained stable," said Wang. 
  The first quarter of 1994 is supposed to be the transitional 
period for China's foreign exchange control system to convert 
from the old to the new. During this period, the Bank of China 
is under instruction to withdraw FEC and set up a special 
records file for enterprises to register the amounts in hard 
currency earnings they sell to the bank. 
  Wang declined to say the amount of fec withdrawn by the bank 
so far, but hinted that through spending and exchanging them for 
U.S. dollars, it will not take long before the special banknotes 
are completely withdrawn by the bank. 
  With eight years of experience as BOC branch chief in London 
and then in New York, the 42-year-old Wang is well-known for his 
expertise in gold and foreign exchange trading. 
  The unification of yuan exchange rates has not caused big 
rises or falls in the rate so far. Wang expects the present 
8.7:1 exchange rate to remain stable in the foreseeable future. 
  "China's overall economic growth is healthy, foreign trade 
keeps increasing and the government is stepping up efforts to 
control inflation. All these are favorable for the yuan to stay 
stable," said Wang. 
  To pave the way for the second stage of foreign exchange 
reform, or the operation of the new system which will start as 
of April 1, said Wang, the Bank of China is improving its RMB 
clearing system and mobilizing required amounts of capital funds 
in both Chinese yuan and hard currencies. 
  In responding to clients' growing awareness of risks, the 
bank has set about establishing a quotation system for future 
yuan trading, Wang disclosed.

  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- A number of 
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), China's 
legislature, today expressed satisfaction with the operation of 
China's new tax system, instituted at the beginning of the year. 
  NPC Standing Committee Vice-Chairmen Chen Muhua, Buhe, Li 
Peiyao and Wu Jieping, together with deputies, listened to a 
report by Jin Xin, deputy director of the State Taxation 
Administration, on the reform of the tax system. 
  Jin described the tax reform as a "major measure" to 
facilitate the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure in China and an important part of the country's 
overall economic restructuring. 
  The reform is designed not to decrease government revenues 
or 
increase tax burdens of businesses because it entails the 
readjustment of the tax structure, he told the deputies. 
  A number of businesses will bear heavier tax burdens as a 
result of the reform, he said. 
  These businesses are required to offset the adverse effects 
of the reform by transforming their operational mechanism, 
tapping their production potential and increasing their economic 
returns, he said. 
  Moreover, the government has formulated and is preparing to 
formulate necessary measures to help these businesses offset the 
adverse effects, he added. 
  Jin Xin also assured the deputies that the new value-added 
tax and consumption tax collected following the tax reform will 
not result in price rises because they involve only a change in 
the type of previously existing taxes. 
  The new tax system will also improve the government's 
capabilities to exercise macro-economic controls, while 
eliminating the previous excessive tax exemptions and 
reductions, he said. 
  The director said: "The new tax system has been operating 
successfully and normally over the past two months, without 
causing sharp rises in commodity prices." 
  The new system has not produced any adverse effects on 
production and circulation, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China's securities 
authorities today overruled a Shanghai share-holding company's 
plan to turn part of the "A" shares it has issued to foreign 
investors into "B" shares. 
  "No such transformation of shares will be permitted until a 
relevant policy is worked out," said a spokesman of the China 
Securities Regulatory Committee (CSRC) at a press conference 
here today. 
  Stocks issued by Chinese firms fall into two categories: A 
shares for domestic investors and B shares for overseas 
investors. The two kinds of shares are traded at different 
markets and follow different trading rules. 
  The CSRC spokesman said that the board of "Dazhong" Taxi 
Company obviously has little knowledge about state securities 
policies. 
  He said that opening "A" shares to foreigners means both the 
sell-out of state property rights and the merger of the two 
kinds of shares, which is something "under serious consideration 
of the authorities," and if so, requires amendment of the 
current laws and regulations on stock market monitoring. 
  "A grassroots company has no right to make the decision 
without state permission," the spokesman said. 
  He said that a tentative distribution plan for the 5.5 
billion yuan worth of nationwide stocks to be issued for 1994 
has been made. 
  Timing of the issuance will be flexible and will depend upon 
the conditions of enterprises as well as the capacity of the 
stock market to absorb the new stocks, he said. 
  According to the spokesman, it is very likely that part of 
the stock issuance will be postponed until next year.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The China 
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) today expressed 
satisfaction over the experiment for the first group of domestic 
enterprises to issue stocks on the Hong Kong market. 
  Nie Qingping, vice-director of the international department 
of CSRC, said that the issuance and transaction of "H" shares 
were "satisfying". 
  Last year, China securities authorities approved nine large 
domestic enterprises to issue stocks in Hong Kong. So far six 
of them have been listed in the Hong Kong market. 
  Nie said that the six "H" shares were warmly welcomed when 
issued. Demands for each one far exceeded the planned issuance. 
  The required number of stocks of Qingdao beer, Maanshan 
steel 
and Shanghai petrochemical were about 110 times, 68 times and 
1.77 times the originally planned amount of issuance. 
  Transaction of "H" shares was encouragingly active in the 
Hong Kong market. The daily transaction volume of "H" shares 
occupied about one-tenth of the total. The present prices of 
"H" shares are averaging 50 percent increases over issuing 
prices. 
  Despite the undulating wave overshadowing the Hong Kong 
market recently, "H" shares maintained an upward trend. The 
average price earning ratio (per) of "H" shares now stands at 25 
percent. 
  Nie Qingping attributed the success to overseas investors' 
confidence in China's fast-growing economy. 
  "They want to share the benefits yielded by China's opening 
to the outside world and economic development, through investing 
in "H" shares," Nie said. 
  According to him, overseas investors were also encouraged by 
strict checking and supervision of listed companies. 
  Nie also disclosed that so far the seventh batch of "H" 
shares -- for the Jiangsu Yizheng chemical fiber company -- are 
promoting sales of stocks worldwide. The company plans to issue 
one billion Hong Kong dollars worth of "H" shares.

<F P=106> [By Yang Hong (2799 4767): "Prevent Power From Invading the </F>
Market"] 
  [Text] Speaking in terms of essence, power is not a 
commodity, and does not have the content and feature of a 
commodity, therefore, it cannot enter the market as a commodity. 
But in some localities the "real text" of a socialist market 
economy has been distorted, and there are frequent phenomena of 
various powers entering the market. For example, some local 
government departments change themselves into companies, 
corporations, or enterprise groups, while their original staff 
and functions remain unchanged. They then take over the rights 
and interests from their subordinate enterprises. Some 
departments, which posses power in certain areas, claim that 
they are "going to the sea" and "running entities," but what 
they are actually doing is monopolizing and doing business 
through power. The exchange of power for money has spread to 
notes of approval, documents of approval, loans, taxation, 
examination of goods, and buying and selling of land, and some 
persons used money to buy power, then used the power to make 
money, and in this way they quickly earned tens-of-thousands of 
yuan, hundreds-of-thousands of yuan, or even millions of yuan. 
Some localities abused power in setting up barriers to block 
others who wanted to do business, or stop the sales of local 
products to other markets. Power's invasion of the market has 
brought about a series of negative effects: 
  1. It contradicts the law of market competition, and hinders 
fair competition in the market. Competition is the basic 
feature and demand of the market economy, but competition must 
be conducted under equal status, law, tax burden, loan, and 
interest rate. No unfair competition is allowed by the market 
economy. The entering of power into the market will cause a 
kind of unfair competition, because some people, with their 
power, may obtain special consideration, light tax burdens, good 
loans, and high profits. Therefore, when power enters the market 
as a commodity, it will lose its fairness, as well as its 
qualification for and ability of guiding, cultivating, and 
managing the market. 
  2. It destroys the balance in economic structure, and 
disrupts the order of economic operation. In any country, 
economic development should rest on structural balance which is 
on an orderly basis. When power enters the market, it will 
interfere in the regulation of economic operation by the law of 
value, the law of competition, and the law of supply and demand. 
It will hinder the implementation of the principle of a legal 
system, the principle of distribution, and the principle of 
taxation system, and it will affect the arrangement of resources 
and lead to chaos in the market. 
  3. It weakens the functions of laws, rules, and regulations. 
The market economy has a legal system as a precondition; the 
main body of economy participating in the market should be 
managed and supervised by legal system, and the operational 
order of market economy should be standardized and maintained by 
legal system, while the state's macroregulation and control of 
the market should also be recognized and guaranteed by the legal 
system. Once power enters the market, and especially when the 
power of law enforcement organs enters the market to the extent 
that those who know the law and enforce the law break the law, 
then the state's laws and regulations will be relentlessly 
trampled upon to the extent that they lose the authoritativeness 
they should have, and consequently market economy cannot operate 
normally. 
  4. It undermines the building of party work style and 
clean-government building, and causes the emergence and 
spreading of corruption. Power is nothing more than a duty of 
serving the public entrusted to someone by the state and people. 
Once it enters the market, it will become the tool for pursuing 
private interests of individuals and groups, leading to the 
corrupt phenomena of bribery, corruption, abuse of power, 
exchange of power and money, the running of businesses with 
power, and assisting business with power. 
  5. It distorts government behavior and misguides the process 
of government organ reform. When power enters the market, it 
will not play the function of promoting government organ reform, 
but will play the function of degenerating the process. For 
example, when "renamed companies" enter the market as power, 
they do so not to streamline organs which should be separated 
from the government, they enable these organs to be preserved 
lawfully in the name of "enterprise," "company," and "group." 
This not only distorts government behavior, but also guides 
government organ reform in an erroneous way. 
  In order to ensure a healthy development of socialist market 
economy, we must take forceful measures to stop power from being 
changed into a commodity for entering the market. 
  First, deepen the reform of government organs, and practice 
"self stripping" of quite a large portion of power from 
government departments. Under the old system of planned 
economy, which was characterized by a high degree of 
centralization, government departments relied on administrative 
orders and mandatory plans to manage the economy through 
allocating funds, materials, and projects. The government not 
only took charge of macroeconomic matters, but also took charge 
of microeconomic matters. It not only carried out indirect 
management, but also carried out direct management, and it did 
not give enterprises decisionmaking power, but viewed 
enterprises simply as subsidiary organs. This did not meet the 
demand of the market economy. 
  From now on in government 
organ reform, we should practice "self stripping" of certain 
power from government departments and, according to the demands 
of the socialist market economy, change from direct management 
to indirect management, change from micromanagement to 
macromanagement, and change from allocating funds, materials, 
and projects to using economic levers and engaging in planning, 
coordination, supervision, and service, so that we can 
resolutely give the power and right which originally belonged to 
enterprises back to enterprises. 
  Second, strengthen legislation and law enforcement, and give 
appropriate restraint to power. Why has power's invasion of the 
market become so rampant? It involves the question of 
restraining power which invades the market. To give restraint, 
there has to be just legislation and strict law enforcement. 
For example, enterprise law, company law, competition law, 
securities law, transaction law, taxation law, planning law, 
auditing law, budget law, banking law, investment law, foreign 
trade law, law governing foreign-funded enterprises, individual 
economy law, private economy law, joint-venture economy law, law 
on management of state assets, law on protecting the rights and 
interests of consumers, law against undue competition, and so 
on, are the laws which we should have. However, we still lack 
many such laws, and although some laws have been formulated, 
they are not perfect, to the extent that in some localities and 
domains, power has invaded the market and disrupted the order of 
economy, but nothing can be done according to law. In addition, 
our law enforcement is not strict enough, and there have been 
frequent phenomena of replacing law with power, replacing law 
with words, and giving light treatment to serious infringements. 
Inadequate legislation and slackened law enforcement means 
loopholes for power to invade the market. A new order of 
socialist market economy can really be established when there is 
no loophole. 
  Third, change the planned economy system to the market 
economy system as soon as possible, and solve problems by the 
change of system. Analyzed from the viewpoint of theory, we may 
say that under a completely centralized planned management 
system, there cannot be any bureaucrat-businessmen, because 
under such conditions there can only be bureaucrats, no 
businessmen. In a healthy and perfect market economy system, 
bureaucrat-businessmen also do not exist, because when they 
pursue private benefits they will at the same time infringe upon 
the property rights of certain persons and violate certain laws. 
Bureaucrat-businessmen are the outcome of a kind of 
semiplanned, semimarket, semi-open, and semirestricted economy. 
They have emerged under the "double-track system" and through 
"fishing in the troubled waters." Therefore, to eliminate 
bureaucrat-businessmen, we cannot rely only on administrative 
orders, meetings, documents, and even rectification campaigns. 
The problem can only be solved by realizing a thorough 
transformation from the planned economy system to the market 
economy system as fast as possible. 
  Fourth, wipe out money fetishism and power fetishism, and 
eliminate the subconsciousness of power invading the market. 
The most direct reason power has so enthusiastically entered 
the market comes from the tremendous magic power produced by the 
exchange of power and money, whereas the catalyst and 
subconsciousness produced by this kind of magic power are money 
fetishism and power fetishism. At present, money worship and 
power worship among some people cannot get worse. "When you 
have money you can order a ghost to push the millstone, when you 
have money you can order a ghost to sing a song," and this has 
already become the basic sense and "golden rule" among some 
people. Therefore, to prevent power from invading the market, 
we must resolutely do two kinds of work simultaneously and, as 
we vigorously carry out reform and opening up, promote socialist 
spiritual civilization construction. We must eliminate the 
influence of money fetishism and power fetishism, establish the 
correct outlook on power and money, and build a mental Great 
Wall preventing power from invading the market.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China has seen good 
progress in the implementation of the joint-stock system. 
  So far, over 13,000 enterprises have adopted the new system, 
with more than 208.6 billion yuan in stock capital and some 25 
million shareholders. 
  Statistics show that these firms are located in 30 
provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities in the country. The three 
provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang and Sichuan have over 800 such 
companies each, and Henan, Hubei and Jiangsu Provinces have more 
than 600 each. The Tibet Autonomous Region has set up four such 
enterprises, with a total stock capital of 200 million yuan. 
  So far, 122 shareholding companies have floated stocks on 
the 
market, mostly in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, 
and the provinces of Liaoning, Jiangsu and Guangdong.

  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- China has decided 
to try out capital structure optimization in 16 selected cities 
in a bid to boost the strength of state owned enterprises. 
  The 16 cities are Tianjin, Shanghai, Tangshan, Taiyuan, 
Shenyang, Changchun, Qiqihar, Changzhou, Bengbu, Qingdao, Zibo, 
Wuhan, Zhuzhou, Liuzhou, Chengdu and Baoji. The state 
enterprises in these cities make up more than 22.7 percent and 
their combined output value accounts for 20 percent of the 
national total. 
  The purpose of the experiment is to seek new ways and new 
methods for revitalizing state enterprises, including the 
introduction of comprehensive reform measures and concentrating 
efforts on solving knotty problems. 
  The reform measures include the enforcement of the 
Bankruptcy 
Law, the establishment of property market to realize 
optimization of capital reserves, the establishment of labor 
markets, the perfection of the social insurance system and the 
solution of such problems as irrational burdens. 
  The state enterprises will be allowed to adopted various 
measures to increase working capital and meanwhile, the central 
departments and local governments will make joint efforts to 
help enterprises increase the capital of the enterprises and 
solve the funds deficiency problem. 
  The goal is to enable state enterprises to complete the 
shifting of operational mechanisms by the end of 1995, enter the 
market and participate in competition.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Agriculture Bank Due To Split Into Two </F>
Entities"] 
  [Text] The central government will split the Agricultural 
Bank of China into two institutions despite its phenomenal 
growth. 
  Ma Yongwei, president of the bank, said his bank will become 
two banks later this year in accordance with the government's 
call to separate the functions of government mandated 
agricultural loans and commercial lending. 
  Ma said the split of his bank's business will not hurt 
future 
development. 
  The two banks will be the Agricultural Development Bank and 
a 
new Agricultural Bank of China, the president said. 
  Ma said it plans to vigorously develop its commercial 
business in foreign countries this year. 
  The Agricultural Bank of China will soon establish two 
offices in Tokyo and Hong Kong to strengthen its presence in 
areas where the bank's major partners are located. 
  It also plans to found three branches in New York, Hong Kong 
and Singapore and issue corporate bonds in Western financial 
markets this year. The move will further involve the 
Agricultural Bank of China in foreign financial markets. 
  The Agricultural Bank of China's split follows the 
government's decision to forbid State policy banks from 
providing commercial loans. 
  Beginning this summer, the Agricultural Development Bank 
will 
fulfill the government's policy of supplying subsidized loans to 
farmers. 
  The granting of long-term, low-interest loans to farmers 
will 
remain a fundamental function of the government, according to 
bank officials. They noted that the 15-year-old economic reform 
has raised farmers living standards substantially. 
  Bank analysts said the creation of the Agricultural 
Development Bank is part of the government's efforts to back 
agriculture while encouraging banks to do their business 
according to commercial practices. 
  They noted many villages still remain undeveloped.

  [Text] Hefei, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The most promising 
economic growth area in the world is the Asian-Pacific region in 
the 21st century, and that in China is the Chang Jiang River 
valley, according to Chinese economists. 
  This was the consensus of opinion of noted economists from 
Beijing, Shanghai and seven provinces along the Chang Jiang 
River who gathered in this capital of Anhui Province to study 
the position, role in economic development and strategic 
objective of the valley. 
  The Chang Jiang River valley has a population of 450 million 
and its gross product accounts for 40 percent of the country's 
total. 
  According to the economists, the central government should 
continuously bring into play the role of the coastal areas in 
economic development while focusing on building economic belts 
along the Chang Jiang River Valley, which has a dense 
population, rich natural resources, convenient transportation 
facilities and a vast potential market. 
  The economists suggested that development of the Chang Jiang 
River valley should concentrate on Pudong, a newly-established 
economic zone that is expected to lead in the transformation of 
Shanghai's industrial and financial sectors, and then tap the 
advantages of localities so as to update the product mix.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China plans to 
borrow 1.076 billion U.S. dollars of foreign loans to build a 
huge water conservancy project designed to generate power and 
control flood of the Yellow River [Huang He]. 
  Work on the Xiaolangdi project, a site on the Yellow River 
40 
km north of Luoyang City in Henan Province, will start later 
this year, according to a Water Conservancy Ministry official. 
  Vice-Minister of Water Conservancy Zhang Chunyuan said that 
about 1.2 billion yuan has been spent on the preparation of the 
project in the past two years, involving 10,000 construction 
workers. 
  The foreign loans will be part of the total expenditure. 
However, Water Conservancy Ministry officials declined to give 
the total budget for the huge project. 
  Deng Shengming, deputy chief engineer of the Yellow River 
Conservancy Commission, said today that the project, which has a 
designed total capacity of 12.56 billion c.m. [cubic meters], 
will be able to control the largest flood to occur in 1,000 
years. Nearly 100 million people will be freed from all 
devastating flood threats caused by the river. 
  At present, the river dyke can only resist a flood of a size 
forecast to occur once every 60 years. 
  The project, to be completed in nine years, will help 
control 
the ice jams which occur every year downstream during the ice 
break-up and reduce the severe aggradation of the river bed 
along the lower reaches, the engineer said. 
  In addition, it will provide water for industry, as well as 
irrigation and produce hydro-electric energy along the lower 
reaches.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Zheng Guomin, a peasant from </F>
Wanghuangdi, by Che Shujue (6508 2885 3778): "A Conversation 
With Zheng Guomin, a Leading Grain-Grower." First paragraph is 
editor's note] 
  [Text] Editor's note: With the development of social 
productive forces, new conflicts and problems in rural areas 
constantly arise. On the one hand, hundreds of millions of 
peasants have successfully created a lot of fresh experiences so 
that these conflicts can be settled. But on the other hand, 
real help given by government departments is also badly needed 
to settle these new conflicts and problems. Over the past few 
years the Central Party Committee and the State Council worked 
out many new policies on the basis of practical experience 
achieved by hundreds of millions of peasants so as to guide the 
ever-deepening rural reform and to make constant progress in 
developing the rural economy. However, it is not easy to 
implement these policies because it is necessary for various 
localities to further refine them, to work out concrete methods 
for implementation in line with local conditions, and to do a 
lot of work for implementation. This article reflects such a 
situation, and comrades engaging in rural work are advised to 
read it. The central authorities have formulated a policy of 
principle on the issue of transferring contracted farmland, but 
obviously, various localities must do a lot of painstaking work 
on its implementation. 
  Zheng Guomin is a peasant from Wanghuangdi village in 
Gushanzi Town, Tiefa City, Liaoning Province. Over the past 
five years, he consistently cultivated over 100 mu of farmland 
and was considered a leading grain-grower in his village, and 
his living standard was counted as relatively comfortable. A 
few days ago this writer went to his home for investigation and 
recorded the conversation with him so that comrades being 
enthusiastic in rural work can think about it. 
  [Che Shujue] I have heard that you are a leading 
grain-grower of this village. How much land do you cultivate? 
How about the benefit? 
  [Zheng Guomin] Over the past few years, I cultivated 130 mu 
of farmland every year. There are two other households which 
are similar to mine. I have 36 mu of self-responsible farmland 
[zi jia ze ren tian 5261 1367 6307 0177 3944], 36 mu of farmland 
allotted by the village, 51 mu of contracted farmland 
transferred from five households, and seven mu of wasteland. 
These plots of land are basically for raising wheat and corn, 
the average per mu yield is 650 kg -- which is a high yield in 
this village -- and the net per mu income is over 100 yuan. 
Last year I built this two-story house and spent more than 
50,000 yuan, which was all earned by farming. 
  [Che] Which households transferred their contracted farmland 
to you? How did they transfer it? 
  [Zheng] Some of the five households are working in coal 
mines (the Xiaonan Coal Mine is near here), some are doing 
business, and others are school teachers and correspondents in 
towns. Regarding the method of transferring contracted land, I 
contract it and bargain for the price once a year. I give 
approximately 75 to 100 kg of grain per mu, whereas I bear all 
the expenses on the land. 
  [Che] How many workers and animals does your family have? 
  [Zheng] My family has five members and two are engaged in 
farm work. I am now 55 years' old and I have an 18-year-old 
daughter, and we are the ones who work on the farmland. I have 
three horses and a cart. I hire casual laborers in the busy 
season. It is not a problem to work on these plots of farmland. 
  [Che] Do you apply manure or chemical fertilizer to your 
farmland? 
  [Zheng] I mainly rely on chemical fertilizer. Chemical 
fertilizer is too expensive and prices are soaring, but I still 
have to use it. I do not have enough manure to use, so I can 
only apply manure to my self-responsible farmland, but I cannot 
use it in contracted land transferred from others. Moreover, I 
only contract land from others once a year. I do not know whose 
farmland I will contract next year. 
  [Che] How many people in your village go to other places for 
work? How about their income? How do they cultivate their 
farmland? 
  [Zheng] As far as male laborers of our village are 
concerned, over 200 of them go to work in coal mines throughout 
the year, and each earns 300 to 400 yuan a month. Since most of 
them do not give up their farmland, their wives and children at 
home are engaged in farming. The yields are not high but merely 
for their daily consumption. They also want to transfer their 
contracted farmland to others, but they feel that the return of 
75 kg of grain per mu is still not good enough. Moreover, a 
more important reason is that they worry that the transfer of 
contracted farmland in private will not last long. They want to 
transfer their contracted farmland to others for a longer 
period, but they worry that people like me, who take over the 
contracted farmland, will not always do so. I also think of 
contracting their farmland for a longer period, but I do not do 
so for fear of policy changes from this year to that year. Hey! 
We fear this or that, just like "using a hemp stalk to hit a 
wolf." 
  [Che] According to your capability and the situation of your 
village, can you still contract more farmland? 
  [Zheng] Sure I can! There is a lot of farmland which I can 
contract, but as I have already said, I worry about policy 
changes. Actually, the more farmland I can cultivate, the more 
it pays. Let me figure it. If I cultivate 50 mu of farmland, I 
cannot earn much after deducting the cost, expenses, and human 
and animal feeds. But if I cultivate more than 50 mu, the more 
I cultivate, the more it pays. I have said before that I can 
earn 100 yuan per mu in farming, but this is the case only if I 
cultivate 50 mu of farmland, which means that the net profit of 
working on a mu will exceed 100 yuan if I cultivate more 
farmland. This year, if grain prices soar again, I think it 
will pay more in the days to come if more farmland is cultivated. 
  [Che] As you have only a cart, is it possible to cultivate 
more land? 
  [Zheng] A cart certainly will not work. I must buy a 
tractor if I have 200 to 300 mu of land to cultivate. If this 
was a common practice long ago, I would have bought a tractor 
first rather than building this small house. Even if no one 
drives the tractor, I will let my daughter try it.

<F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>
  [Text] The partial deregulation of China's grain industry 
is receiving a favorable response across the country. CRI 
[China Radio International] correspondent (Li Gengxian) reports 
from Zhengzhou, capital city of central China's Henan Province. 
Their large-scale grain wholesale market there is playing a 
pioneer role in the burgeoning price reform. Here is Du Lijun 
with the story: 
  [Du Lijun] The price of farm products has long been under 
strict government control. Under this system, the local 
governments bought grain from farmers and sold it to the rural 
residents at fixed low prices. Farmers did not feel motivated 
to do their job well because there was no profit incentive. In 
central China's Henan Province, the bread basket of the country, 
farmers have wished for grain price reform for a long time. 
Finally, a new grain wholesale market with no preset price 
control has been set up. Grain and edible oils can be bought and 
sold at real market value. The Zhengzhou grain wholesale market 
is the first and only trial market of its kind which has been 
approved by the State Council. It has been co-organized by the 
Ministry of Internal Trade and the Henan provincial government. 
  Our correspondent (Li Gengxian) said that since the market 
opened its doors in 1990, great economic and social benefits 
have been achieved. It has over 380 network members in 24 of 
China's provinces and municipalities. They study market demand 
in order to coordinate grain distribution throughout the 
country. By the end of last year, about 4 million tonnes of 
grain and edible oil had been traded. Trade volume in the new 
market has reached 3.5 billion yuan, or about $410 million. 
Open and fair competition defines the spirit of the Zhengzhou 
wholesale market. The grain price settled on among buyers and 
sellers here is a good source of information for foreign grain 
market observers. 
  (Li Gengxian) said that because of the success of the 
wholesale market, the Zhengzhou Commodities Exchange made it 
stable in May of last year. It is the first farm and subsidies 
future in China. [sentence as heard] During the second half of 
last year, the futures market signed more than 1 million 
standard contracts at a total volume of 3 billion yuan. At the 
same time, transaction rules and management at the exchange 
center have improved. 
  The commodity exchange is now automated to enable more 
efficient trading. Each day, the exchange center delivers 
information to the world through the ASSOCIATED PRESS and 
REUTERS news agencies, as well as the China Broadcasting 
Communications Company. The grain futures exchange center is 
also building strong business links with its foreign 
counterparts in the United States, Japan, and Canada. The quick 
development of the Zhengzhou grain wholesale market and futures 
exchange center is another door opened for China's rapidly 
growing economy. [end Du Lijun recording]

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- China has 
decided to raise the cotton procurement price by a large margin 
as of 1 September 1994 when newly harvested cotton is to be sold 
on the market. The price for standard ginned cotton is to be 
raised from 330 yuan to about 400 yuan per 50 kg. In addition, 
some cotton producing provinces also will introduce some other 
preferential measures to encourage peasants to grow cotton. 
  Cotton output slumped in 1993 owing to natural disasters and 
other factors. Statistics by the end of January this year 
indicate that the country's total cotton procurement was only 67 
percent of the procurement for the same period last year. 
Hebei, Shandong, and Henan -- the major cotton producing 
provinces of China the cotton output of which used to account 
for half of the country's total cotton output -- witnessed the 
greatest decrease margin in cotton production which has directly 
affected the country's cotton procurement as a whole. 
  To ease the grim situation in cotton production and 
marketing, and to encourage peasants to grow cotton, the state 
now has decided to raise the cotton procurement price by about 
21 percent this year, in addition to the 10-percent price rise 
last year. Meanwhile, the amount of subsidies to cotton growers 
also will be increased appropriately to make up the price 
difference between parity and the negotiated prices for chemical 
fertilizers and diesel oil. This will be another round of 
substantial raises in the cotton procurement price in China 
after a series of price rises over the past few years since 1988.

<F P=106> ["Anhui Sets All-Time Records in Agricultural Production, </F>
Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Side Occupations, and Fishery"] 
  [Text] In 1993 the socialist market economy was vigorously 
developed and the production structure further adjusted in 
Anhui's vast rural areas. As a result, the rural economy 
registered significant progress. According to statistical data, 
1993 was a year of rapid development since the beginning of 
reform and opening up. With the exception of cotton, of which 
the output was about the same as the previous year, outputs of 
grain, oil-bearing crops, aquatic products, cocoons, meat 
products, and eggs set all-time records. Village and town 
enterprises as well as forestry production also registered great 
progress. 
  Agriculture: The outputs of principal agricultural products 
all increased steadily. The outputs of grain, edible oil, and 
cocoons set all-time records. According to an estimate, the 
total output of grain in 1993 was 25.4 billion kg, increasing by 
8.46 percent over 1992 and exceeding the previous high of 25.2 
billion kg in 1990. The total output of edible oil was 31.33 
million dan [1 dan equals 50 kg], increasing by 11.86 percent 
over 1992 and exceeding the previous high of 30.21 million dan 
in 1987. The total output of cocoons was 32,300 dan, increasing 
by 13.3 percent over 1992. The peasants increased economic 
efficiency as well as their income. According to estimates, the 
total agricultural output value for the entire province totaled 
41.7 billion yuan (based on 1990 constant price), an increase of 
8.47 percent or 3.3 billion yuan over the previous year. The 
average cash income of peasants could reach 670 yuan, an 
increase of 16.9 percent or 97 yuan over the previous year. 
Agricultural markets also developed rapidly, with more fine 
quality products. The problem of structural surplus of 
agricultural products was solved. The total acreage of farmland 
sown for fine quality rice totaled 9.31 million mu. 
Experimental agriculture also developed in depth. 
  Animal husbandry and fishery: According to estimates, the 
total output value of animal husbandry in the entire province 
could total 9.77 billion yuan, an increase of 10 percent over 
the previous year, accounting for 23.4 percent of the total 
agricultural output value. The quantities of pigs, cattle, 
sheep, poultry, and eggs increased by 3.7 percent, 15.7 percent, 
2.9 percent, 12.7 percent, and 0.5 percent over those of the 
previous year respectively. Animal husbandry in 1993 had three 
special characteristics: 1) stress was laid on developing 
grain-saving livestock, and beef and poultry reached 29.3 
percent of total meat production, with the proportion of beef 
and poultry increasing by 2 percent over the previous year; 2) 
large operations increased significantly, and production was 
geared to market needs; and 3) the extent of utilization of 
science was raised in livestock production. 
  The total output of aquatic products for the entire province 
reached 350,000 tonnes, an increase of 15.8 percent over the 
previous year. Breakthroughs were made in producing famous, 
special, fine, and new products. 
  Forestry: In 1993 people in the province afforested 1.692 
million mu of land and planted 257 million trees at near houses, 
villages, roads, and water on a voluntary basis. The average 
survival rate of planted trees was more than 93 percent. People 
in the province also built shelter belts to protect 8.817 
million mu of farmland. Two prefectures and five counties were 
named national advanced units in afforestation. The structures 
of trees became more reasonable. People in the province built 
714,000 mu of economic forests and fruit trees, accounting for 
42.5 percent of the total area of afforestation during the same 
year. Fifteen kinds of advanced forestry technologies were 
adopted in the province. The total value of forestry products 
exceeded 2.8 billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent over the 
previous year.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The Xiamen Special 
Economic Zone (SEZ) in East China's Fujian Province, which is 
opposite to Taiwan Island, is expected to become China's second 
city to have legislative rights. 
  In a draft decision, the country's top legislature will 
empower the people's congress and its Standing Committee of 
Xiamen the rights to formulate laws and regulations, and the 
city government to issue government decrees for the zone. 
  The first city was the Shenzhen SEZ in Guangdong Province, 
which borders Hong Kong. 
  A 4-day session of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress (NPC), which starts on March 2, will 
deliberate the draft decision, said Zhou Chengkui, spokesman for 
the General Office of the NPC Standing Committee. 
  Zhou said the move is "necessary for the development of the 
Xiamen SEZ." 
  Xiamen was one of the earliest established special economic 
zones and has become one of the country's "vanguards" in 
developing economic ties with Taiwan and foreign countries. 
  The draft decision will be submitted to the second plenary 
session of the Eighth NPC, which is due on March 10 for further 
deliberation. 
  The spokesman said the session will continue to deliberate 
the draft supplementary regulation on punishing the crimes of 
illegal border crossing and emigration, and a draft law on the 
protection of investments of Taiwan residents. 
  They were preliminarily discussed in the previous session. 
  The legislators will also review the draft labor law. "The 
labor law is supposed to protect the legal rights of working 
people, to build up and maintain the `harmonious ties' between 
employers and employees, and thus is conducive to the reform of 
the country's labor system in line with the establishment of the 
socialist market economy," Zhou added. 
  The lawmakers will also make preparations for the Eighth 
NPC's second plenary session, such as the deliberating of its 
draft agenda and draft name lists of its presidium, secretary 
general and nonvoting delegates.

  [Text] Nanjing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Jiangsu Province has realized its economic goal for the year 
2000 seven years ahead of time, Governor Chen Huanyou announced 
to a recent meeting of the provincial congress. 
  The governor said in his report that Jiangsu recorded a GNP 
[gross national product] value of 255 billion yuan in 1993, an 
increase of 18.5 percent over 1992. 
  Its per capita GNP reached 3,675 yuan in the same year, 
which 
is almost 1,000 yuan more than the national average, according 
to the report. 
  Jiangsu has been one of the Chinese regions of fast 
development ever since the country adopted the policy of reform 
and opening to the outside world. 
  Statistics by the provincial statistics bureau show that 
from 
1979 to 1993, the province's GNP value increased at 11.6 percent 
a year. The rate of increase shot up to an average of 18.6 
percent from 1991 to 1993. 
  Such a fast, sustained and healthy development of the 
economy, as described by the report, was only made possible by a 
consistent effort in restructuring its industrial structure and 
improving the economic performances of enterprises, the governor 
said. 
  In 1993, the province saw increases varying from 20 percent 
to 90 percent in its production of washing machines, motor 
vehicles, glass, cement, steel, sodium carbonate, beans and 
fruit, all of which sold well in the market. 
  The province also witnessed a big boost in its raw materials 
industry over the past few years. While it took the province 28 
years to bring its annual steel production up to one million 
tons and five years to two million tons, the jump to three 
million tons, its original goal for the year 2000, was only a 
matter of two years. 
  Meanwhile, the province's consumption of raw materials and 
energy per unit industrial output has dropped, resulting in its 
comprehensive index for industrial economic efficiency rising by 
10 percent to reach 99.3 percent. 
  Economic experts hold that Jiangsu's powerful development is 
the result of an economy that is getting more and more 
market-oriented and internationalized, with market demand the 
ultimate determinant behind the increase. 
  In the past year, the province started 450 markets for labor 
and raw materials and wholesale markets for industrial and 
agricultural products. Six of them reported an annual business 
volume of one billion yuan apiece. 
  Its consumer products retail value and sales of means of 
production both exceeded 100 billion yuan in 1993, increasing by 
33.9 percent and 43.7 percent over those of 1992, respectively. 
  The province has been seeking to expand its overseas market. 
It exported 5.96 billion U.S. dollars worth of products in 
1993, ranking it fourth among Chinese regions. 
  The province now owns 368 non-trade enterprises overseas, 
among which 210 were started last year. It is now the Chinese 
region with the biggest number of such ventures. 
  Various development zones have become an important 
locomotive 
for the province's economic growth. By the end of 1993, there 
were more than 6,000 enterprises in operation or under 
construction in the province's 10 economic development zones, 
high-tech development zones, free-trade zones and tourist 
resorts at the national level and a larger number of such zones 
at the provincial level. 
  The service industry has been one of the economic sectors 
enjoying the greatest boom. In 1993, the output value of the 
service industry accounted for 24.4 percent of the province's 
total GNP value, while in rural areas, 84.6 percent of the GNP 
value was produced by the processing and service industries.

<F P=106> [Report by DAZHONG RIBAO correspondent: "Qingdao Finds </F>
Favor in Korean Businessmen's Eyes"] 
  [Text] Over the past years, Qingdao city has grasped the 
favorable chance that the enterprises in the ROK have a fancy 
for making investment in China's "Huanghai economic zone," 
brought its geographic advantages into play, and made a 
breakthrough in conducting economic and trade cooperation with 
the ROK. So far, 173 Korean-funded enterprises have been 
approved in the city. One hundred and forty-eight of these 
enterprises have gone into operation. Contracts on using $288.62 
million have been signed. One third of the investment made by 
the Korean enterprises in China are concentrated in Qingdao. 
  Forty-two enterprises were wholly invested by the Korean 
businessmen and the total investment in these enterprises was 
$69.47 million, respectively accounting for 66 percent and 62 
percent of the total. (the same below) For instance, the 
investment in Qingdao Danong textile corporation which is 
engaged in the production of dyed cotton cloths and yarns totals 
$19 million and that in Qingdao Sanhe fiber corporation which is 
engaged in the production of chemical fiber cloths totals $17.4 
million. The wholly funded enterprises tend to become the "main 
forces" of the Korean-funded enterprises in Qingdao. 
  The number of large-sized enterprises continues to increase. 
The enterprises with more than $10 million investment each 
numbers three and those with more than $1 million investment 
each numbers 23, accounting for 41 percent of the total 
investment. The three enterprises each involving more than $10 
million investment belong to the textile trade. 
  The enterprises are mainly engaged in the production of 
textile products, clothes, and toys. The enterprises of textile 
category account for the largest proportion. The total 
investment in these enterprises is $52.74 million and the 
foreign capital used by these enterprises total $23.14 million, 
respecting accounting for 47 percent and 38 percent of the 
total. The enterprises engaged in the production of clothes 
account for the second largest proportion. The total investment 
is $29 million and the foreign capital used by these enterprises 
totals $18.72 million, respectively accounting for 26 percent 
and 30 percent. The other categories of enterprises are listed 
as toy, electrical appliance, and foodstuff industries when 
arranged in the order of large proportions. 
  Some new-type enterprises are established in Qingdao. They 
are enterprises engaged in the production of sports goods, 
various kinds of wigs, and furniture and catering service. Some 
investment spheres that Korean enterprises had never involved in 
have become the popular investment items, and the investment in 
these spheres tends to increase. Since the beginning of last 
year, the investment in the enterprises of these types has 
surpassed $10 million. 
  The cities and counties in the suburban areas of Qingdao 
city 
find favor in Korean cooperatives' eyes. The statistic figures 
compiled by the Qingdao customhouse showed that following the 
setup of Tuopudun electrical appliance corporation in 
Jiaoliuting Town of Qingdao city at the end of 1989, more than 
100 Korean-funded enterprises were successively set up in the 
cities and counties of Qingdao city. Laoshan District's Liuting 
"street of foreign-funded enterprises" and the "Korean-funded 
enterprise group" of Zhonghan Town in Qingdao tend to develop 
the export-oriented economy.

  [Text] On 26 February at the forum cosponsored by the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government, Li 
Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, set 
forth that the party organizations at various levels, the party- 
member cadres, and the broad masses of the people across the 
province should go all out to safeguard political and social 
stability and ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, 
and modernization. 
  Li Wenquan said in his speech: In the preceding stage, the 
province had a situation characterized by political stability, 
social stability, economic development, and market prosperity, 
and in which the people lived and worked in peace and 
contentment. However, we must notice that there are still 
factors affecting social and political stability and the tasks 
for keeping stability are still arduous. The party and 
government leading comrades at various levels should approach 
from the high plane of the overall situation and from the high 
political plane to grasp and well handle the relationship among 
reform, development, and stability; go all out to safeguard the 
stability of the overall situation; and never, in the slightest 
degree, be vague on or shake this matter of principle. At 
present, we should emphatically grasp the basic work of the 
grass roots, the improvement of administrative honesty, the 
improvement of ideology and work style, and the setup of legal
