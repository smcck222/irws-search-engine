  [Text] Shanghai, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai 
Petrochemicals Co., Ltd., built on waste land with state 
investment, is creating wonders with its modern enterprise 
system. 
  Founded in the early 1970s, the company has developed into 
the ninth key industrial enterprise of its type in the country, 
with an annual sales volume exceeding six billion yuan-worth. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has called on enterprises 
across the country to learn from the Shanghai Petrochemicals 
Co., Ltd., which has put on a fresh look by introducing the 
joint stock system. 
  And the State Planning Commission has just held a national 
seminar at the company on deepening the reform of large key 
state enterprises. 
  In September 1992 the company was designated by the central 
government to try out the joint stock system and sell its stocks 
overseas. 
  "It was a huge project for a large state enterprise with 
600,000 employees and several billion yuan-worth of fixed assets 
to transform into a joint stock company," said Wang Jiming, 
chairman of the board of directors and general manager of the 
company. 
  "We know that before the coming into effect the corporate 
law 
in July this year a registered Chinese enterprise, which plans 
to sell stocks internationally, must do good preparation work 
strictly in line with the international and standardized 
requirements," he said. 
  It took the company more than half a year to make an 
inventory of its stockpiles and capital. 
  In July 1993 it issued 1.68 billion h-shares abroad, marking 
the first time that a registered Chinese enterprise had issued 
stocks overseas. 
  A survey shows that the company collected a sum of 320 
million U.S. dollars and 1.62 billion yuan (one dollar equals 
about 8.7 yuan) by issuing stocks, thus reinforcing its capacity 
for self-development. 
  Since then, it has received streams of foreign investors and 
telegrams of inquiry. 
  "Everyone has noticed that the image of the company, China's 
first one to list stocks in New York and Hong Kong, reflects not 
only the company itself but all Chinese enterprises," Wang said. 
  The company's staff and workers have purchased an average of 
1,950 stocks per capita. 
  "We are now masters of our company, and we work harder and 
pay more attention to the company's production and management," 
said Wang Ziqiu, a worker in the company's acrylic fiber mill. 
  In addition, the Shanghai Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. has 
shifted its operational mechanism by adjusting its product 
structure to produce items with additional value. 
  It has cut its administrative organizations from 55 to 19 
and 
reduced its staff members from 1,270 to 417. 
  According to Wang, the joint stock system has promoted not 
only the development of the Shanghai Petrochemicals Company but 
also the income of its employees. 
  Last year saw the company generate record profits totaling 
1.8 billion yuan, and its employees' incomes increase by at 
least 30 percent. 
  Ye Guozhen, a worker at the company's heat and power plant, 
said happily that his wage rose from 434 yuan per month in 
February last year, just before the company began its reform, to 
780 yuan last month. 
  According to Carol Ruth, chairman of the board of directors 
of Dewe Rogerson Company, an agent of the Shanghai 
Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. in the United States, people engaged in 
international securities transactions agreed that the rise of 
120 percent in the price of stocks issued by the company ltd. 
"fully reflects the rosy view of China of the international 
capital market, and the quality of the key Chinese enterprises." 
  Following suit, 65 out of 600 key state enterprises have 
been 
listed on stock markets.

<F P=106> ["Wan Xueyuan Calls For Striding Forward in Reform While </F>
Inspecting Southwest Zhejiang"] 
  [Excerpts] The Spring Festival is drawing near. How are 
veteran party members and former guerrillas and messengers in 
southwest Zhejiang's old revolutionary base area faring? Have 
cadres and people in impoverished mountainous areas adopted some 
new methods to shake off poverty and set out on the road to 
prosperity? In the past three years of reform [as published] 
have there been any new moves in the land of southern Zhejiang 
which is seething with activities? How fast is the 
Jinhua-Wenzhou Railroad, on which people across the province 
focus their attention, being built through high mountains? Wan 
Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and 
governor of the province, called on people in southwest Zhejiang 
and offshore islands and conducted investigations there along 
with responsible persons of relevant provincial departments. 
[passage omitted] 
  At a discussion with leaders of Taishun and Wencheng, two 
poor counties, Wan Xueyuan said: To quicken their pace in 
shaking off poverty and setting out on the road to prosperity, 
people in poor counties should have a proper mentality; they 
should have a united leading body, a fighting will, a 
hardworking spirit, and a realistic work style. Judging from 
the practice of various localities, to develop agriculture, it 
is necessary to vigorously carry out reforms and readjust the 
structures of crop farming and aquaculture. There must be good 
systems, such as the cooperative shareholding system. At the 
same time, we should do research on the market. [passage omitted] 
  While in Ruian City, Wan Xueyuan invited leaders of nine 
enterprises practicing the shareholding system to a discussion 
on accelerating reform of property rights and promoting the 
establishment and development of a modern enterprise system by 
implementing the shareholding system. In Wenzhou city, he 
called a meeting of leaders of relevant departments and 
enterprises and representatives of individuals engaged in 
industrial and commercial businesses, at which they discussed 
questions about the establishment of a socialist security 
system. During the discussion, Wan Xueyuan fully affirmed the 
pioneering spirit displayed by cadres and people at the 
grass-roots levels in carrying out reforms and the achievements 
they had scored. He said: Judging from the current economic 
situation, Wenzhou has maintained a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of its economy as has the province. To 
promote development, we must deepen reforms, solve deep-seated 
problems, and instill fresh vitality into the economy. The Third 
Plenary Session of the Party's 14th Central Committee set the 
objectives and tasks for reform. People throughout the 
province, especially those in Wenzhou, should take bigger 
strides in reform and exploration, be daring to innovate, 
improve what they have done, and blaze new trails. [passage 
omitted] 
  As the backbone of southwest Zhejiang, the Jinhua-Wenzhou 
Railroad will be of great significance for local economic and 
social development. [passage omitted] Wan Xueyuan visited a 
tunnel construction site at Dongqiao Mountain in Wenzhou. He 
went down to a construction site 200 meters underground to call 
on workers of the Pingyang No. 2 Jingxiang Company who were 
tunneling there. He held a drilling machine for a while. Wan 
Xueyuan expressed satisfaction with the progress made last year 
in building the railroad. [passage omitted] 
  While engaging in investigation and study, Wan Xueyuan also 
called on teachers and family planning workers in impoverished 
mountainous areas and inspected Wenzhou's developing cultural 
market.

  [Text] Hangzhou, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Hangzhou, the 
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, has over the past few 
years made great progress in upgrading its new and high 
technology development zone. 
  Official sources said that 134 million yuan in the 
construction of basic facilities, involving a floor space of 
some 200,000 sq m, was completed last year in this development 
zone. 
  With a total area of some 12 sq km, the zone, which was 
approved three years ago, is Zhejiang's only state-level 
development zone of the kind. 
  To date, local governments, colleges, scientific institutes 
and major companies all over the country as well as some Hong 
Kong and Taiwan businesses have set up more than 305 firms in 
the zone. 
  In addition, some 46 foreign-funded firms have been 
established there over the past three years, involving a total 
foreign investment of more than 80 million U.S. dollars. 
  According to sources from the management committee of the 
zone, great emphasis has been put upon the development of 
electronic information, new materials, new energy and 
biotechnologies as well as technologies to improve efficiency 
and save energy. 
  At the same time, such advanced new and high technologies as 
program-controlled switchboards, membron materials and silicon 
single crystals have been introduced and applied to production. 
  The latest statistics show that some 402 new and high 
technologies are currently being applied to production in the 
zone and will soon be spread throughout the country. 
  Over the past few years, relevant departments have made 
great 
efforts to improve the infrastructure of the zone in support of 
its development, officials from the management committee said.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] With the beginning of the New Year, Zhejiang 
provincial procuratorial organs began stepping up efforts to 
hunt down economic criminals, including those who involved in 
the crimes of accepting and taking bribes. In the period 1-15 
February, the province's procuratorial organs arrested a total 
of 12 economic criminals on the run, thus scoring an initial 
victory in hunting down fugitives. 
  The provincial procuratorate lists the number of fugitives 
who were involved in the crimes of accepting and offering bribes 
at 200. Thanks to long-term efforts, the provincial 
procuratorial organs have arrrested 100 of them. As the 
remaining 100 are still on the run, it is impossible to 
immediately conclude some of the bribery cases. On 1 January 
this year, the provincial procuratorate issued a circular in 
which concrete instructions were set forth for local 
procuratorial organs to step up efforts to hunt down fugitives. 
Upon receipt of the circular, grass-roots procuratorial organs 
began to act in line with the circular's instructions on hunting 
down criminals under their jurisdiction.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Private schools, 
which have been mushrooming throughout China in recent years, 
have been given greater importance in promoting education in 
south China's Guangdong Province. 
  A meeting in this provincial capital decided that private 
schools would have a bigger expansion in Guangdong, especially 
in the fields of pre-school and adult education, and vocational 
training. 
  The meeting, which was held to draw up a blueprint for the 
province's education in 1994, also allows private schools to pay 
more attention to the teaching of foreign languages, computer 
science and art in their syllabuses, provided that they also 
meet the education standards established by the state. 
  The meeting promised that non-profit private schools would 
get help from the government in funds and acquisition of land. 
  On the other hand, the meeting demanded that a complete set 
of regulations be established for a better administration of 
private schools. 
  Aimed at reforming the present public school system, the 
meeting decided that some elementary and high schools, as well 
as vocational training schools might be turned over to private 
operation through tendering. 
  Boosting the private school sector is only part of the 
province's education plan. Regarding education as a strategic 
move in the march to modernization over the next 20 years, the 
province now aims to set up a complete new education system. 
  Though Guangdong has, since 1978, invested more than ten 
billion yuan in building and repairing schools in addition to 
other types of educational investment, education officials said 
the development of education still can not meet the demand.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xie Zuan (6200 9449): "Economic Boom Boosts </F>
Real Estate Industry in Shenzhen"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- At a 
seminar in held Hong Kong on Shenzhen's property development, 
Shenzhen Deputy Mayor Li Chuanfang said this morning that 
Shenzhen's rapid economic growth has brought about a great boom 
in the real estate industry. Since 1979, when Shenzhen was 
authorized to become a city, the investment in capital 
construction has hit 40.6 billion yuan. As a result, the urban 
area has expanded to 75 square km and thousands of modern 
buildings have sprung up in the urban area. 
  It is reported that a dozen small residential areas, 
including the Yuanling, Huangmugang, Buxin, and Binsha 
residential areas, have been set up in turn, with the per-capita 
living space reaching 12 square meters. In 1992, residential 
units measuring a total of 7.5991 million square meters were 
built in Shenzhen. 
  Li pointed out: Shenzhen reformed the land management system 
as early as 1987, and took the lead in introducing the state 
land- leasing system with compensation and tenure, and in 
freeing the land market. The reforms were affirmed by the 
central authorities and praised by people at home and abroad. 
  Li maintained that the property development in Shenzhen is 
relatively normal. The State Council recently sent an 
inspection group to Shenzhen to find out about the property 
development and the group did not make any criticism, she said. 
  At the seminar, Li also touched on the value-added land tax, 
a matter of great public concern. All contracts signed before 
promulgation of the regulations on the value-added land tax will 
be implemented according to the original ordinances, she said, 
adding that the Shenzhen City Government, following the 
promulgation of state regulations on the value-added land tax, 
will formulate detailed rules and regulations for its 
implementation in accordance with state regulations and 
Shenzhen's actual conditions.

  [Text] Haikou, February 26 (CNS)--Shareholding system 
enterprises have become an important force in Hainan's economy 
with 125 limited companies being approved since 1991, raising 
capital of RMB [Renminbi] 20.56 billion. 
  Some of these enterprises are set up based on state-owned 
enterprises with others created from non-state-run ones or 
formed by putting technology, capital and land into capital 
stock or by merging, joint-running or contracting. These 
shareholding enterprises are involved in tourism, industry, 
transportation and finance and have certain notable 
characteristics. 
  First, they make more reasonable the industrial structure in 
Hainan with 23 such companies engaging in tourism, 17 in 
industrial development, 16 in the development of whole pieces of 
land, seven in comprehensive agricultural development and five 
in infrastructural construction, with all achieving greater 
profits. 
  Second, these companies are an important contributor of 
funds 
for infrastructural construction in the province with some 60 
percent of fund for the construction of the Sanya International 
Airport, the Eastern Expressway and electric power stations 
coming from these companies, resulting in relieving the shortage 
of funds and speeding up infrastructural construction there. 
  Third, these companies have also become important sources of 
the local financial income with five listed companies alone 
handing in taxes of RMB 60 million last year. 
  The reason for the rapid development of these kinds of 
companies in Hainan is the market economy in the province and 
the greater autonomy of its enterprises.

  [Text] Haikou, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Hainan, an island 
province in southernmost China, has turned out to be rich in 
minerals as well as tropical and oceanic resources. 
  Prospecting by the province's geological and mineral 
departments has discovered 88 kinds of minerals, of which 59 are 
worthy for industrial exploration. 
  Reserves of ten minerals, such as arenaceous quartz, natural 
gas and iron ore, rank among the top in the country. 
  The province's deposits of iron ore take up more than 70 
percent of the country's iron-rich ore deposits. The ore goes 
to some 100 iron and steel plants in the country. 
  The province is also abundant in a great number of metal 
ores, stone, coal and crude oil resources on land and under 
nearby waters. 
  At present, the annual output value of the province's mining 
and related processing industry is worth about one billion yuan 
(114.9 million U.S. dollars).

  [Text] Wuhan, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Breeding of aquatic 
products is now an important way to become prosperous for 
farmers from central China's Hubei Province. 
  Statistics show that last year farmers engaged in breeding 
of 
aquatic products achieved a per capita net income of 1,100 yuan, 
300 yuan more than the corresponding figure for those farmers 
not engaged in cultivation of such products. 
  Hubei, known to have a thousand lakes and dubbed as a "land 
of fish and rice", has a water area of 1.33 million hectares, of 
which more than 400,000 hectares have been used for breeding of 
aquatic products of various kinds. 
  According to Che Guangbiao, director of the Hubei Provincial 
Bureau of Aquatic Products, over the past 15 years output of 
aquatic products of the province has increased by 50,000 tons a 
year. 
  The output of aquatic products for 1993 surpassed one 
million 
tons, and the per capita availability of fresh water fish 
reached 16 kg in the province, ranking second in the country. 
  Local officials attributed the quick development of the 
breeding sector to reform in circulation of aquatic products and 
the application of scientific methods in their cultivation. 
  Thanks to the reform in circulation of aquatic products, 
traders representing different ownerships have all moved in to 
engage in the aquatic products trade, effectively solving the 
difficulty for growers of aquatic products in selling their 
products. 
  A dozen scientific research institutes in Wuhan City, the 
provincial capital, boast more than 2,000 senior experts of 
aquatic products. 
  Besides giving technical guidance to local farmers, 
researchers with these institutes have developed bait for young 
salmon and the artificial propagation of river crabs, as well as 
introduced approximately 40 new varieties of fish from abroad. 
The efforts have brought about great economic returns.

  [Text] At the emergency telephone conference held by the 
provincial government on 24 February, Vice Governor Gu Erxiong 
pointed out: Major problems existing in the province's current 
cotton production include: Peasants' enthusiasm in growing 
cotton needs to be mobilized further; some localities have not 
yet assigned cotton growing quotas to peasant households and 
plots; some localities have seen the trend of reducing the 
acreage sown to summer cotton; cotton seeds are of poor quality 
and in short supply; and peasants have not prepared sufficient 
means of production for growing cotton. 
  In light of these problems, Gu Erxiong stressed: The month 
before the spring sowing of cotton is the key to decide the 
success or failure in this year's cotton production. 
Governments at all levels should adopt feasible measures to 
successfully assign cotton growing quotas to peasants and ensure 
the scale of cotton growing acreage.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, February 24 (XINHUA) -- North China's 
Hebei Province, one of China's important agricultural bases, has 
reported an all-time record harvest of grain last year despite 
harsh arid conditions. 
  The total grain output of the province hit some 23.8 million 
tons last year, one million tons more than that in 1990, which 
was the previous record, according to the latest official 
statistics. 
  Meanwhile, the total agricultural output value of Hebei in 
1993 topped some 50.1 billion yuan, up 6.2 percent from the 
previous year. 
  Exceptionally serious dry weather attacked most of the area 
over the past year. The average rainfall in the first half of 
1993 dropped to only some ten millimeters per month, official 
sources said. 
  In addition, water in most of the reservoirs and canals 
dried 
up due to rare drought. 
  To fight the drought, the provincial government collected 
some 500 million yuan to construct irrigation systems, draw 
water and readjust the crop structure. 
  With the support of local governments, the Hebei people sank 
about 780,000 pump wells, and the total area of effectively 
irrigated farmland reached some 3.93 million ha [hectares].

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, February 25 (XINHUA) -- North China's 
Hebei Province has taken a stride in the construction of the 261 
state and provincial key projects for the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
period (1991-95). 
  Construction on most of the projects is in full swing, while 
some have been completed and put into operation ahead of 
schedule, according to officials with the Hebei provincial 
leading group for major construction projects. 
  Since last July when China began to adopt macroeconomic 
control measures, the province has adjusted the orientation of 
its basic construction investments at the right time and made an 
overall plan for key construction projects in the province to 
guarantee adequate financing. 
  Meanwhile, Hebei has observed the guiding principle of 
optimizing industrial structure and product mix in making 
investment in fixed assets, speeding up development of basic 
industries and the service trade, and opening wider to the 
outside world and promoting technical progress in the province's 
major enterprises. 
  In the past year, the province completed 54 billion yuan in 
investment toward fixed assets, up 68 percent compared with the 
previous year, according to the officials. 
  Construction of basic facilities and completion of technical 
upgrading projects in state-owned enterprises of the province 
have greatly boosted the province's production of oil, iron 
ores, coal, electricity, iron and steel, chemical fertilizers, 
cement and textiles.

<F P=106> [By reporter Du Ange (2625 1344 7041): "Select the </F>
Breakthrough Points, Expand the Reform Strength, and Use the 
Experience of Selected Units to Rapidly Promote Work in the 
Entire Area"] 
  [Text] Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee 
and chairman of the regional people's congress standing 
committee, and Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the regional 
government, led comrades in charge of relevant departments to 
Xingan League to inspect the implementation of the guidelines of 
the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee 
and the eighth enlarged plenary session of the fifth regional 
party committee on 21-25 January. Comrade Wang Qun and other 
leading comrades have been concerned about the living of the 
people in the disaster areas. Braving the severe cold, they 
travelled deeply to the disaster areas to cordially salute the 
people in the disaster areas on behalf of the regional party 
committee and government and to help them solve some practical 
problems so that people in the disaster area will have a happy 
Spring Festival. 
  Wang Qun listened to briefings given by the Xingan League 
party committee on the morning of 24 January. He was very 
pleased with this league's achievements in overcoming natural 
disasters and various difficulties. Wang Qun said: A batch of 
good examples have emerged in Xingan League. This is your 
wealth, the road of reform is under your feet, and the methods 
of reform are in your experience. Those who are capable of 
grasping their own advantages and selecting the accurate 
economic development path will be able to display their skills 
in the market economy. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: Many reform measures will be issued 
this year. This is a year of reform and development which is 
very important to Inner Mongolia. Leaders at all levels should 
make a good choice of the breakthrough points, expand the reform 
strength, use the experience of selected units to promote work 
in the entire area, speed up the work, and achieve actual 
results. 
  Wang Qun stressed: To successfully carry out this year's 
work, we should further emancipate the mind, broaden the field 
of vision, proceed from local reality, define the report 
priorities, pay attention to grasping the priorities and solving 
in-depth problems, formulate supporting measures, and 
conscientiously organize efforts to implement them. To this 
end, we should strive to study and really know well all reform 
guiding ideologies, basic ideas, programs, and operational 
measures issued by the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological 
mobilization, organize the work carefully, and implement the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
congress and the eighth enlarged plenary session of the fifth 
regional party committee in places where needed. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: Guiding peasants and herdsmen to the 
market is an important task which this era has assigned to 
cadres at all levels. We should create conditions for peasants 
and herdsmen to march towards the market and use information to 
guide them enter the market. To become prosperous by developing 
"high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming and by 
commercializing production, we must combine foreign trade with 
industry and agriculture, and the planting industry with the 
breeding and processing industries, implement the agricultural 
and animal husbandry production structure characterized by 
serialized and enterprise-oriented large-scale production of 
agriculture, industry, commerce, technology, and foreign trade 
that can find a place in the market, invigorate the economy by 
developing local resources, and turn the advantage of natural 
resources into economic advantages. 
  Wang Qun stressed: In the course of rapidly carrying out all 
reforms, we must be bold, keen in blazing new trials, have new 
ideas, measures, and methods, strengthen the study of policies, 
pay attention to solving the new situation and new problems 
emerged in the course of reform and development, particularly 
problems closely related to the lives of the masses, and 
maintain social stability.

  [Text] Hohhot, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Two major railway 
lines are nearing completion while all counties (banners) [as 
received] have installed urban automatic telephone exchanges in 
northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  This is part of the achievements the autonomous region made 
last year in its infrastructure construction. 
  The region has in recent years concentrated its efforts on 
the construction of transportation and telecommunications 
facilities, which are essential to relieve bottlenecks in local 
economic development. 
  Last year, the region spent more than 6.7 billion yuan on 
some 20 national key projects and 17 local key projects. Some 
of them were completed and put into operation last year. They 
have yielded good economic and social returns. 
  The region installed some 193,000 lines of urban telephones 
were installed last year, an increase of more than 100,000 lines 
over the previous year. 
  The Datong-Jungar railway and the Jining-Tongliao railway, 
which will soon be completed, are expected to bring common 
prosperity to the eastern and western parts of the autonomous 
region. 
  In addition, ten leading highway projects are still under 
construction. Infrastructure facilities at the border posts 
like Erenhot and Manzhouli, bordering on Mongolia and Russia, 
were also improved last year. 
  The energy industry in the autonomous region grew rapidly 
last year as generators with a capacity of 574,000 kilowatts 
were installed, pushing the total installed capacity to nearly 
4.68 million kilowatts. 
  Construction of a number of other national key projects, 
including several coal mines and copper mines, is also well on 
its way.

  [Text] Taiyuan, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Judicial 
departments in north China's Shanxi Province are playing a 
significant role in helping guarantee the normal operations of 
the market economy in the province. 
  Shanxi courts handled a total of 9,413 economic disputes and 
finalized 8,264 of them in 1993. They also settled through 
mediation 4,268 economic disputes involving overseas partners. 
  These cases involved more than 1.2 billion yuan. 
  The positive role being played by the judicial bodies of the 
province has guaranteed proper and timely settlements of cases 
of bankruptcy, patents and contracts, which have burgeoned in 
recent years as China pursues a market economy. 
  According to provincial authorities, 90 percent of the 
economic disputes in Shanxi concern economic contracts and often 
drag in large and medium-sized enterprises. 
  Courts in Shanxi have zeroed in on the `knot of triangular 
debts', a lingering problem featuring a host of parties. 
  Officials said that courts in the province's Yangquan city 
have helped enterprises collect debts worth more than 57 million 
yuan and saved 40 enterprises from bankruptcy. 
  To tackle the increasing number of economic disputes arising 
from the rush to profitable markets, many courts in Shanxi have 
set up mediation centers, which have helped settle cases 
involving more than 270 million yuan for some 2,300 enterprises. 
  The courts also have helped local tax departments gather 310 
million yuan in taxes and collect some 730 million yuan in 
overdue loans. The money, in turn, was used to redeem IOU scrip 
issued to farmers [sentence as received]. 
  In co-operation with their counterparts nationwide, the 
courts have broken down local protectionism to settle 
cross-province economic disputes. Incomplete statistics show 
that Shanxi courts helped to collect more than 83 million yuan 
from outside the province last year. 
  Shanxi courts have also kept a close look at the latest 
developments in the forms of economic disputes, in a bid to 
provide legal protection for the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system in the province.

  [Text] Taiyuan, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Rich in coal and 
other energy resources, north China's Shanxi Province is also a 
leader in the fast-growing non-metallic minerals world. 
  The province plans to invest more than six billion yuan in 
development of non-metallic minerals with 54 exploration 
projects. 
  The province's verified reserves of refractory clay amount 
to 
537 million tons, about 26 percent of the country's total. Its 
annual clay output reaches over one million tons. 
  Other major non-metallic minerals include alumina, zeolite, 
rutile, pearlite, potassium, lime and plaster stones, ranking 
first in the country both in such reserves and their quality. 
  The increasing exploration for non-metallic menerals is 
attributed to the country's fast-growing construction and 
industrial demands and the minerals' high economic returns. 
  Analysts here say that the costs of exploration for and use 
of non-metals are very low and the prices commanded by non-metal 
products can be ten times, or even a hundred times those for raw 
metallic ores. 
  In addition, they have a wide use in many industrial 
sectors, 
including metallurgy, chemistry, light industry, construction 
materials, agriculture and environmental protection. 
  Yangquan, known as a coal city in the eastern border area of 
Shanxi, produces refractory materials which have been sold to 
many countries in East Asia and the Western world, as well as to 
most of China's domestic iron and steel companies. 
  The city's annual output value for refractory materials has 
been over 200 million yuan over the past few years. 
  It also plans to build a new center with a production 
capacity of one million tons of refractory materials yearly and 
another for high-quality production of half a million tons of 
such materials. 
  The province also has an ample storage of construction 
materials such as red and black granites, which have for some 
time enjoyed a good reputation on the world market. 
  For this reason, five big rock materials processing 
companies 
will be built in Lingqiu, Hunyuan, Jiangxian and Wutai counties, 
and Xinzhou City, with a total output of 200,000 cubic meters of 
rock materials and 1.45 million square meters of rock plates 
each year. 
  The richness of the non-metallic resources also promotes the 
province's chemical and porcelain industries. The provincial 
government has decided to rebuild a chemical plant to bring out 
a series of expanding clay products which have a wide use in 
casting, textiles, cleaning, and the national defense industry. 
  In the porcelain sector, the production targeted for this 
year is a total of 61.75 articles for everyday use and 1.4 
million square meters of decorative porcelain. 
  Figures show that out of 115 kinds of ore reserves that have 
been discovered in the province, 64 are non-metallic, accounting 
for 55.6 percent of the total. 
  Analysts here attribute the province's wealth of nonmetals 
to 
the constant changes in its special geologic structures formed 
in different periods. 
  About 45 non-metal materials have been explored and widely 
used in many fields. The non-metals sector has now become a 
mainstay industry of the province.

  [Text] The sample survey of the municipality's population 
changes in 1993 showed that by the end of 1993, the 
municipality's permanent population reached 9,280,200, an 
increase of 76,100 people over the same period of 1992. Of 
this, 99,000 people were born, 58,000 people were dead, and 
35,000 people moved from other places. 
  The analysis showed that the number of new born babies in 
1993 was reduced by 16,000 from 1992 and the birth rate was 
reduced by 1.79 per thousand. There are two reasons for the 
reduction. First, at the time of gradually deepening the 
scientific management of the birth control work, the 
municipality has increased the dynamics of the task that top 
party and government leaders personally engage in the management 
and assume sole responsibility for the birth control work. In 
particular, five counties have made preliminary achievements in 
birth control. Second, the number of new couples in 1992 was 
reduced by 6 percent from 1991. Thus, the population birth 
scale was reduced on an appropriate scale. 
  As calculated by the specialists, under the influence of the 
traditional feudalist idea about the "year of widows," many 
women got married in 1993 and before the 1994 Spring Festival. 
So, the number of new born babies in 1994 will be kept around 
100,000, and the permanent population of the municipality will 
possibly surpass 9.35 million. Therefore, the 1994 population 
situation is still grim, and the birth control work must not be 
ignored.

  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 5 February at the No. 1 
workers cultural palace, the municipal trade union council held 
a forum of model workers to mark the Spring Festival and to make 
suggestions. Over 100 representatives of the model workers from 
all fronts of the municipality happily gathered together with 
the municipal leading comrades. They jointly narrated the 
municipality's 1993 gigantic achievements in reform, opening up, 
and modernization and cooperatively discussed the good 
suggestions on restoring the prestige of Tianjin and promoting 
Tianjin's development. 
  Present at the forum were some municipal leading comrades, 
including Gao Dezhan, Zhang Lichang, Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, 
Nie Bichu, Liu Jinfeng, Liu Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Song 
Pingshun, Zheng Zhiying, Wang Hongjiang, Pan Yiqing, Ye Disheng, 
Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang Gonghui, Wang Dehui, and Zhu Liankang; 
and persons in charge of departments, commissions, and offices. 
[passage omitted] 
  Gao Dezhan said: Upon the arrival of the Spring Festival, 
representatives of the model workers of the municipality 
gathered together to suggest ways and means for Tianjin's 
development. This is a meaningful thing. Today's forum is a 
meeting at which municipal leading persons and model workers 
held heart-to-heart talks. The model workers made many good 
opinions and suggestions. We will conscientiously accept their 
opinions and suggestions. The municipality's working class, 
particularly its model workers, has made great contributions. 
On behalf of the municipal party committee and government, I 
express my heartfelt thanks to the model workers and the working 
class in the municipality. Gao Dezhan said: The year 1994 is a 
key year to promote Tianjin's reform, opening up, and 
modernization. Therefore, all work of the municipality should 
be submitted to and serve the overall situation of grasping 
favorable opportunities to deepen reform, expand the scale of 
opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. We 
should speed up the setup of the socialist market economic 
system; maintain a sustained, fast, and sound development of the 
national economy; safeguard political stability; comprehensively 
promote social progress; and make key headway in various 
undertakings. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: To realize the 1994 work targets, we 
should grasp the following few tasks. First, the party and 
government leaders should think for the masses, do everything 
for the masses, and rely on the masses to do their work. It is 
necessary to deepen reform, develop production, improve 
management, increase economic results, and ceaselessly increase 
the income of the staff and workers. Enterprises with good 
economic achievements should create more real benefits for the 
staff and workers. The enterprises that have taken a turn for 
the better from the strained circumstances should solve more 
difficulties for their staff and workers. Second, we should 
enliven enterprises, particularly state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises. Only when enterprises are well 
enlivened will Tianjin be able to become prosperous. Only when 
enterprises are well developed will Tianjin be able to make 
developments. So, we must not only do concrete deeds for the 
masses but also positively do concrete deeds for enterprises. 
All departments and fronts should make contributions to 
enlivening enterprises. Third, we should foster the idea of 
relying on reform to promote development. Enterprises should 
exert great efforts to deepen reform. Fourth, we should persist 
in the principle of taking a two- hand approach and being sure 
that both hands are tough and accurately handle the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability. We should 
strengthen spiritual civilization, the ideological and political 
work, and the improvement of social order so as to create good 
conditions for reform, opening up, and economic development. In 
the new year, we should wholeheartedly rely on the working 
class, pool the joint efforts of all people of the municipality, 
and unite with the people to capture a bigger success in reform, 
opening up, and modernization. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the morning of 25 February, Gao Dezhan, secretary 
of the municipal party committee, inspected the (Dahutong) 
wholesale market for small articles of daily use and the 
(Shitang) wholesale market of north China to further conduct 
investigation and study on accelerating the cultivation and 
development of the market system. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: All fronts of the municipality should 
make concerted efforts and redouble their efforts to 
realistically accelerate the pace of building Tianjin into a 
commercial, trade, and monetary center of north China. 
  Together with Zheng Zhiying, member of the municipal party 
committee standing committee; and Zhang Haosheng, vice mayor of 
the municipal government, Gao Dezhan inspected the market 
situation. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The (Dahutong) wholesale market for small 
articles of daily use has influential power and has made 
contributions to rejuvenating Tianjin's economy. The (Shitang) 
wholesale market of north China has grasped favorable 
opportunities to make rapid development and registered a high 
starting point. This market is full of vitality. 
  Together with the responsible comrades of the commercial 
department, Gao Dezhan deeply studied the issue of accelerating 
the construction of the commercial department. 
  He pointed out: Developing, on a large scale, circulation, 
commerce and trade, and market is of extremely important 
significance to Tianjin's development. Without a perfect market 
system or the achievements in expanding and enlivening business, 
it will be difficult for Tianjin to build itself into a 
commercial, trade, and monetary center of north China. 
  The commercial department undertakes an important task for 
cultivating and developing the market system. We earnestly hope 
that in the course of setting up the market system, the 
commercial department will firmly grasp its work, accelerate the 
pace of development, make greater achievements, and make new 
contributions. We should make a unified plan, use the existing 
[words indistinct], and ceaselessly accelerate the [words 
indistinct] of cultivating markets. In line with the realities 
of Tianjin, which stands as a north China commercial, trade, and 
monetary center and a municipality, we should form a major 
climate for Tianjin's market. It is necessary to make a big 
breakthrough in market's trade volume. To achieve this, we 
should make a big breakthrough in working out measures for 
promoting the market's trade volume. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed again: Accelerating the setup of market 
is a major task. Therefore, all fronts should closely make 
concerted efforts and actively and enthusiastically do their 
jobs well. All departments in charge and all departments in 
charge of the overall work should positively create conditions. 
The construction departments should regard the setup of market 
as a key construction project.

<F P=106> [White Paper released by the Hong Kong Goverment in Hong </F>
Kong on 24 February that "reproduces the text of the White Paper 
presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Foreign 
and Commonwealth Affairs by Command of Her Majesty on 24 
February 1994": "Representative Government in Hong Kong"] 
  [Excerpt] Personal Introduction From the Secretary of 
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs 
  We intend to fulfil our responsibilities towards Hong Kong 
in 
the remaining years of British sovereignty. This is our plain 
duty. We are responsible for holding elections in Hong Kong in 
1994 and 1995. The Joint Declaration lays down that the 
legislature of Hong Kong in July 1997 "shall be constituted by 
elections". Elections have to be fair and open if the territory 
is to have a credible Legislative Council, capable of 
safeguarding Hong Kong's way of life as set out in the Joint 
Declaration, and the rule of law on which it depends. 
  We wished to hold these elections on a basis agreed with the 
Chinese Government, with the aim of ensuring continuity. 
Despite a real and sustained effort on our part, over 8 months 
and 17 rounds of negotiation, agreement has not proved possible. 
By the end of 1993 it was necessary, because of the legislative 
timetable, to proceed with legislation in Hong Kong on the more 
urgent and less complex issues. Therefore, in December 1993 the 
Hong Kong Government introduced draft legislation on the voting 
age and voting method for geographical elections, and on the 
abolition of appointed seats in District Boards and Municipal 
Councils. At the same time, we made clear to the Chinese side 
our readiness, in the time made available by introducing 
legislation on the more urgent issues, to intensify discussion 
on the remaining, more complex issues. But our offer has not 
yet been taken up by the Chinese side. We must now start the 
legislative process on the remaining issues related to the 1995 
Legislative Council elections. 
  This White Paper is intended to inform debate -- in 
Parliament, in the Legislative Council and more widely -- on 
what is at stake. It gives a full account of what our talks with 
China have been about, why agreement has not been possible, and 
how we intend to proceed. 
  Arrangements for the last cycle of elections in Hong Kong 
under British sovereignty cannot be considered in isolation. 
They form part of a long process of gradual development in Hong 
Kong's system of representative government. The Sino-British 
Joint Declaration of 1984, and China's Basic Law for Hong Kong, 
which will come into force on 1 July 1997, between them set the 
pace for democratic development in Hong Kong. There is no 
argument about that. They also establish that Hong Kong will 
retain its own, capitalist way of life after 1997, under the 
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong run by 
Hong Kong people". 
  The wishes of the people of Hong Kong are crucial. There has 
been a steadily growing demand for Hong Kong people to have more 
say in the running of their own affairs. The first part of this 
White Paper summarises these developments. It also addresses a 
question I am often asked: why did Britain not introduce 
democracy to Hong Kong much earlier? The short answer is that 
for many years the community had other priorities. There was a 
deep-seated concern that the introduction of politics could lead 
to open clashes between Nationalists and Communists, and that 
this could lead China to invoke its claim to sovereignty over 
Hong Kong. Her Majesty's Government, and through them the 
Governor, were of course accountable to Parliament for the 
administration of the territory throughout this period. 
  A gradual development of democracy has however been under 
way 
since 1984. 18 members were for the first time directly elected 
to the Legislative Council in 1991. The question which 
confronted the new Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, on his 
arrival in mid-1992 was how to reconcile the clear wish in the 
community for further movement towards democracy with the 
equally strong interest in legislative arrangements which were 
capable of enduring beyond 1997, thus providing an important 
element of continuity. 
  The Hong Kong Government's proposals of October 1992 -- made 
with our full support -- answered this question. They provided 
for a modest development of democracy. These proposals were 
fully compatible with the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and 
any relevant agreements between Britain and China. 
  The proposals put forward by the Hong Kong Government were 
well received in Hong Kong. Despite the hostile Chinese 
reaction, we persevered with efforts to get talks underway and 
eventually agreed a basis for talks, which opened in April 1993. 
The second part of this White Paper gives a full account of 
these talks. It shows that we were prepared to make significant 
moves on two important aspects of our proposals, the Functional 
Constituencies and the Election Committee, provided that the 
overall package met our essential requirements. But there was a 
point beyond which we could not go if we were to achieve our 
objective of fair and open elections. The third part of the 
White Paper analyses in more detail the specific proposals 
advanced by both sides against that objective. 
  The balance sheet is clear. Our proposals, even after 
substantial revisions in an effort to meet Chinese concerns, 
would produce electoral arrangements which were fair, open and, 
in our judgement, acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. The 
Chinese side's proposals as they emerged in the talks would not. 
They proposed electoral arrangements which would have 
restricted choice and left the elections open to manipulation. 
Despite the evidence that tiny franchises can lead to 
corruption and vote-rigging, they proposed freezing all 
development in the 21 existing functional constituencies, and 
proposed that nine new functional constituencies should be 
formed in the same way. They proposed a restrictive and 
cumbersome system for the Election Committee to return 10 
members of the Legislative Council. They proposed a voting 
method for the geographical constituencies which would have the 
effect of ensuring that the less popular parties won seats. 
  We went as far as we could to bridge the gap. As part of 
that, we explored fully the possibility of an interim 
understanding which would allow legislation to be introduced on 
the most urgent issues. But the Chinese side refused to accept 
two elements which in our judgement were essential to fair and 
open elections. First, they opposed the abolition of appointed 
seats in the District Boards and Municipal Councils in 1994/95, 
and indicated that the only circumstances in which they might be 
able to agree to this would be on the understanding that at 
least some of them would have to be reinstated in 1997. Second, 
they could not accept the single seat-single vote method for the 
Legislative Council geographical elections, even though they had 
accepted this method for the District Board and Municipal 
Council elections. The Legislative Council voted clearly in 
July 1992 that this method should apply to the Legislative 
Council elections, and the leaders of the two main parties 
confirmed their support for it in November 1993. It would have 
served no purpose to have tabled draft legislation that omitted 
this point, since members of the Council would be likely to have 
amended it to reflect their known views. As indicated above, 
the Chinese side were also unable to agree with our proposals to 
abolish appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal 
Councils. Given the pressure of time, the Hong Kong Government 
introduced a Bill on these more urgent issues in December 1993. 
This has now been passed by the Legislative Council . 
  Our door has been open all along for discussion with the 
Chinese government. It will remain so. But we can wait no 
longer before legislating on the remaining electoral issues. 
The Governor is introducing a Bill reflecting his October 1992 
proposals. These have been widely discussed in Hong Kong for 
over 16 months, and throughout the period have commanded wide 
support within most sections of the community. They have been 
the subject of three motion debates in the Legislative Council, 
and were endorsed by the Council on each occasion. It is now 
for the Legislative Council to pass legislation, taking full 
account of the views of the community, and against the 
background set out in this White Paper. This is a heavy 
responsibility, which I am confident the Legislative Council 
will discharge in the best interest of Hong Kong. We and the 
Governor have consistently said that we cannot go further, nor 
can we go less far, than the people of Hong Kong wish us to go. 
  We are committed to cooperation with China on Hong Kong and 
to fulfilling our obligations under the Joint Declaration. It 
is common sense that this is the best way to promote the 
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and to secure a smooth 
transition. We look to the Chinese side to work with us to 
achieve this. In particular we look forward to early agreement 
on financing arrangements for the new airport and on Hong Kong's 
ninth container terminal. There is also a long agenda of issues 
in the Joint Liaison Group which need to be dealt with if 
continuity in legal and technical areas is to be achieved. We 
shall continue to work for cooperation with China to achieve 
full implementation of the Joint Declaration. That is in the 
best interests of a successful Hong Kong after 1997. 
  Douglas Hurd Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth 
Affairs 
<H3>  PART I: The Development of Representative Government in 
Hong Kong 
(a) Developments to 1984 </H3>
  1. The unique circumstances of Hong Kong have determined the 
development of its representative institutions. The policy of 
Her Majesty's Government in the case of most other Dependent 
Territories has been to promote the development of democracy in 
preparation for eventual independence. But independence was 
never a realistic option for Hong Kong. Attitudes in the 
community reflected this reality. When relatively modest 
proposals to develop democracy were made by the then Governor in 
the period following the Second World War, they met with 
virtually no public support in Hong Kong. The territory's 
population had increased sharply, from about 600,000 in 1945 to 
2.2 million by mid-1950. Most of these were migrants from 
China, whose priorities were to make a decent living for 
themselves and their families. In these early post-war years 
there was widespread concern that political activity would have 
led to the civil war in China between the Nationalists and the 
Communists spilling over into Hong Kong. 
  2. Some constitutional development was again considered in 
the mid-1960s. But the Cultural Revolution in China caused 
disruption and uncertainty in Hong Kong. Many in the community 
feared that elections would lead to open rivalry between the 
Communists and Nationalists which would have put at risk the 
stability of Hong Kong (there had been Nationalist-inspired 
riots in Hong Kong in 1956, and Communist-inspired riots in the 
1960s). Local attitudes were also influenced by the knowledge 
that China was opposed to the introduction into Hong Kong of 
party politics and elections on western lines. There was no 
wish to provoke China into challenging the status quo 
in pursuit of her standing claim to sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
  3. The Hong Kong Government therefore sought to develop 
greater popular participation in public affairs through a 
network of consultation boards and committees, which provided 
advice on all areas of government activity. Elected 
representation at local level was enhanced in 1973 when the 
Urban Council was reconstituted with a mix of elected and 
appointed members and granted financial autonomy. In 1982 the 
District Boards were established as statutory bodies on a 
territory-wide basis. The development of the local 
administrative structure was completed in 1986, with the 
establishment of the Regional Council with functions in the New 
Territories comparable to those of the Urban Council. Elections 
to a proportion of the seats on these bodies were on a 
geographical constituency basis, with all eligible residents of 
21 years and over having the vote. 
  (b) 1984-1991 
  4. Two issues in particular stimulated demand for a faster 
pace of democratisation. First, the Sino-British negotiations 
over the future of Hong Kong, which culminated in the Joint 
Declaration signed in 1984. Second, the events of Tiananmen 
Square in 1989. 
  5. The Joint Declaration set the broad framework for Hong 
Kong's democratic development. It laid down that the 
Legislature--still fully appointed in 1984--would be 
"constituted by elections" in 1997. With that framework in 
place, the Hong Kong Government issued a Green Paper as a basis 
for public consultation on the next stage of development of 
representative government. The subsequent White Paper announced 
that membership of the 1985 Legislative Council would be 
increased from 47 to 56; that official membership would be 
reduced from 18 to 10 and appointed membership from 29 to 22; 
and that 24 members should be elected indirectly 12 by an 
Electoral College and 12 by functional constituencies. The 
White Paper also noted that the consultation exercise had 
revealed "strong public support for the idea of direct elections 
but little support for such elections in the immediate future". 
The question of whether direct elections should be introduced 
at the Legislative Council elections due in 1988 was explicitly 
left open for consideration in a further review in 1987. 
  6. After 1984, there was increasing public debate on the 
question of elections in Hong Kong. The 1985 Legislative 
Council was more active than its predecessors, and debated this 
and other important issues openly, rather than in closed session. 
  7. During this period China's Basic Law for the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region (SAR), which will enter into force 
on the transfer of sovereignty on 1 July 1997, was being 
developed by the Basic Law Drafting Committee, appointed by the 
Chinese National People's Congress in 1985. A Basic Law 
Consultative Committee was formed in Hong Kong to reflect the 
views of Hong Kong people to the Drafting Committee. A first 
draft of the Basic Law came out in 1988, and the Basic Law was 
finally promulgated in April 1990. It spells out more fully the 
constitutional arrangements for post-1997 Hong Kong as promised 
in the Joint Declaration. A "Decision of the National People's 
Congress", annexed to the Basic Law, set out in some detail the 
method for forming the first legislature of the Hong Kong SAR in 
July 1997, including its composition. The Decision also set out 
the basis on which members of the Legislative Council elected in 
1995 could serve through 1997 to 1999 (the so-called through 
train concept). The text of this Decision is at Annex 2. The 
provisions of the Basic Law and the associated Decision of the 
National People's Congress therefore have important implications 
for the electoral arrangements to be put in place by the Hong 
Kong Government before 1997, given the objective of continuity 
and a smooth transition of government institutions. 
  8. The review of developments in representative government 
took place in 1987. It generated considerable public interest. 
The Hong Kong Government published a further Green Paper. 
After extensive public debate, the resulting 1988 White Paper 
concluded that although there was wide support in the community 
for the principle of some directly-elected members in the 
Legislative Council, opinion was sharply divided as to the 
timing of their introduction. The Hong Kong Government decided 
to postpone the introduction of directly-elected members to the 
Council until 1991, in order to allow the changes introduced in 
1985 to settle down further. The White Paper recommended an 
increase in the number of functional constituency seats in 1988 
and the introduction of 10 directly-elected seats in 1991. 
  9. The events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 had a 
profound effect on Hong Kong opinion, strengthening support in 
Hong Kong for a faster pace of democracy than that laid down in 
the 1988 White Paper. In July 1989 the unofficial members of 
the Executive and Legislative Councils (OMELCO) [acronym as 
published] recommended that one third of the Legislative Council 
should be directly-elected in 1991 (ie 20 seats) and not less 
than 50% in 1995 (ie 30 seats). This became known as the OMELCO 
consensus. Senior members of OMELCO came to London to press Her 
Majesty's Government to implement it. 
  10. This posed in acute form the problem of how to reconcile 
the clear wishes of the community for a faster pace of 
democratisation with the equally strong interest in continuity 
of the political system in Hong Kong before and after 1997. The 
draft of the Basic Law at that time provided for only 15 
directly-elected seats in 1997. Her Majesty's Government took 
up this matter in a series of tough discussions with the Chinese 
Government in late 1989 and early 1990. The British side 
stressed the importance of responding to the clear desire in 
Hong Kong for a faster pace of democratic development by 
increasing the number of directly-elected members of the 
Legislative Council beyond that envisaged in the draft Basic Law. 
  11. The Chinese side eventually agreed to increase to 20 the 
number of directly-elected seats prescribed in the Basic Law for 
the first legislature of the Hong Kong SAR. This was reflected 
in the final version of the Basic Law published in April 1990. 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary confirmed to the House 
in February 1990 that the Legislative Council would have 18 
directly-elected seats in 1991 and at least 20 in 1995. He also 
said that Her Majesty's Government would continue to press the 
case for a faster pace of democratisation. 
  12. The first direct elections, for these 18 seats in the 
Legislative Council, were held in September 1991. All 18 seats 
were contested. The turn-out rate was 39% of the registered 
electorate of 1.9 million, higher than for any previous 
elections in Hong Kong. The United Democrats of Hong Kong and 
others who had campaigned hard for more democracy won 16 of the 
18 seats and over 58% of the vote, a clear expression of the 
community's interest in greater democracy. 
  (c) The Governor's proposals, October 1992 
  13. The presence of 18 directly-elected members in the 1991 
Legislative Council marked a further important step in the 
democratic development of Hong Kong. When Mr Patten arrived as 
Governor of Hong Kong in July 1992, there was a widespread view 
in the community that this process should be taken further in 
the last cycle of elections in Hong Kong under British 
sovereignty: those for the District Boards due in September 
1994, for the Municipal Councils in March 1995 and for the 
Legislative Council in September 1995. There was intense 
speculation about the new Governor's policy on this. The 
pressure of public expectations, as well as the practical need 
to set in place in good time the necessary arrangements for 
these elections, meant that the Governor had to take action soon 
after his arrival. 
  14. The Governor therefore set out his proposals for 
political development in the years up to 1997 in his inaugural 
address to the Legislative Council in October 1992 (the main 
points are summarised at Annex 1). They were the result of wide 
ranging discussions in the community and had the full support of 
Her Majesty's Government. The simplest way to respond to the 
wish of the community in Hong Kong for greater democracy would 
have been for the Chinese Government to agree to amend the Basic 
Law in order to provide for a faster rate of increase in the 
number of directly-elected seats. Her Majesty's Government 
pressed the Chinese Government on several occasions to take this 
step. But the Chinese side maintained that the Basic Law could 
not be changed before it came into effect in 1997. The Governor 
therefore decided, with the support of Her Majesty's Government, 
to look for other ways of extending democratic participation, in 
conformity with the terms of the Basic Law. Two weeks in 
advance of the Governor's address, the Foreign and Commonwealth 
Secretary informed the Chinese Foreign Minister of the substance 
of the proposals. The Governor subsequently wrote to a senior 
Chinese official, outlining these proposals and indicating his 
intention to explain and discuss the proposals more fully. 
Shortly before the Governor was due to address the Legislative 
Council, the Chinese side asked that the announcement of the 
proposals be delayed until agreement had been reached through 
consultations with the Chinese side. 
  15. Her Majesty's Government and the Governor, however, 
considered that it would not have been acceptable to embark on 
negotiations with China without the Governor having set out his 
approach to the Hong Kong community. The Governor emphasised to 
the Legislative Council that he was setting out proposals, not 
firm decisions, and that he wished to discuss them with Chinese 
representatives. The proposals were well received in Hong Kong 
and by international opinion. In three debates, held in October 
1992, November 1992 and January 1993, the Legislative Council 
voted by a substantial majority in favour of the Governor's 
approach. In spite of the hostile reaction from China, opinion 
polls in Hong Kong since October 1992 have shown continuing 
support for the Governor's objectives. 
  16. The Governor went to Peking as soon after his speech to 
the Legislative Council as the Chinese side were able to receive 
him: on 20 October 1992. He explained his proposals, and again 
emphasised the wish of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong 
Kong Government to discuss them with the Chinese side. But 
Chinese leaders refused any such discussion. They later 
demanded in public that the Governor should withdraw his 
proposals before any discussion of electoral arrangements could 
take place. In the following two months, the Chinese 
Government-controlled press in Hong Kong mounted increasingly 
strident attacks on the Governor and on his proposals, without 
offering any alternative ideas. Statements from the Chinese side 
cast doubt on the continuing validity after 1997 of Government 
contracts and franchises and suggested that China might begin to 
prepare alternative arrangements for the legislature in 1997. 
This public campaign caused anxiety in the community in Hong 
Kong. The stock market fell temporarily, although Hong Kong's 
economic fundamentals remained strong. 
  17. At a press conference immediately after the Governor's 
visit to Peking, a senior Chinese official claimed that the 
Governor's proposals violated agreements and understandings 
reached in exchanges of correspondence in early 1990 between the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and his Chinese counterpart. 
To set the record straight, Her Majesty's Government published 
the seven documents concerned in October 1992. These showed 
that the two sides had reached a common view that there should 
be eighteen directly-elected seats in the Legislative Council in 
1991, but there was no agreement on electoral arrangements for 
1995. These were left open for future discussion. 
<H3>  PART II: Talks between Britain and China on Electoral 
Arrangements </H3>
  (a) Establishing a basis for talks 
  18. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government 
made clear from the outset that they were open to alternative 
ideas, either from the Chinese side or from people in Hong Kong. 
A wide range of alternative suggestions were made by groups and 
individuals in Hong Kong in the months after the Governor's 
announcement. The Hong Kong Government published in early 1993 
a compendium of these alternative ideas and passed a copy to the 
Chinese side. This compendium was intended to assist members of 
the Legislative Council when they came to consider the draft 
legislation which would be required to give effect to the 
electoral arrangements for 1994 and 1995. 
  19. The Hong Kong Government's original intention had been 
to submit such draft legislation to the Legislative Council in 
February 1993. But, early in the year Her Majesty's Government, 
in conjunction with the Hong Kong Government, took the 
initiative to repeat formally to the Chinese side that they were 
willing to hold talks about the electoral arrangements without 
preconditions. This led to intensive diplomatic contacts in 
Peking during February and March 1993 to explore whether a 
productive basis for formal talks could be found. Her Majesty's 
Government confirmed that they were ready for talks on the 
basis, as proposed by the Chinese side, of the Joint 
Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, 
and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between 
Britain and China. They also made plain that in any talks the 
British team would include the necessary Hong Kong Government 
officials, on the same basis as other officials from London and 
Peking. This was consistent with the practice followed in 
previous discussions between Britain and China, including the 
negotiations on the Joint Declaration and in the Joint Liaison 
Group. 
  20. The Hong Kong Government introduced into the Legislative 
Council in February a Bill covering one aspect of the Governor's 
proposals: the establishment of a Boundaries and Election 
Commission. This was passed into law in May 1993. In early 
February Hong Kong's Executive Council also endorsed draft 
legislation embodying the remainder of the Governor's proposals. 
Despite strong pressure from the community in Hong Kong for the 
draft legislation to be published, the Hong Kong Government held 
back publication for five weeks to give the contacts between the 
British and Chinese sides the maximum chance of success. But at 
the end of that time it had still not been possible to agree on 
an acceptable basis for the talks, or that they should start at 
an early date. The draft legislation was therefore published on 
12 March. But it was not introduced into the Legislative 
Council. The publication of the draft legislation was 
criticised publicly by the Chinese side. However, on the basis 
of a further initiative from the British side, contacts resumed 
between the British and Chinese Governments on the holding of 
talks. Agreement was announced on 13 April that the talks would 
be held on the basis of the Joint Declaration, the principle of 
convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements and 
understandings previously reached. 
  21. The objective of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong 
Kong Government in the talks was to establish whether an 
understanding could be reached with the Chinese side on a set of 
electoral arrangements which they could commend to the 
Legislative Council in Hong Kong. These would need to provide: 
  --First, that the elections in 1994 and 1995 should be fair, 
open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. 
  --Second, that there should be agreement on clear, objective 
and acceptable criteria for the Preparatory Committee (Footnote 
1) to apply in 1997 when confirming members of the Legislative 
Council elected in 1995 as members of the first legislature of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1997 (the through 
train). 
  The through train was a matter of cardinal importance, since 
the whole rationale for the talks was to agree on arrangements 
which would provide continuity through 1997. Candidates and 
voters would need to know in 1995 what criteria would be applied 
by the Preparatory Committee in determining whether members of 
the Legislative Council could serve through 1997 for their full 
four-year term. Without agreed objective criteria for the 
through train, there would be no point in agreeing with the 
Chinese side detailed electoral arrangements for 1995. 
  22. The talks fell into four distinct phases. 
  (b) First phase of talks: April-May 1993 (Rounds 1-3) 
  23. The British side (Footnote 2) explained that the talks 
would need to be completed in good time so that orderly 
arrangements could be made to hold the elections in Hong Kong in 
1994 and 1995; explained the Governor's proposals, noted that 
the Chinese side had criticised them but had not put forward 
ideas of their own; and sought specific Chinese proposals so 
that the talks could move rapidly to discussion of practical 
electoral arrangements; and emphasised the importance of 
acceptable objective criteria to ensure a through train for the 
Legislative Council. 
  24. The British side also sought assurances from the Chinese 
side on three further points: 
  --Consultation on the Hong Kong membership of the 
Preparatory 
Committee. This Committee will prescribe the specific method 
for forming the first government and the first Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Fifty 
percent of its membership will come from Hong Kong. The British 
side proposed that there should be consultation between the two 
sides about the Hong Kong membership in the same way as there 
was consultation about the membership of the Airport 
Consultative Committee. 
  --The ultimate aim of election of all members of the 
Legislative Council by universal suffrage. Annex II of the 
Basic Law allows for that in 2007. The British side proposed 
that the Chinese authorities make clear that they would support 
universal suffrage in 2007 if that was the wish of the Special 
Administrative Region. 
  --Arrangements for selecting Chief Executives of the Special 
Administrative Region. The Basic Law lays down that there will 
be a "Selection Committee" for the first Chief Executive and an 
"Election Committee" for future Chief Executives. The British 
side proposed that if the two sides reached agreement on the 
method of forming the Election Committee which would elect ten 
members of the Legislative Council in 1995, the Chinese side 
would use the same model for the future Selection and Election 
Committees for Chief Executives and that these Committees would 
be selected by open elections. 
  25. The Chinese side spent the first three rounds insisting 
that before discussion could move on to matters of substance, it 
was necessary for the two sides to reach agreement on a list of 
principles. They claimed that these reflected earlier 
agreements and understandings. In fact, these "principles" 
would have had the effect of prejudicing the subsequent 
discussion of substance. The British side took the view that in 
order to be productive, the talks should deal with matters of 
substance, that is the practical arrangements for the 1994/95 
elections, on which no prior agreement had been reached. 
  26. At the end of the third round the Chinese side dropped 
their precondition about an agreement on principles, and 
accepted that the talks should move to matters of substance. 
  (c) Second Phase: May-June 1993 (Rounds 4-7) 
  27. The second phase of the talks was taken up largely with 
the Chinese side moving slowly to set out their initial views on 
the main issues. The British side continued to press for a 
discussion of the through train, and of the other three issues 
listed in para 24 above. 
  Footnotes 
  1. The Preparatory committee is, according to a Decision of 
the National People's Congress reproduced in Annex 2, to he 
established in 1996 to prepare for the establishment of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, which would come into being 
on 1 July 1997. 
  2. The term "the British side" is used for convenience. At 
all stages the position put forward in the talks by Sir Robin 
McLaren and (for Rounds 16-17) by Mr. Christopher Hum as British 
Representatives, was agreed between Her Majesty's Government and 
the Governor, acting on the advice of his Executive Council. 
  28. The Chinese position on the main issues is set out in 
more detail in Part III. In summary, their position was: 
  --The provisions in existing Hong Kong law disqualifying 
members of legislatures outside Hong Kong from serving on the 
District Boards, Municipal Councils or Legislative Council 
should be amended so that Hong Kong residents who are members of 
China's People's Congresses could become members of these bodies. 
  --On District Boards and Municipal Councils, that their 
functions should remain unchanged and some appointed members 
should be retained. 
  --On the functional constituencies, that there should be no 
expansion of the franchise in the existing 21 constituencies, 
and that the nine new constituencies should not involve a 
substantial increase in the size of the electorate, and should 
be based on corporate voting. 
  --On the Election Committee, that the composition and ratio 
should follow precisely the model set out in the Basic Law, 
Annex I (which specifies the Election Committee that will be 
responsible for electing Chief Executives after 1997 and some 
members of the Legislative Council) but that the size of the 
Committee should be different (600) from that prescribed in 
Annex I of the Basic Law (800). One effect of this would be 
that Hong Kong Deputies to the National People's Congress, and 
representatives of the Hong Kong members of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference would have seats as of right on the Election 
Committee, even though they had not been elected in Hong Kong. 
(The text of Annex I of the Basic Law is reproduced at Annex 3 
of this White Paper.) 
  (d) Third Phase: July-August 1993 (Rounds 8-9) 
  29. The position in late June, therefore, was that after 
seven rounds of talks the Chinese side had finally put forward 
an opening position on the main electoral issues, but one which 
contained significant gaps and ambiguities. They had also 
consistently refused to discuss criteria for the through train 
or the three other issues raised by the British side. Since the 
effect of the Chinese position would have been to ensure the 
minimum development of Hong Kong's political system based on 
restrictive electoral arrangements, there was a wide gap between 
the two sides. 
  30. The Foreign Secretary took the opportunity of his 
presence in the region for the Tokyo Summit to visit Peking for 
talks with the Chinese Foreign Minister on 8-9 July 1993. His 
aim was not to negotiate, but to focus the talks on the 
essential issues, and to stress the need for early progress. 
The Foreign Secretary set out the principles which would need 
to apply if revised electoral proposals were to meet our 
requirements: 
  --On the Election Committee, that its members should be 
elected fairly and openly in Hong Kong, not selected; and that 
the arrangements for elections which took place within the 
Election Committee should themselves be open and fair. If 
agreement could be reached on these principles, the British side 
would be willing to consider whether an Election Committee could 
be devised on the basis of the composition and ratio set out in 
Annex I of the Basic Law. 
  --On the functional constituencies, the electorates should 
be 
of substantial size. Experience had shown that corporate voting 
could lead to an individual having control over several votes in 
functional constituencies. With very small electorates, there 
was a risk of corruption, of which there had been a recent case 
in Hong Kong. The British side therefore proposed to maintain 
the gradual development of the existing 21 constituencies, and 
would be willing to examine proposals which could meet the 
requirements of both sides. 
  The Foreign Secretary also underlined that the whole purpose 
of holding the talks was to achieve continuity, and that it was 
therefore essential to reach agreement on objective criteria for 
the through train. The two sides agreed to make efforts to 
speed up the progress in the talks. 
  31. In rounds eight and nine, the British side fulfilled the 
Foreign Secretary's undertaking by putting forward revised 
proposals on the Election Committee and the functional 
constituencies, even though the Chinese side still maintained 
their refusal to discuss objective criteria for the through 
train. The details of the revised proposals are set out in Part 
III of this White Paper. Part Ill also explains why the Chinese 
proposals on these issues were unacceptable. 
  (e) Fourth Phase: September-November 1993 (Rounds 
10-17) 
  32. During these rounds, the British side offered further 
important moves on the functional constituencies and issues 
related to the Election Committee (See paragraphs 35 and 77 
below). The Chinese side made some minor adjustments to their 
position on functional constituencies. A discussion of through 
train criteria finally got underway. The possibility of an 
interim agreement dealing with the most urgent issues was fully 
explored. At a late stage, the Chinese side made plain that 
they would only be willing to reach an interim agreement if the 
British side undertook not to take unilateral action on any of 
the remaining issues under discussion. 
  33. The Foreign Secretary held a further meeting with the 
Chinese Foreign Minister in the margins of the UN General 
Assembly in New York on 1 October. The Foreign Secretary 
expressed disappointment at the lack of progress, despite the 
major moves by the British side in an effort to bridge the gap. 
He emphasised that the British side were working for success in 
the talks, but that before the talks could make further 
progress, it was essential that a discussion of through train 
criteria should begin. In response to a proposal from the 
Chinese side, he explained that an interim agreement on District 
Board and Municipal Council elections only was not attractive, 
since a number of the elements also applied to the Legislative 
Council elections (eg voting age and voting method) and should 
be dealt with together. The Foreign Secretary briefed the 
Chinese Foreign Minister on the main points relating to the 
talks on the Governor's Annual Address to the Legislative 
Council which was delivered on 6 October. 
  34. In his address to the Legislative Council, the Governor 
was careful not to breach the confidentiality of the talks. But 
in the light of extensive press leaks, he confirmed that the 
British side had put forward revised proposals on the functional 
constituencies and the Election Committee, conditional on 
reaching an acceptable overall agreement that included through 
train criteria. He emphasised that the British side were 
working for success in the talks, but that for practical reasons 
there were only weeks rather than months left in which to reach 
an agreement. 
  35. In the course of October, the British side put forward a 
further revision of their proposals for the nine new functional 
constituencies, taking account of points made by the Chinese 
side. The details are in paragraph 77 below. They also put 
forward new proposals on the Election Committee, accepting the 
Chinese position that the Committee's size should be about 600, 
and confirming that Hong Kong residents who were deputies to the 
National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) would be free to stand 
for election to the Election Committee. 
  36. In late October, the Chinese side proposed that the two 
sides record an interim understanding on five points: that 
there would be no change in the nature or functions of the 
District Boards and Municipal Councils; that the voting age in 
all three tiers of elections, including the Legislative Council, 
should be 18; that the restriction on Hong Kong residents, who 
are members of Chinese People's Congresses, serving in Hong 
Kong's representative bodies should be lifted for all three 
tiers; that the voting method for the District Boards and 
Municipal Councils should be single-seat, single-vote; and that 
the two sides should record their differing view on the question 
of abolishing appointed members in the District Boards and 
Municipal Councils. On the last point, they proposed that it 
should be for the Special Administrative Region Government to 
determine on its own the number of appointed members in the 
District Boards and Municipal Councils. 
  37. The British side responded rapidly by developing these 
points into a draft Memorandum of Understanding. (The text is 
reproduced at Annex 4.) Given the urgency, this draft was handed 
over on 3 November, in advance of the following round of talks. 
The British Ambassador followed this up by calling on the 
Chinese side's Representative on 5 November. The British side 
explained that they had added one point of substance to the 
original Chinese proposal: that the single-seat, single-vote 
method should also apply to the Legislative Council geographical 
elections. Provided draft legislation on all these issues could 
be introduced into the Legislative Council quickly, a little 
more time would be gained to resolve the remaining issues. But 
a first stage understanding would have to include the voting 
method for the Legislative Council. On all the available 
evidence, it would not be acceptable to the Legislative Council 
or the community to include a proposal for the voting method for 
the District Boards and the Municipal Councils but exclude a 
similar proposal for the Legislative Council elections, 
particularly since other aspects of the proposed first stage 
understanding, such as the voting age and the lifting of the 
restriction on Hong Kong residents who are members of Chinese 
People's Congresses, were to apply to all three tiers of 
government, including the Legislative Council. The British side 
reconfirmed their understanding (which had been spelled out in 
the draft Memorandum of Understanding handed over on 3 November) 
that the formula proposed by the Chinese side would leave the 
British side free to abolish appointed membership in the 1994/95 
elections, and that the Special Administrative Region 
authorities would be free in 1997 to decide whether to reinstate 
appointed membership. They explained that unless that was what 
the Chinese proposal meant, it would be of no value. The 
Chinese side made no attempt either on 3 November or on 5 
November or at any point prior to Round 16 to contest this 
understanding. 
  38. Following a Ministerial meeting, attended by the 
Governor, on 10 November, the Prime Minister sent Premier Li 
Peng a message. He welcomed the progress which had been made 
towards an understanding on the most immediate issues, and 
indicated that for practical reasons it would be necessary to 
reach agreement on them very soon. The Prime Minister also 
noted that if it was possible to reach early agreement on these 
matters, there would be a little more time to tackle the more 
difficult issues, and proposed a more intensive final phase of 
the negotiations. 
  39. The British side therefore sought in the two rounds 
following this message (Rounds 16 and 17) to reach agreement on 
the text of a Memorandum of Understanding. Also in Round 16, in 
an effort to reach agreement on objective criteria for the 
through train, the British side handed over a draft of an 
extended oath of allegiance to the Special Administrative 
Region, to be taken by Legislative Councillors in 1997. This 
draft text (which is set out at Annex 5) built on points made by 
the Chinese side in the previous round. But the British side 
made it clear that it would be unacceptable for the criteria to 
apply retrospectively. 
  40. On the Memorandum of Understanding, the Chinese side 
refused to agree that a first stage agreement should cover the 
voting method for the Legislative Council geographical 
elections. They also said in Round 16 that their formula on 
appointed membership did not mean that the British side would be 
free to abolish appointed seats in the District Boards and 
Municipal Councils in 1994-95. They claimed that there had been 
a misunderstanding, notwithstanding the clear statements at the 
time by the British side on how they interpreted the formula. 
  41. In informal discussion during Round 17, the Chinese side 
put forward two texts for an oral understanding: one covered 
only arrangements for the Municipal Council and District Board 
elections; the other covered the same ground but with the 
addition, for the Legislative Council elections, of the voting 
age and the removal of the restriction on Hong Kong residents 
who are members of Chinese People's Congresses. The Chinese 
side said that in either case, if the British side would accept 
that the voting method for the Legislative Council should not be 
included in the understanding, they could accept an "agreement 
to disagree" formula on appointed membership that would allow 
the British side to abolish appointed seats in 1994/95. The 
formula they put forward was as follows: "The British side 
propose to abolish appointed seats in the District Boards and 
Municipal Councils with effect from September 1994 and March 
1995 respectively. The Chinese side propose to retain an 
appropriate proportion of appointed seats in the District Boards 
and Municipal Councils to be constituted in 1994 and 1995. The 
Chinese side state that, from 1 July 1997, the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region Government will determine the number of 
appointed seats of the District Boards and Municipal Councils in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law." 
  42. This formula was different from that put forward in 
Round 15, notably in the omission of the words "on its own" 
after the reference to the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region Government. The Chinese side made clear in their 
presentation of this proposal that if the British side insisted 
on abolishing appointed seats in 1994/95 the Chinese side would 
in the future establish an appropriate proportion of appointed 
seats. After 30 June 1997 the Special Administrative Region 
Government would, in accordance with Article 98 of the Basic 
Law, determine on their own the number of appointed seats. It 
did not mean that the Special Administrative Region Government 
would in the future determine on their own whether to retain or 
abolish appointed seats; that decision would be for "the Chinese 
side". 
  43. Even if the British side had been able to accept the 
Chinese prerequisite for such a formula, namely the exclusion 
from the deal of the Legislative Council voting method--and they 
could not do this they could not have accepted such an 
understanding on appointed membership. The Chinese proposal 
represented an erosion of the autonomy promised to the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region under the Joint Declaration and 
the Basic Law. It should be for the Special Administrative 
Region authorities on their own to determine by law the 
composition of the "district organisations", including the 
question of what (if any) should be the number of appointed 
District Board and Municipal Council members. This should be a 
matter within the high degree of autonomy that Hong Kong is 
guaranteed under both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. 
In addition, the Chinese side's reassertion, in the context of 
the discussion of a first stage agreement, that we should not 
legislate unilaterally on any matter not agreed with the Chinese 
side, remained an obstacle. 
  44. When it became apparent during Round 17 that it would 
not be possible to reach agreement on the issues covered in the 
British draft Memorandum of Understanding, the British 
Representative made plain that his instructions did not give him 
authority to continue discussion of a first-stage understanding. 
But he emphasised that the British side wished to continue 
discussion of the remaining issues, and proposed that a further 
round be held in December in order to do so. The Foreign 
Secretary sent a message to the Chinese Foreign Minister on 30 
November, confirming that for practical and political reasons it 
would be necessary for the Governor to introduce draft 
legislation on the issues covered in the draft Memorandum of 
Understanding to the Legislative Council in the first half of 
December, and to announce his intention to do so to the 
Legislative Council on 2 December. The Chinese response, 
received on 1 December, was to say that this would lead to a 
breakdown of the talks. The British side emphasised again in 
reply that they were not breaking off the talks and remained 
ready for further discussion of the other issues. On 2 December 
the Governor informed the Legislative Council that draft 
legislation on the first-stage issues would be gazetted on 10 
December and introduced into the Council on 15 December. That 
legislation has now been fully debated and passed by the 
Legislative Council. 
<H3>  PART III: Analysis of proposals put forward during the 
talks [subhead] </H3>
  45. This part considers the various electoral proposals put 
forward by the British and Chinese sides against the essential 
requirements of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong 
Government: that the 1994/95 elections should be open, fair and 
acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. 
  Voting Age 
  46. The Governor's proposal in October 1992 was that the 
voting age should be reduced from 21 to 18 for all elections in 
Hong Kong. 
  47. The voting age is 18 in both the UK and China, and this 
proposal was widely supported in Hong Kong. 
  48. The Chinese side took no position on this issue until 
Round 15, when they accepted that the voting age could be 
lowered to 18 for all three tiers of elections. 
  Eligibility to stand for election 
  49. The Chinese side proposed that Hong Kong law should be 
changed to permit Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's 
Congresses to serve in the Legislative Council and District 
Organisations. But the prohibition on members of other 
Parliaments and Councils should remain. 
  50. The British side agreed in Round 14 that as part of an 
agreed overall package, they would be willing to commend to the 
Legislative Council an amendment to the law to permit Hong Kong 
residents who were People's Congress Deputies to become members 
of the Legislative Council and District Organisations. In Round 
16 they offered to agree, as part of a Memorandum of 
Understanding on the more urgent issues, to introduce 
legislation to that effect. 
  District Board and Municipal Council Elections (1994/95) 
  51. The Governor proposed in October 1992 that all members 
of the District Boards and Municipal Councils should be 
directly-elected (except for ex-officio members in the New 
Territories, who are elected representatives of rural bodies). 
  52. Since their inception the District Boards and Municipal 
Councils have been moving away from a wholly appointed 
membership towards an elected membership. The Governor's 
proposal is fully consistent with the principle of open and fair 
elections, and of the gradual development of Hong Kong's 
political system. 
  53. The Chinese proposal made in Round 4 of the talks was 
that the nature, functions and method for forming the District 
Organisations should remain unchanged. Appointed membership 
should be retained. In Round 15 they proposed a small reduction 
in the number of appointed members (from 31.7% to 27.2% in the 
case of the District Boards). Later in the same round they 
proposed that, as part of an interim understanding on the 
District Boards and Municipal Councils, the two sides should 
record their differing views on the abolition of appointed 
membership, and that it should be left to the Government of the 
Special Administrative Region after 30 June 1997 to determine on 
its own the number of appointed members in accordance with law. 
The British side built on this proposal in producing the fifth 
point in the draft Memorandum of Understanding at Annex 4. This 
would have enabled the British side to introduce legislation to 
abolish appointed membership at the 1994/95 elections, without 
prejudice to a future decision by the Special Administrative 
Region authorities on whether to reinstate them. But the 
Chinese side made plain in Round 16, and subsequently, that they 
could not agree to abolition of appointed members on this basis. 
(A fuller account of this issue is set out in paragraphs 40-43.) 
The British side continues to believe that abolition of 
appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal Councils 
is an essential part of the gradual development of Hong Kong's 
electoral system, particularly as the Legislative Council will 
be composed entirely of elected members from 1995. 
  Legislative Council Elections (1995) 
The "Through Train" 
  54. The British side proposed in Round 1 of the talks that 
the only necessary qualification for legislators elected in 1995 
to continue in office until 1999 should be a pledge of 
allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People's Republic of China and a pledge to uphold the Basic Law. 
This would be exactly the same requirement as that set out in 
Article 104 of the Basic Law for Special Administrative Region 
Government officials, Executive and Legislative Councillors and 
members of the judiciary on taking office. 
  55. The Chinese side initially took the position that they 
would only be willing to discuss criteria for the through train 
when they were satisfied that the composition of the 1995 
Legislative Council would conform to their interpretation of the 
Basic Law. They also pointed out that according to the Decision 
of the National People's Congress on the Method for the 
formation of the First Government and the first Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
(reproduced at Annex 2) it would be for the Preparatory 
Committee to confirm members of the Legislative Council as 
members of the first Special Administrative Region legislature. 
  56. In Round 13, the British side suggested a method for 
achieving early promulgation of objective criteria, consistent 
with the role laid down in the Basic Law for the National 
People's Congress (NPC) and the Preparatory Committee. This 
would involve the two sides reaching agreement on criteria; the 
Chinese Government recommending this to the NPC Standing 
Committee for approval and promulgation before the 1995 
elections; and the NPC Standing Committee deciding that these 
criteria--and no other--should be used in 1997 for confirming 
members of the Legislative Council. The Chinese side said that 
they could not accept this proposal, but that it should be 
possible to find a solution. In the event, they did not propose 
any alternative. 
  57. In Round 15, the Chinese side did, however, finally 
respond to the British side's proposal on through train 
criteria. In addition to meeting the straightforward 
requirements in the Basic Law, including a pledge of allegiance 
to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Chinese side 
proposed that in order to "uphold the Basic Law" a Legislative 
Councillor would need to: 
  --Love China and love Hong Kong; 
  --Uphold the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong 
Kong; 
  --Be dedicated to bringing about a smooth transition and 
transfer of power in 1997; 
  --Support the "one country--two systems" principle; 
  --Not commit (or have committed--the tense was ambiguous in 
the Chinese statement) actions such as opposing the Basic Law, 
or participating in or leading activities such as attempting to 
overthrow the Chinese Government or undermining the socialist 
system on the mainland. 
  58. The British side noted that all these points were 
already covered by the Basic Law. But the essential point was 
that any criteria should be forward-looking; it would be 
unacceptable to have any test of past political views or 
actions. In a further effort to take account of the Chinese 
side's wish for a detailed set of criteria, the British side put 
forward in Round 16 a draft of an extended oath to be taken in 
1997. (The text is at Annex 5.) It builds on the Chinese side's 
points, and makes clear that it applies to future behaviour. 
The Chinese side made no response to this proposal. 
  Voting Method in Legislative Council Geographical 
Constituencies 
  59. The Governor proposed in October 1992 that there should 
be 20 members directly elected from 20 single-seat geographical 
constituencies. 
  60. The single-seat, single-vote method is simple, and 
preserves a clear link between the electorate in each 
constituency and their elected representative. The Hong Kong 
electorate is accustomed to this system of voting, which is 
already used in the Municipal Council and most District Board 
elections. 
  61. The Chinese side proposed in Round 9 of the talks that 
for the 20 Legislative Council geographical seats, there should 
be 20 members directly elected from the existing nine 
geographical constituencies using the multi-seat, single-vote 
method. They refused to accept the single-seat, single-vote 
method for the Legislative Council, even though they agreed that 
it should be used for all Municipal Council and District Board 
elections in 1994-95. 
  62. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong 
Kong Government, the multi-seat, single-vote system would not 
provide a fair and open system. It would artificially freeze 
the constituencies as they were demarcated in 1991, taking no 
account of demographic trends in Hong Kong. It also appears to 
be designed to ensure that seats go to parties winning small 
percentages of the vote. In 1992 the Hong Kong Legislative 
Council itself voted in favour of the single-seat, single-vote 
system for Legislative Council elections and in November 1993 
the main political parties reaffirmed their support for it. 
  Election Committee 
  63. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government 
consider that if the election of ten members of the Legislative 
Council by an Election Committee is to be fair, open and 
acceptable to the people of Hong Kong, two essential 
requirements will need to be satisfied: 
  --That members of the Election Committee should be elected 
fairly and openly in Hong Kong. 
  --The arrangements for the elections of ten members of the 
Legislative Council by the Election Committee should themselves 
be open and fair. 
  64. The Governor's proposal in October 1992 was that the 
Election Committee should draw all or most of its members from 
the directly-elected District Boards; and that the Election 
Committee should be able to vote for any qualified candidate, 
not just for members of the Election Committee. 
  65. This proposal meets the two essential requirements. It 
would also provide a simple solution, since no new electoral 
machinery would be needed. 
  66. The Chinese side's proposal (tabled in Round 7 of the 
talks and later clarified, in response to repeated questions 
from the British side, in Round 14) was that: 
  --The composition and ratio of the Election Committee should 
follow precisely the four-sector model set out in paragraph 2 of 
Annex I of the Basic Law (notwithstanding the fact that 
paragraph 2 of Annex II makes clear that the Election Committee 
for the first Legislative Council is not the same as that 
provided for in Annex I) but the size of the Committee should be 
about 600, not 800 as in paragraph 2 of Annex I. 
  --The voting method would be that each of the four sectors 
would elect three candidates for election by the Election 
Committee to Legislative Council making twelve in all. 
Candidates would not have to be members of the Election 
Committee, but would have to come from the relevant sector. The 
election of these three candidates in each sector would be by 
block vote, using a simple majority system. All members of the 
Election Committee would then elect 10 of the 12 to become 
members of the Legislative Council by simple majority. 
  67. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong 
Kong Government the Chinese side's proposals do not meet the 
essential requirements and would not therefore provide a fair 
and open method of election. It should be noted in this context 
Annex I of the Basic Law requires that the Election Committee 
after 1997 should be formed in accordance with the principles of 
"democracy and openness". 
  68. Following precisely the composition for the fourth 
sector set out in paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law raises 
two problems. First, the Basic Law model includes members of 
the present Legislative Council, not all of whom have been 
elected. Second, it includes the Hong Kong Deputies to the 
National People's Congress and representatives of Hong Kong 
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference. These people have not been elected openly and 
fairly in Hong Kong; to include them in the Election Committee 
simply by virtue of their membership of these non-Hong Kong 
bodies would be a major breach of the requirement that the 
Election Committee should be composed of people who had 
themselves been elected openly and fairly in Hong Kong. It 
would mean that part of the Election Committee was produced in 
an undemocratic way. 
  69. The voting method proposed by the Chinese side is 
self-evidently restrictive and cumbersome. 
  70. Following the Foreign Secretary's meeting with the 
Chinese Foreign Minister in July 1993, the British side 
introduced in Round 8 of the talks a revised proposal on the 
Election Committee. In a major move towards the Chinese 
position, this accepted that the Election Committee should be 
composed of four sectors on the lines set out in Annex I of the 
Basic Law. The first three sectors would be elected by groups 
of functional constituencies. Electors in each functional 
constituency would then elect a specified number of members to 
the Election Committee, as well as a functional constituency 
representative to the Legislative Council. On the fourth 
sector, the British side proposed that it should be returned by 
members of the District Boards, the Municipal Councils and the 
Heung Yee Kuk (Footnote 3). They made clear that for the 
reasons noted above, it would not be appropriate for members of 
the 1991 Legislative Council, or Hong Kong deputies to the 
National People's Congress (NPC) and representatives of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) to 
serve on the Election Committee simply by virtue of their 
membership of these bodies. During Round 14, in another effort 
to narrow the gap, the British side confirmed that Hong Kong 
residents who were deputies to the NPC and CPPCC would be free 
to stand for election to the Election Committee; and accepted 
the Chinese proposal that the size of the 1995 Election 
Committee should be about 600, as part of an overall package 
deal. 
  71. On voting method, the British side proposed that the 
functional constituencies would elect the first three sectors by 
the block-vote method, ie each functional constituency elector 
would have as many votes as the number of members to be returned 
by that functional constituency. Elections within the Election 
Committee would use the single transferable vote method. Any 
registered voter who was eligible to serve on the Legislative 
Council would be eligible for election by the Election 
Committee, provided he or she secured at least five nominations 
by Election Committee members. 
  72. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong 
Kong Government, this revised proposal, although less simple 
than the Governor's original proposal, would meet the essential 
requirements by ensuring that the Election Committee would be 
elected by people who had been elected fairly and openly in Hong 
Kong, through either the functional constituencies or the 
District Boards, and that the elections inside the Election 
Committee would take place in an open and fair manner. 
  Functional Constituencies 
  73. The Hong Kong Government's 1988 White Paper defined 
functional constituencies as representing sectors of substantial 
size and importance in Hong Kong. Her Majesty's Government and 
the Hong Kong Government consider that if the functional 
constituency system is to meet the requirements of fairness and 
openness, there are two lessons to be learnt from recent 
experience. First, corporate voting, which is now used in 
electing 11 of the 21 functional constituency seats, can lead to 
an individual having effective control over several votes in 
functional constituencies. Second, the very small electorates in 
some of the existing constituencies lead to a risk of 
corruption, of which there has been a recent example in Hong 
Kong. It is therefore necessary to provide for constituencies 
of a substantial size. 
  Footnotes 
  3. The Heung Yee Kuk represents the indigenous inhabitants 
of 
the New Territories. 
  74. The Governor's proposals in October 1992 took account of 
these points. He proposed that for the 21 existing functional 
constituencies, the process of gradual development should be 
maintained by replacing all forms of corporate voting with 
individual voters. For the nine new functional constituencies, 
the Governor proposed that the simplest and fairest approach 
would be to define them so that they included the entire working 
population. On that basis, the Governor proposed nine 
constituencies based on the existing classification of 
industrial and commercial sectors. 
  75. The Chinese side's proposals, put forward in Round 6 of 
the negotiations, were that the composition and voting method of 
the existing 21 functional constituencies should remain 
precisely as they were in 1991, retaining the concept of 
corporate voting. They proposed that the nine new functional 
constituencies should be: the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises 
Association; one extra seat for the existing Labour Functional 
Constituency; agriculture and fisheries; textiles and garments; 
Importers and Exporters Association; Kai Fong Welfare 
Associations; insurance; maritime; and sports. These 
constituencies should also be based on corporate voting. 
  76. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong 
Kong Government, the Chinese side's proposals would not deal 
adequately with the problems associated with corporate voting 
and very small constituencies. The nine new constituencies they 
were proposing would add only about 20,000 voters to the 
franchise of 110,000 for the existing 21 constituencies. Some 
of their specific proposals also failed to meet the requirements 
for functional constituencies. Kai Fong Associations are not 
economic or professional groups of importance in the community. 
They would in any case yield a tiny functional constituency 
since there are only some 60 such associations in Hong Kong. 
The proposal for a Chinese Enterprises Association constituency 
is inconsistent with Hong Kong's general approach of treating 
all investors and enterprises in the same way, regardless of 
national origin. It could be divisive to create constituencies 
on the basis of "national" interests rather than economic and 
professional groups. Many Chinese enterprises are already 
registered electors in other functional constituencies. The 
Chinese proposal for an Insurance Functional Constituency could 
only be formed by splitting the existing Financial Services 
Constituency which was already very small. Given the small 
number of authorised insurers in Hong Kong (229) the insurance 
constituency by itself would be tiny. In later rounds, the 
Chinese side hinted that they might be prepared to be flexible 
on the number of corporate voters within a corporate voting 
system. But they were never specific. The British side's view 
remains that corporate voting should in all cases be replaced by 
individual voting, for the reasons given above. 
  77. The British side put forward revised proposals on the 
nine new functional constituencies in Round 9. These took 
account of the Chinese proposal that functional constituencies 
should all be based on organisations, and also built on six of 
the nine specific Chinese proposals. In subsequent rounds, the 
British side offered a number of further revisions to their list 
of functional constituencies, in a major effort to bridge the 
gap. After these amendments, the British side's nine proposed 
constituencies were: 
  --Textiles and Garment 
  --Wholesale/Retail and Import/Export 
  --Manufacturing 
  --Agriculture and Fisheries 
  --Transport 
  --Utilities and Communications 
  --Services 
  --Sports, Culture and Entertainment 
  --Lands/Works/Housing and Construction 
  The total franchise for the 30 functional constituencies on 
this basis would be some 840,000. 
  78. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong 
Kong Government, these revised proposals, as part of an overall 
package, would still meet the minimum requirements of fair and 
open functional constituency elections based on constituencies 
of substantial size and importance in the community. 
  Nationality Provision 
  79. The Chinese side proposed in Round 9 of the talks that 
the Hong Kong Government should implement the nationality 
provision of the Basic Law in 1995, two years before the Basic 
Law comes into force. This provides that permanent residents of 
the Region, who are not of Chinese nationality or who have the 
right of abode in foreign countries, may be elected to the 
Legislative Council "provided that the proportion of such 
members does not exceed 20% of the total membership of the 
Council". 
  80. The British side made clear that it would not be 
possible to discriminate in this way against British nationals, 
in elections held in 1995 while Hong Kong was still under 
British sovereignty. The nationality status of individual 
members of the legislature could change between the elections in 
1995 and 1 July 1997. But the British side said that they would 
be willing to discuss any Chinese ideas as to how this provision 
might be implemented after I July 1997, in the unlikely event 
that more than 20% of members were at that time foreign 
nationals or held right of abode outside Hong Kong. 
<H5>  PART IV: Conclusion and the way forward </H5>
  81. As the preceding section makes clear, many of the 
individual issues covered in the talks were, in themselves, 
technical. But the fundamental difference between the two sides 
was simple. The proposals put forward by Her Majesty's 
Government and the Hong Kong Government were, in essence, 
designed to produce a Legislative Council and District 
Organisations that would truly represent the interests of Hong 
Kong and its community, thereby embodying the concept "Hong Kong 
run by Hong Kong people". The Chinese side wanted far more 
restrictive electoral arrangements, with far fewer voters. The 
smallest of their proposed new functional constituencies would 
have had an electorate of under 100. Such arrangements could be 
manipulated and would not, in the view of Her Majesty's 
Government and the Hong Kong Government, guarantee elected 
institutions likely to reflect in undistorted form the interests 
of the people they represent. 
  82. The argument has been made that an agreement should be 
reached at any cost, on the grounds that the consequences of 
failure to reach agreement would be too serious. As this White 
Paper explains, Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong 
Government have done everything possible to try to secure an 
acceptable agreement. But they do not consider that a flawed 
agreement would be better than none. The consequences for Hong 
Kong of the electoral arrangements proposed by the Chinese side 
would themselves be very serious. 
  83. The central objective of the Joint Declaration is to 
preserve Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and the open 
society on which these are based. At the heart of this, and of 
Hong Kong's success over the years, is the rule of law, and 
equally important the confidence in Hong Kong itself and 
internationally, that this will be maintained after 1997. It is 
difficult to envisage the maintenance of the rule of law in a 
community where the legislative body is neither fairly elected 
nor free from the possibility of manipulation. 
  84. Fairly and openly elected representative institutions 
are also necessary to protect other fundamental aspects of Hong 
Kong's way of life. The level playing field for business, which 
has brought so much prosperity to Hong Kong, and from which so 
much of its international reputation derives, depends in the 
last resort on the ability of the Legislative Council to ensure 
that Hong Kong's economic and social needs, and not closed-door 
pressures from vested interests, determine how money is spent. 
Likewise, Hong Kong's success in recent decades has owed much 
to its ability to root out corruption. The introduction of 
electoral structures or practices which cast doubt on the 
integrity of the Legislative Council could threaten that success. 
  85. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government 
regret that it has not been possible to reach agreement with the 
Chinese Government on these issues. In the absence of such an 
agreement, it is the firm view of Her Majesty's Government and 
the Hong Kong Government that Hong Kong's best interest lies in 
making electoral arrangements for 1994 and 1995 which carry 
forward the already agreed and established process of democratic 
development, which are themselves open and fair, and which can 
command the broad support of the people of Hong Kong. 
  86. Within the limits of these principles, the British side 
were prepared to offer revised proposals during the talks, in an 
effort to secure an acceptable overall package, including agreed 
through train criteria. We tried every means to give the talks 
the best possible chance of success. We tried to secure a first 
stage agreement on the simpler and more urgent issues. When it 
became clear that this could not be achieved, we introduced 
separate legislation on these issues to create more time for 
talks to continue on the other issues. We have now come to a 
point where we must get on with legislation on these remaining 
issues. 
  87. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government 
have given careful consideration to the basis on which that 
legislative process might begin. We would have been prepared to 
commend to the Legislative Council the revised package of 
proposals, if we had secured an overall agreement with the 
Chinese side, including the through train. But such agreement 
proved out of reach. The Governor's October 1992 proposals, on 
the other hand, have been the subject of three motion debates in 
the Legislative Council and were endorsed on each occasion. 
Throughout the last 16 months they have been widely discussed, 
and they command wide support within most sections of community. 
They are also compatible with the provisions of the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, and do not breach any past 
agreements between the British and Chinese Governments. They 
thus remain our preferred basis for beginning the legislative 
process. The Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council 
and the support of Her Majesty's Government, has now decided to 
introduce into the Legislative Council a bill based on that 
package. 
  88. Constitutionally, the Legislative Council has the 
responsibility to pass legislation for the 1994 and 1995 
elections. It will have before it the Hong Kong Government's 
Bill, as well as other ideas that have emerged in the community, 
and in the context of talks with the Chinese side, in the past 
16 months. Her Majesty's Government and the Governor have said 
repeatedly that they do not wish to go further, or less far, 
than the people of Hong Kong wish them to go. We are confident 
that the Legislative Council, in discharging its heavy 
responsibility, will take full account of the wishes of Hong 
Kong people.

"Long-Premeditated Actions -- Commenting on the British Hong 
Kong Legislative Council's Adoption of Patten's Partial 
Political System Bill and Britain's Publication of Its White 
Paper"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- After meticulously 
directing one clumsy "farce" after another inside and outside of 
Hong Kong, Governor Patten, in doggedly defying China's repeated 
statements and acts of persuasion and disregarding the strong 
desire of the people of all walks of life in Hong Kong for a 
resolution through negotiations of the 1994-95 election 
arrangements, finally submitted his partial political system 
bill [bu fen zheng zhi fang an -- 6752 0433 2398 0455 2455 2714] 
for adoption by the Legislative Council [Legco] on 24 February. 
  Meanwhile, Britain, in violating the understanding reached 
between China and Britain for the confidentiality of the 
contents of the Sino-British talks, published a lengthy, 
10,000-word white paper, thus unilaterally disclosing the 
details of talks. The next day, the Hong Kong Government 
published in the gazette the second-phase political system bill. 
  The series of actions are by no means accidental. They are 
an inevitable outcome of Britain changing its policy toward 
China and clinging to the "three violations" stand. They amply 
demonstrate that Britain alone has closed the door to 
negotiations and has taken the road of all-out confrontation 
with China on the question of Hong Kong's political system. All 
Chinese people, including the people of Hong Kong, absolutely 
cannot tolerate Britain's long-premeditated actions. 
  As is universally known, Patten, as early as in 1992, 
shortly 
after he assumed the post of Hong Kong governor, assumed a 
facade of benevolence and, under the banner of "expanding 
democracy," systematically and step by step peddled the 
political system bill in an attempt to change Hong Kong's 
current political system and to promote pro-British and 
anti-Chinese elements in the political arena so that after 1997 
Hong Kong would become an independent or semi-independent 
political entity controlled by Britain but beyond the reach of 
the Chinese central government. His sinister intentions are all 
too clear. 
  For starters, in October 1992, Patten, without previous 
announcements, suddenly dished up the political system bill in 
his government work report, thus breaking the state of 
consultations and cooperation which had existed between China 
and Britain since the signing, through negotiations, of the 
Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong question. As a result, open 
polemics ensued for as long as six months. 
  Then, last April Britain was compelled to begin negotiations 
with China on the question of the 1994-95 Hong Kong election 
arrangements. At the negotiating table, however, Britain 
constantly resorted to double-level tactics, uttering glib words 
while secretly playing small tricks and trying by hook and by 
crook to impede the progress of the negotiations. 
  Later on, when China and Britain almost reached agreement on 
the question of elections for the district board and the two 
municipal councils, Britain raised news issues and insisted on 
including in the negotiations the method for holding the Legco 
elections. It also flagrantly announced the suspension of the 
negotiations on election arrangements for regional 
organizations, and it unilaterally proceeded to enact laws. 
Despite all these things, China still repeatedly stated that on 
the precondition that Britain withdrew some of its bills from 
the Legco, the door to negotiations would be wide open. 
However, Britain ignored the Chinese statements and thus shut 
the door to negotiations. 
  The aforesaid facts clearly show that both prior to and 
during the negotiations, or during the three crucial stages that 
led to the breakup of negotiations, Britain demonstrated no 
sincerity whatsoever for cooperating with China; on the 
contrary, it has gone farther and farther down the road of 
confrontation. 
  Recently Patten took great pains to travel to Australia, 
thus 
more openly trying to create public support and to solicit 
international support for the adoption and implementation of his 
political system bill. On 19 January, upon returning from his 
visit to Australia, he hurriedly submitted the partial political 
system bill for adoption by the Legco. Meanwhile, Britain also 
published a white paper. 

    Over the past year or so, the "farces" carried out by Chris 
Patten were so closely staged one after another that it can be 
seen that they were arranged meticulously and long premeditated. 
  Up to the present, Britain still keeps saying something like 
Chris Patten's "three violations" constitutional reform package 
is aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and 
has comprehensively considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong 
people. How pleasant this is to the ears. However, people have 
long ago put a big question mark over Britain's confession in 
light of its deeds. 
  Everybody knows that the Hong Kong people's maximum 
interests 
lie in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and in 
bringing about a stable transition and smooth takeover of 
political power in Hong Kong in 1997. The "Basic Law" has been 
formulated over four or more years of deliberations and drafts, 
and in the process the broad masses of the Hong Kong people were 
fully consulted and their opinions were absorbed. One of its 
important principles is to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stability. It is stipulated in both the preamble and general 
principles of the "Basic Law" that the socialist system and 
policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong SAR and that 
the existing capitalist system and way of life shall not be 
changed for 50 years. Articles 45 and 68 of the "Basic Law" 
provide that Hong Kong's political system should be developed 
"in light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in 
accordance with the principle of a gradual and orderly 
progress." Maintaining Hong Kong's existing system and following 
the principle of a "gradual and orderly progress" are both aimed 
at ensuring Hong Kong's stable development and at bringing about 
the transition, the takeover of political power, and the 
establishment of a Hong Kong SAR government and a legislative 
council in a state of stability in Hong Kong. 
  Therefore, these principles, which have been expounded in 
the 
"Basic Law" and which have identified with the broad masses of 
the Hong Kong people, are truly those which are in keeping with 
the fundamental interests and aspirations of the Hong Kong 
people. Without consulting any Hong Kong residents, however, 
Chris Patten hastily submitted a political system bill less than 
three months after taking office in Hong Kong. Then, in 
ignoring the call of people from various circles in Hong Kong 
for settling Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements through 
negotiations, he forced the bill through the Legco. How can 
this express and reflect the aspirations and interests of the 
Hong Kong people? 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the 
British administration of Hong Kong will terminate on 30 June 
1997 and that the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. China has 
reiterated that as component parts of the British political body 
administering Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district 
boards, the two municipal councils, and the Legco will 
definitely be terminated together with the end of the British 
administration of Hong Kong. Under the condition that China and 
Britain reach no agreements on the arrangements for the 1994-95 
elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the 
partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or 
any other electoral bill possibly to be passed in the future 
will be brought to an end as the British administration comes to 
an end, and they cannot be extended beyond the year 1997. 
  If Chris Patten believes that this bill can be consolidated 
in the form of the law once it is passed and that the 
three-level bodies produced on the basis of this bill can be 
automatically continued after 1997, this is a badly mistaken 
fantasy. 
  The times are progressing forward, and Hong Kong's future 
destiny is in the hands of the Chinese people, including the 
broad masses of the Hong Kong compatriots. No matter how far 
Britain confronts China over the issue of Hong Kong's political 
system, it can by no means resist the wheel of history, which is 
rolling forward. People on the Chinese side maintain that as 
long as the Hong Kong compatriots and the inland people make 
concerted efforts to properly and comprehensively implement "one 
country, two systems," Hong Kong will have a future of 
incomparable brightness.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 26 (XINHUA) -- A Hong Kong-based 
Chinese official hit back at the British Government for its 
white paper on the Sino-British talks released on Thursday [24 
February] by revealing part of the Chinese version about the 
negotiations. 
  Answering questions raised by local reporters after 
attending 
a seminar here on Friday night, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director 
of the XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch, disclosed a letter 
agreed between China and Britain on the Sino-British talks, 
which was excluded in the white paper. 
  The letter was handed over to British Ambassador to Beijing 
Robin McLaren by the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu 
on April 7 in reply to a March 30 British request for reopening 
talks with China. The letter contains the following five points: 
  -- It is China's consistent position to resolve Sino-British 
differences through negotiations. China has made great efforts 
to this purpose and the British side should be sincere about the 
talks. 
  -- The Sino-British talks must be held on the basis of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence 
with the Basic Law and the observation of agreements and 
understandings already reached between the two countries. 
  -- The talks are matters between the Chinese and British 
Governments and should be conducted with only one Chinese and 
one British official present at the talks. Other officials 
should attend as advisers or experts. 
  -- If the British side tables the political reform bill to 
the Legislative Council for discussions before the two sides 
reach agreements, it will show once again that the British has 
no sincerity about the talks and it means the termination of the 
talks. 
  The letter also suggested the version of a news release to 
announce the talks. 
  The British side had agreed with these points and it was on 
the basis of the five-point document that China and Britain 
opened the talks on April 22, 1993, Zhang said. 
  "Why was the document excluded in the white paper? Has the 
British side abided by the understandings set in the document?" 
Zhang asked. 
  By concealing such contents about the Sino-British talks, 
Zhang said, the British side is trying to mislead the public 
opinion and shift its responsibility for undermining the talks 
on China. "China will surely respond to the British move at a 
proper time," Zhang added.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with unidentified member of </F>
the Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, by staff reporter 
Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 1627): "Undermining Talks by 
Interfering in Internal Affairs -- How Did the British Side Drop 
a Hint Foreshadowing the Breakdown of Sino-British Talks?"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb -- This reporter interviewed a 
member of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] who was attending 
a meeting of the committee's political affairs group here. When 
talking about the White Paper -- "Representative Government in 
Hong Kong" -- he pointed out: The British side's "White Paper" 
asserts that it explains the process of the Sino-British talks 
on Hong Kong's institutional structure, but it actually distorts 
the facts and juggles black and white. Despite all this, people 
may discover from the White Paper that during the talks the 
British side repeatedly and seriously interfered in China's 
internal affairs, with the aim of achieving its inglorious 
purpose of undermining the talks. 
<H3>  It Asked for Discussions on Candidates for the Preparatory 
Committee </H3>
  This member cited an example by saying: The British side 
said that during the first stage of the talks, it sought three 
guarantees from the Chinese side. What were these three 
guarantees? First, the British side asked the Chinese side to 
guarantee that both sides would discuss the candidates for the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [SAR]. As everyone is aware, the Preparatory Committee 
is a special organization formed by the National People's 
Congress [NPC] for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR in 
1997. How can the formation of this organization be discussed 
by the Chinese and British sides? Is this not brazenly 
interfering in China's internal affairs? The British side took 
the Airport Advisory Commission for comparison. These two 
issues cannot be compared at all. He added: As we all know, 
Hong Kong's new airport project will straddle 1997 and involve 
the SAR's interests. Therefore the British side must consult 
with the Chinese side on this issue. The formation of the 
Airport Advisory Commission was raised by the Chinese side, the 
purpose being to obtain the Hong Kong people's participation and 
supervision. This member continued: If the construction of the 
new airport could have been completed before 1997, the Chinese 
side would not have interfered in this matter, which is Hong 
Kong's internal affair. Since this project straddles 1997 and 
requires the SAR to undertake responsibility, it is a matter of 
course for the Chinese and British sides to consult the 
candidates for the Airport Advisory Commission. The British 
side asked the Chinese side for consultations on a matter that 
cannot be compared with the appointment of candidates for the 
Airport Advisory Commission and has absolutely nothing to do 
with British internal affairs after 1997. Obviously, the 
British side intentionally laid an ambush for the Sino-British 
talks so that the talks finally would break down. 
<H3>  It Attempted To Participate in the Appointment of the Chief 
Executive </H3>
  Second, the British side asked the Chinese side to guarantee 
that it would support Hong Kong's general election in the year 
2007. Obviously, this is interfering in China's internal 
affairs. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, ratified by the 
NPC, provides explicit stipulations on the electoral system to 
be practiced by Hong Kong in the year 2007, and it also has 
formulated complete procedures selected and decided on by Hong 
Kong people. Obviously, this is an internal affair of the Hong 
Kong SAR. Even the central government cannot interfere in it. 
How could the British side ask the Chinese side to express its 
stand? If the Chinese side had expressed its stand, the central 
government might as well interfere in the SAR's internal affairs 
in the future. The central government absolutely will not 
interfere in anything within the SAR's autonomy, nor will it 
allow the British side to interfere in the SAR's internal 
affairs, or to determine the orientation and timetable of the 
SAR's future democratic development. All these should proceed 
according to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. 
  Third, the British side asked the Chinese side to guarantee 
that the electoral committee for the Hong Kong SAR's first chief 
executive would remain the same committee for the election of 
some members for the British Hong Kong Government's last 
Legislative Council in 1995. This is extremely ridiculous. The 
NPC already has provided a number of principled stipulations on 
the formation of the electoral committee for the Hong Kong SAR 
chief executive. The detailed provisions in this respect will 
be formulated by the SAR Preparatory Committee, which will be 
responsible for the formation of the electoral committee. The 
electoral committee will be established by the Preparatory 
Committee, and the person to be elected will be the chief 
executive of the Hong Kong SAR. What has it got to do with the 
British? What has it got to do with the electoral committee for 
the election of some members for the last not interfering in 
China's internal affairs? 

<H5>    The British Side's Tricks Are Held in Contempt by the People </H5>
  This member said: After Jiang Enzhu provided a briefing on 
Hong Kong's 1995 electoral arrangements, many members strongly 
hoped that the details of the talks could be published so that 
the Hong Kong people would know the truth. In the meantime, 
they greatly despised the British side for brazenly announcing 
the details of the talks in the form of a white paper. 
  This member said that many members have understood the 
following point after the British side's publication of the 
White Paper: The British side had no intention at all of 
reaching an agreement through negotiations. From the very 
beginning, it placed obstacles and laid an ambush for the talks 
so they would fail in the end, and it prepared excuses so it 
could blame the Chinese side when the talks broke down. From 
the several examples we have cited above, we know that the 
British side even resorted to interfering in others' internal 
affairs in undermining the talks -- a most despicable practice 
in international relations. Is it not all too clear where lies 
its sincerity on the question of maintaining Hong Kong's 
prosperity, stability, and smooth transition?

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Newspapers here 
today issued editorials and commentaries criticizing Britain for 
trying to shift its responsibility for undermining Sino-British 
cooperation to China by publishing "White Paper" about the 
Sino-British talks. 
  The British side Thursday unilaterally published a White 
Paper entitled "Representative Government in Hong Kong", to 
disclose the contents of 17 rounds of the Sino-British talks 
held last year, despite of an understanding it reached with 
China not to disclose to the public the contents of the 
negotiations. 
  The daily newspaper "TA KUNG PAO" in an editorial said that 
"the White Paper was designed to deceive the public to believe 
that the controversy between the two sides is concentrated on 
the development of democracy in Hong Kong." 
  However, the editorial said, the essence of the Sino-British 
controversy doesn't lie in whether or not there should be 
democracy in Hong Kong but in whether the agreements and 
understanding already reached between the two sides should be 
honored. 
  Although the White Paper is compiled by the British side 
according to its needs, it can be seen clearly between the lines 
that the British side failed to confirm the principles set in 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and understandings and 
agreements reached between China and Britain. 
  The British side had agreed that the Sino-British talks on 
the arrangements of Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections should be 
conducted on the basis of these documents, understandings and 
agreements, the editorial noted. 
  Another newspaper "WEN WEI PO" said in its editorial "A 
Complete Fraud" that in the White Paper, the British side tried 
to cover what it has done in undermining the Sino-British talks 
and escaping from the historic responsibility it should bear. 
  Recalling the political development on the Hong Kong issue 
over the past few years especially since Patten took office as 
the governor in 1992, the editorial said, "what the British side 
has done is nothing but a complete fraud." 
  "HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY" in a commentary said that as 
the 
foundation for Sino-British cooperations on the Hong Kong issue 
has been seriously undermined, adverse impact is inevitable in 
political, economic and other fields. 
  For example, it said, the Hong Kong stock market suffered a 
sharp drop as a result of Patten's announcement to publish the 
White Paper and push ahead with his reform package on Thursday.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng 
declared today that under no circumstances will the Chinese 
Government waver in its determination to recover China's 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and realize stable transition of 
power and long-term prosperity of the territory. 
  In an impromptu speech at a reception to mark the 
traditional 
Lantern Festival in the Hong Kong and Macao center, Li said, "I 
am sure that Hong Kong will achieve smooth transition and 
long-term prosperity and stability. 
  "China is not what it was 150 years ago. It now enjoys 
political stability and an ever-growing economy. We are full of 
confidence in the future of our motherland," he said. 
  He encouraged members of the preliminary working committee 
for the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region to work harder and make still greater 
contributions to Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. 
  The preparatory committee is a body of the Standing 
Committee 
of the National People's Congress, China's legislature. 
  Zhu Lin, wife of Li Peng, and Vice-Premiers Zou Jiahua and 
Li 
Lanqing also attended the reception together with members of the 
preliminary working committee.

  [Text] On the evening of 25 February, Premier Li Peng, his 
wife Zhu Lin, Vice Premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing, and other 
leading comrades spent a happy evening with members of the 
Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee 
of the Hong Kong SAR at the Hong Kong and Macao Center in 
Beijing. [video opens with a medium shot of a dining hall in 
which many people, including Zou Jiahua, are seated at round 
tables, whereas some of them, including Li Peng and Li Lanqing, 
occupy a long table. Waiters and waitresses are shown serving 
food] 
  At the evening party, Premier Li Peng made remarks on the 
current situation in Hong Kong. [video shows a close shot of Li 
speaking without a written speech while holding a microphone in 
his right hand and partially clenching his left hand into a fist 
and waving the latter while speaking] He said: No matter what 
happens, we are the Chinese people in 1994, not in 1840. 
Today's China is a country with a prosperous economy and a 
stable society. A bright future lies ahead of us. The wheel of 
history is rolling forward, and nobody can resist it. [Li 
smiles after finishing this remark; video shows attendees 
applauding him] 
  Li Peng also noted: Under the current situation, the burden 
is heavier and the responsibility is greater for the PWC. He 
encouraged everybody to work harder and make greater 
contributions to the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong 
Kong and the prosperity of the motherland. This has been a 
report by Beijing Central Television. [video shows shots of Lu

<F P=106> [By special reporter Fang Yuan (2455 0337): "In Li Peng's </F>
Government Work Report, Passage Concerning Hong Kong Will Be 
Amended in Response to Deterioration of Sino-British Relations"] 
  [Text] According to sources in Beijing, after the Hong 
Kong Legislative Council passed the first part of Governor 
Patten's constitutional reform package, after the British side 
unilaterally publish the White Paper on the happenings in the 
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political arrangements and 
after Patten brought the remaining part of his reform package to 
the Legislative Council, in addition to a series of reactions 
that the Chinese side has made and will make, the relevant 
passage in the government work report Premier Li Peng will 
deliver to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] next month also will be amended correspondingly. 
  Reportedly, in the draft of the government work report for 
soliciting opinions, the passage on the Hong Kong issue is 
placed in the sixth part, entitled "Actively Advancing the 
Motherland's Peaceful Reunification." The Hong Kong issue is 
mentioned there, together with the issues of Taiwan and Macao. 
The gist of the passage is: With time elapsing, the date for 
China to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and 
Macao is drawing near. The British side must bear complete 
responsibility for the termination of the Sino-British talks on 
arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. We hope 
the British Hong Kong authorities will not move farther and 
farther ahead along the wrong course. No matter what twists and 
turns there are, the Chinese Government and people have the 
determination and ability to resume the exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong on time, and are full of confidence in 
guaranteeing Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. 
  By contrast, the gist of the passage on the Macao issue is: 
Since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, 
cooperation between China and Portugal on the Macao issue has 
made smooth progress, and we are satisfied with this. 
  It was generally held that the passage of the government 
work 
report (draft for soliciting opinions) concerning Hong Kong was 
mildly worded and still left some leeway. It was not quite 
different from what Li Peng said at the Spring Festival gala, 
and did not express anything new. As the draft was written 
before the recent political events in Hong Kong, it was expected 
that the passage concerning Hong Kong would be amended before 
the official delivery of the report. 
  Last year, at the First Session of the Eighth NPC, Li Peng 
made a major impromptu amendment when reading the relevant 
passage in his government work report. At that time, the Hong 
Kong governor had just gazetted part of his constitutional 
reform package. Li Peng added the following passage: "Now, the 
British side again has placed artificial obstacles to 
cooperation, and the British Government must bear whole 
responsibility for all serious consequences caused by this 
action." 
  The sources in Beijing said: Because Sino-British relations 
this year have become worse, added to the recent events, Li 
Peng's amended government work report will express the Chinese 
side's stronger attacks against the British side, and such words 
as "it is hoped that the British Hong Kong authorities will..." 
are to be deleted and replaced with a call for Hong Kong people 
to unite and make contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's 
stability and prosperity. It is still unknown whether the work 
report will reiterate the point that the three-tiered council 
structure built by the British Hong Kong authorities will be 
completely brought to an end on 1 July 1997. 
  In short, at the coming NPC session, the passage on Hong 
Kong 
issues in Li Peng's government work report may again include 
something "impromptu" like that of last year.

<F P=106> [By reporters You Xiayin (3266 1115 5419) and Gan Zhebin </F>
(3927 0772 2430): "Lu Ping, State Council Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office Director, Indicates That for the British To 
Spread the Idea That Hong Kong's Government Structure Will Not 
Terminate After 1997 Is To Mislead Public Opinion"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Lu Ping, 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State 
Council, noted here today that the British side is trying to 
mislead Hong Kong people by spreading the view that the 
three-tier constitutional framework the British Hong Kong 
Government is going to set up will not be terminated after 1 
July 1997. 
  In response to a question raised by a reporter in a special 
television program today, Lu Ping said: Britain's publication 
of a white paper to unilaterally give its account of the 
Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong constitutional system 
indicates that the British side, on the one hand, is adopting a 
non-cooperative attitude toward China in the coming three and a 
half years, and on the other hand, is trying to make the 
three-tier councils established on the basis of its own 
constitutional reform package a fait accompli. 
  Lu Ping pointed out: The British Hong Kong Government's 
three-tier councils are bound to be short-lived. District 
boards, the Urban Council, and the Regional Council, as well as 
the Legislative Council, all will be terminated on 30 June 1997. 
We hope the British side will no longer indulge in any illusion 
in this regard. Lu Ping reiterated that China always means what 
it says, so by 1 July 1997 China surely will "set up another 
stove" in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law. 
  Talking about the progress the Chinese side has made so far 
in "setting up another stove" under the present circumstance, Lu 
Ping said: The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the 
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administration 
Region must step up its operation. The members of the PWC all 
feel the heavy workload, and they unanimously agree to speed up 
the working pace of the PWC. As for the "stove," the design of 
it is already there in the Basic Law. Our task now is to set up 
the "stove" by 1 July 1997 following the design laid out in the 
Basic Law. And what the PWC is going to do is to implement 
properly the provisions in the Basic Law, and to strive to 
ensure a steady transition and to maintainthe prosperity and 
stability of Hong Kong through 1997, given Britain's policy of 
non-cooperation.

Kong Branch: "The Prospects for Hong Kong Are Full of 
Brightness--Speech Delivered at a Forum on `The Prospects for 
Hong Kong'"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Respected Chairman Hung Chingyuan, ladies and 
gentlemen: 
  On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of 
the Hong Kong Eastern District Association for People From All 
Walks of Life, on behalf of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA 
News Agency, I hereby extend my heartfelt congratulations! And 
I would like to take this opportunity to express my Lunar New 
Year greetings to people from all walks of life in Eastern 
District present here. I wish you all a happy Lunar New Year, 
good health, and smoothness in everything! 
  In the past year, with the common efforts of Hong Kong 
compatriots and citizens and under the direct influence of the 
mainland's prosperous economic development and a fine social 
situation, Hong Kong has maintained its economic development 
vitality after overcoming all kinds of negative factors. In the 
political field, the past year has not been tranquil. In 
October the year before last, Mr. Chris Patten unilaterally 
dished out a so-called constitutional reform package regardless 
of the Chinese side's advice and objection, thus causing an open 
dispute. Last year, China and Britain held 17 rounds of talks 
on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements. In the process 
of the talks, despite the greatest efforts, much flexibility, 
and accommodations on many issues on our part, the British side 
still obstinately insisted on its "three violations" program 
regardless of the Chinese side's and Hong Kong citizens' strong 
opposition and the severe criticism by farsighted personalities 
within and outside the British Government. It constantly 
obstructed and undermined the talks and announced the suspension 
of the talks when there was no agreement between the two sides. 
It unilaterally submitted part of the constitutional reform 
package to the Legislative Council, thus causing the talks to 
break down. Everyone is aware of these facts. But to deceive 
the public and mislead public opinion, a British Cabinet meeting 
held not long ago and a recent speech by Mr. Chris Patten still 
indicated their wish to reopen the talks. This method of 
deception is unwise and will only enable people to see through 
their hypocrisy. 
  The British side's unilateral publication of the details of 
the talks, which have been sorted out by itself, is aimed at 
deceiving the citizens, misleading public opinion, and covering 
up and shifting its responsibility for undermining the talks and 
Sino-British cooperation. But all this has come to naught. The 
Chinese side has never objected to publishing the details of the 
talks. We said long ago that the publication of the details of 
the talks and the British side's act of undermining the talks 
will not bring any glory to Mr. Chris Patten; it will only 
enable citizens to understand clearly how they obstinately 
persist in the stand of "three violations" and how they 
obstructed and undermined the talks. But the Chinese Government 
has always acted in good faith in diplomacy. The Chinese and 
British Governments sent representatives to the talks, there 
were agreements between China and Britain, and the details of 
the talks remained secret; if the details of the talks were to 
be published, the two governments should reach an agreement. 
Now the Hong Kong governor, who was sent by the British 
Government to exercise colonial rule in Hong Kong, has commanded 
the British Foreign Office to unilaterally take action which 
involves diplomatic affairs between the two countries. This is 
something we cannot make head or tail of. After being ridiculed 
by public opinion, the British side said that the details of the 
talks would be jointly published by the British and Hong Kong 
Governments, to redeem their face a little. We will certainly 
respond to the British side's move. 
  To maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during its 
transitional period and ensure a smooth transition in 1997, the 
Chinese side hopes for good cooperation between the two sides. 
This is explicitly set down in the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, and the Chinese side has made positive efforts 
toward this end. But cooperation is not unilateral. Now the 
British side wants to be antagonistic in addition to not being 
cooperative. This is nothing terrifying. Because the 
constitutional structure cannot converge, the British side's 
three-tier councils will terminate on 30 June 1997, and at that 
time the Chinese side will reorganize the structure of the 
three-tier councils according to the provisions of the Basic Law. 
  Officials from the British side have repeatedly said that 
this will not happen. That is only their wishful thinking. The 
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional Government will 
be a special administrative regional government directly under 
the jurisdiction of the central people's government after China 
recovers Hong Kong and resumes the exercise of sovereignty over 
it; this government will not be a continuation of the British 
Hong Kong Government. It is legitimate and rational to dissolve 
and reorganize the political structure of a government currently 
under British colonial rule. Now Hong Kong's return to the 
motherland in 1997 is less than three and a half years away. 
There is a great deal of preparatory work to do for the 
transfer of power. Hong Kong citizens are generally concerned 
about whether or not Hong Kong's steady transition can be 
ensured at a time when the Sino-British talks have broken down 
and the British side is not being cooperative. The Chinese 
Government has stated time and again that under any 
circumstances, China has full confidence and the ability to 
ensure Hong Kong's steady transition together with the Hong Kong 
citizens and to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong as scheduled. This judgment is based on a coolheaded 
analysis of various objective factors. 

    First, China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty 
over 
Hong Kong is a just cause which corresponds with the trend and 
popular feeling, is rational and legitimate, and enjoys 
wide-ranging support from the descendants of Emperor Huangdi, 
including Hong Kong compatriots. For more than 100 years after 
the opium war, the Chinese nation experienced plunder and 
disasters and was subjected to humiliation. The founding of New 
China enabled the Chinese nation to stand tall among the nations 
of the world; reform and opening up have all the more brought 
about a new look in China; and its politics have remained 
stable, its society is harmonious, its comprehensive national 
strength keeps increasing, its people's lives are improving 
markedly, and its international position is being enhanced. 
Against this major historical background, China's resumption of 
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong will help 
rehabilitate the nation after more than 100 years of 
humiliation; and this is an event affording general 
satisfaction. No force can obstruct the Chinese nation's wish 
for reunification and prosperity. 
  Second, the series of principles and policies for Hong Kong 
announced by the Chinese Government are entirely correct and 
have won enthusiastic support from the Chinese people, including 
the citizens of Hong Kong, and have received extensive 
recognition from around the world. The basic point of these 
policies is to achieve Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a 
high degree of autonomy in accordance with the principle of "one 
country, two systems," after sovereignty over Hong Kong is 
recovered in 1997. These basic principles and policies were 
laid down in legal form by way of the formulation and 
promulgation of the Basic Law. Over the past 10 years or so, 
the Chinese Government has consistently and steadfastly abided 
by these policies, without being shaken by all the domestic and 
external factors or making any change because of the British 
side's breach of faith, which has greatly boosted the confidence 
of Hong Kong's general public in staying in the territory to 
assist in the territory's future development. It is because of 
the Chinese Government's consistency in adhering to this policy 
that Hong Kong has basically maintained social stability and 
economic growth up to now in the transitional period, as a 
result of which the public feel reassured and large numbers of 
emigrants are returning to the territory. The overwhelming 
majority of the people in Hong Kong and investors in the 
territory from elsewhere are full of confidence in Hong Kong's 
sustained prosperity and stability. 
  Third, Hong Kong is an economic center. Its advantage lies 
in its economy and steady economic growth is the basis of Hong 
Kong's smooth transition. As the reform and opening up in the 
mainland are continuously deepening and expanding, the mainland 
and Hong Kong are coming closer and closer together in their 
economic ties and Hong Kong's role as a bridge and link between 
the mainland and the international market is also being ever 
more fully brought into play. As of April 1993, the Chinese 
mainland replaced the United States as Hong Kong's biggest 
source of transit goods and biggest destination of exports. The 
number of Chinese-funded and mainland enterprises which have 
their shares listed on Hong Kong's stock market has 
significantly increased, constituting a conspicuous force among 
all listed companies in Hong Kong. Facts indicate that the 
economy of Hong Kong and that of the mainland have fused and are 
inseparable. Since last year, a series of record highs has been 
observed on the Hong Kong stock market and large amounts of 
foreign investment have poured in. This is not only a result of 
people seeing positive trends in Hong Kong's economy, but also a 
sign of their optimism about the prospects for the mainland 
economy. As long as the mainland economy maintains a sustained, 
speedy, and healthy [chi xu jian kang kuai su 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660] growth, Hong Kong will continue to benefit from 
it. 
  Fourth, after going through the stormy past few years in 
this 
transitional period, the Hong Kong people's sense of belonging 
and sense of identity in connection with their motherland has 
been gradually enhanced. They are feeling more profoundly than 
ever before the connection of their vital interests with their 
motherland's future and interests and have come to realize that 
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity hinge on the steady 
development of the mainland and the harmony between the two 
places. Assuming the posture of masters of their own affairs, 
the people of Hong Kong are, in a manner never seen before, 
showing concern for and taking part in social affairs, 
supporting smooth transition, and opposing any act to impede the 
return of Hong Kong's sovereignty and to sabotage smooth 
transition. The voice of patriotism and love for Hong Kong is 
getting progressively stronger, the influence of patriotic 
forces in Hong Kong's political life and social affairs is 
gradually expanding, and the stabilizing factors are 
strengthening by the day. The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC], 
as a working organ authorized by the National People's Congress 
[NPC] to make preliminary preparations for the setting up of the 
Special Administrative Regional Government, has since its 
founding done a great deal of work for the smooth transition and 
transfer of government in Hong Kong. This signals the beginning 
of a new phase in the preparations for the transfer of 
government in Hong Kong. It has been made possible to a large 
extent by the Hong Kong people's enthusiastic support and active 
participation. Mr. Chris Patten has time and again belittled 
and attacked the PWC and even insulted PWC members. It shows 
that the founding of the PWC is very necessary and all the work 
it does is a powerful check on the British side's attempt to 
sabotage the smooth transition. One may say that if some people 
have the audacity to risk universal condemnation and try to 
create great chaos in Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong will 
definitely not allow them to do so. 

    Fifth, the British side's change of policy toward Hong Kong 
has greatly damaged the mutual trust and cooperative 
relationship between China and Britain, which has in turn harmed 
Hong Kong's and Britain's own interests. This will naturally 
cause discontent and opposition among more and more people of 
insight in Hong Kong and in Britain. Even if the British side 
maintains an antagonistic stance in the coming three years or 
so, it will only have limited power and influence. Any 
decisions that involve issues beyond 1997 made by the British 
side in the transitional period without seeking consensus 
through consultations between China and Hong Kong will 
definitely be terminated on 1 July 1997. This also applies to 
the three-tier councils that will have to be reorganized. The 
British side has repeatedly claimed that if the Chinese 
Government reorganizes the three-tier councils in accordance 
with the Basic Law and the relevant provisions of China's NPC on 
1 July 1997, it will meet with the objections of world opinion. 
But the opposite will be the truth. The side that should 
receive condemnation by world opinion is the British side. In 
short, justice is on the Chinese side, popular feeling is for 
the Chinese side, and the time advantage is also with the 
Chinese side. All kinds of positive factors contributing to the 
smooth transition in Hong Kong are gradually expanding and the 
ultimate initiative is in our hands. Hong Kong's future is full 
of brightness. 
  As early as in 1984, Deng Xiaoping said: "One should believe 
that the Chinese in Hong Kong can run Hong Kong well. Refusing 
to believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can run Hong Kong well 
is a mentality left behind by the old colonialism." After Hong 
Kong returns to China in 1997, Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong 
and a high degree of autonomy will be instituted according to 
the principle of "one country, two systems" and in pursuance of 
the provisions of the Basic Law. "Hong Kong people ruling Hong 
Kong" must be exercised mainly by patriots. This is not only an 
important expression of China's resumption of sovereignty over 
the territory, but also an objective requirement for 
safeguarding national unity, correctly handling the relationship 
between the "two systems" operating in the mainland and in Hong 
Kong respectively, and maintaining permanent prosperity and 
stability in Hong Kong. The criteria for a patriot are: 
Respect for his nationality, sincere support for his motherland 
in resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, and refraining from 
harming Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Therefore, love 
for the country and love for Hong Kong should be entirely 
aligned. 
  In the same speech, Deng Xiaoping also said: "The people of 
Hong Kong are capable of running Hong Kong well. They should 
have such self-confidence. The existing prosperity of Hong Kong 
is largely a result of the efforts made by the Chinese. Chinese 
are not any less intelligent than foreigners. Chinese are not 
imbecile. Do not always think that only foreigners can do a 
good job. One should believe we Chinese can also do a good job 
ourselves." 
  This is a full affirmation of the important contributions 
that Hong Kong compatriots have made to the territory's 
prosperity and also an expression of the greatest trust in Hong 
Kong compatriots. 
  The overwhelming majority of the Chinese in Hong Kong are 
patriotic. The general public are deeply conscious of the 
righteousness of the cause, have a strong national pride and 
confidence, support their motherland's peaceful reunification, 
support their motherland in resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, 
and do not wish to see anything happen that undermines Hong 
Kong's prosperity and stability. Hong Kong compatriots have had 
a glorious patriotic tradition in history. During the talks 
between China and Britain on Hong Kong's future, after Hong Kong 
entered the transitional period, Hong Kong compatriots did a 
great deal of work with utter patriotic enthusiasm. In recent 
years, by supporting their motherland in its construction drive, 
by participating in the formulation of and propaganda on the 
Basic Law, by providing relief for East China when it was 
stricken by disastrous floods in 1991, by supporting their 
motherland in the 2000 Olympics bid, by providing aid for the 
"Hope Project," and by doing many other things, Hong Kong 
compatriots have shown fervent patriotism. To prepare for the 
territory's return to the motherland, the compatriots in various 
circles in Hong Kong have been taking an active part in various 
social affairs and doing their best to help maintain Hong Kong's 
stability and prosperity. The Eastern District Association for 
People From All Walks of Life, as a patriotic mass organization 
that loves Hong Kong, has done a great deal of work in the past 
four years in connecting extensively with the compatriots from 
all walks of life in Eastern District and in helping promote 
Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and smooth transition. It 
has won praise from personalities of various circles. After 
Hong Kong is returned to the motherland in 1997, the patriotic 
enthusiasm of Hong Kong compatriots is bound to be able to find 
full expression in running Hong Kong and accomplish new feats. 
  I believe our Hong Kong compatriots are now all asking 
themselves this question: In this important historical period 
when Hong Kong is about to return to the motherland, what have I 
done for it and what have I contributed to it? And I have even 
more reason to believe that everybody will give the best answer 
with their actions. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> ["CHINA DAILY commentary": "Erroneous Steps"] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) on Thursday 
passed the partial political reform bill proposed by Chris 
Patten. Elated by his initial "easy success," the governor 
quickly announced that he would put more parts of the electoral 
reform package before Legco for deliberation. 
  This indicates that the British Government is bent on moving 
further away from the accords concerning Hong Kong it had 
formerly reached with China. 
  The Chinese Government has reacted to the erroneous steps 
taken by the British side by declaring that any system forged 
under the Patten plan, including Legco itself, will come to an 
end when China recovers sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. And 
Hong Kong's political structure will be decided by the Chinese 
National People's Congress in line with the Basic Law. 
  This is a just and appropriate stand that we, like all our 
fellow countrymen, with due sense of national dignity, voice 
full support. [sentence as published] 
  The British have been vociferous that they only mean to meet 
the basic political demands of the Hong Kong residents, as if 
they were truly the champions of democracy. 
  But this can only incur the scorn and derision of anyone who 
knows anything of the British colonialists track record over the 
last two centuries. 
  The British have been in Hong Kong for more than 150 years 
but have they ever treated the Chinese people there as their 
equals? Why is it only now when they are being forced to quit 
that they begin to show "deep concern" for the democracy of Hong 
Kong? Are they really sincere or do they have ulterior motives? 
If the die-hard colonialists are daydreaming of playing tricks 
to obtain de facto political and economic control of Hong Kong 
after 1997, they should be told that their dream will never come 
true. 
  In the face of the unco-operative attitude of the British 
Government, the Chinese side has affirmed more than once that it 
will ensure a smooth transition for Hong Kong and continued 
prosperity for the area. China can be expected to be as good as 
its word. 
  However, Britain's hypocritical actions over Hong Kong's 
future will inevitably have undesirable effects on Hong Kong and 
its people. The British side must bear all the responsibility 
for any adverse consequences which arise from its action. 
  If the British do care about the residents of Hong Kong as 
they claim to, they should change track and mend their ways.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondent Feng Xiuju: "Patten's Bill </F>
Passage, a Long Premeditated Action"] 
  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- The recent passage 
of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's partial electoral bill by 
its Legislative Council (Legco) was not accidental, but long 
premeditated. 
  The step was taken in disregard of repeated persuasion by 
China and the aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong 
for a settlement of the electoral arrangements through talks. 
  Over the past two days, the British side also published a 
white paper and unilaterally made public the contents of last 
year's 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the arrangements for 
the 1994-1995 elections in Hong Kong. 
  In addition, the Hong Kong Government gazetted the remaining 
part of Patten's reform package on Friday [25 February]. 
  This string of actions is the inevitable result of the 
change 
of Britain's policies toward China and its stubborn perseverance 
in violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle 
of convergence with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and the relevant agreements and 
understandings reached between the two countries. 
  These actions fully show that the British side has closed 
the 
door of negotiations between the two sides and is finally taking 
a road of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's 
political system. 
  None of the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong 
compatriots, can ever tolerate such kind of actions. 
  It is known to all that shortly after Patten became Hong 
Kong 
governor in 1992, he began to sell his political bill step by 
step under the pretence of increasing democracy in Hong Kong, in 
an attempt to change Hong Kong's present political structure and 
pull the pro-British elements and those who are opposed to China 
onto the political stage, so as to turn Hong Kong into an 
independent or semi-independent political entity which cannot be 
controlled by the central government of China after 1997. 
  The following facts clearly show his real intention. 
  First, Patten tabled his political reform bill in October, 
1992, in a sudden manner, without consulting with China, thus 
sabotaging the Sino-British consultations and cooperation of the 
past ten years since they negotiated and signed the joint 
declaration, and bringing about a half-year-long open argument 
between the two countries. 
  Then Britain, under all sorts of pressure, agreed to hold 
talks with China in April last year on the arrangements for 
elections for 1994/1995 in Hong Kong. 
  However, at the negotiating table the British side 
repeatedly 
adopted double-faced tactics. It spoke fine words while 
blocking the progress of talks by setting up various barriers. 
As a result, the talks could not be moved forward. 
  Later, when the two sides almost reached identical views on 
the arrangements for elections of municipal councils and the 
district boards, the British side intentionally confused these 
elections with that of the Legislative Council and unilaterally 
terminated the talks and then introduced the first part of the 
package to the Legislative Council last December. 
  Even so, China made it clear repeatedly that for the Chinese 
side the door for negotiations was open, with the prerequisite 
that the British side must withdraw the submitted partial bill 
from the Legco. 
  But the British side ignored this and was the first to walk 
away from the negotiating table, thus completely closing the 
door of negotiations. 
  The above-mentioned facts demonstrate that the British side 
has had no sincerity at all on cooperation with China in the 
three crucial periods, namely, prior to the talks, in the 
process of the talks and leading to the break-down of the talks. 
  On the contrary, it has walked far along the road of 
confrontation with China. 

    Recently, Patten made a special trip to Australia and tried 
his best to win support from outside Hong Kong for the passage 
and the implementation of his political bill. 
  Shortly after Patten returned to Hong Kong at the end of his 
trip to Australia on February 19, his partial electoral bill was 
passed by the Legislative Council. 
  Meanwhile, Britain also issued a white paper. 
  Over the past year or more, Patten has directed so many 
farces which converged so closely that it is clear that what he 
did was carefully arranged and long premeditated. 
  The British side time and again said that Patten's political 
bill was aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability 
and completely considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong 
residents. 
  It is known to all that to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity 
and stability and to ensure its smooth transition in 1997 are in 
the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong residents. 
  The Basic Law was formulated after more than four years' 
discussions and drafting, and fully absorbing opinions of the 
Hong Kong residents. Its most important principle is to 
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
  The preamble and the general principles of the Basic Law 
stipulate that the socialist system and policies shall not be 
practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and 
the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain 
unchanged for 50 years. 
  Article 45 and article 68 of the Basic Law also stipulate 
that Hong Kong's political system should be developed "in the 
light of the actual situation" and "in accordance with the 
principle of gradual and orderly progress". 
  These principles aim at precisely guaranteeing Hong Kong's 
stable development, stable transfer of its power, and steady 
establishment of the government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and Legislative Council. 
  Therefore, the principles in the Basic Law accepted by the 
Hong Kong residents conform to the fundamental interests and 
opinions of the Hong Kong people. 
  However, Patten hurriedly put forward his political reform 
bill less than three months after he began to serve as Hong Kong 
governor, without absorbing opinions from the Hong Kong 
residents. More serious was that, despite strong appeals from 
Hong Kong residents for the settlement of the electoral 
arrangements through talks, the political reform bill submitted 
by Patten was passed. How can people say that it reflects the 
opinions and interests of the Hong Kong residents? 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
stipulate that the British administration of Hong Kong will 
terminate on June 30, 1997, and the Chinese Government will 
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1, 
1997. 
  In accordance with these provisions, the Chinese side has 
reiterated that as component parts of the British political body 
administering Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district 
boards, the two municipal polls and the Legislative Council will 
definitely be terminated together with the end of the British 
administration of Hong Kong. 
  Before the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on 
the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, the three-level 
bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill 
passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or any other electoral 
bill possibly yet to be passed by the Legco cannot remain beyond 
the year 1997. 
  It would be a vain fantasy to think that the passed bill 
will 
be fixed in the form of law and the three-level bodies produced 
from the bill can be automatically extended beyond the year 1997. 
  Time is advancing and the destiny of Hong Kong in future 
will 
be in the hands of the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong 
compatriots. 
  No matter how far the British side will walk along the road 
of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's 
political system, it absolutely cannot prevent the progress of 
history. 
  China holds that as long as the Hong Kong compatriots and 
the 
mainland people closely cooperate and completely implement the 
principle of "one country, two systems", the future of Hong Kong 
will be bright.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The political 
affairs group of the preliminary working committee for the 
preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region ended its fifth meeting here today. 
  The meeting, which started yesterday, discussed the 
relationship between the administrative and legislative organs 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the method of 
forming the first regional government and the method and time 
for the election of the administrative commissioner and how to 
form the administrative council and its functions and the 
establishment of a consultative committee after 1997. 
  Leader of the group said after the meeting that as the 
British side has shut the doors to talks, the preparatory 
committee will do solid work and start a new "stove" according 
to the guidelines of the Basic Law and ensure a smooth 
transition of power and the long-term stability and prosperity 
of Hong Kong. 
  The committee members urged the Chinese Government to 
publish 
as soon as possible the truth of the Sino-British talks and 
clarify the facts distorted by the white paper published by the 
British side on Feb. 24. 
  They said that it was merely an illusion for the British 
Hong 
Kong authorities to attempt to carry the framework it has 
arranged over July 1, 1997 deadline.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji today urged Japanese firms to increase their 
technology transfer to China to help it modernize the country. 
  "My answer is very clear: I want Japan to give us more 
technology," Zhu replied to a question during a press conference 
at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo. 
  He said he was pleased that a rising number of Japanese 
corporations had began to give know-how to their Chinese 
partners while doing trade with them. 
  Japan ranked first in the transfer of foreign technology to 
China last year, in which 28 percent of China's technology 
imports came from Japan, he noted. 
  "It's great. It will eventually benefit Japan's economic 
development," he added. 
  The advancement of Chinese technology will help upgrade the 
competitiveness of Japanese products on the international market 
since most of the transfer were done through Japan's joint 
ventures with China there, the vice premier explained. 
  Zhu, who is in Tokyo on a nine-day visit, cited as a model 
of 
bilateral technology cooperation the start of videorecorder 
production in Beijing last year with full technology given by 
Matsushita, a Japanese electronics giant. 
  He hoped that more Japanese makers will follow Matsushita in 
doing so. 
  Zhu underlined the importance of Japanese support for 
China's 
reform and economic development and vowed to work hard to boost 
Beijing's ties with Tokyo. 
  He said he felt satisfied over recent years' "marked 
progress" in bilateral trade, which totaled 39 billion U.S. 
dollars in 1993, an increase of 54 percent over the previous 
year. 
  But he said this is still short of its potential in view of 
the present good relationship between the two countries. 
  Japan overtook Hong Kong as China's biggest trading partner 
while China became Japan's second largest trading partner after 
the United States in 1993.

  [Text] Tianjin, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Gao Dezhan, 
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Tianjin Municipal 
Committee, and Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin, met here today 
with Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporean senior minister. 
  Lee and his party arrived here this afternoon. This is his 
first Tianjin visit. 
  During the meeting, Gao said that the investment environment 
in this biggest industrial city in north China is very good, and 
the fields for foreign investment are broad. 
  He expressed his hope that Tianjin would further its 
economic 
cooperation with Singapore. 
  Lee said that the expressway linking Beijing and Tianjin has 
brought the city closer to China's capital, thus giving impetus 
to its development. Singapore will help Tianjin's economy 
through making investment here. 
  His advance party, a Singaporean industrial and commercial 
observation group, consisting of officials of some governmental 
departments and heads of large-sized enterprises, arrived here 
yesterday. 
  Lee and his party, during their visit here, will observe 
Tianjin's investment environment and hold talks concerning 
cooperation in fields of economy and trade, science and 
technology and urban construction. 
  The Singaporean businessmen today started their talks with 
their Chinese counterparts here about cooperation in areas such 
as real estate development, building materials production and 
port construction. Agreements on a number of cooperative 
projects and joint ventures were signed today. 
  By the end of last year, 148 enterprises had been set up in 
the city by Singaporean businessmen, according to the city's 
foreign economic and trade committee. 
  The contracted volume of investment by these enterprises has 
reached 178 million U.S. dollars, which ranks 6th among 77 
countries and regions investing in Tianjin.

  [Text] A first round of bilateral trade talks between the 
ROC [Republic of China] and the United States on the former's 
admission to GATT has ended for the time being. 
  People have been most concerned with issues of tariff 
reduction in agricultural products. Even though they failed to 
respond completely to the U.S.-proposed list of 387 agricultural 
products earmarked for tariff reduction, the ROC has agreed to 
reduce tariffs on 277 items. The tariff reduction rates will be 
more than 20 percent. 
  It has been learned that, under strong U.S. pressure, tariff 
reductions on imported apples will be the largest. Tariff 
reductions on certain sensitive agricultural products, including 
fresh pears, peaches, plums, and processed fruit juices, will be 
relatively low and will be reduced gradually over six years in 
order to lessen their adverse impact. 
  The Council of Agriculture indicated: To counterbalance 
future massive tariff reductions on agricultural products -- 
especially imported fruits including apples, whose imported 
quantity is large -- and fresh fruits that are produced by major 
exporting countries at low production costs, the ROC will shift 
from the existing practice of levying tariffs on fresh fruits in 
accordance with their price levels to a new practice of levying 
tariffs in accordance with their imported quantities, or levying 
mixed tariffs by integrating the existing and new practices. 
The ROC has formally notified the U.S. delegation that we are 
shifting from the existing practice to a new practice of levying 
tariffs on fresh fruits.

<F P=106> ["Notes on a Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping </F>
(5012 0393): "State of Deng Xiaoping's Health and Controversy 
Over His Public Appearance"] 
  [Text]Deng Xiaoping Has Contracted Myopathy in the 
Leg 
  "One of the purposes of Deng Xiaoping's recent trip down 
south (Shanghai and other places) was to improve his bodily 
functions and find a cure for his rheumatic arthritis." 
  That is quoted from a report in the "Notes on a Northern 
Journey" in the February 1994 issue of CHENG MING. 
  Rheumatoid arthritis can be categorized as a "disease of the 
elderly" which is common and does not pose any threat to Deng's 
health. 
  However, through diagnosis, it was concluded that Deng 
Xiaoping had contracted myopathy in the leg. That is an 
uncommon disease and more troublesome than ordinary rheumatoid 
arthritis. Deng will accept medical treatment in both Western 
and traditional Chinese medicine. 
  This news had its origins with Wan Li and Liu Huaqing. 
<H3>  Wan Li and Liu Huaqing Testify That Deng Has Trouble With 
His Legs </H3>
  When Wan Li met veteran comrades in Beijing at the Great 
Hall 
of the People on 5 February, he said: "Comrade Xiaoping's 
health is an issue of universal concern from the top tp the 
bottom in China and also overseas. All men have to take the 
last leg of the journey in life.... The Central Committee has 
made special arrangements for the health of Comrade Xiaoping. 
After a recent consultation by experts from various 
departments, all of Comrade Xiaoping's bodily orrgans were found 
to be normal as was his blood pressure and pulse. Although he is 
approaching 90, his train of thought remains clear, a phenomenon 
which experts believe to be rare at his age. The experts 
proposed that as Deng is getting on in age, it was advisable 
that he should use his brain less; otherwise, it would affect 
his blood pressure, especially in the evening. Recently, 
Comrade Xiaoping has contracted myopathy in the leg and finds it 
difficult to walk long distances. Presently, he is accepting 
medical treatment in both Western and traditional Chinese 
medicine." 
  On 6 February, when Liu Huaqing feted old generals in 
Beijing 
at the Jingxi Guest House, he said: Our former Central Military 
Commission chairman, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is in healthy 
condition. The Central Committee has proposed that Comrade 
Xiaoping cut back walking when he goes out. He has contracted 
myopathy in his legs and is under medical treatment now. He 
still likes to stroll for an hour or so every day. The Central 
Committee has decided to reduce the effects on Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's rest as best it can. 
<H5>  Veteran Cadres's Minds Are Overshadowed </H5>
  When veteran cadres heard the briefings of Wan Li and Liu 
Huaqing, they started gossiping in private. Although both Wan 
Li and Liu Huaqing made remarks to ease their minds, some of the 
veteran cadres' minds were overshadowed. Many people, both in 
the government and the public, hoped that Deng's trouble with 
his legs would not develop further. Others found it 
uncomfortable to hear the word "myopathy." If they believed in 
God they would certainly pray for Deng Xiaoping. 
  This reporter knew nothing about the word "myopathy" and 
when 
some people were terrified upon hearing it, this reporter was 
reminded to consult a doctor about it. A physician from a 
famous hospital said, myopathy is not terrible, not 
life-threatening, and will not necessarily shorten one's 
lifespan. However, there is no effective cure but some of the 
symptoms can be alleviated. Should the disease be found in 
one's lower limbs, it will affect one's ability to walk and one 
is liable to tumble; this being the case, the patient must have 
the support of others when he walks. Another physician gave a 
similar explanation. By inference, he believed that the reason 
why some people were terrified at the mere mention of "myopathy" 
was that they had learned from XINHUA News Agency's internal 
reference department: A Canadian women continuously demanded 
"euthanasia" because of contracting myopathy and committed 
"suicide" with a doctor's aid in the end. The physician said 
that such cases are rare. The physicians said that they had not 
received news of Deng Xiaoping contracting myopathy; but this 
reporter personally believes that, had they learned the inside 
story, they would not have been worried about Deng. 
<H5>  The Central Committee Suggests Deng Xiaoping Curtail Walking </H5>
  It is said that Deng Xiaoping was very confident in medical 
treatment in both Western and Chinese traditional medicine. The 
Central Committee suggested that he curtail his walking; 
however, this stubborn elderly person has insisted on doing some 
exercises outdoors. In the medical treatment group comprising 
the experts, opinions varied. One opinion was that he should 
cut back walking as much as possible; and the other opinion was 
that he could continue walking under the condition that he did 
not become exhausted. Deng Xiaoping believed in the second 
opinion. That was because he would not easily bow before 
difficulties, including diseases; his character has decided that. 
  Nevertheless, Deng Xiaoping's condition is really poorer 
than it was before. A CPC General Office source said that it 
was on the schedule that Deng Xiaoping would visit suburban 
Shanghai's Jinshang Petrochemical Industrial Works and 
Fengxian's Nanqiao on 5 February and he arrived in Fengxian that 
very morning. Suddenly he did not feel well and the doctor 
accompanying him promptly ordered the suspension of the 
inspection tour. That evening, his temperature rose to 39.2 
degrees Centigrade and he had symptoms of acute pneumonia. On 
the morning of 6 February, Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Wen Jiabao, 
and Li Desheng took a special plane to Shanghai to visit Deng. 
Later, they got word that Deng must rest quietly but was not in 
any danger; then they took a flight back to Beijing. 
  A source has disclosed: On 8 February, the Central Committee 
made the decision that Deng Xiaoping meet leading members of 
Shanghai Municipality and extend New Year greetings to the 
Shanghai people at the reception hall of the guest house in 
which he was being put up; however, Deng Xiaoping opposed the 
decision, saying: I can still walk. He insisted on meeting the 
municipality's leading members at the smaller auditorium of the 
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. 
<H3>  Ding Guangeng Indicated That Allowing Deng Xiaoping To 
Appear on TV in a Senile and Weak Condition Was an Inappropriate 
Decision </H3>
  On 9 February, the television newscast of Deng Xiaoping, 
walking with the support of his two daughters on either side was 
broadcast across China, instantly rousing repercussions and 
anxieties. That very evening, Ding Guangeng indicated to Wang 
Ruilin, CPC General Office Deng Xiaoping Office director, and Wu 
Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee secretary, that the 
arrangements had been inappropriate and had resulted in bad 
effects. According to a CPC General Office source, on 14 
February, in the wake of relaying across China the TV newscast 
of Deng Xiaoping's thin, pallid, and dull appearance while 
meeting Shanghai municipal leading members to extend New Year 
greetings, the Central Authorities and related departments had 
received some 3,500 telegrams and letters from all departments, 
localities, organizations, schools, army units, and foreign 
friends, in which their concerns were shown for Deng Xiaoping's 
condition, while enthusiastically wishing him good health and 
longevity. 
<H3>  Jiang Zemin: The Political Bureau and I should Bear Certain 
Responsibility </H3>
  Regarding the arrangement for the senile and weak appearance 
of Deng Xiaoping on TV, Jiang Zemin examined himself in the 
written instructions on a report. He indicated that criticism 
had come from inside the party, the Army, and people at home, 
who believed that the central authorities had made an 
inappropriate decision in making those arrangements; at the same 
time, Jiang acknowledged and indicated that there were problems 
in the central authorities' related departments in making the 
arrangements and that the Political Bureau and Jiang himself 
should bear certain responsibility. Regarding the effects, to 
some extent resulting from this, it was imperative to make some 
assessment and have some understanding. 
<H3>  Bo Yibo Gives Explanation of Deng Xiaoping's TV Appearance 
on 9 February </H3>
  It is learned that Deng Xiaoping arrived in Wuxi's Taihu in 
early December last year, heading for Shanghai later on. During 
this period of around two months, he was under medical treatment 
while meeting leading members of the party, government, and the 
military, conducting inspection tours at the same time. It is 
learned that at a gathering with veteran cadres in Shanghai, Bo 
Yibo made some explanation focusing on veteran cadres' opinions 
opposing Deng Xiaoping's 9 February appearance on TV: Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping was too tired; he would never stop working. He 
did everything for the party's cause, offered suggestions, and 
gave guidance to the new Central leadership tier.... Comrade 
Xiaoping would not rest, that was determined by his party 
spirit, character, and enterprising spirit. We have all 
persuaded him not to overtire himself, including [Jiang] Zemin, 
[Liu] Huaqing, Wan Li, [Yang] Shangkun, and Gu Mu. 
  It is learned that on 19 February, Deng Xiaoping left 
Shanghai for Shandong's Qingdao on a special train. He talked 
with Wu Bangguo and others for some 20 minutes at the railway 
station; consequently, seven trains had to alter their departure 
times from Shanghai station.

  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- By the end of 1993, 
more than 5,000 Chinese electronics enterprises had overseas 
investment, with contracted foreign funds totalling 3.5 billion 
U.S. dollars, sources from the Ministry of the Electronics 
Industry said today. 
  Statistics from the customs department show that last year 
China's exports of electronics products reached 8.11 billion 
U.S. dollars, up 18.1 percent from the previous year; 
foreign-funded electronics enterprises gained an export income 
of 4.43 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 54.6 percent of the 
total export value of electronics products. 
  In the past few years, the Chinese Government has been 
paying 
special attention to the electronics industry, and defined it as 
the state's pillar industry for key development. Early last 
year the State Council re-established the Ministry of the 
Electronics Industry to reinforce the administration and 
management of the industry. 
  Statistics show that last year the national electronics 
industry finished a total output value of 175 billion yuan, 
constituting some 5.2 percent of the country's total industrial 
output value. Of the industry's 40 kinds of major products, 32 
had big increases in output, which included ground stations for 
satellite communications, program-controlled switching, 
micro-computers, telephones and videorecorders. 
  Experts from the electronics sphere said the country's 
electronics industry is now facing new development 
opportunities, for which the reasons are: 
  The state is accelerating the construction of economic 
information systems to improve and reinforce macro-control 
means; various industries are showing great enthusiasm in using 
electronic information technology to remold traditional 
industries; the demand by national economy and social life for 
various electronic products has kept on increasing, which 
provides a broad market for the industry; many foreign companies 
have expressed interest in the Chinese market, and the industry 
has met with an unprecedented boom in foreign cooperation. 
  To speed up the readjustment of industrial and product 
structure, the ministry has defined nearly 20 key construction 
and technological remolding projects, including integrated 
circuits, mobile telecommunications, facsimile equipment, 
new-type program-controlled phone exchanges, and the 
second-phase project of video recorder and video camera.

<F P=106> [By reporter Pan Xiaozhu (3382 1420 3796)] </F>
  [Text] Dhaka, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Bangladesh Foreign 
Minister Mustafizur Rahman hosted a banquet in Dhaka on the 
evening of 24 February to welcome Qian Qichen, vice premier of 
China's State Council and foreign minister, and his party. 
  Speaking at the banquet, Mustafizur Rahman extended a warm 
welcome to the visit by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. He 
described the visit as "an important landmark in the development 
of bilateral relations between the two countries." 
  Commenting on Bangladesh-Chinese relations, he said: China 
is a valuable friend of Bangladesh. Bangladesh cherishes the 
Bangladesh-Chinese friendship very much. As time passes, this 
friendship will continually and steadily develop. 
  Mustafizur Rahman highly commended China for its 
accomplishments in reform and opening up to the outside world. 
He said he believed that China will play an increasingly 
important role in international trade and economic relations. 
  He held that China's rapidly increasing importance in 
international economic relations will be conducive to further 
improving the global situation. 
  He indicated: The Bangladesh people will continue to 
cooperate with the Chinese people and will make joint efforts to 
build a righteous [gong zheng 0361 2973], fair, and peaceful 
world. 
  In his speech, Qian Qichen said that as friendly neighbors, 
China and Bangladesh enjoy a profound, traditional friendship. 
To develop friendly relations and cooperation with Bangladesh 
is a firm policy of the Chinese Government. 
  Commenting on international relations issues, Qian Qichen 
pointed out: Since the end of the cold war, the world has been 
progressing toward multipolarization, and international 
relations have undergone some positive changes. However, we 
have yet to attain peace and development, which are the two main 
themes facing mankind. At present, invigorating the economy has 
become the common aspiration of peoples of various countries, 
and giving priority to economic progress is becoming a main 
factor influencing the development of international relations. 
Developing countries should strengthen coordination and 
cooperation, should preserve peace and stability, should promote 
common economic growth, and should make active efforts to 
establish a new international political and economic order. 
  Qian Qichen expressed his hope: Based on the Five Principles 
of Peaceful Coexistence and guided by the spirit of mutual 
respect and holding consultations on an equal footing, various 
countries in South Asia will properly resolve existing problems 
among themselves so as to further enhance regional stability and 
prosperity. 
  Qian Qichen also refuted allegations spread by certain 
people 
about the so-called "China threat" and about China's expansion 
into the Indian Ocean. He stressed: China has been pursuing 
unswervingly an independent foreign policy of peace and will 
never seek hegemony. He said: China will not attempt to 
establish a sphere of influence or build a military base in any 
part of the world. China is and will remain a force for 
preserving world peace and stability. 
  Senior Bangladesh Government officials, Army and Navy 
generals, friendly figures, and Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh 
Zhang Xujiang attended the banquet.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jing Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- A spokesman for the 
China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee 
[CSSAC] today told the press that the CSSAC does not rule out 
the possibility of having a portion or a considerable portion of 
new shares to be issued this year instead carried forward to 
next year because of changes in the market. 
  The CSSAC spokesman said: The preliminary plan for the 
allotment of the 5.5 billion yuan worth of shares to be issued 
in 1994 has been determined by the CSSAC and the State Planning 
Commission after they held consultations. Based on the 
consideration of whether an enterprise which has transformed its 
operating mechanism meets the qualifications of a listed 
company, and based on the consideration of the capacity of and 
changes in the stock market, the CSSAC will bring the tempo of 
new shares' issue under the appropriate control and will choose 
different times to officially announce the plan for the 
allotment, to process the reexamination of the documents 
submitted by enterprises for issuing shares to the public, and 
to approve the issuing of shares to the public by enterprises, 
as well as their transactions at securities exchanges. The 
spokesman said that after a portion of new shares is carried 
forward to the next year to be issued, the remaining portion of 
shares allotted to all areas for issuance shall remain valid. 
  A person in charge of a relevant department of the CSSAC 
today also issued a statement on a plan by the Board of 
Directors of the Shanghai Dazhong Taxi Co., Ltd. [SDTCL] to 
change the shares that the company has issued and that are held 
by legal persons to B shares. He pointed out: Because the plan 
involves macroeconomic policies on the stock market such as the 
selling of state-owned property to investors outside Chinese 
territory, the combination of the A-share market with the 
B-share market, and the amendment of the law and regulations on 
the control of the A-share and B-share markets, it needs further 
study. The person in charge stressed: According to a relevant 
law, the state has a specific regulation governing the release 
of information by listed companies. However, the SDTCL Board of 
Directors released a piece of unauthorized information, which 
may mislead the public, before the state has decided on a 
definite macroeconomic policy on the B-share market, before the 
company has received its allotment for issuing B shares, and 
after the CSSAC has clearly expressed its opinion on temporarily 
not making an announcement of the information. The SDTCL's 
practice is wrong. He pointed out: At present, the CSSAC is 
working with the relevant departments of Shanghai and Shenzhen 
to carry out a survey and study of how to improve the B-share 
market. Measures for improvements will be proposed soon. 
  Meanwhile, the person in charge also expressed his opinion 
on 
a decision by the Board of Directors of Jiangsu's Kunshan 
Susanshan Industrial Co., Ltd. [KSICL] to allot share 
subscription certificates. He said: The KSICL Board of 
Directors recently decided on a plan to distribute the dividends 
for fiscal year 1993, including two shares to be allotted in 
1995 as dividends for every shareholder who owns 10 shares. He 
pointed out: Share subscription certificates are a kind of 
securities derived from shares owned. Their issue and 
transactions of them as a new kind of securities after a unified 
national stock market has taken its initial shape will require 
us to not only formulate appropriate laws, regulations, and 
operating rules, but also to draw up appropriate provisions for 
the accounting system. In this connection, further work need to 
be done. Meanwhile, the broad masses of investors must undergo 
a process of continuously deepening their understanding of 
various negotiable securities. Therefore, the current objective 
conditions for the issue of share-subscription certificates and 
their transactions on the market do not exist. The relevant 
department cannot approve such a resolution adopted by the KSICL 
Board of Directors. He stated his requirement that all the 
parties concerned comply with the "Interim Regulations on the 
Control of Shares Issues and Transactions." Before specific and 
relevant implementation measures are promulgated, listed 
companies should not make unauthorized plans on issuing and 
allotting securities derived from shares. Relevant department 
of governments in all areas should not handle such cases, 
either. If it is, indeed, necessary to implement such cases on 
a trial basis, the parties concerned should consult the relevant 
department of their local governments beforehand and, after 
that, should report the matter to the CSSAC for examination and 
approval.

<F P=106> [Apparent text of Lu Rongjing's speech at a Spring Festival </F>
tea party sponsored by the Anhui provincial party committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Hefei 
on 3 February 1994] 
  [Excerpts] Comrades, friends: 
  We are greeting the spring festival -- a traditional holiday 
for the Chinese people -- at a time when the people across the 
province are earnestly studying and thoroughly implementing the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the 10th Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth 
Anhui Provincial CPC Committee and in a situation of accelerated 
development of reform, opening up, and modernization. [passage 
omitted] 
  Last year was one in which we, guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, emancipated our 
minds, invigorated our spirits, and seized the opportunities to 
win victories in in-depth reform, economic construction, and 
social undertakings. It was also a year in which a major step 
was taken toward the goal of establishing a socialist market 
economy set at the 14th National Party Congress. Like the rest 
of the country, Anhui witnessed an unprecedentedly good 
situation in reform, opening up, and modernization. The 
province enjoyed political stability and social progress. Its 
economy continued to develop with a strong momentum. Its 
overall economic strength improved notably. It was a year of 
unprecedented growth in Anhui's history. Its gross output value 
reached 94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent over the 
previous year, giving Anhui the third highest growth rate in the 
country. Its total industrial output value was 140.2 billion 
yuan, a 44.6 percent increase. Of the total industrial output 
value, industries at and above the township level produced 94.9 
billion yuan, an increase of 26 percent, seventh in the nation. 
Its agricultural output value totaled 41.7 billion yuan, an 
increase of 8.5 percent, fifth in the nation. Large increases 
were also reported in revenues, export, and peasants' per capita 
income, all of which had not seen rapid growth in previous 
years. Revenues rose 32.8 percent to 7.32 billion yuan; exports 
grew 16 percent to $964 million; and peasants' per capita net 
income was up 26.3 percent to 724.5 yuan. In step with economic 
growth, the province also made substantive progress in 
enterprise, rural, and other reforms and opened itself wider to 
the outside world. It also made major progress in party 
building, spiritual civilization, and other social undertakings. 
[passage omitted] 
  The year 1994 is critical to China's efforts to accelerate 
modernization and build a socialist market economy. It is also 
vital to Anhui's development. For the province, the task of 
achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living and basically 
establishing a socialist market economic structure by the end of 
this century is extremely arduous. To accomplish this arduous 
task, we must work hard not only to raise the major economic 
norms but also to improve our overall strength; to ensure not 
only higher quality but also higher efficiency than the previous 
year; and to seek not only faster economic growth but also 
comprehensive social progress. To achieve this, in the new year 
we must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as a 
guide to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 10th 
Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial CPC 
Committee, further emancipate our minds, and seize opportunities 
to actively but prudently press ahead with reform; constantly 
seek to open ourselves wider to the outside world; correctly 
handle well the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability and between material and spiritual civilizations; and 
elevate our work in all fields to a higher level. [passage 
omitted] 
  Comrades, friends: Building a modern socialist country with 
special Chinese characteristics is our magnificent goal. Our 
future is bright, even though our tasks are arduous. Let us 
rally more closely around the party Central Committee, with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, work with one heart and one 
mind in a pioneering and enterprising spirit for China's and 
Anhui's revitalization! 
  In conclusion, I wish you and your family happy New Year and 
good health!

  [Text] In his recent investigation and study tour to 
Ulanqab League, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party 
committee and chairman of the regional people's congress 
standing committee, pointed out that in regard to the focal 
points of the 1994 rural work, we should emancipate the mind, 
stress real efficiency, change functions, strengthen service, 
accelerate the pace of deepening reform, and fight for reaping a 
bumper agricultural harvest. 
  Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee; 
and Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the regional government, 
accompanied Wang Qun to conduct the investigation and study in 
Ulanqab League. They successively investigated Liangcheng, 
several townships, households engaged in breeding industry, and 
key enterprises; and inspected, on the spot, the construction of 
the three-mu farmland projects, the development of the 
socialized service system, the coordination of cropping, 
breeding, and processing industries, the processing of farm and 
sideline products, and the circulation and marketing situation. 
They heard the reports made by responsible persons of 15 
townships and held talks with some grass-roots cadres on the 
issues of developing high-efficient agriculture and readjusting 
the industrial structure. They also went deep to the peasant 
households to hold heart-to-heart talks with the peasants; to 
ask, in detail, about their production, living, and income 
situation; and to solicit the opinions from the grass-roots 
cadres and the peasants. They encouraged that in the new year, 
the people should make persistent efforts to make new 
achievements and make new headway. 
  During the investigation and study tour, Wang Qun pointed 
out: Accelerating the pace of emancipating the mind and 
quickening the development of agriculture and animal husbandry 
is the principle for guiding the urban and pastoral areas' 1994 
economic work. The setup of a perfect socialist market economic 
system as set forth at the third plenary session of the 14th 
party Central Committee has provided us with the best 
opportunity to accelerate the pace of emancipating the mind and 
the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. This is 
the best external condition. The readjustment of farm and 
livestock product prices will bring about gigantic benefits to 
the peasants and the herdsmen. However, we must notice that our 
internal factors have gigantic potential. To further accelerate 
the agricultural and livestock development, we should first 
accelerate the pace of linking agriculture with animal 
husbandry. We have many typical examples in this regard. All 
this has provided us with beneficial experiences. We must 
cherish and pay attention to these experiences. So long as we 
handle affairs according to the market law will we be able to 
make acceleration in these two aspects and satisfy the people. 
  Wang Qun also pointed out: Our region has appropriately 
improved the agricultural production. Particularly, the 
construction of farmland water conservation projects, the setup 
of the scientific and technological service system, the 
cultivation of skilled persons, and the setup of the market 
system have helped lay a better foundation for agricultural 
production. How shall we be able to step onto a new stage? We 
should [words indistinct] to create high efficiency and high 
economic results. That is, we should take the path of 
developing high-yield, high-efficient, and good-quality 
agriculture. First of all, it is necessary to readjust the 
structures within agriculture, including the cropping structure, 
the cropping-breeding-processing structure, and the 
trade-industry- agriculture structure. It is necessary to plant 
crops according to market demands and to develop the crops with 
good economic results. The readjustment pace should be 
accelerated and the dynamics of readjustment should be expanded. 
So long as the agricultural structure is reasonably readjusted 
will we be able to take the path of favorable cycle. Second, 
the pace of transforming cropping, breeding, and processing 
industries should be accelerated. We must clearly notice that 
the key to developing agriculture hinges on transformation, the 
potential is changing, and the efficiency is changing. Only 
when we firmly grasp the link of transforming cropping, 
breeding, and processing industries will we be able to take the 
path of becoming rich as soon as possible. 
  Wang Qun particularly stressed: The party and government 
departments at various levels, particularly banners, counties, 
towns and townships, and sumu, should accelerate the changes of 
functions, strengthen the service for the people's life, and 
streamline [words indistinct]. The personnel divorced from 
departments are allowed to engage in economic entities. 
Production should vigorously be developed and a large number of 
cadres should be transferred from their work posts. The broad 
masses of cadres should bring into play their wisdom and 
intelligence in the rural socialized service. This is a need 
for organizational reform as well as a need for deepening the 
rural reform. According to the actual conditions, all 
localities should work out [words indistinct] policies suitable 
to themselves. 
  In regard to the issue of setting up a town and township 
overall service system, Wang Qun pointed out: The overall 
service stations of towns and townships are a key link of the 
overall socialized service system. This link has the connection 
between markets and households. So, we should bring into full 
play the functions of this link. We should conscientiously 
solve the problems relating to the service stations; 
particularly work out some preferential policies toward them, 
including distribution and taxation policies; simultaneously 
strengthen the leadership over them; and [words indistinct]. 
  Bai Enpei and Yun Bulong also made specific opinions on 
positively guiding the peasants to enter the markets.

<F P=106> ["Facts on Major Issues of Sino-British Talks Revealed"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman for the 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made public here today facts 
on major issues concerning the Sino-British talks on the 
arrangements of elections for 1994/1995 in Hong Kong. 
  The representatives of the Chinese and British Governments 
held 17 rounds of the talks on the election arrangements between 
April and November last year. 
  Prior to the talks, the spokesman said, the two sides 
reached 
an understanding that the content of the talks would not be 
revealed. But the British side has unilaterally made public the 
content of the talks, distorting and attacking the position of 
the Chinese side in an attempt to shirk the responsibility of 
sabotaging the talks. 
  The Chinese side was thus compelled to make public the 
facts, 
the spokesman said. 
  The long statement of the spokesman consists of seven parts: 
  -- The British side stubbornly stuck to its political reform 
bill that violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
principle of convergence with the Basic Law of the Special 
Administrative Region of Hong Kong and the relevant 
understanding and agreements reached between the two countries; 
  -- The British side attempts to interfere in China's 
sovereign affairs; 
  -- Agreements and understanding reached between the two 
sides 
on the issue of electorial committee must be abided by; 
  -- The original meaning of the elections for the functional 
organizations must be persisted in; 
  -- The issue of "through train" can only be solved in the 
frame of the decision of the Chinese National People's Congress 
and relevant stipulations of the basic law; 
  -- The Chinese side has made tremendous efforts for reaching 
an agreement on the elections for municipal council and district 
boards; and 
  -- The British side deliberately sabotaged the talks. 
  The statement also includes a conclusion part. 
  The essence of the Sino-British dispute over the political 
system in Hong Kong is not a question of whether to develop 
democracy in Hong Kong. Instead, it is one of whether to act in 
good faith in relations between nations and whether to converge 
with the Basic Law so as to realize a smooth transition in Hong 
Kong, he said. 
  The dispute arose from Britain's change of policy on the 
Hong 
Kong issue. Facts will show that such a change runs counter to 
Britain's own interests and will bring about damage to Hong 
Kong, he said. 
  The Sino-British talks have broken up because of the 
sabotage 
of the British side. The Chinese side deems it necessary to 
solemnly reaffirm that in accordance with the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, Britain's administration of Hong Kong will come to 
an end by June 30, 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume 
the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, 
he said. 
  With the expiry of Britain's administration of Hong Kong, 
its 
last district boards, the municipal council and the Legislative 
Council, as part of the framework of the political system 
thereby Britain administers Hong Kong, will definitely come to 
an end, he added. 
  Beginning on July 1, 1997, the political framework of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be formed according 
to the decision of China's National People's Congress and 
relevant stipulations of the Basic Law, he said. 
  In conclusion, the spokesman stressed that Hong Kong will 
return to the motherland's embrace in due time, and no one can 
stop this process. The Chinese Government and people have full 
confidence and ability to resume the exercise of China's 
sovereignty over Hong Kong on time, implement the principle of 
"one country, two systems", carry out the Basic Law and maintain 
long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (AFP)--European Union (EU) 
Commissioner Leon Brittan said here Tuesday that he had received 
"unequivocal" assurances from China that it would not 
discriminate against Britain or any other EU member on political 
grounds. 
  Brittan said he had received the assurances after a heated 
joint news conference Monday with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister 
Wu Yi. 
  At the conference Wu had reiterated Beijing's position that 
the Sino-British row over political reform in Hong Kong would 
"inevitably affect" bilateral trade ties. 
  "I have now had absolutely unequivocal assurances that there 
will be no discrimination against any member state on political 
grounds," Brittan told reporters. 
  The promises were made by senior leaders that Brittan met 
during his stay in Beijing, he said. 
  In addition to Wu, Brittan talked with Vice Foreign Minister 
Jiang Enzhu and Vice Premier Li Lanqing. 
  Brittan said he had also received the "firmest possible" 
assurances that China understood that the principle of non- 
discrimination, against members and the EU as a whole, is 
fundamental to China's re-entry to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Brittan reiterated that any attempt to discriminate against 
an EU member state would be viewed as "a very serious matter" by 
the Union. 
  However, he refused to specify what retaliatory action the 
EU 
might take and admitted that discrimination "may be difficult to 
prove."

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of 
China, said here today that reform would dominate the 
forthcoming annual session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress. 
  Qiao made the remarks at a meeting with George Shultz, 
chairman of the International Council of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. 
Incorporated, and other council members here this morning. 
  The council also includes former British Foreign Secretary 
Sir Geoffrey Howe and former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee 
Kuan Yew. They have been here to attend the 40th session of the 
council held in Beijing on February 27 and 28. 
  This year, China is taking major steps to reform its systems 
of tax, finance, investment, planning, foreign exchange and 
trade, Qiao told the guests. 
  Some reform measures have been phased in and even more 
measures are being considered and in the drafting stage, Qiao 
said. 
  China is confident of the realization of its modernization, 
Qiao said. However, it is fully aware that to achieve this 
demands strenuous efforts of generations. 
  "We have taken note of the gaps between the workers and 
peasants, and between regions in the east and west of the 
country," Qiao said, adding that "we are trying to narrow these 
gaps." 
  Briefing the guests on the NPC's work, Qiao said that the 
current NPC and its Standing Committee are committed to promote 
the construction of the country's democracy and legislation, and 
to establish an initial legal framework suited to China's 
socialist market economy. 
  Shultz said the fact that the council chose Beijing as the 
meeting site was itself a good indication of the strong interest 
of its members in China.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren met with George Shultz, chairman of 
the International Council of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated, 
and 
other council members here this morning. 
  Shultz and other council members, including Singaporean 
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former British Foreign 
Secretary Geoffery Howe, have been here to attend the 40th 
session of the Council held in Beijing on February 27 and 28. 
  Noting that many of the council members are familiar with 
China, Rong urged his guests to offer suggestions on building a 
socialist market economy in China. 
  Rong said China is carrying reforms on taxation, finance, 
foreign trade and state-owned enterprises. "This is a year of 
crucial importance. If we succeed, our people will be 
guaranteed a relatively comfortable life by the end of the 
century," he said. 
  China, while deepening its reforms and opening wider to the 
outside world, is paying equal attention to the maintenance of 
stability, Rong said. 
  Stability promotes economic development, said Rong, adding 
that economic growth and the improvement of people's livelihood, 
in turn, help to maintain a stable political environment. 
  China is constantly improving its economic legislation and 
investment environment. "We welcome direct foreign investment," 
he said. 
  Recalling China's fruitful cooperation with the J.P. Morgan 
Company, Rong voiced the hope that the company would continue to 
play a role in China's economic development. 
  Shultz said all the members of the Council which is made up 
of renowned political and business figures from around the 
world, without exception, are interested in China.

  [Text] London, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Four Serb warplanes, 
which were bombing a Muslim munitions factory, were shot down 
today by NATO jet fighters enforcing a U.N. ban on military 
flights over Bosnia, according to the REUTERS news agency. 
  The action marked the first Western military intervention in 
the 22-month-old conflict in Bosnia, and NATO's first combat 
action since it was founded in 1949. 
  NATO said two U.S. F-16 fighters first warned and then shot 
down four Galeb light attack aircraft early this morning near 
Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia. 
  U.N. sources in Zagreb told REUTERS the Serb planes had 
apparently attacked a Muslim-controlled ammunition factory in 
central Bosnia shortly before they were downed. 
  NATO said the two U.S. F-16s had taken off from an Italian 
air base on a patrol mission to enforce the U.N. no-fly zone 
over Bosnia, which has been in effect since last April. 
  The U.N. ban was aimed at preventing the Bosnian warring 
factions from using aircraft in the conflict. There have been 
some violations, mostly by helicopters flying short trips, but 
NATO had not taken action against them. 
  Hours after the downing of the planes, Bosnian Serb forces 
began heavily shelling the center of the Muslim stronghold city 
of Tuzla, where the U.N. wants to reopen the airport for aid 
flights. 
  Meanwhile, the U.N. has suspended aid flights to Sarajevo 
and 
has cancelled convoys through Serb-held areas of Bosnia. 
  NATO did not carry out threatened air strikes against Serb 
forces after the February 21 deadline passed as the Serbs 
complied with NATO's demand that their heavy weapons be 
withdrawn from around Sarajevo, or be placed under U.N. control. 
  However, a U.N. official said today that the Serbs had 
driven 
at least six tanks out of the exclusion zone in violation of the 
NATO ultimatum and the U.N.-brokered ceasefire agreement with 
the Muslims.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 28 (XINHUA) -- A Serb military 
spokesman said today that the four warplanes shot down by NATO 
fighter jets did not belong to the Serbian Air Forces. 
  Nebojsha Radmanovich, spokesman for the Serb military press 
center in Banja Luka, near where the four planes were downed, 
said that Serb planes did not fly today. 
  NATO said two U.S. F-16 fighters first warned and then shot 
down four Galeb light attack aircraft early this morning near 
Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia. 
  This was the first Western military intervention in the 
22-month-long conflict, and NATO's first combat action since it 
was founded in 1949. 
  U.N. sources in Zagreb said the Serb planes had apparently 
attacked a Muslim-controlled ammunition factory in central 
Bosnia shortly before being shot down. 
  Muslim radio in Sarajevo also reported that Serb planes this 
morning attacked Muslim targets in central Bosnia. 
  But Serb military personnel said all their warplanes were 
under the supervision of United Nations observers, and that if 
the planes took off they could not escape detection by the 
observers. 
  NATO jets have flown more than 1,000 sorties over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina since last April when the no-fly zone 
injunction took effect. 
  NATO said it will continue to take military action against 
any plane that intrudes into the no-fly zone.

  [Text] Geneva, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The co-chairmen of 
the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Thorvald 
Stoltenberg and David Owen, said today that the NATO action of 
shooting down four Serb warplanes was "entirely justified". 
  The co-chairmen said in a statement that "the presence of 
six 
military jet aircraft detected and engaged by NATO aircraft this 
morning was a violation of United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 781." 
  "The action by NATO was clearly authorised by UN Security 
Council Resolution 816 which was aimed at ensuring compliance 
with the ban proportionate to the specific circumstances and the 
nature of the flights," said the statement. 
  "Today's action was entirely justified and should not be 
used 
by any of the parties to distract from the pressing need to 
negotiate a settlement to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
they stressed. 
  On 6 October 1992, the U.N. Security Council passed 
Resolution 781 which banned all unauthorised flights over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. A week later, on 13 October, the Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic gave his assurance, in a meeting with the 
co-chairmen in Geneva, that Bosnian Serb fixed-wing aircraft 
would not violate the U.N. ban, according to the co-chairmen's 
statement.

  [Text] United Nations, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The 
presence of six military jet aircraft detected and engaged by 
NATO aircraft this morning was a violation of UN Security 
Council resolution, the spokesman for the co-chairmen of the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia said today. 
  According to news release from Geneva available here, the 
spokesman said the NATO's shotdown of four of the six aircraft 
over central Bosnia early this morning was clearly authorized by 
UN Security Council Resolution 816, which was aimed at ensuring 
compliance with the ban "proportionate to the specific 
circumstances and the nature of the flights." 
  "Today's action was entirely justified and should not be 
used 
by any of the parties to distract from the pressing need to 
negotiate a settlement to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
he said. 
  According to the information director of the UN Protection 
Force in the Former Yugoslavia (Unprofor), the NATO planes were 
patrolling the "no-fly" zone over Bosnia when the incident 
occurred. It was the first time that NATO warplanes have taken 
this action since the "no-fly" zone was declared in October 1992. 
  The Unprofor said the NATO aircraft encountered six Galeb 
aircraft. They challenged them and warned them twice that they 
were flying in violation of the Security Council resolution on 
the issue.

  [Text] Wellington, March 1 (XINHUA) -- New Zealand today 
voiced its backing for NATO's action yesterday in shooting down 
four military planes said to be flown by Bosnian Serbs. 
  Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said NATO was acting within 
the 
mandate of the Security Council resolution passed last March 
when New Zealand acted as president. 
  "They (the aircraft) were warned, they ignored it and they 
have paid the price," he said. 
  "The resolution really sent two signals -- that the Security 
Council would not tolerate violations of its resolutions and 
decisions and that the best course was to stop fighting and 
instead work on setting differences by negotiation," the 
minister added. 
  NATO said its fighters yesterday shot down four Serb 
warplanes which were conducting a bombing raid over Bosnia.

  [Text] Bonn, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The German Government 
expressed hopes today that the peace process in former 
Yugoslavia will not be held up by the shooting down of four 
aircraft over Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Government spokesman Dieter Vogel told a news briefing here 
that the peace process cannot be broken off. 
  He said the four planes, identified as Bosnian Serb but 
denied by them, clearly violated the UN Security Council 
resolution banning flights over the war-torn area in Bosnia. 
  NATO said the aircraft were Bosnian Serb planes and had 
carried out a bombing raid on Muslim-held territory. 
  Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SDP), while condoning 
the attack, nevertheless described it as a serious incident. 
  "Military action is always accompanied by the danger of it 
escalating," the SDP leadership said in a statement. It hoped 
the incident would clear the way for a political solution to the 
Bosnian conflict. 
  Germany has joined other NATO countries in enforcing the 
Bosnian no-fly zone, but its participation is limited to the use 
of its airmen on AWACS planes.

  [Text] Madrid, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Spanish Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez expressed his approval here today after 
U.S.-piloted jets shot down four Serbian warplanes, but he 
warned against reoccurrence of such action. 
  The incident should not repeat itself, Gonzalez said, adding 
that a tense atmosphere would undermine the budding hope of a 
long-waited peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The prime minister noted that the incident indicated the UN 
ban on air flights over Bosnia ought not to be violated. "In 
fact, the air attack is in strictly keeping with the resolution 
of the UN Security Council," he said. 
  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana also attributed 
NATO's 
air attack to Serbs' violation of the no-fly zone and emphasized 
that it should not undermine the favorable turn resulting from 
the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo. 
  The attack occurred today as American pilots saw "bombing 
maneuvers" of the planes and explosions on the ground. One 
American F-16 fighter jet shot down three planes and a second 
downed a fourth. 
  It was the first time NATO used its military might in the 
23-month-old Bosnia war and its 44-year history.

  [Text] Canberra, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Australian Foreign 
Minister Gareth Evans today urged all parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to "press ahead urgently with the peace 
process". 
  The war-torn nation needs a negotiated settlement to end the 
tragic conflict, Evans said in a statement after U.S. planes 
shot down four military aircraft in Bosnia yesterday. 
  He regarded the action as "in strict accordance with the 
provisions of the U.N.-imposed no fly zone in Bosnia". 
  Meanwhile, he called upon all parties concerned in the 
country not to take any retaliatory action against the U.N. 
Forces or international relief efforts. 
  "It is essential that the humanitarian effort be allowed to 
continue uninterrupted and that the current momentum for 
restoring peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina continue," Evans said.

  [Text] Moscow, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry is still analyzing the Bosnian developments, following 
the downing of four planes by NATO fighters in restricted 
"no-fly" zone, a spokesman said today. 
  The spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed that 
"no matter what side had carried out an air raid in Bosnia in 
violation of respective U.N. Security Council resolutions on the 
`no-fly' zone, it shall bear all responsibility for that." 
  "According to the available information as of this hour, 
aviation controlling the `no-fly' zone in the air space of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina shot down planes-violators this morning, 
while carrying out bomb strikes near the city of Travinik, that 
is in the zone of Moslem-Croatian fighting," the spokesman said. 
  He said: "At the same time, there have been statements that 
these planes could have belonged to Bosnian Serbs, although 
their military commanders denied such a possibility, work is 
under way to investigate into the circumstances of the incident." 
  According to an ITAR-TASS news agency report from Belgrade, 
the Bosnian Serbs army headquarters said its air force planes 
did not take off from the air base in Banja Luka on Monday [28 
February]. 
  It said this could be proved by U.N. observers at the air 
base, Banja Luka is the only air base of Bosnian Serbs which is 
now under U.N. control, the ITAR-TASS said. Their planes cannot 
perform flights without U.N. consent as envisaged by U.N. 
Security Council resolution on the "no-fly" zone in the former 
Yugoslav republic adopted about 18 months ago, the news agency 
added.

  [Text] Moscow, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said today Russia has consistently opposed any 
air action in Bosnia and warned that violators of a peace plan 
for the Bosnian crisis should realize the grave consequences of 
such behavior. 
  Kozyrev made the remarks at a press conference here when 
talking about the downing of four aircraft earlier today by two 
U.S. F-16 fighters in the no-fly zone over Bosnia. 
  He said that as aircraft will inevitably appear in the 
region 
sooner or later, it has become more necessary to solve all the 
issues in Bosnia through peaceful means. 
  Violators of a peace approach should realize the grave 
consequences of their behavior, he warned. 
  Kozyrev said it cannot be confirmed that the aircraft shot 
down came from the Bosnian Serb side because all the three 
warring parties possess such planes.

  [Text] Sofia, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The Bulgarian 
Government said Monday [28 February] that it is deeply concerned 
over the violation of the no-fly zone imposed over Bosnia by the 
United Nations. 
  It was reported earlier today that two NATO F-16 fighters 
shot down four alleged Bosnian Serb aircraft over Banja Luka in 
Bosnia. 
  A statement issued by Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry about the 
action carried out by NATO said the UN resolutions enforcing a 
no-fly zone, numbers 781 and 816, were part of the efforts made 
by the international community to find a peaceful settlement to 
the Bosnia crisis. 
  It appealed for a strict compliance of these resolutions and 
hoped that the incident will not jeopardize the on-going peace 
process for an end to the military conflict in Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 27 (XINHUA) -- The United 
Nations will open a key bridge in Sarajevo on Monday [28 
February] "for UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) vehicles and 
pedestrians," said a U.N. spokesman. 
  The opening of the bridge of "brotherhood and unity" will 
for 
the first time link the Muslim-dominated inner-city area with 
the part held by the Serbs in Sarajevo since the Bosnian capital 
came under siege in April 1992. 
  "Both sides have agreed to the opening" beginning Monday 
noon, Spokesman Rob Annink said. 
  The bridge, now cleared of mines, will be guarded by UN 
peacekeepers and Muslim and Serb troops, with access to the 
bridge controlled by Muslims and Serbs separately on each side. 
  The bridge was once a no-man's land between the front-line 
Muslim and Serb forces and thus split Sarajevo into two parts. 
Its opening is the first step to restore peace to the city 
under a plan proposed by Michael Rose, commander of the UN 
peacekeeping force in Bosnia. 
  Rose said his next step is to open routes between Muslim and 
Serb-controlled neighborhoods along with the roads in and out of 
the city. 
  Meanwhile, the passage connecting Sarajevo with the outside 
will also be open on Monday, Annink announced today. 
  Reports reaching here said that a UN humanitarian relief 
convoy will be heading for Sarajevo tomorrow via Muslim, Serb 
and Croat-held areas, with passage permit from the warring 
factions no longer necessary. 
  Under Rose's order, the convoy will be escorted by UN 
troops, 
and the aircraft of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will 
provide air cover and resort to "necessary military means" if it 
is intercepted.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 27 (XINHUA) -- A top Bosnian 
Serb military leader said today that Serbs do not agree with a 
UN decision to open a key bridge in Sarajevo. 
  Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of the general staff of the Serb 
forces, described as "not allowable" and "one-sided" a decision 
made by Michael Rose, commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia to open the bridge "brotherhood and unity" beginning 
Monday [28 February] noon. 
  "If needed, we will resort to military means" to prevent the 
opening, he said in a statement issued this evening. 
  He pointed out that the bridge should be opened under an 
agreement to be signed by Serbs and Muslims, with the mediation 
of UN special envoy in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi. 
  According to a UN plan to restore peace in Sarajevo, the 
bridge will be open on Monday and so will be the roads linking 
the city with the outside. 
  Opening of the bridge "brotherhood and unity" would connect 
the Muslim-dominated inner-city area in Sarajevo with the part 
held by Serbs for the first time since the Bosnian capital came 
under siege in April 1992. 
  Earlier reports reaching here said the United Nations 
expected the bridge to be guarded by UN peacekeepers and Serb 
and Muslim troops. 
  Meanwhile, Milovanovic also said Serbs neither agreed with 
the UN-announced new ways for humanitarian relief operations. 
  He was referring to Sunday's decision by the United Nations 
to move relief convoys through Bosnia without asking for 
permission from the warring factions. 
  The Serb general stressed that any relief convoy and other 
UN 
vehicles should not move through Serb-held territory without 
permission, warning that otherwise, serbs will "prevent their 
movement with weapons." 
  He accused UN peacekeepers of having shipped weapons and 
ammunition to Muslims in the past and added that no humanitarian 
worker has been killed on Bosnian Serb territory. 
  Earlier reports said that a relief convoy will be heading 
for 
Sarajevo Monday, moving through lands controlled by Muslims, 
Croats and Serbs without asking for permission as expected by 
the United Nations. 
  Under Rose's order, the convoy will be escorted by UN troops 
and the aircraft of the north atlantic treaty organization will 
provide air cover and use arms if it is intercepted.

deployment of Russian peacekeepers in Sarajevo, terming it as "a 
provocation that might lead to conflict." 
  "We oppose the dispatch of Russian troops to Bosnia,...the 
decision should be canceled," he said. 
  The presence of Russian troops in Sarajevo demonstrated 
Russian support for the Bosnian Serbs, Izetbegovic said in a 
letter to Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia. 
  Meanwhile, Bosnian ambassador to the UN presented a similar 
letter to the Security Council.

  [Text] Geneva, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Zhang Yishan, deputy 
representative of the Chinese delegation attending the 50th 
session of the UN Human Rights Commission, today called on the 
commission to strictly abide by the objectives and principles of 
the UN Charter if it truly wants to help realize human rights 
and basic human freedoms. 
  Speaking on the topic of rationalizing the work of the Human 
Rights Commission, Zhang Yishan stressed that many countries 
deem it necessary for the commission to rationalize its work 
because under certain circumstances, the commission's work has 
deviated from the objectives and principles of the UN Charter, 
and such deviations are not good for the promotion of 
international cooperation in human rights and the general 
realization of human rights and basic human freedoms. He noted 
that malpractices and abnormalities -- such as politicizing 
human rights issues, employing double standards, and using human 
rights issues as pretexts to interfere in other countries' 
internal affairs -- must be eliminated. 
  He said: The Human Rights Commission has made it a yearly 
practice to adopt a resolution on the human rights situation in 
many countries. Certain countries are extremely self-important 
[wei wo du jun -- 0707 2053 3747 1415] and relentless in 
attacking others for human rights violations while still 
claiming that they are observing international standards of 
human rights. In their eyes, all other countries are violating 
human rights and only they themselves are meeting human rights 
standards. 
  Zhang Yishan stressed that the practice of exerting pressure 
on other countries by adopting resolutions every now and then is 
anachronistic and that facts have proved that such a practice 
cannot really help the efforts to promote human rights. 
  He continued: The Human Rights Commission should act in 
accordance with the objectives and principles of the "UN 
Charter" as well as the provisions of the "Vienna Declaration 
and action program," to make sure that human rights issues are 
handled objectively and not selectively. Moreover, the 
commission should promote human rights-related dialogues and 
cooperation between countries on the basis of respecting each 
other and treating each other equally so that they can exchange 
views and experiences, promote understanding, and learn from 
each other's strong points to offset each other's weaknesses. 
Only by doing so can the commission truly and effectively 
promote and protect human rights and basic human freedoms. 
  Zhang Yishan added: While reforming its agenda, the Human 
Rights Commission should make sure that the issues which the 
majority of developing countries are concerned about can be 
fully examined and discussed. He said: While reforming the 
agenda, the Human Rights Commission should attach importance to 
economic, social, and cultural rights as well as the right to 
development so that there will be a balance between all kinds of 
rights.

  [Text] Moscow, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Russia today 
declared U.S. diplomat James Morris "persona non grata" and 
urged him to leave the country within seven days in retaliation 
for the recent expulsion of a Russian diplomat by Washington. 
  In a statement to the U.S. Embassy, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry accused Morris, who works as a counselor at the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow, of engaging in activities incompatible with 
his diplomatic status, noting him as an agent of the U.S. 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 
  "The Russian Foreign Ministry is lodging a protest against 
illegal activities of the American side with regard to an 
official representative of the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service who has been working in Washington since the summer of 
1993 by mutual consent," the statement said. 
  "In this situation," the statement continued, "we have to 
declare, on the basis of reciprocity, a CIA officer in Moscow 
persona non grata and demand that he leave the Russian 
Federation." 
  It also said that "The Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds 
from 
the fact that there are special channels for settling issues 
arising on both sides in connection with intelligence or 
counterintelligence activity. The channels can and should be 
engaged. This will allow (us) to find a mutually acceptable way 
out from the current situation and avoid its politicization." 
  On Friday [25 February], the United States declared Russian 
diplomat Aleksandr Lysenko persona non grata and ordered him to 
leave the country within seven days.

  [Text] Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States today protested in the strongest possible terms at the 
expulsion from Russia of a U.S. Embassy officer, describing it 
as an unjustified retaliation to its own actions over Russian 
spies. 
  U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the 
expulsion of a Russian resident from the United States on Friday 
[25 February] was entirely justified. 
  He was referring to the the espionage case of former CIA 
counter- intelligence officer Aldrich Ames, who the U.S. alleges 
had been a long-term underground member of the Russian 
intelligence service. 
  "By contrast," McCurry said, "the expulsion of the U.S. 
diplomat from Moscow is purely an act of unjustified 
retaliation." 
  He reiterated that Washington reserves the right to take 
further action if there are others implicated in connection with 
the case of Ames, who was allegedly paid more than 1.5 million 
dollars for collecting vital CIA operational and personnel 
information for Moscow. 
  "We will continue to assess, as that investigation and 
prosecution develops, what further measures might be necessary," 
McCurry added.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "China-EC Trade `Full of </F>
Potential'"] 
  [Text] Despite lingering skirmishes, trade between China 
and the European Community (EC) is full of potential, a senior 
Chinese official said yesterday. 
  Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, 
said China believes bilateral relations are extremely important, 
especially trade ties. 
  She made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing with 
visiting EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan. 
  They presided over the 13th session of the EC-China Joint 
Committee and the eighth bilateral ministerial-level talks over 
trade issues. 
  Brittan, who is in charge of the EC's external relations and 
trade policies, reaffirmed the community's support for China's 
re-entry into GATT but urged the mainland to further liberalize 
trade. 
  "We admire China's remarkable progress towards the creation 
of a market economy," Brittan said yesterday. "The EC will 
support and welcome China's continued economic reforms." 
  He continued: "China's re-entry into GATT (the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) would be of great interest 
worldwide." 
  During the talks, the two sides have agreed to discuss the 
liberalization of non-tariff measures in China. 
  The first meeting will take effect in March in Geneva within 
the framework of the GATT Working Party on China. 
  Brittan's remarks came a week after Dorothy Dwoskin, the 
U.S. 
assistant trade representative, announced her country's support 
of China's reentry into the world trade body. 
  Their remarks will be in China's favour when the GATT 
Working 
Party on China convenes its 16th session in Geneva in March, 
local analysts said, for the two represent major GATT 
contracting parties. 
  Wu said her talks with Brittan were conducted in a "frank, 
friendly and down-to-the-earth fashion." 
  "We've reached consensus on a wide range of issues and 
agreed 
to tackle the remaining ones in the future in a positive 
manner," she said. 
  She described her talks with Brittan as paving the way for 
future bilateral cooperation. 
  She pointed out that the EC has become China's second 
largest 
import source after Japan. The two sides have engaged in 
bilateral economic cooperation in agriculture, environmental 
protection and other areas. 
  Also yesterday, the EC announced it will finance the 
establishment of the China-Europe International Business School 
in Shanghai this year. 
  The two sides did not discuss the EC's quota restrictions on 
Chinese exports, which has been a major problem in bilateral 
trade. 
  In another development, Wu Yi said Britain's inability to 
cooperate over the Hong Kong issue would likely hurt 
Sino-British trade, which had surged 86 percent over 1992 last 
year. 
  But Brittan said China must extend non-discriminative 
measures to all EC members.

  [Text] Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, trying to brush aside recent differences with 
London, today stressed Washington's special transatlantic 
relationship with Britain. 
  Welcoming British Prime Minister John Major in Pittsburgh, 
where major's grandfather and father once lived, Clinton said at 
the airport, "We're working together today to respond to the 
terrible tragedy in Bosnia to try to bring an end to the killing 
and to bring peace and to keep that conflict from spreading." 
  For his part, Major said, pressure would be increased for 
the 
peace that every sensitive person wishes to see in that war-torn 
and troubled land. 
  On Russia, Major said "A Russia that's a good neighbor to 
the 
United States and West would be one of the finest things that 
this generation could hand down to the next." 
  Clinton will then share his Air Force One back to the 
nation's capital. 
  Major will spend a night at the White House, the first 
foreign head of state to have this honor since Clinton became 
President. 
  On Tuesday [1 March], the two leaders will begin their 
discussions on a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, 
Northern Ireland and the world trade. 
  The two will also discuss Northern Ireland and "what to do 
with NATO," Clinton said. 
  Clinton and major will meet again in June in Europe during 
the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day of the second 
world war. 
  Major said Clinton would visit Britain, and perhaps the 
Oxford University, Clinton's alma mater, during the June visit.

  [Text] Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will 
be hold a third round of formal talks in Geneva this month, the 
State Department said here today. 
  The exact date for holding the talks will be officially 
announced when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections of the DPRK nuclear sites begin on March 1, said 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard at a regular 
news briefing. 
  The IAEA inspectors have received their visas and are 
expected in Pyongyang late Tuesday [1 March] afternoon. The 
IAEA said that they can complete their inspections at the DPRK's 
seven nuclear facilities in about two weeks. 
  When the inspections begin tomorrow, Hubbard said, 
"Announcements also will be made concerning plans for the 
U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) military exercise Team Spirit '94." 
  Also on the same day south-north working level talks will 
resume in Panmunjom to arrange for south-north dialogue on 
exchange of special envoys, he said. 
  Hubbard stressed that "The undertakings of the United States 
regarding Team Spirit '94 and a third round of U.S.-DPRK talks 
are based on the premise that the IAEA inspections will be fully 
implemented and that the south-north nuclear dialogue will 
resume." 
  Asked whether other two suspected nuclear sites will be 
included in these inspections, Hubbard said that "we do not 
require that in advance of the third round." 
  But he said, "Our basic position remains that we are seeking 
a full resolution of the nuclear issue."

  [Text] Hanoi, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Vietnam and the 
United States today began talks on compensation for properties 
confiscated by both sides after 1975, the year of Vietnam's 
reunification. 
  Nguyen Xuan Phong, acting director of American affairs in 
the 
Foreign Ministry of Vietnam and head of the Vietnamese 
delegation, told reporters that the U.S. Government should make 
a comprehensive account of former South Vietnam Government 
properties which were frozen by the U.S. after 1975. 
  The U.S. delegation is headed by James Hall of the East Asia 
and Pacific Affairs Bureau of the U.S. State Department. 
  The Vietnamese Government estimates the worth of the frozen 
properties of former South Vietnam at around 250 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  The U.S. attorney general has received 192 requests from 
U.S. 
companies and individuals asking the government to seek 
compensation of around 230 million dollars from Vietnam. 
  The two sides will also work out a detailed schedule for 
setting up liaison offices in each other's capital, as agreed 
upon following the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against 
Vietnam in early February.

  [Text] Attending a breakfast given by Japan's Mitsui Group 
on the morning of 27 February, visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji pointed out that China's economic reform certainly will 
succeed, and China's economic growth rate will be maintained at 
8 or 9 percent annually for a long time to come. 
  He stressed: The favorable factors -- right time, 
geographical proximity, and harmonious relations between the two 
peoples -- have brought China and Japan closely together. 
China-Japan friendship is an irresistible historical tide. 
China's development needs Japan's capital and technology, and 
Japan's economic revitalization needs China's market and 
resources. Only by strengthening our cooperation can our two 
countries achieve our respective prosperity. When our two 
countries proceed with our mutually beneficial cooperation on an 
equal footing, we must resolve existing problems through mutual 
understanding and friendly consultations so we can continue to 
promote Sino-Japanese good neighborly relations and friendship. 
  Speaking at a breakfast given in his honor by Sanwa Group in 
Osaka on 28 February, Zhu Rongji said: The economy of Japan's 
Kansai areas is full of vitality. This has everything to do 
with the continual development of cooperation with China. I 
hope people in Kansai's economic circles will continue to take 
the lead in developing China-Japan economic cooperation and 
trade. [video shows the arrival of a bullet train at a train 
station, a panoramic view of Osaka, and Zhu attending a 
breakfast. Video then cuts to show close-ups of a seated Zhu 
making an impromptu speech] 
  Zhu Rongji also gave a brief report on China's economic 
development and the situation of this year's reform. 
  Kenji Kawakatsu, president of Sanwa Bank, and persons in 
charge of a dozen or so other mainstay businesses of the Sanwa 
group, repeatedly hailed the successes China has achieved in 
reform and opening up.

  [Text] Osaka, 27 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji attended a dinner given in his honor by Ichizo Kimura, 
president of the Japan-China Trade Center, in Osaka this evening. 
  Speaking at the dinner, Zhu Rongji said: "Japan Kansai 
area's trade with China accounts for 40 percent of Japan-Chinese 
trade, occupying a decisive position. I hope my current visit 
will further promote the development of Kansai's economic 
relations and trade with China." 
  During the dinner, Kimura spoke highly of the remarkable 
successes China has achieved in reform and opening up. He said:

no one has ever followed. Despite difficulties, I am convinced 
China will certainly be able to surmount them, and Japan can 
also develop economic relations and trade with China without 
worries."

general 
of the State Council, and other principal members of the vice

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji left here by special plane for an official 
goodwill visit to Japan this morning. 
  Before departure, Zhu Rongji delivered a statement at the 
airport and answered reporters' questions. He said his visit 
was aimed at calling on old friends and making new ones, 
enhancing friendship, deepening mutual understanding, and 
promoting cooperation and development. He hoped the goodwill 
visit would lift friendly Sino-Japanese relations to a new 
level. [passage omitted] 
  Answering questions about Chinese economic development, Zhu 
Rongji pointed out that China's economy will not over-heat 
again. He said: Since 1993 China has strengthened its 
macro-economic control and regulation policies, a move which was 
supported unanimously by the whole nation and the whole party, 
and it has reaped significant results. 
  He said: As for the current high speed of economic growth, 
it is decided by China's economic conditions. We should avoid 
sudden ups and downs, and should preserve rapid, sustained, and 
healthy [kuai su chi xu er you jian kang 1816 6643 2170 4958 
5079 0642 0256 1660] economic development. 
  Zhu Rongji said China's economy will continue to grow at 9 
percent or so this year, which can be repeated in future years. 
China's ability to manage macroeconomic control and regulation 
depends on its economic situation. For this reason, we can 
guarantee stable, fast, and sustained growth [wen ding kuai su 
he chi xu di fa zhan 4489 1353 1816 6643 0735 2170 4958 4104 
4099 1455] of the economy." [no beginning quotation mark as 
received] 
  Among Zhu Rongji's entourage were He Chunlin, deputy 
secretary-general of the State Council General Office; Gan Ziyu, 
vice minister of the State Planning Commission; Yang Changji, 
vice minister of State Economics and Trade Commission; Xiang 
Huaicheng, vice finance minister, Tang Jiaxuan, vice foreign 
minister; Liu Shanzai, vice minister of foreign economic 
relations and trade; Dai Xianglong, vice governor of the 
People's Bank of China; and Cui Yushan, vice chairman of the 
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Seeing 
the vice premier off at the airport this morning were State 
Councillor and State Council Secretary-General Luo Gan, Minister 
in charge of the State Planning Commission Chen Jinhua, Minister 
in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission Wang 
Zhongyu, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu 
Yi, Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, vice governor Zhou 
Zhengqing of the People's Bank of China and Japanese Ambassador 
to China Michihiko Kunihiro.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- More than 130 Chinese 
specialists on water and soil conservation have been trained 
through joint efforts by China and Japan over the past three 
years. 
  The co-operative training project, jointly funded by the 
Chinese Ministry of Forestry and the Japan International 
Co-Operation Agency, started from 1990. 
  As a main contractor of the project, the Beijing Forestry 
University built ten computer and soil analysis laboratories in 
the training center, equipped with advanced instruments costing 
over 250 million yen provided by Japan. 
  The center has, ever since its founding, made great 
achievements in research fields, including forestry hydrology, 
remote sensing, soil science, water and soil conservation, and 
natural disaster prediction. 
  Also included is research into soil erosion control and 
afforestation on north China's Loess Plateau, 
  Experimental forests have been planted in north China's 
Shanxi province over the past few years. 
  Many of the specialists have now been promoted to leading 
posts in county-level water and soil conservation departments.

  [Text] Colombo, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese vice-premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Sri Lankan Foreign Minister 
A.C.S. Hameed exchanged views on bilateral, regional and 
international issues at their two-hour official talks here today. 
  At talks, Hameed briefed his Chinese counterpart on the 
current situation in his country, saying that his country will 
stick to a stand of solving domestic problems through political 
dialogue. 
  Qian spoke highly of the economic development in Sri Lanka 
and appreciated the efforts by the Sri Lankan Government in 
realizing national conciliation and safeguarding territorial 
integrity and unity of the country. 
  On regional issues, Hameed said, "Although disputes are 
existing among the South Asian nations, the South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has made much 
progress in recent years." 
  Qian said, "China has attached importance to developing 
relations and cooperation with South Asian countries as South 
Asia is an important region with a large population and a 
potential large market as well". 
  Qian expressed the hope that South Asian countries will 
remove external interference and find peaceful resolutions of 
the disputes so as to create a peaceful environment for 
developing economy in the region. 
  About Indian Ocean Peace Zone, Hameed said, "As a sponsor 
country, Sri Lanka hopes this peace zone will make progress as 
the confrontation of the two big powers has ended." 
  Qian said, "China has been supporting the proposal for 
establishing the Indian Ocean Peace Zone." 
  He noted that "The big powers outside the zone should 
withdraw the military existence in the Indian Ocean region and 
respect the independence, sovereignty and security of the 
countries in the region". 
  The two foreign ministers also had in-depth discussions on 
other regional and internal issues of common interest. 
  Qian arrived here on February 28 on a two-day official visit 
to Sri Lanka.

<F P=106> [From the "Report on Current Events" program] </F>
  [Text] Listeners: Following the adoption of the partial 
political reform package by the Hong Kong Legislative Council 
[Legco] on 24 February, the British Government published a white 
paper on the Hong Kong issue, unilaterally disclosing the 
contents of the Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. This 
has pushed the Sino-British talks to a state in which it cannot 
be saved [wu fa wan hui di jing di]. The following is a roundup 
prepared by our station reporter: "The Hong Kong Issue Has 
Become a Focus of Attention in Beijing." 
  On the same day the British Government published the white 
paper and the Legco adopted the partial political reform 
package, the spokesmen of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office separately issued statements, 
pointing out that the British side has closed the door to the 
Sino-British talks. The spokesmen said: Prior to the opening of 
the talks, both China and Hong Kong had reached an understanding 
of not disclosing the contents of the talks. The British 
Government in Hong Kong has acted in disregard of the repeated 
advice from the Chinese side and the wishes of all circles of 
Hong Kong that China and Britain resolve the question on the 
arrangements for the 1994-95 election through negotiations. 
This has fully demonstrated that the British side is not 
sincere about cooperating with the Chinese side to resolve the 
Hong Kong issue. 
  On 24 and 25 February, the Preliminary Working Committee 
[PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region [HKSAR] 
Preparatory Committee held a special group meeting in Beijing. 
The meeting attracted numerous reporters from Mainland China 
and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The special meeting, held by 
the Political Affairs Group, mainly discussed and studied the 
relationship between the administrative and legislative organs 
in Hong Kong after 1997, the measures for the creation of the 
first government, and other issues. Under the current 
circumstance, the Political Affairs Group, which was established 
by the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] to study the 
future of Hong Kong, is playing an increasingly noticeable role. 
Xiao Weiyun, head of the Political Affairs Group, told 
reporters that Chris Patten's political reform program violates 
the Sino-British declaration, the HKSAR Basic Law, and 
agreements reached between China and Britain. In the face of 
the fact that his political reform program has been approved, 
there is no doubt that the Chinese Government will set up a 
separate kitchen [ling qi lu zao] based on the basic law. For 
this purpose, the PWC will step up its preparatory work in a 
concrete way to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and its 
long-term stability and prosperity. 
  On the evening of 25 February, Chinese Premier Li Peng, Vice 
Chairmen Li Lanqing, and Zou Jiahua, as well as other state 
leaders attended a soiree sponsored by the PWC to celebrate the 
arrival of spring. Premier Li Peng made an impromptu speech at 
the soiree. Speaking of Hong Kong's situation, he said that 
China today is no longer what it was 150 years ago. At present, 
China has a growing economy and enjoys political stability. We 
are full of confidence in China's future. In his speech, the 
premier once again emphasized that no matter what happens, the 
Chinese Government will not change its determination to resume 
Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, and that Hong Kong will 
definitely achieve a smooth transition and long-term stability 
and prosperity.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- Celebrities from all 
walks of life and social organizations in Hong Kong today 
published comments welcoming China's publication of the facts 
concerning Sino-British talks, and they expressed the belief 
that the Chinese document can help Hong Kong residents 
distinguish between right and wrong. They pointed out: The 
facts have amply testified that the Chinese side made tremendous 
efforts at the talks. The essence of the Sino-British dispute 
is not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong, 
but one of whether to act in good faith and whether to converge 
with the Basic Law in the three aspects so as to realize a 
smooth transition in Hong Kong. In the face of the iron-clad 
facts, Britain can hardly shirk its responsibility for the 
rupture of the talks. 
  Fan Xu Litai and Li Zetian, members of the Preliminary 
Committee, said: China's publication of the facts concerning 
the talks is a good thing which can help the public in Hong Kong 
understand the truth. The facts show that during the talks, 
China made considerable concessions over the three preconditions 
set by Britain, that is, "lowering the voting age, abolishing 
appointed membership, and implementing the system of single 
seat, single vote." China also agreed to the British proposal 
concerning elections of the two municipal councils and the 
district board. China only requested that discussion of the 
single seat, single vote system in the Legislative Council 
elections be left to a later stage. However, Britain used this 
as a pretext to suspend the talks. This move by Britain shows 
that it has no sincerity whatsoever in the talks. Fan Xu Litai 
said: It is China's consistent goal to maintain Hong Kong's 
smooth transition, prosperity and stability. China had hoped 
the talks would be successful; the responsibility for the 
breakup of the talks lies with Britain. 
  Li Liansheng, a deputy to the National People's Congress, 
said: Since Britain has unilaterally published the tailored 
contents of the talks, it is only natural that China has been 
compelled to make a corresponding response by making the facts 
public. In so doing, Hong Kong residents can distinguish right 
from wrong and will not be misled by the British-orchestrated 
public opinion. He added: The British unilateral publication 
of the White Paper is an attempt to take the initiative to 
misguide Hong Kong residents and make them believe that 
responsibility for the rupture of the talks lies with China. 
The facts prove that the essence of the Sino-British dispute is 
not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong, but 
one of whether to abide by the agreements reach between the two 
countries. The Chinese and British Governments long ago reached 
a series of agreements and understandings concerning the 
arrangements for Hong Kong's political system. The unwarranted 
dispute has been started by Britain's inconsistency and failure 
to honor its commitment. 
  Hong Kong affairs advisor Chen Wanxian welcomed China's 
publication of the details of the talks, and deemed the document 
as helpful for Hong Kong residents to draw a fair judgment. She 
said: By using the promotion of democracy to cover up its 
failure to honor the Sino-British agreements and understandings, 
Britain's ultimate objective is to perpetuate its vested 
interests in Hong Kong beyond 1997. 
  Hong Kong affairs advisor Tang Yizhu pointed out: The facts 
show that Britain, devoid of sincerity in the talks, 
unreasonably brought up at the negotiation table the demand to 
discuss issues falling within the scope of China's sovereignty 
and manipulated the Hong Kong's Legislative Council to discuss 
the "constitutional reform package." Obviously Britain wanted 
to use the talks to cover up its efforts to peddle the so-called 
"constitutional reform package." He added: As we understand, 
in order to reach agreement with Britain on electoral 
arrangements for the district board and the two municipal 
councils, China repeatedly made concessions during the talks and 
proposed a compromise which took into consideration the stand of 
both sides and which would skirt the differences between the two 
sides. However, Britain raised obstacles which led to the 
rupture of talks. 
  The Hong Kong Federation for Democratic Construction, 
Association of Freedom and Democracy, Liberal Party, Focus, 
Association for the Advancement of Democracy and the People's 
Life, and many other political parties and social organizations 
in Hong Kong also published commentaries, giving a "big welcome" 
to the Chinese publication of the facts concerning the talks. A 
few of social organizations believe that the contents released 
by China are "comprehensive," while those in the British version 
are "selected and prioritized." China's move can help the 
residents better understand the truth that Britain's 
faithlessness led to the failure to reach a Sino-British 
agreement on electoral arrangements. 
  Yang Yaozhong, a representative of the Hong Kong Educators' 
Association, said in a commentary: The contents of the details 
of the talks released by China can ensure a correct 
understanding of the facts. In the face of the facts, Britain 
cannot shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks. 
In more than a century of colonial rule, Britain has never 
promoted democracy in Hong Kong. Now it is holding the banner of 
democracy. The essence of this is to maintain Britain's 
influence on Hong Kong after 1997.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The British Hong 
Kong authorities' fourth financing proposal on the proposed new 
airport in Hong Kong still poses a huge debt burden, a senior 
Chinese official said here Sunday [27 February]. 
  Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of XINHUA news agency Hong Kong 
branch, accused the British side of playing mathematics games, 
saying Hong Kong residents should establish a monitoring group 
to supervise the construction of the new airport. 
  Zhu said, "We have reiterated that the airport should be 
constructed in accordance with the memorandum of mutual 
understanding. But the fourth proposal put forward by the 
British side still poses a big problem: who should be 
responsible for the more than 20 billion H.K. [Hong Kong] 
dollars (2.564 billion U.S. dollars) debt." 
  He accused the Hong Kong Government of intending to shift 
the 
debt burden to the Special Administrative Region Government of 
Hong Kong by changing the provisional airport authority into the 
so-called airport corporation. 
  On the composition of the monitoring organization, he said 
this needs further consultation as it is the Hong Kong residents 
who pay for the construction of the airport.

<F P=106> [By M Y Sung in Beijing and Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] Britain's ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, 
yesterday conceded further negotiations with Beijing over the 
political future of Hong Kong were impossible. Sir Robin's 
admission contrasts starkly with statements by Governor Chris 
Patten and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd that the door 
to talks with China remains open. 
  Two weeks ago, Chief Secretary Anson Chan also implied the 
time for negotiations with China on political reform was over. 
She said stringent time constraints dictated that the 
constitutional reform process had to be completed soon. 
  In Beijing yesterday, Sir Robin said that China's conditions 
for a resumption of talks on political reform were impossible to 
meet. China has demanded that Britain nullify constitutional 
reforms already endorsed by the legislature, and withdraw the 
reform package gazetted on 25 February. The arrangements for 
this year's district board elections, and next year's municipal 
and Legislative Council polls need to be on the statute books by 
the end of July. Sir Robin said Britain could not 
simultaneously fulfil its obligations in implementing fair and 
open elections and meet China's pre-condition for more talks. 
Although the British wanted to reach agreement with China on 
political reform, it did not seem "it was going to be possible", 
he said. 
  Conceding the talks were over, and in the light of 
statements 
by China's Foreign Ministry that the non co-operation on 
political reform would affect other transitional issues, Sir 
Robin again warned Beijing against trade discrimination. He 
said any discrimination against British firms for political 
reasons would not be compatible with the deal on economic 
relations and trade between the European Union and the Chinese 
government. 
  Meanwhile, China's most senior bureaucrat dealing with the 
territory, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Director Lu Ping, 
yesterday lashed out at Britain for attempting to play down the 
Beijing decision to dismantle the territory's political system 
after 1997. Mr Lu accused Britain of misleading Hong Kong 
people by pretending this would not happen. The prospect of the 
three tiers of government in Hong Kong straddling the transfer 
of sovereignty was "pure imagination", he said. "We Chinese are 
people who mean what we say. "And as we have said we will set 
up a second stove, we must do it," he said. 
  A commentary published yesterday in the official CHINA DAILY 
continued to accuse Britain of being hypocritical over Hong 
Kong's democratisation. It accused the British of being 
"die-hard colonialists...day-dreaming of playing tricks to 
obtain de facto political and economic control of Hong Kong 
after 1997". 
  Mrs Chan yesterday reiterated the British side had never 
accepted Chinese demands, before or during the Sino-British 
negotiations, not to put constitutional reforms before the 
legislature without the approval of the Chinese government.

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by Political Editor Fanny Wong] </F>
  [Text] Much has been said from London and Beijing about 
their good intentions of disclosing details of the 17 rounds of 
secret negotiations over the future political structure of the 
territory so that Hong Kong people can come to their own verdict 
on who is right and who is wrong. 
  Britain delivered its version of the story on Thursday [24 
February], although it was an abridged account. China followed 
suit last night. Again, not surprisingly, it was a summarised 
report. 
  If both governments were trying to be transparent on a 
subject so vital to the future of Hong Kong people and win over 
six million hearts and minds, their public relations exercises 
have failed. 
  They claim they have no fear in sharing the details of the 
highly secretive diplomatic exchanges. But what is presented is 
no more than fragmented documentation of what has really 
happened, with both sides concentrating on particulars that 
serve their own interests. 
  Fresh in people's minds is the challenge by the Director of 
the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
Lu Ping, for Governor Chris Patten to "disclose all the records 
and documents". Certainly, from what was released last night, 
Beijing has not been so generous. 
  And the timing was a public relations nightmare. 
  First hints that Beijing would publish its version of the 
story came out after 5.30 pm [0930 GMT], indicating that the 
17,000-character document would be out at 8 pm. 
  Not a word actually ran from the machine until 9.45 pm. 
  If China wants its case heard properly by the Hong Kong 
community, it could have done better. 
  It now has to contend with a hasty appraisal, and a clever 
offer by the British side last night to disclose even more of 
its version by the week's end.

  [Text] Sino-British negotiators have reached an agreement 
in principle for construction of a naval base for the People's 
Liberation Army (PLA), despite the political rift over Governor 
Chris Patten's reforms. 
  China yesterday reaffirmed that co-operation on 
non-constitution fronts would suffer because Mr Patten had 
revealed contents of the 17 rounds of secret talks and yesterday 
tabled the remaining parts of his 1992 electoral package. The 
sharp attack from Beijing during the day included allegations 
that the Government was "lying to the public and misleading the 
media". Despite this, experts from both sides at the Join 
Liaison Group (JLG) succeeded in bridging their differences in 
key issues relating to the naval base, paving the way to draft a 
final accord on the disposal of military land. 
  It is understood that the Chinese JLG team is also prepared 
to hold expert talks on the airport projects as early as next 
week. Another positive sign that Beijing was prepared to get 
back to business came from Guangdong's provincial police head, 
Chen Shaoji. He issued a strong assurance that under no 
circumstances would long-time cooperation with Hong Kong 
counterparts be adversely affected by the Sino-British political 
row. He said that cross-border co-operation on law and order 
would be strengthened to maintain social stability. "Without 
social stability there will be no preservation of prosperity and 
stability of Hong Kong," said the Public Security Bureau 
director. 
  But stability and prosperity might be harmed by the failure 
to complete the new Chek Lap Kok airport on time, British 
Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, said in Beijing. Sir 
Robin said a deal could still be struck on the financing package 
of the new airport and its rail links. 
  But the newly-appointed deputy director to the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Wang Fengchao, 
warned that the row over the release of the White Paper would 
inevitably affect other issues. "Since Britain has disrupted 
the co-operative atmosphere over the transition of the sovereign 
power, it is hard to say that other matters would not be 
affected," Mr Wang said. "We don't want to see that. The 
British side should bear the entire responsibility." 
  Yesterday's last day of talks on defence facilities was said 
to have been held in a normal atmosphere. Chinese expert team 
leader Luo Jiahuan said the two sides would be devoting further 
effort to strike a full deal. His British counterpart. Alan 
Paul, said there was some progress made in the meetings and the 
two sides would continue to meet. It is understood that while 
they reached a consensus on matters of principle, much 
fine-tuning needed to be done before a final accord could be 
struck. Sources said the work would still involve some tough 
bargaining. The two sides are expected to meet again on the 
subject in the next few weeks to follow up the discussions. 
  A key obstacle barring a full Sino-British accord on defence 
matters is the construction of the new naval base on the south 
side of Stonecutters Island. The Chinese side agreed to 
slightly cutting the size of the naval basin it sought and the 
British side agreed to build a basin bigger than it originally 
proposed. Under the Chinese proposal, the size of the naval 
basin should be 480 metres by 480 metres while the British 
proposal only envisages a 250-metre by 250- metre basin. The 
compromise is expected to cut the construction costs of $700 
million that the Chinese side has estimated under its original 
blueprint. Chinese sources said Beijing was willing to accept a 
"slightly smaller" naval base, but stressed that it should be 
enough for the anchorage of aircraft carriers. 
  Meanwhile, the expenditure part of the 1994/95 Budget 
released yesterday reveals that spending on defence would drop 
from the revised estimates of $1.72 billion for 1993/94 to an 
estimated $1.48 billion next year. Secretary for the Treasury, 
Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, attributed the reduction to the phased 
withdrawal of the British Garrison beginning this autumn. Mr 
Tsang said the actual reduction in defence costs arising from 
the withdrawal of British forces for the next financial year was 
about 20 per cent but the withdrawal would also involve some 
expenditure and therefore the net reduction in payments was 
about 14 per cent.

  [Text] Daya Bay experienced its first scare last Sunday 
when a pump failure triggered an alarm at the Guangdong nuclear 
power plant, 50 kilometres from Hong Kong. The incident was the 
most serious at the plant since operation began on February 1. 
Plant officials say the problem was minor, with no safety 
impact, but strict rules meant the incident had to be reported 
to the China National Nuclear Safety Administration under the 
terms of international nuclear safety agreements. 
  Last Sunday's incident was the first problem of 
international 
classification scale to occur at Daya Bay. At least 59 similar 
incidents had been reported at the plant since last April, 
well-placed sources told the SUNDAY MORNING POST. The 
disclosure of the first classified problem since Daya Bay went 
on line sparked renewed Hong Kong criticism of China's nuclear 
power programme and came only days after the announcement of a 
planned expansion that would site reactors in a ring around the 
territory. The mishap also underscored Hong Kong Government 
efforts to reach an agreement with Chinese officials about 
expanded information of on-site problems. The present agreements 
only bind China to inform Hong Kong about accidents in which 
there is likely to be an off-site release of radiation that may 
affect the territory. 
  "People are very frightened and worried about Daya Bay," 
said 
Legislative Councillor, the Reverend Fung Chi-wood. "More plants 
will add to the worry. Legco [the Legislative Council] should 
urge China not to build more so close, but I do not know how 
much they will listen." 
  Fears about Chinese secrecy and plant safety are also of 
international concern. American nuclear energy companies, 
barred from doing business with China, are closely monitoring 
the Daya Bay situation. Officials with the Hong Kong Nuclear 
Investment Company insist the pump problem has been the only 
reportable incident at the plant since operation began. They 
said most of the other incidents occurred during Daya Bay's 
testing phase, when equipment was purposefully pushed to the 
limits to probe the efficiency of safety devices and monitoring 
systems. 
  "This is a safe plant," said Dr Jacques Pretti, senior 
nuclear technical adviser with the company. He said Daya Bay 
had performed to or above expectations, despite the minor pump 
problem. Dr Pretti said automated monitoring equipment 
immediately detected the pump problem and triggered safety 
shutdowns. However, the mishap has renewed calls for a 
government nuclear watchdog committee to monitor China's growing 
nuclear power industry. A second reactor is set to come on line 
at Daya Bay next summer. 
  Environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth accused 
Daya Bay officials of secrecy. "It just goes to show what we 
suspect about nuclear power, that it's not safe," Friends 
spokeswoman Lisa Hopkinson said. "If they can't be open and 
straight about more minor incidents, you wonder whether they 
will tell us about a real accident." "We would like to know 
about all on and off-site accidents. If an accident occurs, 
what follow-up action is taken? It may be minor but provided 
operators can respond and deal with it, it provides reassurance. 
If it occurs with regularity, it is indicative that things are 
going wrong." Although Friends of the Earth believe the chances 
of a meltdown at Daya Bay are small, the problem lies more in 
the risks of chronic health problems from radioactivity that may 
contaminate water and food supplies. 
  China last week announced plans for several other reactors 
in 
Guangdong province, including two just five kilometres from Daya 
Bay. The mainland intends to build up to six additional 
reactors at Yangjiang City, about 200 kilometres southwest of 
Hong Kong. Chinese officials have talked of a massive investment 
in nuclear power, with plans to boost nuclear energy production 
twenty-fold to 20,000 megawatts by the year 2020.

  [Text] Nanjing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- During his inspection 
tour of Jiangsu, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau, state councillor, and minister in charge of 
the State Economic Restructuring Commission, stated: This year 
is crucial for reform. The tasks of reform include fully 
implementing the major reform measures enacted by the central 
authorities, undertaking careful organizational efforts, and 
providing specific guidance in accordance with the "Decision" of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to 
ensure smooth implementation of the reforms in question. Reform 
should be closely linked to economic construction to promote 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
  From 11-20 February, Li Tieying visited enterprises and 
rural 
areas in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang cities 
to assess the progress made by urban and rural areas in carrying 
out reforms in economic, cultural, and other fields. Li Tieying 
pointed out: The current economic situation and reform status 
are excellent, and we are faced with rare opportunities. The 
central authorities have enacted or will soon enact a set of 
plans to reform structures in the macroeconomic arena and other 
fields. Reform has moved into a new stage of full-scale 
intensification and overall coordination. The main task of 
reform for all localities is to seriously study, thoroughly 
understand, and fully implement the "Decision" of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as 
the reform plans developed by the central authorities. This 
year, we should tackle key reform tasks, whose scale and scope 
are unparalleled, and whose arduousness and complexity we should 
fully recognize. All localities should formulate implementation 
plans, undertake careful organizational efforts, provide 
specific guidance, and improve upon the current favorable 
situation in light of their realities. The reform process will 
inevitably lead to new problems and circumstances, which we 
should study without delay to make timely adjustments and sum up 
our experiences in earnest. We should show a pragmatic spirit, 
ensure the smooth implementation of various reforms, and further 
promote development through reform. 
  During the tour, Li Tieying invited the leaders of Suzhou, 
Wuxi, and Changzhou cities; the persons in charge of the 
planning and economic commissions and the economic restructuring 
commissions of those cities; and some entrepreneurs to an 
informal discussion to solicit their opinions on the "Plan on 
Establishing an Experimental Modern Enterprise System." 
Participants in the discussion noted: All localities are 
seriously studying ways to establish a modern enterprise system, 
which was considered the microeconomic basis of the socialist 
market economic system, an effective means for combining public 
ownership with the market economy, and vitally important for 
invigorating large and medium state-owned enterprises and for 
establishing a new socialist market economic system. Li Tieying 
noted: The proposal for instituting a modern enterprise system 
represents a review of our experience over the past 10-plus 
years in carrying out actual enterprise reforms and in 
conducting theoretical explorations; it points the way for 
reforming state- owned enterprises and signals a shift in our 
country's enterprise reform toward initiating a new enterprise 
system through the readjustment and development of our country's 
policy of delegating power and allowing enterprises to retain 
profits. Judging from the current situation, we are still in an 
experimental stage of establishing a modern enterprise system. 
The experiments the State Council plans to carry out in some 
100 enterprises constitute explorations for a new enterprise 
system, and will provide experience in establishing a modern 
enterprise system. For the majority of enterprises, the 
prominent issue is to improve quality, strengthen management, 
and stress efficiency. They should conscientiously change their 
mechanisms in accordance with the "Enterprise Law" and the 
"Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in 
State-Owned Enterprises." They should also establish a 
financial and accounting system that meets the demands of a 
market eocnomy in accordance with the "two sets of regulations," 
to create conditions and lay the groundwork for the next stage 
of reform. 
  Li Tieying fully affirmed the achievements scored by the 
Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou regions in economic development, 
reform, and opening up. He said: The past 10-odd years have 
witnessed rapid economic development in Suzhou, Wuxi, and 
Changzhou cities, whose total output of goods and services 
exceeded 100 billion yuan in 1993, or half the provincial total, 
and whose industrial and agricultural output value surpassed 300 
billion yuan, or three- fifths of the provincial total. These 
achievements were mainly born of reform. People in the three 
cities seized opportunities to conduct bold explorations in 
deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world, thereby 
gaining a wealth of useful experiences; these experiences 
deserve to be summed up earnestly. Li Tieying particularly 
noted: Although village and town enterprises are the dominant 
force in this area, they should further exploit their flexible 
mechanisms by deepening reform. 
  Li Tieying and the leaders of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou 
cities jointly studied ways to increase regional cooperation, 
deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and take 
advantage of the cities' proximity to Shanghai to promote 
development in the region during the new period. Li Tieying 
said: The State Economic Restructuring Commission and the 
provincial economic restructuring commission should lend full 
support to the region's reform experiments. By focusing on 
establishing a modern enterprise system, they should earnestly 
coordinate work between higher and lower levels and between 
departments in changing government functions, in nurturing 
markets, and in carrying out overall supplementary reforms of 
the social security, personnel, cadre, and income distribution 
systems with a view to creating an even better external 
environment for regional cooperation and overall advancement in 
development and reform in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities, 
and to providing the cities more experiences in promoting 
development and stability through reform.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Fourth Council of 
the All-China Journalists' Association [ACJA] held its fourth 
meeting here today. The meeting decided to hold the Second 
Plenary Session of the ACJA Fourth Council in the near future; 
it also discussed the work report and the revised draft of the 
"Norm of Professional Ethics for Chinese Journalists," which 
will be submitted to the plenary council meeting for 
deliberations. 
  ACJA Chairman Wu Lengxi presided over the meeting. Secretary 
Wang Zheren briefed the council meeting on the drafting of the 
work report. In discussing the work report, permanent members 
of the council maintained: Since the fourth council held its 
first plenary session in 1991, the ACJA, local journalists' 
associations, and special journalists' associations have done a 
great deal of work in helping, organizing, and pushing the press 
to vigorously publicize Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reform, opening 
up, the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, 
and adherence to a correct orientation for public opinion, with 
economic construction as the center. They have made 
achievements in implementing the norm of professional ethics, 
opposing "paid journalism," commending advanced journalists and 
units, and cultivating and building up the force of journalists. 
They have also made significant progress in selecting and 
awarding good news articles, promoting professional exchanges, 
holding academic symposiums, pushing journalistic reform, and 
launching journalistic exchanges and cooperation with foreign 
countries, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. 
  Participants in the meeting noted: Last year, the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted a 
decision on several issues concerning the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure; at a national work 
conference on propaganda and ideology held by the central 
authorities, Comrade Jiang Zemin called for "arming the people 
with scientific theories, guiding them with correct public 
opinions, cultivating them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring 
them with excellent works." These have further clarified the 
orientation and set the missions for the press in propaganda and 
building up its force. The upcoming second plenary session of 
the council should make the implementation of the guidelines of 
these two conferences its subject, unify and encourage the broad 
masses of journalists to thoroughly study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and adhere to the correct orientation for pubic 
opinion to create a good press environment for reform, opening 
up, and stability; advertise the main theme of economic 
construction, reform, and opening up; and, in the meantime, make 
greater efforts to publicize the construction of socialist 
spiritual civilization. In the course of journalistic reform, 
we should avoid the practice of stressing economic returns only 
and ignoring social benefits, as well as the tendency of 
pandering to low tastes. We should continue to make building up 
the force of journalists our central work, strive to improve 
journalists' ideological and professional levels, strengthen 
professional ethics, and keep honest practices and 
self-discipline. 
  Permanent members of the council noted: Being important 
social organizations of the press, journalists' associations 
should fully use their clout as mass organizations to conduct 
activities with their own characteristics, inspire the 
enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of journalists, so 
that the work of journalists' associations will be more animate 
and lively. 
  To suit the development of situation, it is necessary to 
make 
appropriate supplements and revisions to the "Norm of 
Professional Ethics for Chinese Journalists." Permanent members 
of the council discussed the revised draft at the meeting. 
  The meeting agreed to recruit Yang Shangde, Liang Heng, Sun 
Yongren, Zhang Enhua, Wang Yunxiang, and Zhang Biao as permanent 
members to the council. 
  Also attending the council meeting were ACJA vice chairmen 
Shao Huaze, Li Yan, Guo Chaoren, Ma Qingxiong, Ding Ximan, Zhang 
Cong, Yang Zicai, and others.

<F P=106> [Speech by Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee </F>
Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party 
Committee, in Shanghai on 10 February] 
  [Text] Comrades and friends: 
  During this traditional festival, which is being happily 
celebrated by everyone and whose celebration is being shared by 
the whole nation, we are getting together joyously to offer mass 
Spring Festival greetings. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal 
CPC Party Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's 
Government, I wish you all a happy New Year! I would like to 
offer my New Year's greetings to the broad masses of workers, 
peasants, intellectuals, government functionaries in Shanghai; 
officers and men of the three branches of the Armed Forces 
stationed in Shanghai; armed police officers and men; public 
security cadres and policemen; and patriotic people in all 
circles. I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best 
wishes to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, as well as 
overseas Chinese and international friends, who show concern 
for, assist in, and support Shanghai's modernization. 
  In the past year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, under the leadership 
of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and with the 
support of all people in the nation, the Shanghai people united 
as one to blaze new trails and make progress. Shanghai was a 
heartening scene of prosperity in economic construction, reform, 
opening up, and social development. It enjoyed sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development on the basis of market demand, 
good quality, and high efficiency. Shanghai vigorously steered 
reform of the economic structure toward the goal of taking the 
lead in building operating mechanisms of the socialist market 
economy. It scored new achievements in developing Pudong and 
opening up to the outside world. The spiritual civilization was 
developed coordinately. People's lives improved notably. In 
particular, the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping and the convocation of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee greatly 
inspired the Shanghai people to further promote the development 
of various undertakings and encouraged us to confidently march 
toward the coming year. 
  The year of 1994 is a crucial year for China's reform, 
opening up, and modernization, as well as a decisive year for 
Shanghai to "bring about great changes in three years." Seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the 
outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability 
are the major goals for the entire party this year, and we must 
follow and serve these goals. According to the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, we must firmly embrace the 
central task of economic construction, insist that development 
is the last word, focus on the key links vital to Shanghai's 
overall economic situation, and maintain strong momentum for 
Shanghai's economic development. We must painstakingly organize 
the implementation of various major reforms, and strive for new 
breakthroughs in taking the lead in establishing operational 
mechanisms of the socialist market economy. We must adhere to 
the principle of "carrying out two tasks simultaneously and 
proceeding steadfastly with both," continue to promote socialist 
spiritual civilization, arm people with scientific theory, guide 
public opinion correctly, mold people with a lofty spirit, and 
inspire people with excellent works to enhance citizens' quality 
and the cultural levels of the cities. We must vigorously 
accelerate the construction of socialist democracy and the legal 
system, further maintain and develop political stability and 
unity, and promote social progress in an all-around way. 
  In the new year, the key to opening up a new prospect for 
various undertakings is to arm ourselves and guide our actions 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. We must continue to conscientiously 
study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
and the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, thoroughly master the essence of emancipating 
our minds and seeking truth from facts, enhance our awareness 
and determination in carrying out the party's basic line, and 
improve our ability to lead socialist modernization and master 
the market economy. We must be modest and prudent, make 
constant progress, boldly explore new ways, courageously 
practice newfound ways, and work creatively with a higher goal 
in mind. 
  Now that the objectives and tasks for reform and 
construction, as well as the guiding principles and policies, 
have been formulated, we should work hard and in a down-to-earth 
manner to implement them in 1994, and should earnestly improve 
our work style and leading methods. We should study more often 
and socialize less frequently; should conduct more investigation 
and research and reduce wishful acts; and should perform more 
actual work and curtail rhetoric. When facing heavy tasks of 
reform and construction, we should be good at keeping the 
overall situation in mind; should earnestly study new conditions 
and new problems; and should promptly summarize experiences in 
an effort to actively, steadily, and realistically make progress 
in various tasks. 
  In 1994, to correctly understand the relations among reform, 
development, and stability is of utmost importance for us to 
accomplish various missions. Economic development is the 
central task of all our work; reform is the driving force for 
development; and stability is the prerequisite for reform and 
development. While pursuing reform and development, we should 
also correctly handle the two types of contradictions; should 
safeguard social stability; and should provide a favorable 
social environment for reform, opening up to the outside world, 
and economic progress. We should conscientiously strengthen and 
improve party building; should promote the party's fine 
traditions; should foster close ties with the masses; and should 
unite all Shanghai people to join in the great cause of 
Shanghai's modernization drive. 
  Comrades and Friends: 
  We are shouldering heavy responsibilities in 1994. The party 
Central Committee, the State Council, proletarian 
revolutionaries of the older generation including Deng Xiaoping, 
and people across China are holding keen expectations on 
Shanghai's progress. It is our glorious historic responsibility 
to continually initiate new ways of performing tasks in Shanghai 
and to enhance Shanghai's vigor and prosperity. Under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin at the core, let us perform realistic work with one heart 
and one mind, and strive to accomplish new victories in 
Shanghai's reform, opening up to the outside world, and 
modernization drive! 
  Finally I wish all of you a happy New Year, happy family 
lives, good health, and prosperous undertakings!

<F P=106> ["Beijing political situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429) written in Beijing on 16 February 1994: "The 
Mysterious Truth Behind the CPC's Emphasis on Safeguarding the 
Authority of the CPC Central Committee With Jiang Zemin as the 
Core"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the spring festival this year, CPC 
elders Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, Yang Shangkun, Bo Yibo, and Wan 
Li, and Political Bureau Standing Committee members Jiang Zemin, 
Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, and Liu Huaqing, as well as many 
other vice premiers and state councillors, went to various 
places for inspection. On one hand, they preached the 
20-character principle of "grasping the opportunity, deepening 
reform, expanding the open- door policy, and promoting 
development," which has been proposed by the senior level of the 
CPC as this year's work, and on the other hand they listened to 
the opinions of local authorities on reform measures aimed at 
state-owned enterprises, finance, taxation, revenue, investment, 
and foreign trade -- measures that are forceful, penetrating, 
and extensive -- so as to strengthen communications between 
central and local authorities and to create a good environment 
for the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] which will open on 10 March. 
<H5>  "Central Committee With Jiang As Core" Still Has No Authority </H5>
  Informed sources in Beijing disclosed that Yang Shangkun, Bo 
Yibo, Wan Li, and other CPC elders stressed during their 
inspection trips that in the new year, when many reform measures 
are being announced, whether or not changing from the planned 
economy to a market economy goes well will depend on five 
factors: 
  1) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can 
voluntarily safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee 
which has Jiang Zemin as the core. 
  2) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can 
establish the view that party spirit is above everything, and 
voluntarily strengthen party spirit and organization. 
  3) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can 
unconditionally submit local and partial interests to central 
and overall interests. 
  4) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can 
strengthen their own clean government building and win the 
people's trust by the image of doing solid work. 
  5) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can 
seriously learn from Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and actively, thoroughly, 
and correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's theory. 
  The persons of political circles in Beijing pointed out 
that, 
regarding the importance of safeguarding the authority of the 
CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, not only 
Deng Xiaoping has talked about it many times, but even Chen Yun 
stressed it when he talked about the way to solve the current 
difficulties with Shanghai's party and government leaders who 
went to convey New Year greetings to him on 9 February. He 
said: "Without the authority of the Central Committee, big 
things cannot be done, and society cannot be stable." He also 
praised the current leading group in the central authorities 
saying it is strong, capable, and doing quite a good job. 
Undoubtedly, with the support of Chen Yun, who is viewed as the 
chief representative of the conservative forces within the CPC, 
the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as 
the core will be strengthened. However, the authority of the 
"Central Committee with Jiang as the core," which is the 
third-generation leadership, must still rely on the protection 
given by the CPC elders, and this shows that the "Central 
Committee with Jiang as the core" still has no authority. This 
cannot be denied as a big potential problem after Deng and Chen 
pass away. 
<H3>  Not Carrying Out Political Reform Is "Political 
Shortsightedness" </H3>
  According to informed sources, Wan Li talked specifically on 
the issue of self-construction of leading cadres during his 
inspection trip. He hoped that leading cadres could set high 
standards for themselves. He mentioned that some leading cadres 
were content with not engaging in corruption, not taking bribes, 
not pursuing erosion, and not abusing their power, and he 
pointed out that these "four not's" are only the criteria for a 
law-abiding citizen, not the criteria for leading cadres, and 
that if they are only able to do the "four not's," then they are 
not qualified to serve as leading cadres. He said: "In the new 
historical period, and today when we try to establish the system 
of the socialist market economy, we must stress in particular 
that leading party and government cadres must put the interests 
of the party, the state, and the people first, and put 
individual interests, as well as the interests of their family 
members, in a lesser position. I am not saying that those 
interests are not to be considered, and it is not realistic to 
completely ignore them, but there has to be an order of 
priorities. Otherwise, one is not qualified to serve as a 
leading party or government cadre, and the people have no 
obligation to support him." 
  Bo Yibo, during his inspection trip, criticized some 
provinces that have owed wages to primary and secondary school 
teachers for a long time, and issued IOU's to peasants, but 
spent a large amount of public funds to build halls, buy cars, 
and travel. He said at the meeting of the standing committee of 
a certain provincial party committee: "If you, the standing 
committee members who are sitting here, did not receive your 
paychecks for three or six months, would you still come to work? 
Would you not complain? Would you not swear at the Central 
Committee? Did you feel any sense of guilt when you rode in the 
imported limousines to the counties and villages for inspection? 
You must know that the price of an imported limousine could 
completely change the face of a village!" 
  According to political circles in Beijing, what is 
noteworthy 
is why the phenomena criticized by Wan Li and Bo Yibo is 
continuously spreading within the CPC. In the final analysis, 
it is because as reform of the economic system is carried out, 
reform of the political system is not. But regrettably, the CPC 
elders and the current CPC leaders still bury their heads in the 
sand regarding this serious mistake. They hardly realize that 
establishing democratic politics is more helpful in safeguarding 
the position of the party and government and the security of the 
country, and at the same time, it has a bigger political 
rallying force than merely imbuing the masses with a "sense of 
loyalty." Not carrying out political reform is indeed a kind of 
"political shortsightedness." 
<H5>  The "20-Character Principle" Is the Basic Tone of the NPC </H5>
  The informed sources also said that Bo Yibo, who once said 
that Deng Xiaoping's biggest contribution is that "he found the 
way of building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- a way 
which Mao Zedong wanted to find but failed to find," demanded 
during his inspection trip that provincial leaders thoroughly 
learn from and correctly understand Deng Xiaoping's theory. He 
said: "The true meaning of Comrade Xiaoping's theory is that it 
proceeds from China's actual conditions. Comrade Xiaoping, 
using the stance, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, has 
summed up the positive and negative experiences in the 
development of China and foreign countries, summed up the 
positive and negative experiences in the history of the CPC, and 
created the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The essence of this theory is emancipating 
minds and seeking truth from facts. Under the guidance of this 
theory, our country has undergone profound changes over the past 
14 years, catching the attention of people all over the world. 
Therefore, every party member and the leading cadres of various 
levels must seriously learn from and grasp Comrade Xiaoping's 
theory." 
  According to political circles in Beijing, Bo Yibo's high 
appraisal of Deng Xiaoping's theory was helpful in checking the 
unhealthy tendency of the Mao craze within and without the party 
arising from the 100th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birthday. 
But it is difficult to correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's 
theory. 
  For example, Deng Xiaoping has time and again explained the 
theory of opportunity in recent years, and stressed the need to 
grasp the opportunity and expedite reform and development (note: 
see the 21 February article in this column), as a result, many 
cadres have rapidly launched projects without considering 
conditions. In fact, when Deng demanded a speedier development, 
he did not permit blind enthusiasm. Concerning this point, Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji, who is taking charge of China's economic 
reform and is considered to be most skillful in understanding 
Deng Xiaoping's theory, has explained it as follows: "To 
actively, thoroughly, and correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking and theory, one will be condemned by history if one 
fails to grasp the opportunity. If one charges ahead blindly, 
and does not seek truth from facts, to the extent of causing big 
fluctuations, then, one will also be condemned in history." The 
above-mentioned "20-character principle," which has been 
proposed by the senior level of the CPC, has replaced 
"expediting the development" with "promoting the development," 
and this obviously is to prevent blind adventure. Judged from 
this, the 20-character principle will be the basic tone of the 
Second Session of the Eighth NPC and the government work report, 
whereas before the NPC, it is believed that the CPC authorities 
will achieve a consensus at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee on the relevant issues such as this 
basic tone and the way to strengthen the authority of the 
"Central Committee with Jiang as the core."

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 KYODO -- Half of the cremated 
remains of Aisin Giorro Pu Jie, the younger brother of China's 
last emperor, will be buried at Nakayama shrine in Shimonoseki, 
Yamaguchi Prefecture, his daughter said Tuesday [1 March]. 
  Kosei Fukunaga, second daughter of Pu Jie, spoke with 
reporters the day after his death and eulogized him as a kind, 
loving and unselfish father who was like a saint to her. 
  Half of Pu Jie's ashes will return with his daughter to 
Japan 
and the other half will remain in China, she said. 
  The remains of Pu Jie's wife and eldest daughter, which have 
stayed in Beijing, will be kept together in Nakayama shrine, she 
said. 
  Pu Jie's younger brother, Aisin Giorro Pu Ren, joined her. 
  "While he was living, father felt that he was indebted to 
many of his Japanese and Chinese friends," Fukunaga said 
solemnly in recalling the latter part of Pu Jie's life after New 
China was established. 
  "Father's most unhappy thoughts were that mother died before 
he," she said. 
  Dressed in a finely cut black jacket and matching skirt, 
Fukunaga, 53, remained composed while discounting Pu Jie's role 
as a high-level military official in the puppet state of 
Manchuria, set up by the Japanese Government in the early 1930s. 
  "In such a wartime situation, he didn't have much choice," 
she said, adding that overcoming such an "adverse situation" 
made Pu Jie a better person in later life. 
  Pu Jie, the younger brother of the last emperor of the Qing 
dynasty, Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, died Monday morning in a Beijing 
hospital from complications due to pneumonia and an enlarged 
thyroid gland. 
  His funeral will be held on Monday at Beijing's Babaoshan 
cemetery.

"Consolidate the Achievements of the Anticorruption Drive and 
Carry It Out Persistently"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- An anticorruption drive 
that enjoys popular support is unfolding across the vast land of 
China. Over the past 6 months or so, people have seen through 
the media that a succession of measures aimed at combating 
corruption and promoting honesty were promulgated, major cases 
of corruption were brought to light one after another, and 
corrupt elements were punished by party or administrative 
sanctions one after another. 
  According to information released by the discipline 
inspection and supervision authorities, since the second plenary 
session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection 
which was held last August, some 470,000 party and government 
organs at and above the county (division) level across the 
nation -- including nearly 19,000 cadres at the provincial level 
-- have conducted self-examination and self-rectification in 
line with the five-point regulations for observing clean 
standards and self-discipline set by the Central Committee. 
Compared to the corresponding period in 1992, the number of 
major bribery cases involving over 10,000 yuan that were 
investigated nationwide from September to December last year 
rose 2.1 times, and the number of cases involving economic 
offenses by cadres at the county (division) level rose 6.8 
times. Relevant central departments and local authorities at 
various levels have abolished 5,370 illegal fees. The 
localities and departments have stopped some 1,600 unqualified 
groups from taking tours abroad. 
  The people -- after seeing the Central Committee's 
determination to combat corruption, improve discipline, and 
promote clean and honest government and the results that have 
been made -- have increased their confidence. A poll by 
relevant authorities shows that nearly 67 percent of the pollees 
believed that the negative and corrupt manifestations "have been 
contained somewhat" since the anticorruption drive was launched; 
69 percent believed that there have been "some improvements" in 
regard to observing clean standards and self-discipline in party 
and government organs; nearly 59 percent said that are 
"satisfied or somewhat satisfied" with the progress in the 
investigations of major cases; 50 percent believed the unhealthy 
practices of illegal fees and government-funded sightseeing 
tours abroad have been "by and large halted." Reports from 
various quarters and sectors indicate a strong momentum in the 
anticorruption drive, which has produced the expected results of 
halting the spread of the negative and corrupt manifestations 
and has fully asserted the correctness of the Central 
Committee's game plan for combating corruption. 
  Meanwhile, we must be soberly aware that although we have so 
far achieved some progress in the anticorruption drive, 
corruption remains serious and many deep-rooted problems remain 
unsolved; what has been achieved so far still falls short the 
requirements set by the Central Committee and the expectations 
of the masses. Moreover, it is impossible to root out 
corruption -- a problem left over by history -- overnight. 
Combating corruption and promoting honesty is a long-term task. 
We must not, in the slightest degree, lower our guard; rather, 
we should attend to it perseveringly. 
  It is necessary to focus, in a given period, our resources 
and build up the momentum to quickly halt some corrupt 
manifestations and unhealthy practices about which the masses 
are most dissatisfied. However, if we do not remove, once and 
for all, the soil that breeds corruption, it will resurface -- 
or become even more aggravated -- after each attempt at 
rectification. Therefore, to implement the anticorruption drive 
in a deep-going and sustained manner, we must treat both the 
symptoms as well as the root cause; we should start with the 
sources of corruption and tackle the deep- seated problems in 
terms of the structure, rules and regulations, and 
administration. In addition to putting a stop to irregularities 
and rectifying discipline, we should also formulate new rules 
and regulations, introduce and amplify step by step norms and 
standards governing the conduct of party members and public 
servants as well as supervision and restraining mechanisms for 
fighting corruption and promoting honesty, step up efforts in 
formulating rules for party discipline and supervision, and 
bring this work within the jurisdiction of law step by step. 
  As development of the socialist market economic system picks 
up pace and reform measures are promulgated one after another in 
the new year, there will certainly be new conditions, new 
problems, and new contradictions. In the changeover from the 
old structure to the new, inadequacies and shortcomings in the 
structure and mechanisms will emerge, inevitably creating 
opportunities for some people to take advantage of. Therefore, 
the anticorruption drive and the efforts to improve party 
workstyle and administrative honesty must evolve closely around 
and safeguard the general interests of reform, development, and 
stability; around the central task of economic development; and 
focus on critical problems that hamper and affect reform, 
development, and stability; there must also be clearly defined 
tasks and goals for the various phases of the drive. We must 
step up law enforcement and supervision; see to it that all 
policies and orders are implemented to the letter; safeguard the 
seriousness of political discipline; facilitate and ensure that 
the series of major policies and measures adopted by the CPC 
Central Committee and State Council for deepening reform, 
developing the economy, and safeguarding stability are fully 
implemented; and create a good environment for the defense of 
political stability, the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system, and the sustained, rapid, and healthy growth 
[chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 
4099 1455] of the economy. 
  An ancient poem puts it this way: "All nations and families 
past tell this story: diligence leads to prosperity and 
extravagance to disaster." Looking squarely at corruption and 
combating it with a firm and clear-cut stand -- this is the 
CPC's, the ruling party, answer on how to get out of the 
"historical cycle." It is also an indication of the party's 
strength and confidence. So long as we persist in Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's strategic policy of "attaching equal importance to 
both and being careful not to emphasize one and neglect the 
other," the long-tested CPC will -- by relying on its own 
strength and the people's support -- certainly be able to root 
out corruption and, together with people of all nationalities 
and in a new pose, help one another like passengers in the same 
boat, work vigorously to make the country prosperous, and 
jointly build a modern socialist country with Chinese 
characteristics.

<F P=106> ["Special article": Report on interview with PRC Vice </F>
President Rong Yiren by special correspondent Hsueh Chien-hua 
(5641 1696 5478); date, place not given: "State Vice President 
Rong Yiren Forecasts the Trend of Economic Development on the 
Chinese Mainland and the Hong Kong Situation"] 
  [Text] Soon after the New Year, the Spring Festival drew 
near. As we bade farewell to the old year and greeted the new, 
State Vice President Rong Yiren, in the midst of his pressing 
affairs, gave a special interview to a TZU CHING magazine 
special correspondent, talking freely about the excellent 
situation of China's reform and opening-up, forecasting the 
major trend of China's economic development, expounding on the 
inseparable relations between Hong Kong and the Chinese 
mainland, and extending New Year's greetings to our countrymen 
at home and abroad. 
  Quick in thought, the 78-year-old vice president remained a 
good talker. Concentrating on the main points and taking a 
strategically advantageous position, he reviewed the past, 
forecast the future, and was full of confidence in the prospects 
for China's socialist modernization program. 
<H5>  Assist the State President in Doing Jobs </H5>
  Rong Yiren was elected vice president of the PRC at the 
First 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress on 27 March 
1993. Ten full months have elapse since then. 
  Rong Yiren said: "In the past I held the posts of vice 
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, chairman of All China 
Association of Industry and Commerce, and chairman of the Board 
of Directors of the China International Trust and Investment 
Corporation [CITIC], but I spent most of my time on CITIC 
business. I am now state vice president, and have resigned my 
position as CITIC Board of Directors chairman. As a matter of 
fact, I was prepared to retire. Besides, I also have resigned 
my position as chairman of the Association of Industry and 
Commerce." 
  "My position as state vice president is mainly to assist the 
state president in doing jobs." Rong Yiren declares. 
  As state vice president, from April 1993 until now, Rong 
Yiren has visited Portugal and Spain, and has received and met 
with 88 groups of visitors from all over the world, including 
fellow countrymen from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, with almost 
one interview every two or three days, or sometimes several 
interviews in one day. Since the beginning of this year, the 
vice president has met with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan 
and Zimbabwe, U.S. Senators, the Romanian minister of state 
affiars, and other important visitors. 
  Talking about holding the post of state vice president, and 
whether or not he is busier than before, Rong Yiren said: "I 
cannot say busy; I was very busy in the past, when I worked at 
CITIC. Only now my work is of a stronger political nature than 
in the past, and the requirements are higher too." 
  He declared that as state vice president he represents the 
interests and reputation of the state. In contacts with foreign 
visitors, it is necessary to present China's situation to them 
in a practical and realistic manner, introduce them to matters 
they want to know, and also explain to them patiently the things 
they do not quite understand. It is important to respect 
guests, as well as ourselves, but it is more important to 
promote and develop contacts and friendship between China and 
other countries. 
<H5>  Constantly Exchanging Views With President Jiang Zemin </H5>
  Rong Yiren said: "In my work I often exchange views with 
President Jiang Zemin. I assist him in doing jobs, and I will 
do my best in whatever business I am required to do. President 
Jiang Z emin also attaches importance to my views, and we have 
had very good cooperation." 
  Talking about his relations with President Jiang Zemin, Rong 
Yiren recalled with delight: "The two of us have a longstanding 
friendship, and have always been on very good terms. In 1979, 
in the PRC Foreign Investments Management Committee, Jiang Zemin 
was vice chairman, Gu Mu was chairman, and I was advisor. We 
had many contacts between us." 
  "Afterward, Jiang Zemin became minister of the electronics 
industry, and I was engaged in setting up CITIC. We had many 
contacts in our jobs. When Jiang Zemin was mayor of Shanghai 
and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, I even 
called on him when I visited Shanghai." 
  Talking about his job in mainland China, Vice President Rong 
Yiren said that as the emphasis of his job in the past was in 
the economic field, his job in mainland China was mainly to do 
more investigation and study and to discover the facts, and 
after consideration, to make suggestions and proposals to the 
departments concerned. 
  "Therefore," Rong Yiren declared: "After being busily 
engaged in protocol work, I spend much of my time reading data 
and studying problems." In May and November last year, he went 
to Jiangsu Province and Tianjin Municipality in succession to 
make on-the-spot investigations and to discover facts. The 
visits were most rewarding. He points out: "As a whole, my job 
has been pretty smooth." 
<H5>  The Year 1993 Laid a Solid Foundation for Future Development </H5>
  Talking about his appraisal of China's economic situation in 
1993, Rong Yiren said: "Taken as a whole, China in 1993 
witnessed the implementation of Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It was a year 
in which China continued to score successes by seizing 
opportunities, deepening reform, and developing the economy 
faster and better [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge you kui you 
hou di fa zhan jing ji 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 
0642 1816 0642 1170 0966 4099 1455 4842 3444]. Enormous changes 
have taken place in China's situation following Deng Xiaoping's 
inspection tour to southern China in 1992. At the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Congress, we finally built up all over 
China a unanimous understanding of the experiences gained 
through more than 10 years of exploration and discussion, that 
is, to build up the socialist market economy system. This has 
vigorously promoted the development of China's economy." 
  Rong Yiren declared: From 1980 to 1991, the annual average 
growth of China's economy was about nine percent, the growth in 
1992 was 12.8 percent, and the growth in 1993 was about 13 
percent. Such high-speed growth for years running is very 
rarely seen in the world. The reason China made tremendous 
achievements in economic construction last year was primarily 
because China emphasized in- depth reform, strengthened 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and enabled economic 
construction to proceed in a more orderly way than in the past. 
Now China is socially and politically stable, agriculture 
continues to gain great bumper harvests, industrial production 
is growing rapidly, domestic markets are prosperous, foreign 
trade is brisk, the life of the people continues to improve, and 
the overall strength of China's economy has increased to some 
extent. All these accomplishments have laid a solid foundation 
for development in 1994 and in the years to come. 
<H3>  A Nine Percent Growth Rate This Year Is Laid on a Good 
Foundation </H3>
  Rong Yiren said that this year China will further carry out 
in- depth reform, and will develop the economy with more 
intensive reforms in banking, fiscal levies, foreign trade, and 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. In addition, we 
will step up legislation work, and a series of many laws and 
regulations will be introduced which will favor the transition 
to a market economy. 
  He said: In accordance with China's basic national 
conditions and the essential requirements of the socialist 
market economy system, China's next-step reform still must adopt 
the methods of 'follow in order and advance step by step' and 
'gradual transition'. Before the introduction of each reform 
measure, the bearing capacity of the state and the people must 
be taken into full consideration, and the ability to promote 
economic development and social stability through reform must be 
ensured. 
  He said: For instance, the common people now have some 
complaints about prices, which should draw attention. Of 
course, some problems can be overcome only gradually, by reform. 
However, attention should be paid to acting according to 
economic law, and best efforts should be made to avoid the ups 
and downs of the economic situation and any major fluctuation. 
  Talking about the growth rate this year, Rong Yiren believed 
that the nine percent growth rate now set has quite good a 
foundation. He declared: "It seems that this growth rate is 
lower than that of last year, but actually it is not. Economic 
development in China should take the road of sustained, 
high-speed, and healthy development [chi xu kuai shu jian kang 
fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6615 0256 1660 4099 1455], and nine 
percent is a rational pace. Throughout the `Eighth Five-year 
Plan,' China's growth rate was set at eight to nine percent, 
which was precisely for the sake of being favorable to 
mobilizing the initiatives of various fields, and of ensuring 
the healthy and orderly progress of economic construction." 
  Rong Yiren stressed that currently it is necessary to handle 
several relationships well, that is, the relationships in 
sustained, high-speed, and healthy development [chi xu kuai shu 
jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6615 0256 1660 4099 1455], and 
the relationships in reform, development, and stability. In the 
former group of relationships, healthy development is the crux, 
and only with healthy development will there be truly sustained, 
and high- speed development; otherwise it will possibly be false 
and bad development. For example, the economy grows at a high 
speed, but inflation also rises to an extent that the common 
people can hardly bear. Then what is is the good of it? 
Conversely, if everything is kept under tight control, the 
economy can hardly develop either. 
  Among reform, development, and stability, reform is the 
leading factor. Without reform, there will be no development, 
but without stability, and without social and political 
stability, both reform and development are but empty phrases. 
Therefore, development is the objective, reform is the motive 
force, and stability is the guarantee. We hope to promote 
development through reform. Only when the economy develops and 
the living standards of the people are raised can there be 
political and social stability, and stability, in turn, pushes 
forward in-depth reform. These are the major experiences China 
has acquired in the more than 10 years of reform and opening up. 
<H3>  Currently It Is Still Necessary To Lay Stress on Hard 
Struggle </H3>
  With regard to why China's high-speed economic development 
in 
recent years has drawn the world's serious attention, Rong Yiren 
asserted his belief that China covers a large territory, and has 
a large population. It naturally occupies a very large 
proportion of the world, and it is quite natural for it to draw 
the attention of others. However, if we analyze in a practical 
and realistic manner, there is an enormous gap between China's 
per capita income and that of many Western countries. Some 
people currently overestimate China's economic strength. This, 
plus differences in statistical methods, means that people are 
quite different in their viewpoints. Of course, there are two 
kinds of situation here. One is: People are friendly to China, 
and they are really happy with China's progress. The other is: 
People harbor evil designs. Toward this kind of situation, 
explanations should be made to them and those things that are 
not in conformity with facts should be cleared up, and 
exaggeration by some people who have ulterior motives also 
should be guarded against. 
  Rong Yiren explained that China has made considerable 
achievements in economic development, but it is still quite a 
long way from its objective. We propose to build China into a 
medium- developed country within half a century, and it is now 
still a far cry from this objective. We still are required to 
keep making great efforts. 
  He declared that China currently is still required to lay 
stress on arduous efforts, on thrift and hard work, and on 
determination to make progress, as well as to truly build China 
well through concerted efforts." He criticized some localities 
for being wasteful and extravagant after their economic 
conditions improved. He said that such a situation is no good 
and should be stopped resolutely. 
  Rong Yiren gave this earnest advice: New China was built on 
the foundation of a semicolonial and semifeudal society, and the 
goal now is to build a modern socialist country with Chinese 
characteristics. It is impossible to achieve this goal without 
going through protracted arduous struggles, without surmounting 
numerous difficulties, and without undergoing repeated setbacks. 
The policy is: Strive for fewer twists and turns, and for more 
stable development. 
<H3>  China Attaches Great Importance to the Development and Role 
of Hong Kong </H3>
  Talking about the relations between the Chinese mainland and 
Hong Kong, Rong Yiren said: "As an international monetary, 
trading, and shipping center, Hong Kong has very close ties with 
the economic development of the Chinese mainland. In the past 
few years, Hong Kong's volume of international trade grew 
considerably, and it had more and more contacts with the Chinese 
mainland. Investments by Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and 
especially by those in Hong Kong, also grew very rapidly. For 
years running, investments from Hong Kong occupied first place 
in the overseas investments drawn by the Chinese mainland -- 
approximately over 60 percent. Therefore, we value the 
development and role of this region." 
  Rong Yiren said that only by relying on the Chinese mainland 
had Hong Kong been able to develop up to today. Without the 
support of the mainland, the daily life of the residents would 
be affected, not to mention banking and trading. Through the 
important region of Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland has 
developed its contacts with the international community, and 
Hong Kong also has gained many benefits from the frequent 
contacts between the Chinese mainland and the outside world. 
Therefore, the close links between the Chinese mainland and 
Hong Kong, were as described by Premier Li Peng: "The economies 
of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland have become an inseparable 
entirety." 
  He said that currently more and more compatriots in Hong 
Kong 
have come to understand the relations between the Chinese 
mainland and Hong Kong, thereby developing more and more 
economic and trading contacts with the Chinese mainland." He 
hoped that this favorable momentum would continue to develop. 
  Rong Yiren said that recently the negotiations between China 
and Britain on the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements had 
broken down as a result of the fact that the British Government 
did not live up to its words and took an uncooperative attitude. 
This increased some troubles and difficulties, and it was 
natural for our compatriots in Hong Kong to worry about the 
situation. Whatever the situation, however, the Chinese 
Government will uphold the principles of "one country two 
systems" and of Hong Kong governed by Hong Kong people, which 
will never change. Together with patriotic fellow-countrymen of 
various circles in Hong Kong, the principles of the Basic Law 
will be upheld, and the long-term stability and prosperity of 
Hong Kong will be maintained. 
  He pointed out that it was only a little over three years 
before China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong. He hoped that 
during this period everyone would see more clearly the situation 
in which Hong Kong stands, that economic and trade ties with the 
Chinese mainland would be developed in a better way, and that 
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong would be upheld. 
  Before the end of the interview, Vice President Rong Yiren 
wished, through TZU CHING magazine, to extend New Year's 
greetings to compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, to compatriots 
in Taiwan, and to fellow countrymen residing overseas, wishing 
all of them a happy Lunar New Year, happiness to the whole 
family, and that everything turns out as they wish.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese couples who 
cohabit before the legal "marriageable age" will be separated 
and the marriage will not be protected by law, under a new 
marriage registration regulation. 
  The text of the new government regulation was promulgated on 
February 1. 
  The new regulation is expected to curb "early marriages and 
births," and is conducive to the nation's goal of controlling 
its already large population, said Yang Jianchang, spokesman for 
the Ministry of Civil Affairs, at a press conference here today. 
  China's marriage law stipulates that men are not allowed to 
marry until 22, and women until 20. 
  Every year there are two million illegal marriages out of a 
total ten million marriages, the spokesman said. The illegal 
ones include 1.6 million so-called "early marriages." 
  According to the new regulation, China is continuing to 
combat arranged and mercenary marriages, marriages between close 
relatives and bigamous marriages. All these are still 
widespread in some parts of China. 
  The spokesman said that the new regulation will be "a 
forceful legal means" for the civil affairs bodies to administer 
the marriage registration process. 
  The new rules stated that legally marriageable couples who 
simply do not go to the government marriage registration agency 
will be criticised and have to register within a certain period 
of time. 
  Marriages based on certificates obtained through fraud and 
deception will be declared null and void, the certificates will 
be withdrawn and the couples fined up to 200 yuan (about 23 U.S. 
dollars), according to the text. 
  The regulation gives couples getting married the right to 
bring charges against any officials or organisations trying to 
impose illegal fees or engaged in other corruptive practices in 
marriage registration. 
  The regulation also specifies the rights and duties of 
people 
wanting to divorce. The spokesman said that divorces have been 
increasing annually. The latest statistics show that 310,000 
couples divorced in 1992, compare with 190,000 couples in 1979. 
  Existing regulations for marriages of Chinese people to 
foreigners, or to Overseas Chinese people, or to residents of 
Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, are not replaced by the new decree.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Dressed in a Western 
suit and wearing a long checked shawl, Wang Donghong said he 
would like to look for an "open-minded, tender and beautiful 
girl" for his wife. 
  The 35-year-old man, who works for a Japanese company, made 
this announcement last week on a special program aired by 
Beijing television aimed at helping Chinese bachelors studying 
or working abroad and returned students who are still single to 
find mates. 
  The hostess, Yang Guang, said that she found out that many 
young people studying or working abroad are looking for partners 
from within China. However, their dreams often cannot become 
true because they live abroad. 
  "I am waiting for my luck, but it's really not easy," said 
29- year-old Lu Qing, who studied law in New Zealand and has 
opened a law office in Beijing. "Life abroad is dull. We missed 
China and our hometowns every day. After returning to China, I 
find my life is colorful and happy." 
  The 80-minute program presented nine such bachelors, some of 
whom were introduced by their family members or friends in 
China. Most of them, with master's or doctor's degrees in hand, 
have passed their 30th birthday. 
  In recent years, China has made a series of preferential 
policies including the freedom to return and leave again to 
encourage students studying abroad to return to China. More and 
more students have begun to come back.

<F P=106> [By Li Zhurun and Ni Siyi] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese press 
will eventually be guided by law and self-discipline, leaving 
the government to plan and supervise in accordance with the law. 
  According to Liang Heng, deputy director of the State Press 
and Publication Administration (SPPA), a draft of China's first 
publication law will be submitted to the Legislative Affairs 
Commission of the National People's Congress for deliberation 
this year. 
  The draft, prepared by the administration, has been 
"repeatedly revised and is now ready for legislative 
procedures." As regards the country's first press law, 
"legislative procedures are to be completed within two or three 
years." 
  Government decrees have, until now, been the guidance for 
China's press work. "Work will be intensified to ensure that 
law and self- discipline do the job," said Liang, who is in 
charge of the press work. 
  As the government body in charge of the press and publishing 
industries, Liang specified, the SPPA will, in addition to 
planning and supervision, be responsible for drafting laws and 
decrees and selecting and awarding government prizes. 
  "Self-discipline" means "instituting ethical standards or 
rules of conduct for journalists and writers in fulfilling their 
social responsibilities," Liang said. 
  The official cited the All-China Journalists Association, 
which has issued a norm of professional ethics for journalists 
throughout the country. 
  Local journalists' associations are busy preparing norms 
that 
suit local conditions, he added. 
  In implementing laws and decrees, Liang said, the SPPA will 
continue to ban illegal publications, including those of "an 
excessively low taste or pornographic." 
  But that does not amount to censorship. "Newspaper and 
magazine editors independently decide what to publish in 
accordance with state laws, government policies and their own 
editorial policies," he said. 
  SPPA officials do read and check up some publications after 
they come off the press. But they insisted that this was to 
ensure a "healthy development of China's press and publishing 
industries for the good of the entire people." 
  One was Zhang Bohai, a former editor of the People's 
Literature Publishing House and now an SPPA "examiner." "For me 
and my colleagues, the most gratifying thing is to conclude, 
after reading, that the publications are of high quality and 
taste," he said. 
  "Unless the problems in a certain publication are 
exceptionally serious, we will not take administrative measures 
against it," he added. 
  In most cases, the problems are referred to the editor with 
advice on improvement. 
  By the end of 1993, he added, 2,039 newspapers and about 
8,000 other periodicals had registered with SPPA. Among them, 
Zhang said, "only four or five were ordered to close down for 
grave problems." 
  China's press and publications industry had a boom in 1993, 
the number of newspapers registering a 13.9 growth. This year, 
SPPA officials said, the growth in the number of newspapers will 
be "controlled somewhat" for better quality. 
  The policy is one of aiding those "of high quality and 
popular" in their development and helping those of inferior 
quality to improve. 
  Meanwhile, new publications badly needed in China's economic 
construction will have priority to get registered, and this 
policy also applies to publications of science and technology or 
in languages of China's ethnic minority nationalities.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Experts at </F>
China Academy of Social Sciences Publish Pessimistic Forecast, 
Expecting Social Instability in Rural Areas This Year"] 
  [Text] A blue paper on current social conditions -- 
written recently by Lu Xueyi, director of the Sociology 
Institute of the China Academy of Social Sciences, and his 
colleagues -- predicted that China's rural communities would 
face many problems in 1994, and that it would be hard to effect 
a fundamental turn for the better in the situation, which might 
even get worse. 
  When reviewing the situation in 1993, Lu Xueyi, an expert in 
rural society, and his colleagues said: Last year, the social 
situation in the Chinese countryside was more serious than the 
economic situation. Although the situation of agricultural 
production was basically stable, social stability worsened. "It 
was a year full of worrisome events, but it was fortunate that 
no major trouble occurred." 
  They predicted that this year, town and township enterprises 
in China would continue to develop at a high speed, but that 
agricultural production would remain stagnant. According to Lu 
Xueyi's prediction, China's cotton production will pick up in 
1994, but will reach only the 1992 level. The grain production 
situation, however, will not be satisfactory because of the 
continued decrease in the area of farmland, plus other reasons. 
It is likely that gross grain output will decrease by 10 to 20 
billion jin. 
  They held that along with the appearance of stagnation in 
agricultural production, the grain supply will become more 
strained. It is expected that this year's grain output will 
reach some 440 billion jin, and if the reserve in the state 
granaries and in the hands of peasants are put together with 
imported grain, demand and supply still may be basically 
balanced. However, the degree of strain in the cotton supply 
will not be mitigated in 1994, so if things are not handled 
properly, another "cotton war" may be triggered. 
  Another problem that makes the rural situation worrisome is 
that in 1994, although town and township enterprises will 
continue to develop rapidly, peasants' income still will 
increase slowly and the rural market will continue to be less 
brisk then the urban market. On the other hand, it will be hard 
to lessen the burdens imposed on peasants, and such burdens may 
exceed 5 percent of the net annual income per capita. 
  A particularly worrisome fact is that the contradiction 
between the local governments, on one side, and the individually 
run and private enterprises in rural areas will become the focus 
of the social problems in 1994. In some localities, this may 
bring about social conflicts. 
  Lu Xueyi pointed out: The implementation of the tax-division 
system will become a serious test for most individually run and 
private enterprises in the vast central and western regions, as 
they have just started operation, and it also will become a 
serious test of the relationship between the local governments 
and these individual-run and private enterprises. The 
authorities concerned must pay sufficient attention to matters 
in this regard because the sentiments of private entrepreneurs 
will affect the vast peasantry. 
  He held that in order to mitigate the contradiction, it is 
necessary to do a good job in the following three aspects: 
  First, reducing the burdens imposed on peasants and removing 
charges according to the relevant policies. 
  Second, developing town and township enterprises, especially 
those in the central and western regions. 
  Third, streamlining government institutions and reducing the 
staff there. Those that can be merged should be merged, so that 
the number of people to be fed by government finances can be 
reduced. This is certainly an important way to lessen burdens on 
peasants.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376): "The </F>
Implementation of the `Outline on Educational Reform and 
Development Program' Brings About Progress"] 
  [Text] Today, a spokesman for the State Education 
Commission said that, in the past year since the beginning of 
the implementation of the "Outline of China's Educational Reform 
and Development," new progress has been made in our country's 
educational undertakings. Basic education has been further 
strengthened; vocational, adult education, and higher education 
have been developing at an obviously quicker pace; and 
educational structural reform has been conducted in depth. 
  The spokesman said: Last year, the schooling rate of 
children between 7 and 11 years of age in our country increased 
substantially as compared with that in 1992 and reached 98.3 
percent; elementary education was basically popularized in areas 
with over 90 percent of the national population, and junior 
secondary education was basically popularized in large cities 
and some economically developed areas. Nine-year compulsory 
education was implemented in stages throughout the country, and, 
in 1993, illiteracy was eliminated among about 5 million young 
and middle-aged people, and the rate of illiteracy among young 
and middle-aged people was lowered to about 7 percent. The 
State Education Commission established the system for assessing 
the work of popularizing nine- year compulsory education and 
eliminating illiteracy. By the end of last year, 26 provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities assessed the work in more 
than 350 counties (cities and districts). The results showed 
that Beijing Municipality took the lead in basically 
popularizing nine-year compulsory education and basically 
eliminating illiteracy, and Jilin Province basically eliminated 
illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. 
  The spokesman said: Last year, the number of students 
currently taking degree courses and diploma courses in ordinary 
institutions of higher education reached 2.54 million people, an 
all-time high. In order to set in motion the "211 project" aimed 
at training competent professionals for our country in the 21st 
century, the State Education Commission also began to carry out 
the "program for training outstanding well-educated people for 
the new century" and selected the first group of 42 outstanding 
young experts whose work would receive financial assistance. 
Last year, the number of students receiving senior secondary 
vocational education for the first time exceeded the number of 
students receiving ordinary senior secondary education; and the 
number of adult students taking degree and diploma courses of 
higher education reached 1.9 million people, or increased by 
more than 20 percent over that in 1992. In addition, the number 
of adults receiving all sorts of technical training also 
increased markedly. 
  When discussing the reform of the educational structure, the 
spokesman said: In the first year since the "Outline" was 
implemented, the schooling system in our country has begun to 
change from the pattern of complete government-run schools to 
the pattern of the government primarily running schools but with 
the participation of various social circles, and the educational 
management system based on multitiered local administration has 
also been further improved. The new curriculums for nine-year 
compulsory education and the unified examination system for 
senior secondary education have also been put into practice. In 
the area of higher education, marked progress has been made in 
the reform of the school management system and in the adjustment 
of school distribution. Some colleges and universities were 
merged, and some schools which were originally managed by the 
ministries concerned were changed into institutions jointly 
managed by local governments and central departments. Reform of 
the internal management system in colleges and universities has 
generally been started; and the reform of the systems for 
enrolling students, fixing school fees, and job placements for 
graduates has been obviously quickened. The spokesman said: 
Over the past year, with the coordination and management of the 
government, vocational education and adult education were 
strengthened with the participation of various trades, 
institutions, and social circles. The reform of the system for 
enrolling students and seeking jobs for graduates in secondary 
technical schools was also sped up. Approximately 40 percent of 
students were enrolled beyond the state's enrollment target. 
The comprehensive educational reform in rural and urban areas 
has effectively promoted economic and social development in all 
localities. 
  Gratifying progress was made in educational legislation over 
the past year. The promulgation and implementation of the 
"Teachers' Law" became an important event which was cared about 
by people in all social circles. The "Regulations on Education 
for Disabled People," the "Regulations on Non-Government-Run 
Schools," and the "Regulations on Giving Awards to Outstanding 
Teaching Results" have been submitted by the State Education 
Commission to the State Council, and the "Education Law" is 
being intensively drafted. At the same time, a number of 
important policy documents and some local regulations were also 
successively put into practice last year.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's total 
population totalled 1,185.17 million by the end of 1993, an 
increase of nearly 13.5 million from a year before, according to 
the State Statistics Bureau. 
  Information released by the bureau today showed that China's 
birth rate was 18.09 per thousand and death rate 6.64 per 
thousand, which meant a natural population growth rate of 11.45 
per thousand. 
  Statistics indicated a remarkable increase in household 
income. In urban areas, the figure per capita was 2,337 yuan 
last year, a real hike of 10 percent over the previous year, 
while in rural areas it was 921 yuan, a three percent real 
increase. 
  But the Bureau pointed out that differences in income level 
between provinces and between urban and rural households were 
expanding and that living standards of a host of households 
declined. 
  The Bureau said in a statistical communique that the reform 
in the field of labor and employment had been accelerated, 
leading to the improvement of the employment service system. By 
the end of last year, employment agencies in China totalled 
13,000 and 7.05 million people found jobs in cities and towns. 
  The urban unemployment rate was 2.6 percent last year, it 
said. 
  China's workers and staff numbered 150.4 million by the end 
of 1993, 2.48 million more than a year before, while workers in 
private enterprises and individual workers numbered 11.16 
million, an increase of 2.78 million. 
  Last year also saw a continued development of the social 
welfare sector. There were 954,000 beds in social welfare 
institutions of various types in China, with 706,000 people 
being accomodated. Some 41 million people in need received 
relief from the government. 
  At the same time, the social security network extended to 
nearly 32 percent of rural townships, 97,000 community service 
facilities in urban areas were established and workers' pension 
insurance was expanding. 
  China paid special attention to environmental protection. By 
the end of 1993, the number of environmental protection workers 
was 81,000. Seventy-seven nature protection areas were set up, 
10 of which became members of the man and the biosphere 
international protection network. 
  China has set 313 standards in order to keep the environment 
clean and safe. In 1993 alone, 2.54 billion yuan was invested 
in 5,737 projects to fight against environmental pollution, the 
Bureau said.

  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (CNS)--A police patrol system 
is now in place nationwide with 88 medium- and large-sized 
cities, including 23 municipalities and provincial capitals, 
introducing this practice with a patrol force of 15,000 in 
various police units. The practice has enabled the public 
security department to have a tight grip on public order and 
help create a sense of safety throughout society. 
  Implementation of the patrol system has in the past two 
years 
been one of the important measures adopted in various cities for 
the restructuring of public security work and for the 
strengthening of public order. The police patrol practice has 
been adopted in certain areas in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, 
Wuhan, Fuzhou, Xian and Shenyang and such patrols are supported 
by advanced communications systems enabling a rapid response to 
emergencies. 
  The patrol practice provides a convenience for the public to 
report crime to the police and in turn boosts the ability of a 
rapid response by the police. Shanghai has a police force of 
2,800 specially for patrols, and patrol posts have been erected 
in certain areas in the municipality and cover a wide area. The 
police can rush to the scene of a problem within three to five 
minutes after receiving a report. Police on patrol arrested a 
total of 1,986 suspected criminals in Tianjin last year and 5836 
criminals were dealt with. Patrolling police helped solve 6,589 
cases concerning social order and 1,947 criminal cases while 
they settled 15,900 civil disputes and some 100,000 cases where 
the public was faced with various kinds of difficulties and 
problems. Police patrols in cars were employed last year in 
Wuhan, Xian, Hangzhou and Shenzhen with striking success in the 
handling of crime reports and showing a rapid response in 
combatting various kinds of crime.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Legislative Affairs 
Commission under the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress [NPC], the Ministry of State Security, and FAZHI RIBAO 
[Legal System Daily] held a joint forum today to mark the first 
anniversary of the promulgation of the "State Security Law of 
the People's Republic of China." 
  Hu Kansheng, vice chairman of the Legislative Affairs 
Commission under the NPC Standing Committee, presided over the 
forum. Those who spoke at the forum included Jia Chunwang, 
minister of state security; Zou Yu, director of the China Law 
Society; Wang Shuwen, vice chairman of the NPC Law Committee; 
and Wang Shengjun, deputy secretary general of the Central 
Commission on Politics and Law. 
  They stressed that the "State Security Law" adopted at the 
30th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh NPC on 22 
February 1993 has not only provided a forceful legal weapon for 
state security organs to prevent and stop all kinds of 
lawbreaking and criminal acts that endanger state security, but 
also fully reflected the strong desire of the people in the 
nation for persisting in "carrying out the policy of promoting 
the reform and opening drive with one hand and cracking down on 
severe crimes with the other" and in "toughly implementing the 
two-handed policy," thus forming a legal basis for all levels of 
party and government organizations to mobilize the masses to 
jointly maintain state security. Although this law was 
promulgated only a short time ago, its implementation has 
achieved initial results. The law has won the universal support 
of the broad mass of the people and has played a more and more 
obvious role in the practical work of defending state security 
and maintaining social stability. This demonstrates that the 
formulation of the "State Security Law" in China is quite 
necessary. 
  Participants at the meeting pointed out the long-term work 
of 
implementing and enforcing the "State Security Law" and called 
for perseverance in doing a good job of implementing it. They 
spoke of the need for all levels of party committees, people's 
congresses, governments, and units involved in foreign affairs 
work to continuously and extensively study, publicize, and 
implement the "State Security Law"; to enable the masses to 
better understand the important significance of the relevant 
stipulations in this law, to enhance their consciousness of 
state security, to help them firmly establish the concept of 
"it's everyone's responsibility to protect national security," 
to urge them to closely coordinate with state security organs 
and relevant departments to prevent and stop criminal acts that 
jeopardize state security, and to ensure the smooth progress of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction.

  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Sending good wishes 
via the greeting wire service has become a popular fashion in 
China on occasion of festivals and celebrations, as the 
country's telecommunications have greatly improved. 
  In a change from the previous over-elaborate formalities, 
more and more Chinese, who are leading a better and more 
efficient life, are turning to faster and more economical ways 
of conveying their greetings. 
  In Guangzhou, which has the most telephone users among all 
cities in China, many people dialled to express their good 
wishes on New Year's day this year. A few simple words on the 
phone easily bring people closer despite the distances between 
them. 
  Central China's Hunan Province opened a greeting wire 
service 
during the New Year festival and cut fees for trunk calls by 
half. 
  In Dongshan Island, southern Fujian Province, the number of 
calls sent by local villagers to their friends and kin in Taiwan 
increased by half over the previous years. 
  During China's traditional Spring Festival, sounds of pagers 
could be heard everywhere in large cities. Digits appearing on 
pagers indicated all kinds of good wishes. 
  In Taiyuan, capital of northwest China's Shanxi Province, it 
was counted that during the Spring Festival, the pager system of 
the city's telecommunication bureau sent over 100,000 greetings 
each day. 
  In the past, telegrams told people of emergencies. However, 
many post offices have opened telegraph greeting services. 
Along with telegrams, people could also receive gifts, such as 
flowers or cakes, which were sent at the request of their 
friends. 
  A young man who was in love with a girl but was too shy to 
say it, sent a greeting telegram and a bunch of flowers on New 
Year's day. Since then he has sent a greeting telegram as well 
as a rose to her every day. The telegrams helped him to show 
his affections. 
  Officials said that the booming of the greeting wire service 
comes with the booming of the country's telecommunications. 
  Last year, 18 cities widened their handling capacities of 
telecommunication systems. 
  In Taiyuan, the capacity of the city's telephone network has 
reached 304,000. 
  With the improvement of living standards, more and more 
people ask for modern communication channels. As a result, 
experts say, greeting wire services are bound to become even 
more popular.

Province Promotes All-Position Opening to the Outside World"] 
  [Text] Chengdu (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Sichuan, a province 
located in inland China, in recent years has stepped up the 
process of opening up to the outside world as an important 
measure to speed up economic development. The province has made 
many foreign friends, expanded international cooperation, and 
achieved a great success. 
  Cities in Sichuan Province have so far established friendly 
ties with 33 cities of 14 countries; meanwhile, the province has 
established economic and trade relations and cooperation with 
more than 120 countries and areas. In order to encourage 
foreign investors to expand their investments, Sichuan Province 
last year organized investment and trade talks in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Macao, and the ROK, and sponsored Sichuan Festivals in 
Moscow and Sofia, all of which were successful. The province 
also participated and played an active part in the Shenzhen 
Investment Symposium. Despite the drastic changes in both the 
domestic and overseas markets, Sichuan Province persistently 
promoted export trade with a view to earning more foreign 
exchange income. Last year, Sichuan Province's gross 
import-export volume totaled $2,916 million, an increase of 32.6 
percent over the previous year. Of this volume, the export 
value totaled $1.65 billion, an increase of 11 percent. A total 
of 1,910 new foreign-funded enterprises were established, and a 
number of agreements on foreign-financed investment projects 
were signed, involving a total value of $2.4 billion. The 
province signed project construction contracts and labor service 
contracts with foreign parties, involving a total value of $600 
million, an increase of 17.6 percent. The province's border 
trade volume totaled $750 million. Foreign exchange earnings 
derived from tourism totaled $80.4 million, an increase of 16.2 
percent. Province-wide economic and technological cooperation 
has also been further expanded. 
  This year, the Sichuan provincial party committee and 
government are to take up the undertaking of opening up to the 
outside world as a task of top priority, further do away with 
ossified thinking, enhance the sense of opening up, improve the 
environment for investment both in terms of software and 
hardware, simplify operational procedures, and improve service 
quality. The province will reorganize state-owned foreign trade 
enterprises to meet the requirements of the modern enterprise 
system, thus increase export volume and earn more foreign 
exchange. In this connection, the province has drawn up a plan 
and selected 10 large export enterprise groups to undertake 
pilot projects with the aim of establishing international 
consortia with legal entity status. At the same time, 
enterprises with good potential will be encouraged to increase 
exports with a view to earning more foreign exchange, so that 
the province's total export volume will rise to $2 billion this 
year. 
  Sichuan Province will strive to attract more investors, 
explore more investment sources, and make use of various other 
channels, in an effort to introduce 2,000 new foreign-funded 
enterprises into the province. At the same time, the province 
has decided to select a number of strong, key industrial 
branches and some large- and medium-sized enterprises or 
workshops to run a number of technology-intensive 
technology-import projects with high added value, in the forms 
of joint ventures, cooperation operation, lease, and technology 
assignment, so as to establish a group of high-standard and 
large-scale foreign-funded enterprises. The target of this 
operation is to import $1 billion or even $1.5 billion worth of 
foreign capital.

for 1994 (Excerpts)"] 
  [Text]I. The Implementation of the 1993 Plan 
  In 1993, the national economy of the whole province, on the 
basis of the relatively fast growth of the previous year, 
continued to maintain a good momentum. After the implementation 
of Document No 6 of the Central Committee in particular, the 
increasingly tense economic environment was improved, the pace 
of economic construction was accelerated, the strength of reform 
and opening up increased, various social undertakings were 
vigorously developed, and the annual plan of the main sectors of 
the national economy was basically fulfilled or overfulfilled. 
The domestic gross output value of the whole year was 186.6 
billion yuan, an increase of 12.8 percent, of which the tertiary 
industry increased by 12.3 percent. The gross output value of 
the industrial and agricultural production was 366.53 billion 
yuan (334.07 billion yuan as calculated according to the 
constant prices in 1990), an increase of 26.8 percent. They 
were respectively 3.8, 0.3, and 15.4 percentage points higher 
than the requirements of the annual plan. 
  1. The rural economy developed steadily and township and 
town enterprises grew at a high speed. Last year, despite 
natural disasters, a relatively good harvest was reaped in 
agriculture through the common efforts of the whole province. 
The total grain output of the whole province was 43 million 
tonnes, 1.311 million tonnes less than the previous year. The 
number of hogs marketed was 67.38 million, 1.38 million more 
than the previous year. Trees were satisfactorily planted over 
5.34 million mu of land, which greatly exceeded the targeted 
area of the plan. The situation of a higher rate of 
tree-felling than tree-planting began to change. Some 3.15 
million mu of medium- and low-yield fields were transformed, 5.1 
percent more than the requirement of the annual plan. The 
township and town enterprises developed at a high speed. Their 
total annual output value was 191.87 billion yuan, 95 percent 
over the previous year. The income from sales and profits and 
taxes increased simultaneously. The momentum of rural laborers 
going out of the province was good. The annual gross output 
value of agriculture was 84.59 billion yuan (81.1 billion yuan 
as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), 1.5 
percent over the previous year. 
  2. The reform of enterprises was continuously deepened, 
industrial production grew at a high speed, and the economic 
results were improving. Our province thoroughly implemented the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Changing the 
Operational Mechanism of Enterprises Under the Ownership of the 
Whole People," emphatically grasped the work of changing the 
operational mechanisms of 2,000 enterprises, and selected 22 
large and medium-sized state enterprises for carrying out 
experiments on the establishment of the modern enterprise 
system. Industrial production maintained rapid growth 
throughout the whole year. The gross output value of industry 
of the whole province was 281.94 billion yuan (252.97 billion 
yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), an 
increase of 37.8 percent, of which industries at or above the 
township level accounted for 212.61 billion yuan (181.39 billion 
yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), an 
increase of 20.9 percent. They were respectively 22.8 and 8.9 
percentage points higher than the requirements of the annual 
plan. The output of major industrial products increased by 
varying degrees and the annual plans for them were 
overfulfilled. Production was basically in keeping with 
marketing and the annual marketing rate of products reached 96.1 
percent. The economic results of enterprises were improving. 
The total amount of profits of local state-run industrial 
enterprises included in the provincial budget was 77 percent 
higher than the previous year and the growth of profits and 
taxes was 43.7 percent. 
  3. The investment structure was readjusted to some extent 
and the construction of key projects was strengthened. Last 
year the increase in the investment in fixed assets of our 
province was relative big, the number of newly started projects 
was reduced, the investment structure was further readjusted, 
and the work of key construction projects was carried out in a 
down-to-earth manner. It is estimated that 50.6 billion yuan of 
investment in fixed assets of the whole society in the whole 
year was completed, 24.8 percent over the previous year. In 
accordance with the requirements of the central authorities on 
strengthening macroregulation and control in investment in fixed 
assets, our province seriously checked up on invested projects 
under construction and arranged them into different categories. 
We ensured the construction of the most important ones and 
increased the speed of construction of key projects. With 
efforts during the past year, most of the key construction 
projects in Sichuan progressed smoothly and some of them were 
completed and put into operation. 
  4. Great efforts were made to strengthen market building and 
urban and rural markets were stable and tended to become brisk. 
Last year, emphasis was made on grasping the reform of the 
circulation structure and the building of the market system and 
markets of various kinds developed to a varying degrees. Efforts 
were made to develop urban and rural markets and to meet the 
purchase demands of the residents. The supply of consumers' 
commodities was abundant across the province. The annual social 
commodity retail sale volume amounted to 85.46 billion yuan, 
18.8 percent over the previous year and exceeding the 
requirement of the annual plan. Following reforms in housing, 
medical service, education, and the social security system, the 
noncommodity consumption of the residents increased to a 
relatively great extent. 
  5. The province was opened wider to the outside world and 
progress of a breakthrough nature was made in attracting foreign 
businessmen and capital. The annual import and export volume 
was $2.916 billion, 32.6 percent over the previous year, of 
which the export volume was $1.65 billion, an increase by 11 
percent. The total volume of border trade was 750 million yuan, 
74.4 percent over the previous year. The establishment of 1,910 
additional foreign- invested enterprises were approved in the 
whole year and agreements involving the introduction of $2.4 
billion were signed. The direction of foreign investment also 
began to shift from ordinary industries to capital-intensive and 
technology-intensive industries, basic industries such as power 
industry, transportation, and telecommunication, and technical 
transformation of large and medium-sized enterprises. 
  6. The work related to financial revenue was satisfactorily 
carried out and the financial order was improved to some extent. 
The annual revenue amounted to 20.14 billion yuan, an increase 
of 37.1 percent. In view of the drastic fall in bank savings 
and abnormal cash inputs in the first half of the year, 
governments at all levels seriously implemented various measures 
concerning the strengthening of macroregulation control put 
forward by the central authorities and the province, resolutely 
consolidated the financial order, made great efforts to pool 
funds, seized the opportunity to grant more loans, readjusted 
the credit structure, and ensured the needs of economic 
development and key construction projects of our province are 
met. 
  7. The science, education, and other social sectors were 
strengthened and the living standard of the people was further 
improved. Last year, with the support of state departments 
concerned, our province undertook 180 key state projects and 55 
key projects included in the provincial plan to turn 
achievements in science and technology into productive forces. 
Good results were made in different stages in most of the 
projects and they produced good economic results in production. 
Through making great efforts to enhance technical progress, the 
ability of enterprises to develop technology with their own 
resources and to digest and absorb technology was greatly 
increased. Greater importance was attached to education, the 
input into education by the whole society continued to increase, 
the quality of education was improved, and benefits from running 
schools also increased to some extent. The speed of the 
development of ordinary middle school education and tertiary 
education increased markedly and the scale of enrollment was 
enlarged. 
  People's living standards continuously improved and their 
living conditions also improved to some extent. Urban and rural 
construction developed steadily. Medical service and public 
health work further developed and, in particular, the rural 
sanitary conditions were improved to some extent. Family 
planning was considerably strengthened and the rate of the 
annual natural population growth was 9.57 per thousand. At the 
same time, various social undertakings such as culture, arts, 
radio, television, the press, publication, employment, tourism, 
and sports, developed by varying degrees. 
  8. The economy and society of areas inhabited by minority 
nationalities developed comprehensively. Last year, areas 
inhabited by minority nationalities in our province further 
emancipated their minds, made greater efforts in reform and 
opening up, overcame various difficulties in economic life, and 
maintained a good situation of a relatively fast development of 
the national economy and social stability. The domestic gross 
output value of areas inhabited by minority nationalities of the 
whole province is expected to be 9.6 percent over the previous 
year. The total grain output was higher than the previous year. 
In the pastoral areas, the rate of cattle marketed and the 
commodity rate increased. The annual gross output value of 
agriculture increased by 5.5 percent. Mainstay industries 
characteristic of the strong points of resources in areas 
inhabited by minority nationalities continued to take shape and 
the speed of construction of transportation, telecommunication, 
and other infrastructure was accelerated. The living standard 
of the people continued to improve and the annual per capita net 
income of the peasants and herdsmen is expected to reach 500 
yuan. 
  However, some conspicuous contradictions and problems also 
cropped up in the course of the implementation of the plan. The 
first is that last year, the prices of the means of agricultural 
production rose too fast and the efficiency of agriculture 
declined. The second was that the contradiction between the 
supply and demand of funds was too sharp. The third was that 
the coordination in development between heavy and light 
industry, and between the state- owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises on the one hand and the state-owned small 
enterprises on the other, was not good enough. The fourth was 
that commodity prices rose too fast. Besides, there were other 
problems such as inefficient macroregulation and control and 
funds were too widely spread. In making economic plans this 
year, we must pay great attention to these contradictions and 
problems and have them properly resolved. 
<H5>  II. Arrangements of the 1994 Plan </H5>
  This year is a crucial year in promoting reform to establish 
the socialist market economy structure. It is also an important 
year to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development 
[chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhen 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 
4099 1455] of the national economy. Therefore, planning 
arrangements should have new ways of thinking and should meet 
the needs of the new economic structure. According to the 
guiding ideology for the economic work of the whole province put 
forward by the provincial government, we should lay stress on 
grasping the four principles in planning arrangements this year: 
The first is to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. The second is to ensure 
the smooth implementation of various reformative measures. The 
third is to properly readjust the economic structure of our 
province in accordance with the needs of building the socialist 
market economy structure. The fourth is to effectively control 
the range of the rise of the general level of commodity prices 
to maintain social stability. 
  According to the above principles, the arrangements for the 
main targets of the national economy and social development plan 
of the whole province this year are: 
  The domestic gross output value is to be 220.8 billion yuan, 
an increase of 9.6 percent; of which the increased value of the 
tertiary industry is to be 60.7 billion yuan, an increase of 
11.3 percent. 
  The gross output value of industry and agriculture is to be 
(as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990) 376.8 
billion yuan, an increase of 12.8 percent. 
  The financial revenue is to be 12.24 billion yuan, an 
increase of 9.7 percent. 
  The total retail volume of commodities of the society is to 
be 100.8 to 102.6 billion yuan, an increase of 18 to 20 percent. 
  The total index of retail prices of the whole society is to 
be controlled around 110 percent. 
  The local investment in fixed assets of the whole society is 
to be 30.786 billion yuan, 70.8 percent over the beginning of 
last year. 
  The per capita net income of the peasants is to exceed 775 
yuan, an increase of more than 80 yuan, and efforts are to be 
made to increase their income by 100 yuan. 
  The rate of natural growth of the population is to be 11.66 
per thousand and the population at the end of the year is to 
reach 112.456 million. 
  The main aspects of the planning arrangements are: 
  1. Continue to put agriculture in the most important 
position of economic work. The gross output value of 
agriculture is planned to reach 84.3 billion yuan, an increase 
of 4 percent; and the total grain output is planned to reach 43 
million tonnes, which is expected to be the same as that of last 
year. The gross output value of township and town enterprises 
is to reach 250 billion yuan, an increase of 30 percent. 
Stabilizing grain output, increasing income, and structural 
readjustment are regarded to be the main targets and guiding 
ideology of rural work. Striving to become relatively well-off 
is to be in command of all rural work. Reform is to be 
deepened, structural readjustment is to be made, circulation is 
to be invigorated, the first, second, and third industries in 
rural areas are to be developed in a coordinated manner, and 
great efforts are to be made to achieve breakthroughs in 
increasing the agricultural output, increasing the peasants' 
income, and developing township and town enterprises. 
  2. Seize the opportunity to deepen reform of 
enterprises and to maintain a rapid and efficient growth of 
industrial production. According to this year's plan, the 
gross output value of the whole province is to reach 292.5 
billion yuan, 15.6 percent more than the previous year. The 
gross output value of industries at and above the township level 
is to reach 203.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12 percent. A 
certain growth rate is to be maintained in the output of main 
industrial products. According to the plan, it is necessary to 
create good external conditions for deepening the reform of 
enterprises and for improving state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises. It is necessary to speed up the reform of 
enterprises and structural readjustment, regarding the 
improvement of state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises 
as the center and the establishment of the modern enterprise 
system as the target. It is necessary to, through deepening the 
reform of enterprises, strengthen management, reduce 
consumption, lower production costs, and energetically increase 
the economic results of industry. 
  3. Maintain a rational scale of investment and make 
great efforts to readjust the investment structure. This 
year, the scale of local investment in the fixed assets of the 
whole society is 30.786 billion yuan, of which the investment 
local state-owned units accounts for 23.036 billion yuan, and 
that of collective investment, 7.75 billion yuan. It is 
necessary to widen the investment and fund-raising channels for 
basic projects and key construction projects and to support the 
development of bottle-neck industries and the exploitation of 
resources. It is necessary to make greater efforts to readjust 
the investment structure. In making investment, the province is 
to give priority to projects for transportation, agriculture, 
water conservation, telecommunication, energy, and important raw 
materials, projects jointly constructed by the state and the 
province, winding-up projects, projects whose products are 
required to meet targeted quotas, and projects whose 
construction is resumed. The focus of technical transformation 
is to optimize the structure, save energy consumption, do a good 
job in the transformation of state-owned large and medium-sized 
old enterprises and old industrial bases, and raise the level of 
key industries centering round industries with strong points and 
best-selling products. 
  4. Do a good job in the planning, layout, and 
construction of various key markets in our province and make 
great efforts to develop and expand the markets; deepen the 
reform of the operational structure and make great efforts to 
raise funds. A number of big markets are to be developed 
in our province in important places where commodities are 
produced, marketed, collected, and distributed and stress is to 
be laid on the construction of a number of large and 
multifunctional wholesale markets which can have a positive 
impact on a wide range of neighboring localities. The uneven 
development of the market system in our province is to be 
changed. The nurturing and development of the funds, stock, 
technology, information, qualified personnel, labor power, and 
other essentials markets are to be speeded up and the gradual 
formation of the market system is to be promoted. On the basis 
of consolidating the order last year, the reform of the 
financial structure in our province is to be properly carried 
out and the macroregulation and control of the people's banks 
are to be strengthened. At the same time, various specialized 
banks are to be gradually changed into commercial banks. 
Efforts are to be made to encourage people to keep more bank 
savings, to properly run various kinds of social security 
undertakings, and to pool up funds to meet the needs of economic 
development. 
  5. Make great efforts to open up wider to the outside 
world, to expand foreign economic relations and trade, and to 
attract foreign businessmen and introduce foreign capital. 
According to the plan, the total import and export volume in 
the foreign trade of whole province is $3.15 billion, an 
increase by 8 percent, of which the export accounts for $1.815 
billion, and efforts are to be made to make it $2 billion. In 
the whole year, $3 billion of foreign capital involved in 
agreements is to be used and the amount of foreign capital to be 
actually used, $1 billion. Efforts are to be actively made to 
keep abreast with the reform of the foreign trade and foreign 
exchanges structure and various enterprises with necessary 
conditions are to be encouraged to increase export to earn more 
foreign exchange. Continued efforts are to be made to readjust 
the export product mix of our province, to earnestly strengthen 
quality control and supervision, and to strive to bring about a 
marked improvement of the quality of the export commodities of 
our province. The investment environment is to be further 
improved to attract more foreign capital for foreign-invested 
enterprises in Sichuan. Efforts are to be made to have more 
than 2,000 additional foreign-invested enterprises. Industrial 
policy guidance for foreign businessmen to make investment is to 
be strengthened and foreign businessmen are to be encouraged to 
continue to make investment in infrastructure, basic industries, 
high-technology and new-technology industries, and the technical 
transformation of old enterprises. 
  6. Implement the strategy of "revitalizing Sichuan 
with education" and the "Law on the Progress of Science and 
Technology," and make great efforts to turn science and 
technology achievements in science and technology into realistic 
productive forces; implement the "Education Reform and 
Development Program" and the "Teachers Law" and train various 
kinds of qualified personnel to meet the needs of economic 
construction. The reform of the science and technology 
management structure is to be pushed further forward and the 
focus is to be put on turning achievements into productive 
forces. Efforts are to be concentrated on a number of science 
and technology projects which have good market prospects, high 
added-values, a major role in the development of the national 
economy of our province, and a role in promoting the development 
of relevant trades and of the regional economy. At the same 
time, various ways are to be adopted to extensively carry out 
science and technology consultation, technology exchanges, and 
other activities in a bid to apply faster more achievements in 
science and technology to production and construction. 
  Education is to be earnestly put in a strategic position and 
priority is to be given to its development. To meet the needs 
of qualified personnel for reform, opening up, and economic 
development, the readjustment of courses, levels, and speciality 
structure of colleges, universities, and post-secondary 
institutes is to be speeded up. The issue of personnel needed 
by border and remote areas, poor mountain areas, areas inhabited 
by minority nationalities, sectors whose work is difficult to 
do, and township and town enterprises is to be solved through 
expanding the enrollment of students whose assignments after 
graduation are fixed, students trained on behalf of departments 
and organizations, and students who paid for their tuition. The 
structure of running schools is to be further reformed to meet 
the needs of the social and economic development. Various 
channels are to be used to raise funds for running schools, 
conditions for running schools are to be improved, and the 
quality and benefits of running schools are to be improved and 
increased. 
  7. Meet the needs of economic development, promote the 
coordinated development of various social undertakings, and 
strive to improve the people's living standard. Public 
health undertakings, cultural undertakings, and social security 
undertakings are indispensable factors for the assessment of the 
goal of being relatively well-off. While grasping economic 
development, governments at all levels must make unified 
planning with due consideration for all concerned to ensure 
coordinated development. In a bid to meet the needs of and keep 
abreast with the progress of the general reform, the speed of 
reform in the social security system and the housing system is 
to be accelerated, and the comprehensive progress of the social 
undertakings of the whole province is to be promoted. On the 
basis of developing the economy and increasing benefits, the 
living standard of the urban and rural residents are to be 
further improved. 
  8. Have a foothold on the strong point of resources, 
and speed up the economic development of areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities. The "Nationality Regional Autonomy 
Law" is to be comprehensively implemented, various policies to 
help areas inhabited by minority nationalities issued by the 
state and the province are to be fully utilized, and flexible 
opening up strategies are to be adopted to speed up the economic 
development of areas inhabited by minority nationalities and to 
narrow the gap between these areas and the hinterland. A 
foothold is to be planted on the strong point of resources in 
areas inhabited by minority nationalities and the construction 
of agriculture, power industry, nonferrous metal industry, gold 
industry, transportation, telecommunication, and other basic 
industries and infrastructure is to be further stressed. Great 
efforts are to be made to exploit tourism resources and to 
develop tourism and tourism is to be used to promote the 
development of the tertiary industry in areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities in our province. Greater efforts are to 
be made to develop social undertakings in areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities and the cultural, science, technology, 
and health levels of the peasants and herdsmen are to be 
constantly raised. Great efforts are to be made to 
comprehensively fulfill the Eighth 5-Year Plan a year ahead of 
schedule. 
  9. Do a good job in regional planning and promote 
regional economic development. The two center cities of 
Chengdu and Chongqing are to be used as a support, the 
preferential policies for opening up the two cities are to be 
fully used and extended, and the developed areas and the 
backward areas are to be linked up in order to attain common 
prosperity. "The two lines" are to be developed with great 
effort, on the basis of continuously developing agriculture, 
township and town enterprises, to speed up the development of 
the second and tertiary industries, and to promote the process 
of industrializing the rural areas and integrating the urban and 
rural areas in a bid to become relatively well-off earlier. The 
three gorges economic zone is to seize the opportunity, to 
combine the resettlement of people with the economic development 
of the reservoir zone, to make unified planning with due 
consideration for all concerned, and to speed up the economic 
development of the entire reservoir zone. While properly 
grasping the construction of a number of existing major projects 
for the exploitation of resources, the Panxi Chuannan Economic 
Zone is to grasp firmly the early-stage work of a number of 
projects. Great efforts are to be made to introduce foreign 
capital and technology and to promote the exploitation of 
resources and economic development of the entire economic zone. 
The hilly areas in central Sichuan is to energetically 
cooperate with the construction of the Daxian-Chengdu railway. 
The Guangan Bazhong prefecture is to take advantage of its new 
establishment to grasp firmly planning work and to speed up its 
development. 
  10. Enthusiastically and carefully grasp well the 
construction of existing development zones of the whole 
province. Macroguidance to the development zones is to be 
strengthened and the principle of making unified planning with 
due consideration for all concerned, making rational layouts, 
acting according to one's capability, doing one's best, starting 
within a smaller area, and developing in a rolling manner, is to 
be upheld. An operational mechanism for development zones which 
conforms with the socialist market economy structure is to be 
enthusiastically explored and the construction and management of 
the development zones are to be gradually put on the orbits of 
standardization and legalization so that the development zones 
can truly become new growing points and supporting points of the 
economic development of our province.

commercial households; county-level industrial and commercial 
administrations in remote and poverty-stricken areas can 
authorize industrial and commercial administrative offices to 
issue business licenses for individual industrial and commercial 
households. 
  7. The business scope and management of individual and 
privately-owned economic sectors shall be further relaxed. 
Except for those trades and commodities which the state laws 
and regulations prohibit management of by individual industrial 
and commercial households and privately-owned enterprises, they 
are allowed to manage all other trades and commodities. The 
style for managing trades and commodities which are allowed to 
be managed by individual and privately owned businesses shall be 
completely free. 
  Individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately-owned enterprises may form economic associations of 
various forms embracing different regions, trades, and ownership 
systems; and they may buy shares from each other. Privately 
owned enterprises may contract, lease, merge with, or purchase 
state-owned and collective enterprises. 
  8. With approval from the competent authority, individual 
industrial and commercial households and privately owned 
enterprises may set up private schools, kindergartens, 
hospitals, and clinics. 
  Except for the category of mines prohibited by the state or 
the autonomous regional people's government for exploitation, 
individual industrial and commercial households and privately 
owned enterprises may apply for the exploitation of small 
amounts of mineral ores and establishment of small mining 
enterprises. 
  9. Individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises may transport means of production or 
subsistence or farm and sideline products for sale over long 
distances to meet market demands; they should be encouraged to 
carry out comprehensive mobile business activities in remote 
farming and pastoral areas and poor areas; and they should also 
be encouraged and supported to engage in commodity wholesale 
businesses. 
  To actively encourage individual industrial and commercial 
households and privately owned enterprises to develop tertiary 
industries, registration formalities should be simplified and 
sped up with regard to application for setting up businesses in 
commerce, food catering, service, repairing, consultation, 
communications, and long-distance transportation and sale. 
  10. Individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately-owned enterprises should be supported in setting up 
joint and cooperative ventures with foreign investors and in 
engaging in processing with materials and samples or assembling 
of parts and components provided by foreign clients and in 
compensation trade. They may engage in mutual trade with border 
residents. 
  In line with the policy of inducing investment from abroad 
and developing lateral ties at home, the competent authority 
should treat individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises the same way as state-owned 
enterprises, and should examine and approve their application 
for the establishment of the "three kinds of foreign-funded 
enterprises" within the time limit. Those that have received 
the approval and are issued the "PRC license for the three kinds 
of foreign-funded enterprises" are entitled to preferential 
treatment in absorbing foreign capital as prescribed in the 
relevant state and regional policies. 
  A "business license of enterprise legal entity" should be 
issued to privately owned enterprises that have set up wholly 
funded or partnership businesses abroad so their legal status 
can be established. 
  11. When peasants and herdsmen in poor remote areas apply 
for 
the establishment of individual and privately-owned economic 
undertakings, the industry and commerce administration may, in 
accordance with the principle of "opening up first and 
regulating later," file the application on record and allow them 
to begin business activities without obtaining a license and 
paying fees and to complete the registration after the 
conditions are ripe. 
  Preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption shall 
be given to individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises for a given period after they set up 
factories or stores for productive operations in farming and 
pastoral areas in accordance with the relevant regulations. 
  Preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption shall 
be given to individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises that set up productive undertakings 
in remote farming and pastoral areas, especially in townships 
and villages below the county level. 
  12. Privately owned enterprises that meet the quota of 
employing handicapped people shall be given tax reduction or 
exemption as deemed appropriate by tax offices; and the industry 
and commerce administration may reduce or exempt administrative 
fees on them. 
  Revenues from tax reduction and exemption for privately 
owned 
enterprises should be used for expanding the scale of production. 
  13. With approval from the science and technology and 
planning and economic commissions at the same level and with the 
certification of tax offices, individual industrial and 
commercial households and privately owned enterprises shall be 
given preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption 
during a given period of time in their trial development and 
production of new products. 
  14. The administrative departments of industry and commerce, 
taxation, commodity prices, public security, urban construction 
and environmental protection, science and technology, and public 
health should actively provide guidance and consultation 
regarding laws, regulations, policies, information, and science 
and technology; and they should exercise administration within 
the scope of their functions prescribed by the law to create a 
favorable social environment for the healthy development of 
individual and private economic sectors. 
  15. The lawful rights and interests of individual and 
private 
economic sectors shall be protected by law. Except under 
circumstances allowed by the state laws and statutes and the 
regulations of the regional people's government, no unit or 
individual shall be allowed to arbitrarily collect fees and 
donations from and impose fines on individual industrial and 
commercial households and privately owned enterprises. When 
fees are collected, it is necessary to show the "fee collection 
license" issued by the commodity price department, publicize the 
reason and standard for fee collection, and use the uniform 
voucher. Individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises have the right to refuse to pay 
illegal fees, and to report and complain to the government and 
relevant departments. 
  16. Except for the industry and commerce administration, no 
unit or individual shall be allowed to seize or revoke the 
business license of individual industrial and commercial 
households and privately owned enterprises. Units and personnel 
concerned should bear legal and economic responsibilities for 
economic and other damage done to individual industrial and 
commercial households and privately owned enterprises as a 
result of illegal seizure or revoking of their business license. 
  17. Land used by individual industrial and commercial 
households and privately-owned enterprises for business 
operations or factory construction should be incorporated into 
the overall plan of urban construction. The urban construction 
department should arrange appropriate buisness venues for 
individual industrial and commercial households and privately 
owned enterprises that are to be dismantled and relocated under 
urban construction plans. When the dismantling and relocation 
is approved by a people's government at and above the county 
level, the construction units and individuals should bear the 
dismantling and relocation expenses according to the relevant 
regulations. 
  No unit or individual shall be allowed to occupy business 
venues which have been approved by the competent authority for 
use by individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises. Units and individuals that occupy 
such venues shall be responsible for economic damage caused by 
the occupation. 
  18. Staff members of state administrative organs shall not 
violate the lawful rights and interests of individual industrial 
and commercial households and privately owned enterprises. 
Violators shall be given administrative disciplinary action and 
economic penalties by the competent authority, depending on the 
degree of seriousness; those who cause economic damage shall be 
ordered to make compensation, and those who violate criminal law 
shall be turned over to the judicial organ and be affixed with 
criminal responsibilities. 
  19. Individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises shall use the uniform voucher which 
is printed by the taxation department and which does not 
indicate the nature of ownership. No unit shall be allowed to 
reject the voucher as receipt for expense. 
  20. To harness the enthusiasm of individual industrial and 
commercial households and privately owned enterprises in 
donating funds to schools, education departments at all levels 
should allow schools to accept children of individual industrial 
and commercial households and owners and employees of private 
enterprises from both inside and outside the locality. 
  21. Qualified individual industrial and commercial 
households 
and owners and employees of private enterprises may apply to 
join the CPC, the Communist Youth League, and the Army; to go to 
a school of higher grade; to be recruited as cadres or workers; 
and to be elected as model workers, people's congress deputies, 
and members of the people's political consultative conference. 
Outstanding individuals with meritorious service may be 
recommended to leading posts. 
  Individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately 
run enterprises that have made outstanding contributions to the 
regional economic development and have delivered more than 
50,000 yuan in taxes annually may apply to governments at 
various levels for transfer from agricultural to nonagricultural 
households. 
  22. Governments at all levels should strengthen leadership 
over associations of self-employed workers; actively create 
conditions for solving practical problems related to personnel, 
budget, and office venue; and bring into full play the role of 
associations in self-education, self-management, and 
self-service. 
  23. Banking institutions at all levels should actively 
provide quality service for business activities pursued by 
individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately-owned enterprises. When they apply to banks and 
credit cooperatives for loans to meet operational needs, banking 
institutions and credit cooperatives at all levels should treat 
them in the same manner as state and collective enterprises and 
should support them with loans according to the state credit 
policies. 
  24. Industry and commerce administrative departments at all 
levels should step up coordination with relevant departments in 
assisting individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises to solve problems related to loans, 
business venues, product appraisal and exportation, evaluation 
and employment of specialized technical personnel, and overseas 
commercial activities. 
  25. Industry and commerce administrative departments and 
associations of self-employed workers at various levels should 
strengthen ideological and political education and education on 
the legal system and on professional ethnics among individual 
industrial and commercial households and owners and employees of 
privately owned enterprises so they can foster a correct 
operational concept and style, conscientiously safeguard the 
interests of consumers, and become managers with a sense of 
morality and ideals and observe the law and discipline. 
  26. Individual industrial and commercial households and 
privately owned enterprises should strictly abide by and enforce 
state laws, statutes, and policy regulations; and engage in 
lawful operations and civilized service. Manufacturing and 
marketing of fake and shoddy goods, fraudulent transactions, 
speculation and monopoly, and other lawbreaking activities that 
undermine the lawful rights and interests of consumers shall be 
dealt with resolutely. 
  27. Those who print, broadcast, sell, or engage in the 
rental 
of reactionary and pornographic books, magazines, pictures, and 
audio-visual products shall, in accordance with the relevant 
state laws and regulations, be given a fine depending on the 
degree of seriousness and have unlawful income confiscated; and 
those who violate the criminal law shall be affixed with 
criminal responsibilities according to the law. 
  28. The Regional Administration for Industry and Commerce is 
authorized to interprete these regulations. 
  29. These regulations enter into force upon promulgation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Roundup on Tibet's Private Sector </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of the year, good news has kept 
arriving from the vast lands of the plateau where cold winds 
constantly blow. With irresistible force, the private sector of 
the economy, which started in the course of reform, is surging 
ahead rapidly, presenting gratifying results. According to data 
provided by the department of industry and commerce, by the end 
of 1993 the number of individual businesses had risen from 489, 
employing 501 people, in 1980 to 41,830, employing 65,579 
people, at present. Their registered capital exceeded 170 
million yuan. Total sales volume at rural markets throughout 
the region topped 900 million yuan. 
  What do these impressive figures show? 
  There is only one answer: The ancient and quiet plateau is 
opening its doors to the outside world; the people there are 
emancipating their long confined minds and changing their 
concepts. 
  The establishment of a market economy has injected new 
vitality into Tibet's long-standing unitary economic mode. 
  The rapid development of individual enterprises on the 
plateau can be attributed to the reform and opening up policies 
and the relentless efforts of the regional party committee, 
government, and departments of industry and commerce at various 
levels. In recent years, in line with the reality of different 
situations in different localities in Tibet, careful 
preparations were made before any decision to concentrate on 
cultivating markets, and this played a role in promoting the 
development of individual businesses. By the end of 1993, Tibet 
had established 99 markets of various types with a combined 
floor space of more than 100,000 square meters. In 1993 alone, 
the region invested 11.60 million yuan in building 23 markets, 
improving on the previous situation in which stalls were set up 
in roads, streets, and open areas. 
  Emancipating their minds and continually breaking new ground 
in their march forward, administrative departments of industry 
and commerce have simplified procedures for granting licenses to 
individual business applicants, completely changing the old 
situation in which friends had to be asked for favors when 
people applied for business permits. This has greatly helped 
individual businesses. In Lhasa alone, 5,300 new, individually 
run enterprises were added last year, an increase of 56 percent 
on 1992. As a result, the number of employed people in the 
private sector rose by 102 percent while the sector's annual 
turnover increased by 126 percent. 
  Individually run enterprises have flourished in Tibet since 
the procedure for applying for a business permit was simplified, 
making it unnecessary to ask favors of friends. 
  On 12 January the regional people's government officially 
promulgated "Some Provisions on Accelerating the Development of 
Individual Economic Undertakings." Even before the promulgation 
of the provisions, though, individual businesses had been in 
operation in Tibet for a year. But the provisions have helped 
speed up the development of individually run businesses in the 
region. 
  As far as figures are concerned, a characteristic of the 
development of the private sector of the economy in Tibet in 
1993 was that although the total number of individual businesses 
was about the same as that of 1992, the number of workers they 
employed rose sharply by 20,000; the net volume of registered 
capital increased by over 70 million yuan; and the total volume 
of trading at rural and urban markets throughout the region went 
up by 21.6 percent, accounting for 47.36 percent of the region's 
total retail sales. 
  This shows that the scale of the private sector of the 
economy is expanding and advancing in the direction of intensive 
and large- scale operation. 
  What is worth mentioning is that Chongsaikang market in 
Lhasa, which accommodates 1,400 individual businesses, handled a 
business volume of 340 million yuan last year. It has become a 
large, comprehensive market dealing in both wholesale and retail 
sales and handling more than 15,000 types of commodities, which 
are distributed to most prefectures and counties in the 
autonomous region. The rapidly developing individual sector of 
the economy contrasts sharply with state-run enterprises, which 
are struggling. Some people feel individual businesses have 
edged out state-run enterprises and taken over the market. The 
view of one entrepreneur was to the point when he said: 
"Individual businesses are using their own money to create tax 
income for the state, and the state does not have to bear any 
risk or burden." Data show that in 1993 individually run 
industrial and commercial enterprises paid more than 26 million 
yuan in taxes to the state, accounting for 40 percent of the 
region's total industrial and commercial taxes. 
  In fact, in Tibet, a region where the economy is backward, 
transportation and information services are lacking, and which 
relies on other provinces for the majority of its daily 
necessities, the role played by the private sector of the 
economy should not be doubted. In urban areas, rural areas, and 
pastoral areas, individual businesses, like the light cavalry, 
are playing an undeniable role in enlivening Tibet's rural and 
urban economy, improving the circulation of commodities, and 
providing convenience in the daily life of the masses. 
  Taking a look at the development of the region's 
individually 
run businesses, we can see that their prospects are bright. 
However, Tibet's growth rate and scale of development are 
insufficient compared to other provinces and regions. The 
reasons are: People's awareness of commodities is still rather 
weak; the market system has yet to be cultivated and improved; 
industrial and commercial administrative departments, although 
charged with administering markets, have themselves applied for 
land to be used for the construction of markets -- this 
continues to be a problem; and some other departments have 
collected all types of fees and so "killed the chicken to get 
the eggs," thus affecting the development of individual 
businesses. Relevant departments have proposed that to boost 
the development of individual businesses, we must thoroughly 
implement all regulations that help the development of 
individual businesses and at the same to strengthen propaganda, 
improve management and services, crack down on illegal economic 
activities, and encourage fair and rational competition. Only 
this way can there be a new breakthrough in the development of 
private sector economic undertakings. 
  It is expected that the private sector of the economy in 
Tibet will continue to develop in 1994.

  [Text] Kunming, February 27 (XINHUA) -- Overall economic 
development of Southwest China's Yunnan Province has entered a 
new stage thanks to the reform and opening drive implemented 
more than a decade ago, according to He Zhiqiang, governor of 
the province. 
  Its GNP [as received] reached 64.9 billion yuan last year, 
tripling that of 1978, with a growth rate higher than the 
country's average. 
  Yunnan's total revenue also topped 20 billion yuan in 1993 
and the province was finally relieved from the state's long-term 
financial subsidies. 
  Rich natural resources and a 4,000-kilometer border have 
long 
put Yunnan at a very advantageous position to develop its 
economy. But substantial progress was not gained until the 
tidal wave of market economic reforms swept over this 
southwestern frontier of the country. 
  Local people, especially the large population of minority 
nationalities, who used to cling to quiet and unchallenging 
lives, have gradually adapted to new ideas and abandoned such 
conservative ones as the rejection of and disgust at trade 
activities. 
  Areas in southern Yunnan, bordering Burma, Laos and Vietnam, 
and mainly inhabited by minority nationalities, have become the 
vanguard for the opening-up of all of Southwest China. 
  Scattered across this area are eight state-level trading 
ports and 11 provincial trading ports, linked with China's 
inland commercial centers and foreign countries by 80-plus roads 
and highways. The total volume of border trade grew to 2.8 
billion yuan last year. 
  Last year's trade volume in imports and exports saw an 
increase of 29 percent over the previous year, markedly higher 
than the country's average. 
  Newly approved foreign-invested enterprises number 509, 
almost doubling the total established during the last 15 years. 
  The amazing success of Yunnan's tobacco industry on the 
domestic market has greatly bolstered yunnan's confidence and 
determination to achieve more economic gains. 
  The province has also taken pioneering steps in the reform 
of 
the construction system. By calling for bids on the huge lubuge 
hydropower station project, it managed to import advanced 
technology, management experience and construction skills, 
enabling the project to be completed in the shortest possible 
time while ensuring high quality. 
  The province jointly funded the construction of Manwan 
hydropower station with the former Ministry of Water Resources 
and Power Industry instead of the traditional practice of 
totally depending on state allocation of funds for large power 
station construction. 
  During recent years, the provincial government has 
altogether 
earmarked 30 billion yuan for infrastructural construction. 
Along with the improvement of its investment environment, 
Yunnan is striving to be the country's major electricity 
generation and tourism province.

  [Text] Kunming, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Yunnan Province plans to carry out a "5-4-3-2-1" 
telecommunications program this year. 
  It means to build five optical fiber cable lines, four 
micro-wave lines, 300,000-channel program-controlled telephone 
network, two postal projects and ten ground telecommunication 
satellite stations. 
  Last year, the total capacity of the province's telephone 
exchanges was doubled, and 96 percent of its villages had 
telephone communications. Rural telecommunications in Yunnan 
rank now fourth in the country, after Beijing, Tianjin and 
Shanghai. 
  In the past, the backward telecommunications system had 
affected economic development of Yunnan, which has many 
mountains and changeable weather. In some mountainous areas, 
telecommunications would be cut for over a month during the 
rainy season. 
  Last year, the province invested 530 million yuan to build a 
micro-wave line, and three optical fiber lines between Dali and 
Ruili, Kunming and Yuxi, and Panzhihua, as well as a number of 
telecommunications satellite ground stations. 
  Two of the stations -- in Kunming, capital of the province, 
and Nujiang Prefecture -- have been completed and will go into 
operation soon. 
  In 1993, the province increased telephone exchange lines by 
140,000. 
  Eighty-six of the province's 127 counties have joined the 
national long-distance automatic telephone network, and 48 
cities have installed the IDD [international direct dialing] 
system. 
  Telephone lines were installed in 1993 in an additional 854 
townships and villages.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of the speech made by Cheng Weigao, secretary of </F>
the provincial party committee, on 10 January at the report 
meeting on appraisal of the work of provincial-level government 
departments by 1,000 enterprises; place not given] 
  [Text] Today's meeting is a very special and important one. 
  Having 1,000 enterprises appraise the work of the government 
departments at the provincial level, was organized by the 
provincial industrial and economic federation and the provincial 
entrepreneurs' association, and was launched according to the 
decision of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government. This is a major move adopted by the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government to implement the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to further promote 
transformation of the functions of government departments, to 
expedite the implementation of the "enterprise law" and the 
"regulation on changing the operational mechanism of state-owned 
enterprises," and to help establish the socialist market 
economic structure. It is the first time that the province has 
launched such a provincewide activity of "appraising higher 
levels by lower levels." When viewed in terms of practical 
results, this activity is not only completely necessary but also 
successful. 
  Whether our government departments will successfully 
transform their functions and style of work depends chiefly on 
the opinions of enterprises and the reflections of the 
grass-roots levels. "A house may have a leak in its ceiling, 
but it is discovered below." The method of organizing 
enterprises to appraise the work of government departments 
constitutes a direct and effective supervision of government 
departments as well as a positive attempt to promote the 
transform of the superstructure with the voice from the economic 
base. We should successfully summarize the experiences gained 
from this activity, carry them forward, and establish systems to 
ensure that our government departments will be able to listen 
to, in a timely manner, all the opinions of the grass-roots 
units and the voice of enterprises and then will, in line with 
the demand on government functions under the condition of the 
market economy, continuously improve their work and better meet 
the requirements of new circumstances and new tasks. Here, I 
mainly dwell on three views and opinions: 
  1. Our government departments at the provincial level have 
made progress in implementing the "enterprise law" and the 
"regulations," but there are still many problems. 
  The current appraisal of the work of the provincial-level 
government departments by 1,000 enterprises is, in fact, an 
inspection over the situation in which the provincial-level 
government departments have transformed their functions and work 
style. When viewed from the results of the appraisal, what 
should be affirmed first is that these departments have scored 
great achievements in implementing the "enterprise law" and the 
"regulations" and in transforming their functions and style of 
work. In order to truly enable enterprises to transform 
mechanisms, to enter the market, and to become the mainstay of 
the market economy as demanded by the "enterprise law" and the 
"regulations," many government departments have positively 
assigned to enterprises the affairs that should be managed by 
enterprises and have delegated to enterprises the powers that 
should be enjoyed by enterprises. For the affairs that should 
be managed by the government, but were managed in a poor and 
ineffective manner in the past, government departments are now 
adopting measures to gradually strengthen management. To 
expedite the enterprise reform, and, in particular, to help 
invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, some 
government departments have voluntarily gone deep into 
enterprises to specifically guide and help enterprises deepen 
their internal reform, seek projects and funds, and solve 
problems. Some departments that were originally engaged in 
planned economic work have rapidly transformed themselves into 
the departments that provide enterprises with the service of 
information, consultation, technology, development, and 
marketing, thus creating conditions for enterprises to rapidly 
transform mechanisms and dovetail themselves with the market. 
All these cases have proven that the overwhelming majority of 
our government departments at the provincial level have 
conformed to the historical trend of reform and have actively 
keep abreast of the demands of the new situation. In the 
current appraisal, many enterprises have expressed satisfaction 
with and highly appraised the work of such comprehensive 
economic departments as the provincial planning commission, the 
provincial foreign economic relations and trade commission, and 
the provincial economic restructuring commission. This is 
really gratifying. 
  However, the enterprises participating in the current 
appraisal activity have also generated much criticism and 
complaints, and some problems revealed by them are very serious. 
In light of these complaints and problems, what I want to 
stress on is why enterprises still have so many complaints and 
why so many problems remain with our provincial-level government 
departments after the promulgation of the "enterprise law" five 
years ago and after the issuance of the "regulations" a year or 
so ago. This merits our conscientious research and ponderation. 
Of course, it takes time to change government functions, and it 
also takes time to tackle various sorts of contradictions and 
problems. We do not expect the government to tackle all sorts 
of contradictions and problems all at once. The problem at 
present, however, is that many problems that could be tackled 
completely have not yet been tackled and many affairs that could 
be completely handled have not yet been handled. This has 
affected the reform and development of enterprises so that 
enterprises can not help but complain about the government. 
Then, what is the reason for this situation? From an objective 
analysis, when delegating decision-making powers to some 
enterprises, we need a process of coordination, and such kind of 
coordination should be gradually realized through in-depth 
reform. From a subjective analysis, there are three reasons: 
First, some comrades have failed to conscientiously study 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the decision of establishing a 
socialist market economic structure, the "enterprise law," and 
the "regulations." Some comrades have lacked an understanding of 
new structures and have not been fully prepared ideologically 
and professionally to orient the work of government departments 
to the new demands of reform. Second, some comrades have failed 
to conscientiously implement the idea that "reform is a new 
revolution," are still accustomed to the past work style of 
"grabbing power and centralizing power" that was available under 
the planned economic structure, are still accustomed to 
considering enterprises the subsidiary body of government 
departments, and are reluctant to give up the powers in their 
hands and their vested interests. Third, some government 
departments have paid attention to professional work but not to 
the ranks of working personnel, and, as a result, the management 
is in chaos and many problems have emerged in the ranks of 
working personnel. Some working personnel are still riding 
roughshod, extorting money from the people, and using their 
power to seek personal gain. 
  Facing these problems, all government departments should pay 
high attention to the criticisms and complaints raised in the 
current appraisal activity. Although some criticisms and 
complaints are not completely correct, generally speaking, they 
are objective, fair, and pertinent. Although some problems have 
emerged at the grass-roots level, their roots are in the higher 
levels. Although local governments should assume some 
responsibilities for problems, the provincial responsible 
departments also should not shirk their responsibilities onto 
others. Therefore, all departments should, without exception, 
pay attention to and do research for the complaints raised in 
the appraisal and examine and ponder over them one by one. On 
no account should they remain indifferent towards these 
complaints. Second, we should adopt measures to firmly grasp 
rectification and correction. All departments and units should 
make clear the situations and the reasons for the related 
problems raised in the appraisal. On this basis, we should 
formulate feasible measures for solving problems in the right 
order of importance and urgency in order to straighten them out 
and correct them. As for the problems that are enterprises 
complain strongly about,and that should be and can be solved, 
responsibilities should be assigned to departments concerned to 
solve them as quickly as possible and yield results in the near 
future. For the problems that are not raised in the appraisal 
but actually exist in practical work, voluntary inspection 
should also be conducted to correct them. Third, we should use 
rectification and correction to expedite transformation. The 
current appraisal activity will greatly promote the 
transformation of functions of all government departments. All 
departments and units should regard the appraisal as a very good 
opportunity to transform their functions, should draw inferences 
about other cases from the problems revealed in the appraisal, 
should summarize experiences and draw a lesson from these 
problems, and should strive to take a big step forward in the 
work of transforming functions. 
  2. The establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure urgently requires the transformation of government 
functions, and that it should be firmly grasped from beginning 
to end. 
  The "decision on some issues of the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure," adopted by the third 
plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, has sketched 
the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure. 
The five major pillars of this framework--the modern enterprise 
system, the nationwide integrated market structure, the perfect 
macro-economic control system, the rational individual income 
distribution system, and the multi-layered social security 
system--are all closely related to the transformation of 
government functions. If the government refuses to transform 
its functions, a modern enterprise system cannot be established, 
a nationwide integrated market structure and a perfect 
macro-economic control system cannot be formed, a rational 
income distribution system and social security system cannot be 
set up in a very good manner, and then we are in no position to 
establish the socialist market economic structure. Therefore, 
transforming government functions is not only an important 
content of the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure but also a supporting reform that must be carried out 
to ensure the success in the package reform. All departments of 
the government should attach high importance to the 
transformation of functions and truly handle this issue well in 
carrying out organizational reform. 
  A major issue of the transformation of government functions 
is to make clear what should be managed and what should not be 
managed under the new situation of the socialist market economy 
and to correctly handle the relationship between the two. The 
practice in the past several years proves that if government 
departments fail to delegate to enterprises the powers that 
originally belong to the government in carrying out the planned 
economy and that should be delegated to enterprises now, the 
reform cannot be carried on; and if government functions fail to 
manage the affairs that they should manage in many fields of the 
development of the market economy, a confused situation will 
emerge and losses will be incurred. Therefore, our government 
departments must make clear what affairs that were managed in 
the past should, or should no longer be managed under the new 
structure, and provide ways to successfully manage these 
affairs. Departments should conduct conscientious investigation 
and study as well as discussion and analysis by proceeding from 
helping to invigorate enterprises and facilitating the sound and 
orderly development of the market economy, and then define the 
targets of the transformation of functions, the work 
orientation, and the work priorities for respective departments. 
  This year, the province will carry out organizational reform 
step by step and spread the reform of the public service system 
in line with the unified arrangements of the central 
authorities. This reform will be carried out from higher levels 
to lower levels, beginning with the provincial-level 
organizations. All administrative organizations at the 
provincial level, particularly comprehensive economic 
organizations, specialized economic organizations, and the 
organizations supervising the enforcement of economic laws, 
should make good preparations for successfully fixing the scale, 
functions, and staff of their organizations in accordance with 
the "decision" adopted by the third plenary session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and with the demands for carrying out the 
organizational reform of administrative organizations and for 
implementing the reform of the public service system. 
  3. We should continue to firmly and thoroughly stop wanton 
collections of fees, fines, and apportionments, as the major 
content of the anticorruption campaign. When viewed from the 
current appraisal, the province as a whole has made progress and 
yielded results in stopping the "three wanton collections," but 
these results cannot be overestimated. A host of facts show 
that the "three wanton collections" still seriously remain in 
many places, and they have not only seriously disturbed the 
normal operational sequence of enterprises and hampered reform, 
opening up, and economic development, but also seriously damaged 
the image of the party and the government. Therefore, the 
elimination of "three wanton collections" must be conducted 
through to the end by regarding it as an important content of 
the transformation of government functions and the 
anticorruption campaign. 
  To make the work in this aspect a success, I want to stress 
on the following points: 
  First, all departments directly under the provincial 
authorities must assume responsibility for stopping the "three 
wanton collections" within their own departments. All 
departments should not only manage their professional work but 
also manage their ranks of working personnel. And, they should 
not only eliminate the "three wanton collections" directly 
occurred in their own departments but also eliminate the "three 
wanton collections" occurred in other departments and trades in 
the province as well as at the grass-roots areas. All 
departments should pay attention to education, training, 
rectification, and correction to constantly improve the quality 
of their ranks of working personnel and enhance their expertise 
of enforcing laws and disciplines. From now on, if the masses 
at the grass-roots level complain strongly about a department or 
a trade for its serious wanton collections, the responsible 
government departments of the provincial level will be held 
accountable. Second, the inspection of and punishment to the 
"three wanton collections" should be strengthened in a sustained 
manner. All departments at all levels should inspect and ferret 
out the "three wanton collections" in a timely manner. Once a 
case is discovered, it should be inspected and dealt with 
immediately. Those which should be returned should be returned, 
those deserving punishment should be punished, and those 
deserving disciplinary actions should be given them. The 
serious cases should be laid bare and dealt with publicly. The 
responsible persons of enterprises who dare to resist the "three 
wanton collections" should be encouraged and supported 
continuously. Third, all measures and stipulations aiming at 
checking the "three wanton collections" should be assigned to 
the grass-roots areas. The fees and apportionments that are 
abolished by the provincial-level government departments and the 
measures and methods related to this work have already been made 
public in newspapers. But, it is only the first step. They 
must be made known to all grass-roots areas and to all related 
personnel. All departments and units should take advantage of 
the opportunity provided by the current appraisal to inspect, in 
the near future, whether the "three wanton collections" are 
eliminated among grass- roots areas. Once a problem is 
discovered, it should be tackled immediately in order to 
strictly prevent and correct the cases of "sticking to one's old 
way of doing things," "rectifying in the beginning but being 
confused at the end," and "remaining confused despite repeated 
rectifications." Fourth, we should continue to carry out the 
system of "making work procedures and results public so that 
they are subject to supervision by the masses." All the 
stipulated reasonable fees and fines should be made public and 
be subject to supervision by the masses. All departments at all 
levels should pay attention to the petitions of the masses that 
reflect the "three wanton collections," and conscientiously 
examine and deal with them. On the whole, the tasks on 
eliminating the "three wanton collections" remain very arduous, 
and the endeavor of eliminating the "three wanton collections" 
should still be regarded as the emphasis of the anticorruption 
campaign this year in order to thoroughly tackle problems 
related to wanton collections. All departments at all levels, 
particularly law and discipline enforcing departments such as 
public security, communications, postal and communications, 
power, industrial and commercial, tax, and public health 
departments, must strive to make contributions to eliminating 
the "three wanton collections" in the province and to optimizing 
the economic environment. 
  The current appraisal of the work of provincial-level 
government departments by 1,000 enterprises has been conducted 
in a successful way. It has been proven that in the new 
historical period and the new situation, such social groups as 
the industrial and economic federations and associations of 
various trades have much to do and accomplish in conducting 
activities around the central task of economic construction. 
Such social groups that lie between the government and 
enterprises, serve as a new type of bridge to link the 
government with enterprises, and thus play the role as the mass 
groups of enterprises. Therefore, party committees and 
governments at all levels should attach full importance and give 
warm support to such newly born groups and pay attention to 
studying and exploiting their positive role in expediting reform 
and development. Industrial and economic federations and the 
associations of various trades should enhance their senses of 
historical responsibility and mission, make great efforts to 
make innovations and explorations, continue to summarize 
experiences, and strive to invigorate the work in all fields.

<F P=106> [Report by Liu Junjie (0491 0193 2638): "Seize the </F>
Opportunity, Break a Path to Tackle the Most Difficult Problems, 
and Accelerate Development"] 
  [Text] We should further emancipate the mind, increase the 
dynamics of reform, seize the opportunity, break a path to 
tackle the most difficult problems, and accelerate development 
with a view to pressing the work of Hulun Buir League onto a new 
stage. This was stressed by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional 
party committee, during his recent inspection tour of Hulun Buir 
League. 
  From 18 to 21 January, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional 
party committee, and Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the region, 
led responsible persons of departments concerned to make a 
four-day inspection tour of Hulun Buir League. During the tour, 
they inspected some shareholding cooperative enterprises and 
township enterprises in Hailar city and Chen Barag Banner, 
visited some households specializing in breeding milk cows and 
some enterprises and households with difficulties, listened to 
the reports on the situation of Manzhouli city and Ergun Banner 
in foreign economic relations and trade, and had talks with 
responsible comrades of Daxinganling Forestry Administration, 
Yimin Coal and Electricity Corporation, Hailar Farm and Herd 
Farm Administration, and Zalantun Pulp Mill. Comrade Wang Qun 
spoke highly of the achievements scored by Hulun Buir League 
Experimental Zone over the past six years and fully affirmed the 
methods of Hailar city and Zalantun city in transforming the 
operational mechanism of enterprises and invigorating the 
management of enterprises. 
  On 19 January, Wang Qun, Zhou Weide, and other leading 
comrades travelled, in spite of the piercing wind and the bitter 
cold with a temperature of minus 30 degrees centigrade, to the 
Tuanjie village in suburban Hailar city, where they visited 
Zhang Shengxiang and Sha Yanju, who specialize in breeding milk 
cows. Then, these leaders made a journey of more than 100 li to 
Bayi gacha in Baorixile town in Chen Barag Banner to investigate 
and learn about the situation of the village specializing in 
breeding cattle. At the house of Zhang Shengxiang, a household 
specializing in breeding milk cows, Comrade Wang Qun entered the 
cow shed and the ensiling cellar and talked with Zhang 
Shengxiang to learn about cow breeding and the management 
situation. Comrade Wang Qun said to Zhang Shengxiang: You 
should break with the traditional breeding methods left over by 
our ancestors, engage in modernized and scientific breeding, 
make more investment, seek high output, and increase economic 
returns in order to take the lead in becoming prosperous. After 
hearing the report on animal husbandry production of Chen Barag 
Banner, Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: We should give full play 
to the advantages of animal husbandry, combine agriculture with 
animal husbandry, combine the cropping trade with the breeding 
trade, expand the scale, accelerate the growth of animals, 
increase economic returns, and accelerate the development of the 
commodity economy. 
  After hearing the reports on the opening up of border areas 
and on the foreign economic relations and trade of Manzhouli 
city and Ergun Banner, Comrade Wang Qun stressed: Border trade 
is boundless and should develop in depth and toward a high 
level. Border trade should aim at conducting economic and 
technological cooperation to link itself with the international 
market as quickly as possible. He said: We should pay attention 
to studying the changes in the international market, gain the 
initiative on the international market, and know how to deal 
with changes in view of the objective situation. We should take 
the road of integration, engage in import and development, 
expand the scope of foreign economic relations and trade, and 
extend ourselves to Northeast Asia in the east and to Western 
Europe in the West. He demanded that Hulun Buir League should 
record in 1994 a big breakthrough in developing foreign trade, 
particularly in organizing economic and technological 
cooperation, and should establish a number of economic 
cooperation projects with foreign countries to bring along the 
development of foreign economic relations and trade in the 
entire region, border areas in particular. 
  In Zalantun city, Comrade Wang Qun talked with directors of 
a 
plywood plant, a starch plant, a pulp mill, and a silk factory. 
Comrade Wang Qun stressed: To transform the mechanism of 
enterprises and invigorate enterprises, the key lies in 
leadership. Leaders should enhance their sense of reform and 
understand that reform is the only way out and refusing to carry 
out reform will inevitably lead to ruin. Leaders should 
emancipate the mind to seek truth from facts and should rely on 
the initiative of the vast numbers of workers and staff to seek 
the operation and management methods that are commensurate with 
the development of enterprises. At the same time, attention 
should be paid to comprehensive coordination. 
  On the afternoon of 20 January, after hearing the work 
reports by the party committee and the administrative office of 
Hulun Buir League, Comrade Wang Qun emphatically dwelt on the 
following five opinions. First, we should conscientiously 
review and summarize the experiences gained by the Hulun Buir 
League Experimental Zone over the past six years, affirm 
achievements, find out where we lag behind, and continue to 
pioneer the road of advance. He said: The Hulun Buir League 
Experimental Zone has scored remarkable achievements in 
construction and recorded quadrupling growth in many fields, and 
the people there have really benefited and tempered from the 
experiments with reform. The valuable experience of this 
experimental zone is exactly the emancipation of mind and the 
boldness in trying something new and going ahead. Whether we 
can effect constant development depends chiefly on the 
emancipation of mind and on the boldness in trying something 
new. The achievements of the zone have been scored through the 
emancipation of the mind and from the pioneering work. Second, 
now we are confronted with the period of breaking a new path and 
with the opportunity of rapid growth. We must seize this 
opportunity to pioneer the road of advance and work hard in 
unity to make the economic development of Hulun Buir League 
march at the head of the entire region. Comrade Wang Qun 
pointed out: Currently, we are confronted with many new 
circumstances, new problems, and new difficulties. If we refuse 
to make progress through hard work, we will lose the initiative 
in breaking the new path. He said: Breaking the new path is 
like a boat sailing against the current that must forge ahead, 
or it will be driven back. It will not do to pace up and down 
and to be muddled all day long. Hulun Buir League should seize 
and cherish this opportunity to make best possible use of its 
own advantages. Third, we should carry out reform and 
experiments by leaps and bounds with a view to pressing forward 
the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, foreign 
economic relations and trade, township and town enterprises, 
nonpublicly owned enterprises, and large and medium-sized 
enterprises. Fourth, we should transfer part of the cadres of 
party and government organizations who have good professional 
quality and are good at management to the first lines of 
production and construction to strengthen the capacity of first 
lines, foreign economic relations and trade units, township 
enterprises, and comprehensive agricultural and animal husbandry 
service trades so that they can keep pace with the development 
of productive forces. Such cadres should not be left unused at 
the organizations to waste their abilities. Such cadres should 
be encouraged to become better-off first. At the same time, the 
strengthening of the grass-roots units should be integrated with 
organizational restructuring in order to actually streamline the 
overstaffed organizations and help overcome bureaucratism and 
improve work efficiency. Fifth, we should strengthen leadership 
and combine political work with reform and opening up by 
persisting in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and 
being tough with both hands. We should strengthen the unity in 
all fields, seek unity of thinking and action, and provide an 
effective ideological and political guarantee for accelerating 
reform and opening up.

  [Excerpt] The Tianjin municipal economic work conference 
opened at the Tianjin Auditorium on 17 January. Major tasks of 
this conference are, taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, to 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and the national 
economic work conference, to study the important issues on 
current economic development in line with the guidelines of the 
second plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, 
to unify understanding of the situation and tasks, to make 
overall arrangements for this year's economic work, and to 
mobilize people across the municipality to raise spirit, make 
concerted efforts, and strive to accelerate Tianjin's 
development. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave 
an important speech at the conference. Mayor Zhang Lichang 
delivered an important report entitled "Uplift Spirit, Work With 
All-Out Efforts, and Create a New Situation in Accelerating 
Development." Municipal leading comrades Liu Fengyan, Li Huifen, 
Song Pingshun, Zheng Zhiying, Ye Disheng, Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang 
Gonghui, Wang Dehui, Zhu Liankang, and Zhang Guanwen attended 
the opening ceremony. 
  Gao Dezhan said in his speech: After the second plenary 
session of the sixth municipal party committee concluded, people 
throughout the municipality have swung into action to relay and 
implement its guidelines. Based on their specific conditions, 
many units have explored new ideas, studied and formulated major 
measures, assigned the responsibility for attaining defined 
targets, and notably quickened the pace of their work. Through 
this conference, we should make conscientious efforts to fulfill 
the various tasks and targets of economic work, further develop 
the good trend, and accomplish the tasks as put forward in the 
work priorities of the municipal party committee. 
  Regarding Tianjin's economic work for this year, Gao Dezhan 
emphasized five issues. 
  --It is imperative to persistently take economic 
construction 
as the central task and seize the opportunity to accelerate 
reform, opening up, and economic development. As far as Tianjin 
is concerned, economic development decides on the public 
interests and the entire situation of the municipality and 
affects the development of various undertakings and the 
improvement of living standard. Therefore, we should firmly take 
economic construction as the central task. The most important 
thing for the present is to seize the opportunity to accelerate 
reform, opening up, and economic development. This is the theme 
of this year's economic work. To accelerate economic 
development, all work should be made successful, and major 
efforts should be devoted to the following tasks. First, 
Tianjin's growth rates of GNP and other major economic 
indicators and all its important work should be made better than 
in 1993; large breakthroughs should be achieved in key work and 
some weak links; and some aspects of work should continue to be 
ranked among the best in the country or should strive to become 
so. Second, development of the primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries should be accelerated in an all-round manner. In 
particular, we should strengthen the fundamental position of 
agriculture, strive to improve large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, greatly raise economic efficiency, and 
expand the tertiary industry with greater efforts. Third, we 
should adhere to the principle of developing the various sectors 
of the economy simultaneously while keeping public ownership 
predominant and give a free hand to the faster development of 
township enterprises, the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises, urban collective enterprises, individual 
enterprises, and private enterprises simultaneously while making 
state-owned enterprises successful. Fourth, all enterprises, 
all departments, and all districts and counties should improve 
their level and achieve major breakthroughs in work. In other 
words, all departments and all areas should accelerate 
development. Fifth, Tianjin should open to all domestic areas 
and foreign countries in all directions and quicken the pace in 
directly using foreign capital. Sixth, the principle of 
"developing Tianjin with science and technology" should be 
further implemented, scientific and technological achievements 
should be transformed more rapidly, and great efforts should be 
made to industrialize high and new technology. Party committees 
and governments at all levels in the municipality should devote 
greater efforts to accelerating reform, opening up, and economic 
development, conscientiously strengthen leadership over economic 
work, correctly analyze and estimate the situation, earnestly 
study new conditions and new issues, and be determined to 
resolve the conspicuous contradictions in economic operation so 
as to gain initiative in economic work. All localities, 
departments, and enterprises, economic or non-economic, should 
channel their work to the track of accelerating Tianjin's 
economic development and take the initiative in serving reform, 
opening up, and economic construction, which represent public 
interests. 
  --It is imperative to accelerate economic development by 
deepening reform. In particular, enterprise reform should be 
made successful. Only when enterprises are prosperous, can 
Tianjin be prosperous. In conducting reform, we should promote 
package reform while giving prominence to key areas. Enterprise 
reform--the key area and central link of the reform of the 
entire municipality--is the most important of the reforms in all 
fronts. Enterprises are the foundation of the national economy, 
and enterprise development has a direct bearing on Tianjin's 
economic strength and its capacity for sustained development. 
Therefore, to accelerate reform, enterprise reform should be 
accelerated first; and accelerating enterprise development is 
the key to accelerate development. We should embrace the idea 
of pooling the efforts of all fields to conduct enterprise 
reform. We should adopt every means to fulfill the tasks of 
enterprise reform in order to improve and invigorate 
enterprises. We have issued a clear-cut call for doing 
practical work for the masses. Likewise, we should also do 
practical work for enterprises. This should be the major 
criterion for assessing the work of a department or a locality. 
Leaders of various committees, offices, bureaus, districts, and 
counties should go down to enterprises to help them address 
problems one by one. Departments in charge, departments with 
overall responsibilities, and other departments should enhance 
the sense of service and provide service to the endeavor of 
deepening enterprise reform. Meanwhile, focusing on deepening 
their reform, all enterprises should achieve success in 
deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, adjusting 
the structure, developing new products, strengthening 
management, conducting technical transformation, improving 
grass-roots levels, building the spiritual civilization, 
training staff members and workers, and improving leading 
bodies. Through the work, enterprises with good efficiency 
should pursue greater development, and those with poor 
efficiency should overcome difficulties and achieve a turn for 
the better. 
  --It is imperative to have a good command of the orientation 
to ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
At the second plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee, the municipal party committee called for attention to 
five principles concerning the guiding thought for Tianjin's 
work for this year. These principles are very important, and 
they play an important role in guiding economic work. To make 
economic work successful, we should particularly handle well the 
relationship in the following three aspects. First, we should 
handle well the relationship between the quantity and the 
quality of economic development. We should establish new ideas 
for economic development and truly channel economic development 
to the track centering on improving economic efficiency. In 
developing the economy, we should emphasize not only the 
increase of quantity but also the improvement of quality and 
exert greater efforts in adjusting the structure, strengthening 
management, and achieving scientific and technological advance. 
We should see to it that an increase is achieved in the 
revenues at all levels, in the profits of all types of 
enterprises (a decrease of deficits on the part of loss-making 
enterprises), and in the income of the vast number staff members 
and workers, and that the standard of living is improved 
continuously. Second, we should handle well the relationship 
between reform and development on the one hand and stability on 
the other. We should understand that development is the 
purpose, reform the motivation, and stability the condition. We 
should achieve faster economic development by deepening reform 
and opening wider to the outside world and, meanwhile, provide a 
more relaxed environment for reform when arranging economic 
work. Third, we should handle well the relationship between 
faster economic development and comprehensive social progress. 
  --It is imperative to take the increase in the income of 
urban and rural staff members and workers as an important 
criterion for judging economic work. In developing reform, 
construction, and all other work, we should take the "three 
advantages" put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the 
fundamental criteria. To be specific, our work should be 
advantageous to developing Tianjin's productive forces, 
increasing Tianjin's economic strength, and improving the 
standard of living of all its people. Party committees and 
governments at all levels should regard the income increase of 
staff members, workers, and peasants and improvement in their 
living standard as an important criterion for judging economic 
work, attach great importance to it, and make it a success. We 
should exert utmost efforts to do practical work for the benefit 
of the masses and successfully fulfill all the tasks designed 
for this purpose. The most important practical work for the 
masses is to continuously increase the income of staff members, 
workers, and peasants, and to improve their standard of living. 
We should adopt every means possible and devote every effort to 
benefit the masses and increase their income. The issues 
concerning retired cadres, staff members, and workers should 
also be addressed well. Regarding the staff members and workers 
who have difficulties in their life for the time being, we 
should work out ways and do meticulous work to resolve the 
difficulties. The system of responsibility for attaining work 
targets will be instituted across the board this year. The 
income increase of staff members, workers, and peasants should 
be taken as an important indicator for evaluation. 
  --It is imperative to fulfill responsibilities, improve work 
styles, and work hard and in a down-to-earth manner. The system 
of responsibility for attaining work targets should be 
implemented across the board. An important task of this 
economic work conference is to assign all departments and all 
enterprises with economic tasks and specific targets in line 
with the requirements of the plenary session of the municipal 
party committee so that everyone will have pressure and targets 
on their shoulder. It is hoped that party and government organs 
at all levels, especially leading cadres, will set a good 
example in instituting the work target responsibility system. 
The year-end summary of work and appraisal of leading bodies 
and cadres should all be based on how they have implemented the 
system. We should further change work styles. Leaders at all 
levels should take the lead in changing work styles, working 
hard, and making earnest efforts to do practical work. They 
should resolutely overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and 
formalism. They should renounce exaggeration and fraud in favor 
of truth, practical work, and realistic results. They should 
firmly rely on the masses and mobilize all positive factors. 
Regarding the important issues on economic work, reform, and 
opening up, they should give heed to the opinions, voice, and 
requirements of the masses and win their understanding and 
support. When reforming their inner managerial system and 
leadership system, enterprises should pay attention to 
protecting the interests and democratic rights of their staff 
members and workers. They should attach importance to the 
ideological and political work for their staff members and 
workers to soothe people's feelings. 
  In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: Tianjin's tasks of this 
year's reform and development are heavy and arduous. As long as 
the people across the municipality unite as one to work hard and 
in a down-to- earth manner, Tianjin will be able to surmount 
numerous difficulties, accelerate reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive, regain its magnificent bearings, and score 
brilliant achievements again. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The three-day (enlarged) plenary session of the 
party committee of the Tianjin Garrison concluded recently. Gao 
Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee and 
first secretary of the party committee of the garrison; and Yang 
Zhihua, commander, and Yang Huichuan, political commissar of the 
garrison, attended the session and presented awards to the 
advanced units and individuals who were commended. 
  The session discussed ways to implement the guidelines of 
the 
recent enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission and 
the enlarged session of the party committee of the Beijing 
Military Region, summarized last year's work, and arranged this 
year's tasks. Under the leadership of the party committee of the 
Beijing Military Region and the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee, 
the Tianjin Garrison paid great attention to the education for 
studying the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the 
enlarged meeting of the military commission and achieved notable 
results in raising the political level of its units in the past 
year. It made conscientious efforts to meet the requirement for 
taking military training as the focus and thus created a new 
situation in military training. It made efforts to improve 
party style and maintain honesty in performance of duty and 
further strengthened the leading bodies of the party committees 
at and above the regimental level. It conducted strict 
management and education to maintain a high degree of stability 
and unity of its units. It also enhanced the capacity for 
logistic support and achieved new development in logistic 
technical support and production. The session urged that in the 
new year, all the units of the garrison should conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the enlarged meeting of the Central 
Military Commission and the enlarged session of the party 
committee of the Beijing Military Region; achieve good results 
in the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, in the improvement of the ideology and work 
styles of leading bodies, in the reform of the military 
training, and in the implementation of the "outlines of the 
grass-roots building of the Army;" maintain a high degree of 
stability and unity; and successfully fulfill all tasks. It 
urged the vast number of commanders and soldiers, militiamen, 
and armymen in reserve duty of the entire garrison to "attach 
importance to study, abide by discipline, stress unity, and 
carry out work," raise spirit, pioneer the way forward, and 
further open up a new situation in army building and building 
the forces in reserve duty. 
  Gao Dezhan gave an important speech at the session. He said: 
The Tianjin Garrison and the units stationed in Tianjin have 
actively participated in Tianjin's economic construction and 
various public welfare undertakings over the past many years. 
They have played an important role in building key projects, 
conducting emergency rescue and relief work, and safeguarding 
political and social stability and made outstanding 
contributions to promoting the two civilizations in Tianjin. 
Every achievement of Tianjin in reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive is linked to the great support of the 
People's Army and embodies the painstaking labor and wisdom of 
the people's own army. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm our 
minds and guide our action is the basic guarantee for promoting 
reform, opening up, and the modernization drive and also for 
comprehensively improving the contingents and revolutionizing, 
modernizing, and regularizing the Army. All levels should 
regard the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory as a basic 
task and conscientiously fulfill it. We should intensively 
study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas on the army 
building of the new period, exert great efforts to improve 
leading bodies, and successfully build the Army to make it 
"politically qualified, militarily competent, good in work 
styles, strict in abiding by discipline, and reliable in 
providing logistic support." 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: The Tianjin Garrison and the Army 
units stationed in Tianjin should set a good example in 
consolidating and developing the unity between the Army and the 
government and between armymen and civilians, in supporting 
local economic construction, in safeguarding social stability, 
and in building the spiritual civilization. They should fully 
develop their advantages and make new contributions to 
accelerating Tianjin's reform, opening up, and economic 
development. While improving themselves and conducting training 
for war preparedness, they should actively support local key 
projects, social welfare projects, farmland water conservancy 
projects, and emergency rescue and disaster relief work. They 
should actively participate in the comprehensive management of 
public security to safeguard the political and social stability 
of the municipality. They should continue the activities for 
the Army and the civilians to build the socialist spiritual 
civilization together to create a good social environment for 
accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development. They 
should continue the activities to build the districts and 
counties exemplary in the double-support work and, through the 
concerted efforts of the Army and local authorities, make the 
advanced districts still more advanced, make the mediocre 
districts catch up with and surpass the advanced districts, and 
promote Tianjin's double-support work to a new height. 
  Speaking on intensifying efforts to improve reserve forces, 
Gao Dezhan said: Party committees and governments at all levels 
should correctly handle the relationship between economic work 
and the work of the militia and reserve forces and make 
conscientious efforts to address the specific problems in the 
work of the militia and reserve forces. We should embrace the 
idea of focusing on economic construction when developing the 
militia and persistently use, train, and make strong the Army on 
the major battleground of economic construction. We should 
conduct study to explore the new ways to improve the reserve 
forces in the condition of the socialist market economy and make 
efforts to achieve success in the work of the militia and 
reserve forces in the new period. With the establishment of the 
socialist market economy system, the work of the militia and 
reserve forces can only be strengthened and not weakened. We 
should improve the organizations of the grass-roots people's 
armed forces departments in line with the "regulations on the 
militia and reserve forces of enterprises." 
  Gao Dezhan also urged: Local party committees and 
governments at all levels should intensify the work to support 
the Army and give preferential treatment to disabled servicemen 
and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and 
consider it their responsibility to support army building. The 
municipal party committee and government should take the lead in 
conscientiously studying and addressing the issues on supporting 
army building. They should wholeheartedly help local Army units 
resolve the difficulties in the duties for war preparedness, 
construction for national defense, production and business, and 
scientific research. They should comprehensively implement the 
various policies on giving special care to disabled servicemen 
and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen; place 
demobilized and retired soldiers, Army cadres transferred to 
civilian jobs, and retired cadres in a down- to-earth manner; 
earnestly solve the problems in the job and school arrangements 
for the accompanying dependents of Army officers; and do a good 
job in the special care and medical service to disabled 
servicemen and the families of revolutionary martyrs and 
servicemen in order to eliminate their misgivings and provide 
favorable conditions for strengthening army building. 
  In conclusion, Gao Dezhan emphasized: Strong unity between 
the Army and the government and between armymen and civilians is 
a fine tradition of our party and our Army and an important 
magic weapon to win success in revolution and construction. We 
should develop this tradition still more in the new situation. 
Let us unite more closely round the party Central Committee and 
the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core, establish closer ties between the Army and the government 
and between armymen and civilians, work hard in unison, follow 
the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
win new success with full confidence.

  [Text] Yesterday, the municipal party committee and 
government held a rural work conference to implement the 
guidelines of the central rural work conference and of the 
second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee and to study new ideas and new move for further 
strengthening the agricultural foundation status, seizing the 
opportunity, and concentrating efforts on expediting the 
municipality's agricultural and rural economic development under 
the new situation of accelerating reform and development, 
rapidly developing the rural national economy and all social 
undertakings, and greatly raising the income of peasants. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave 
an important speech. Mayor Zhang Lichang delivered an important 
report, entitled: "Seize the Opportunity To Accelerate 
Development and Strive To Raise the Income of Peasants." 
  Municipal leading comrades Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, Nie 
Bichu, Liu Jinfeng,Zheng Zhiying, Zhang Yuhuan, Lu Huansheng, 
and Zhang Guanwen, and veteran comrades, including Wu Zhen and 
Wang Liji, attended the conference. Vice Mayor Zhu Liankang 
presided over the conference. 
  Last year the municipal rural situation was excellent. All 
district and county party committees and governments led the 
broad masses of cadres to do all they can to overcome serious 
natural disasters and all kinds of difficulties, succeeded in 
reaping a bumper agricultural harvest, maintaining a fairly 
rapid growth trend in township enterprises, and achieving a 
fairly big progress in rural economic development, and make 
positive contributions to the whole municipality's economic and 
social development. Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang extended 
lofty respects and heartfelt thanks to the broad masses of rural 
cadres and comrades who have cared for and supported the rural 
work on behalf of the municipal party committee and the 
government. 
  In his speech, Gao Dezhan stressed: It is necessary to 
further enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility of 
seizing the opportunity to accelerate agricultural and rural 
economic development. Agriculture has occupied an extremely 
important status in our country's economic and social 
development. Since reform and opening up, Tianjin has rapidly 
developed its agriculture and rural economy and made great 
achievements in this regard. Agriculture and rural economic 
development have become an important component of the 
municipality's national economy. Judging from the overall 
situation, to seize the opportunity to accelerate development, 
we must strengthen the foundation status of agriculture and 
accelerate the development of rural economy. We must soberly 
recognize that our municipality's rural economic development is 
not good enough and the growth of income from the agricultural 
sector and of peasants is quite slow. The higher and the lower 
levels across the municipality should further enhance the sense 
of urgency and responsibility of accelerating agricultural and 
rural economic development. During this year, party committees 
and governments at all levels should conscientiously implement 
the guidelines of the central rural work conference, 
realistically attach prime importance to agriculture while 
formulating economic guidelines and putting them into practice, 
adopt effective measures, concentrate efforts on accelerating 
agricultural and rural economic development, try by all possible 
means to increase the income of peasants, enable the municipal 
agriculture and rural economy to cope with the overall situation 
of accelerating development in the whole municipality and to 
match with the status of Tianjin as a municipality. 
  Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: It is necessary to 
regard accelerating rural economic development and unceasingly 
increasing the income of peasants as the fundamental starting 
and resting points of the rural work, exert strenuous efforts to 
grasp the "nonstaple foods" project on the premise of 
guaranteeing a steady increase in grain and cotton production, 
actively develop high- yield, fine-quality, and highly-efficient 
farming as well as township enterprises, comprehensively 
expedite the development of rural economy, and further enhance 
the economic strength of rural areas in the municipality. While 
attending to agriculture and rural work, we should pay great 
attention to the issue concerning peasants' income, strive to 
increase the income of peasants across the municipality by a 
large margin through deepening rural reform and accelerating the 
development of agriculture and rural economy, and realistically 
end the situation of slow increase in the income of peasants 
throughout the municipality. Increasing the average per-capita 
income of peasants should be regarded as one of the important 
targets for evaluating the work of all localities. In order to 
fulfill the objectives and tasks of accelerating agriculture and 
rural economic development, we must realistically do well the 
work in three aspects: First, we should continue to deepen 
rural reform and actively develop the social productive forces 
in the rural areas; second, readjust the rural production 
set-up, optimize the allocation of resources, and develop 
high-yield, fine- quality, and highly-efficient farming; and 
third, regard township enterprises as the new economic growing 
points and further accelerate development. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: We should realistically strengthen 
leadership over agricultural and rural work and create a new 
situation in this aspect. The municipal party committee and 
government should take the lead in this work and concentrate 
more energy on it. Continued efforts should be made to attend 
to the work of changing government functions and give further 
play to the role of districts and counties. All departments 
and units should consciously make contributions to the 
development of agriculture and rural economy. It is necessary to 
advance this work in an all-round manner, implement the work 
target responsibility system, and make strict evaluations. We 
should exert strenuous efforts to strengthen the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization in the rural areas. Party 
committees and governments at all levels in the rural areas 
should consciously uphold the principle of "taking a two-handed 
approach and be tough with both," realistically strengthen the 
building of spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal 
system, and do a good job in comprehensively improving public 
security in the rural areas. It is necessary to realistically 
strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations in 
the rural areas, and give full play to the fighting bastion role 
of party branches and the vanguard and exemplary role of party 
members. We should adopt measures to further strengthen the 
building of township leading bodies, village party 
organizations, and party organizations of township enterprises, 
make special efforts to consolidate backward party 
organizations, and rapidly improve their work. Continued 
efforts should be made to strengthen the building of village 
supporting organizations with party branches as the nucleus, 
strengthen and improve education and management of party 
members, do a good job in training, and unceasingly raise the 
quality of party members and party-member cadres. 
  Zhang Lichang pointed out in his report: The rapid 
development of rural economy and all undertakings have become 
increasingly important in the whole municipality's reform, 
opening up, and economic construction, and their role has become 
more prominent. Currently, the vast countryside is making solid 
steps to become industrialized and modernized cities and towns. 
We should comprehensively recognize the rural situation, and 
enhance the sense of urgency of accelerating development. 
Compared our municipality's rural economic development to that 
of the advanced localities throughout the country, our 
development rate is not quick enough and the overall level is 
quite low. We must keep a sober mind, have the sense of 
hardships and a sense of urgency and responsibility of 
accelerating development, be determined to work with a will to 
make the municipality strong, continue to work hard, and strive 
to make brilliant contributions. 
  Zhang Lichang pointed out: The year of 1994 is important for 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating 
economic development. Rural work should be chiefly focused on 
increasing peasants' income and effecting a quicker economic 
development in the rural areas. In the next five to seven 
years, the GNP of the agricultural departments should increase 
at an annual rate of 12 percent, higher than the municipal 
average; through five to seven years of efforts, the average 
per-capita net income of peasants should increase by 100 percent 
over 1993; by the year of 1997, all rural areas throughout the 
municipality should become well-off. To realize this objective, 
we must have a high starting point in carrying out various rural 
work and achieve big development in some important aspects: 
First, the level of agricultural production should be greatly 
enhanced. This year, while stabilizing the family-based 
output-related contract responsibility system, we should further 
deepen reform of the rural land utilization system and the 
operational form of agricultural production, sum up and 
popularize the experience in developing the land on a fairly 
large scale, carry out work in close connection with the 
development of high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient 
farming, and make new contributions to developing production, 
invigorating the market, and increasing peasants' income. 
Second, we should regard enhancement of efficiency as the 
central task and accelerate the development of township 
enterprises. Township enterprises must have a flexible 
mechanism. Currently, the most important is to clarify the 
property right relations, actively popularize the shareholding 
cooperative system, and enable township enterprises to raise 
scale, level, and ability in market competition. Third, we 
should greatly raise the proportion of export-oriented economy 
in the rural economic sector. Expanding the use of foreign 
capital should be regarded as a breakthrough point. We should 
firmly attend to items on inviting business and capital, change 
the past method of only confining business to industrial items, 
and comprehensively carry out primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries. Fourth, with urbanization as the objective, we 
should speed up the building of modern small towns. According 
to our initial plan, by the end of this century, we will develop 
seven districts and counties outside the outer ring road where 
the governments are located and build them into satellite cities 
with a fair scale and fairly modern facilities. In 12 districts 
and counties, we will select 30 towns and market towns with 
convenient means of transportation, good infrastructure 
facilities, strong radiation functions, and promising 
development prospects and build them into central cities and 
towns with initial prosperity. The rural areas inside the outer 
ring road will be built in line with the unified urban plan. 
Fifth, we should make more villages become prosperous. By 
1997, we will make peasants across the municipality become 
well-off in living and some advanced localities attain the 
standard of initial prosperity. Attention should be paid to 
reducing peasants' burdens, strictly controlling peasants' 
personal burden at within 5 percent of the average per- capita 
income of the previous year, and rapidly reducing the irrational 
burdens of township collective organizations and collective 
enterprises. 
  Zhang Lichang pointed out in conclusion: We should 
realistically strengthen leadership and create a good 
environment for expediting rural economic development. Comrades 
charged with rural work, specially the leading cadres at all 
levels, should seize the opportunity, take advantage of the 
situation to advance, and create new achievements. It is hoped 
that all trades and professions will care for and support rural 
economic development and make new contributions to Tianjin's 
invigoration and prosperity.

  [Text] The provincial leading group in charge of the work 
of supporting the Army and giving preferential treatment to 
families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and the work of 
supporting the government and cherishing the people held its 
third meeting in Harbin on the afternoon of 26 February. Sun 
Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee and head of 
the leading group, made a speech at the meeting. 
  He set forth that we should upgrade our understanding, 
strengthen duties and responsibility, and deepen the development 
of the double- support work. 
  The meeting heard the opinions made by some members of the 
leading group and the report on summing up the double-support 
work done in 1993, examined and discussed the 1994 
double-support work priorities, and discussed the detailed rules 
of the methods for naming and managing model cities and counties 
advanced in the double-support work. 
  The meeting was chaired by Sun Weiben. Shan Rongfan, Yu 
Jingchang, and Ma Shujie, deputy heads of the leading group, 
attended the meeting. 
  Sun Weiben said in his speech: Some of our double-support 
work achievements made in 1993 can be affirmed. The party, 
government, and Army leaders at various levels and the broad 
masses of armymen and people have upgraded their understanding 
about the double- support work. The society as a whole has made 
concrete efforts to grasp and manage the work. The gratifying 
situation characterized by the unity between the Army and the 
government and between the Army and the people has been 
consolidated and developed. Both the Army and the localities 
have done many good deeds by launching the double-support 
campaign, the joint civility campaign, and the mutual service 
campaign. Localities have extensively conducted investigation 
and study and worked out local laws and regulations on giving 
special care to disabled servicemen and to families of 
revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Thus, the policies on 
giving special care to disabled servicemen and families of 
revolutionary martyrs and servicemen have better been 
implemented. 
  In regard to the 1994 double-support work, Comrade Sun 
Weiben 
said: The 1994 double-support work priorities have been 
defined. We should clearly define our duties and grasp the 
implementation of the 1994 work. We should concentrate energy 
on conducting investigation and study, firmly attend to the 
setup of laws and regulations governing the double-support work 
and on giving special care to disabled servicemen and families 
of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, and continue to improve 
the campaign of striving to be model cities and counties 
advanced in the double-support work. Both the Army and the 
localities should earnestly do concrete deeds for each other and 
make contributions to the province's reform, development, and 
stability.

establishing the socialist market economy system more rapidly 
and also the last year of the three-year period for promoting 
Jilin's economy to a new height. In performing government work 
in 1994, we should thoroughly implement the guidelines of the

system, the further deepening of reform, and the rapid 
development of the economy have set new demands on government 
work. Changing and strengthening the work of the governments at 
all levels is an important guarantee for accomplishing the 
various tasks for the whole year./ 
  Gao Yan pointed out: Comprehensive fulfillment of the 
various tasks for promoting the economy to a new height requires

spirit and strong sense of mission, fulfill their 
responsibilities, and make concerted efforts to resolutely march 
toward the set target.

of development. The international and domestic situation is 
very favorable. Under the leadership of the party Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party

  [Text] Changchun, February 26 (XINHUA) -- Construction of 
China's largest production line for Volkswagen Jetta sedan cars 
has been proceeding with speed in Changchun, capital of 
northeast China's Jilin Province. 
  The production line is financed by the No. 1 Motor Vehicle 
Plant and Volkswagen Co. Ltd. as a Sino-German joint venture. 
It has a designed annual production capacity of 150,000 Jetta 
sedans. 
  According to engineers in charge of the construction 
project, 
the main workshops for general assembly, welding, coating and 
engines, and some other necessary facilities, have been 
completed. 
  A total of 95,000 sq m of roads, public squares and parking 
lots have been constructed and put into use. Imported welding 
equipment and production equipment have been or are being 
installed. 
  The plant has won 420 million U.S. dollars in loans from an 
international banking consortium formed by 36 banks. The money 
will be used to cover expenses for importing engines and 
transmission drive chains from overseas. 
  The construction of the production base is being carried out 
simultaneously with production by using existing production 
lines for Audi sedans. 
  Last year, the plant manufactured 12,000 Jettas and earned 
1.58 billion yuan from sales of such cars. The localization 
rate for Jetta sedan cars has reached 20.1 percent. 
  In addition, 101 after-sale Jetta service centers have been 
set up across the country. 
  The entire base is expected to be completed and put into 
operation in 1996.

  [Text] Washington, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank 
announced today it has approved a loan of 205 million U.S. 
dollars to help the poor farm families in China's northeastern 
province of Liaoning and Jilin. 
  The loan, through the International Development Association, 
will support the Songliao Plain agricultural development 
project, which will cost a total of 382.3 million dollars, the 
World Bank said. 
  Most families in the project area have an annual income of 
about 140 dollars. "They are constrained by single crop 
production, low productivity, and an uncertain market for the 
crop," said project manager Rapeepun Jaisaard. 
  The project, the official said, will increase the amount of 
available farmland and overall productivity by reclaiming 
currently unarable land and expanding irrigation on already 
farmed land. 
  About 6,200 hectares of saline-alkaline wasteland in 
Liaoning 
Province will be reclaimed under the project.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The high-tech 
industrial sector will produce 5.6 billion yuan a year in 
northeast China's Liaoning Province after 1996, senior officials 
from the provincial committee of economy said here recently. 
  The officials said Liaoning would seek development of its 
high- tech industry in ten aspects, namely, industrial robots, 
bar code technology, laser devices, bioengineering medicines, 
superfine particle materials, superfine fibers, talcum 
activation products, permanent-magnet materials, diaphragm 
technology and multi-media contact screens. 
  Construction projects for nine of the above ten industries 
started last year and will form mass production capability by 
1996, the officials predicted. 
  Though a total of 860 million yuan is needed for Liaoning's 
high- tech concerns to become a real industry, the officials 
said, investment in the high-tech industry is very rewarding 
compared with that in heavy industry, which now dominates the 
economy of the province. 
  The officials also pointed out that developing the high-tech 
sector is helped by Liaoning's present advantage in technology 
and industry processing ability. 
  For example, they said, the province now has over 200 senior 
experts in industrial robots, and has developed an underwater 
robot, a welding robot and a robot with visual capabilities, 
thanks to an investment of 60 million yuan by the central 
government. 
  Experts estimate that China's auto industry will need more 
than 900 welding and assembling robots in one to two years. 
  The province now plans to produce some 300 welding robots a 
year by 1996, making it a 300-million-yuan business, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Shenyang, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province is collecting funds to accelerate construction 
of expressways. 
  It is expected that by the end of this century the total 
length of the expressways in the province will reach 1,055 km. 
  Zhang Gongxian, deputy director of the Provincial Department 
of Communications, said that in the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period 
(1991- 1995), the province will construct the Shenyang-Benxi 
Expressway, Shenyang-Tieling Expressway and an expressway 
circling Shenyang City, the provincial capital. 
  The total length of the three expressways will be 213 km. 
  From 1996 to 2000 the province will construct the Shenyang- 
Shanhaiguan Expressway and another, from Tieling to Siping City 
in Jilin Province. The total length of the two expressways will 
be 471 km. 
  The province already has an expressway connecting Shenyang 
and Dalian, 375 km in length. 
  The investment in the three expressways under construction 
is 
about three billion yuan. 
  The state will provide 20 percent of the investment in the 
projects and Liaoning will get loans of 50 million U.S. dollars 
from the Asian Bank for the purpose. 
  The other two expressways to be constructed later this 
century will cost nine billion yuan.

  [Text] Dalian, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
has mounted to the third place among investors in Dalian, a 
leading port city in northern China's Liaoning Province and a 
traditional investment attraction for Hong Kong, Macao and Japan. 
  Latest statistics show that last year a total of 150 million 
U.S. dollars in contractual volume came from American investors, 
pushing the total investment Dalian has attracted from overseas 
to 4.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 96.8 percent over the previous 
year. 
  Officials said that favorite investment fields cover real 
estate, commerce, the entertainment business and information 
services. So far, a number of modern ventures involving science 
and technology, industrial production, telecommunications, 
transportation, posts and farming produce processing industries 
have been established. 
  Infrastructural facilities were greatly improved last year 
to 
create a better investment environment, local officials said. 
Tours to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia to invite 
investors proved fruitful. 
  In addition, local officials issued bonds worth 10 billion 
Japanese yen in Japan. They were sold off within eight days and 
were labeled "A Plus" in terms of credibility. 
  There are now more than 3,000 foreign-funded enterprises in 
the port city. The 1,439 enterprises which have started 
production have generated 10.97 billion yuan in output value and 
made 980 million U.S. dollars in exports.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- The 13th meeting of 
the China-EC Joint Committee was held here this morning. Wu Yi, 
head of the Chinese delegation, and minister of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation, and Brittan, head of the European 
Community [EC] delegation and member of the EC Commission 
jointly reviewed the economic relations and trade between China 
and the EC, and held broad discussions and consultations on 
bilateral cooperative ties. 
  Following the continued growth of bilateral trade and 
improvement of the imbalance in trade, both sides agreed at the 
meeting to make all-out efforts to promote a more balanced 
development of bilateral trade. 
  The two sides agreed to hold the second meeting in Brussels 
in June 1994 to continue discussions on some problems that still 
exist in bilateral trade and economic cooperation, concerning 
mainly agriculture, intellectual property and financial services. 
  Both sides also agreed to hold an industrial cooperation 
meeting in the nonferrous metal sector, to conduct technical 
discussions on alcoholic beverages, to organize a seminar on 
antidumping in China, and to explore the possibility of 
cooperation to ensure the safety and hygiene as well as to 
conduct inspections of import and export commodities. 
  The Joint Committee meeting reaffirmed the implementation of 
the minutes of the meeting held last year on intellectual 
property and sea transportation, and reaffirmed that both sides 
would continue to apply the principle of nondiscrimination. 
  At the meeting, the two parties also exchanged views on GATT 
and the prospects of bilateral cooperation. Both sides were 
satisfied with the progress made in bilateral cooperation in 
various areas, and also agreed to continue bilateral cooperation 
in such areas as the environment, industry and training of 
Chinese experts concerning trade policy, economics, law, 
management and telecommunications. 
  Both sides hoped to further enhance business cooperation, to 
increase direct contacts between enterprises with a view to 
bringing about more investment as well as other forms of 
industrial and trade cooperation between the two sides. 
  The two parties also agreed to set up a China-Europe 
international business school, and signed a memorandum at the 
conclusion of the meeting. 
  After the meeting, Wu Yi and Brittan jointly held a news 
briefing, and answered questions from reporters. 
  This afternoon, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing met 
with Brittan and his party; and they exchanged views on issues 
of common concern.

  [Text] Qian Qichen, PRC vice premier and foreign minister, 
met Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia at Prime Minister 
House in Dhaka on 26 February. During the talks, the two sides 
expressed satisfaction over the smooth development of cordial 
relations and cooperation between the two countries. Prime 
Minister Khaleda Zia said that the Government of Bangladesh 
attaches special importance to friendly ties and cooperation 
with China. The people of Bangladesh are grateful for the 
Chinese assistance. Qian Qichen said that China and Bangladesh 
have a long-standing history of friendly relations and their 
bilateral ties have received fresh impetus during the past few 
years. He added that China is satisfied with this. The PRC 
Government all along has been emphasizing the development of its 
cordial and cooperative relationship with Bangladesh. 
  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that he held 
fruitful discussions with Bangladeshi Foreign Minister 
Mustafizur Rahman during his visit. The current visit will 
certainly accelerate the development of the overall multifaceted 
cooperative relationship between the two countries. During the 
meeting, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen conveyed PRC Premier Li 
Peng's greetings and invitation to visit China to Prime Minister 
Khaleda Zia. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia gladly accepted the 
invitation and requested Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to convey 
to Premier Li Peng her good wishes and an invitation to visit 
Bangladesh. 
  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China held a news conference 
at the [word indistinct] State Guest House in Dhaka yesterday. 
He answered various questions by journalists on the 
international and regional situation and China's relations with 
the Third World. On the issue of making South Asia a 
nuclear-free zone, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that the 
PRC favors the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in South 
Asia. China hopes that there will be no arms race in South Asia 
because any arms race is harmful to peace and stability in the 
region. On Sino-Indian relations, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
said that we are satisfied with the development of Sino-Indian 
relations after the normalization of relations between the two 
countries. We feel that development of Sino-Indian relations 
should not affect China's cordial relations and cooperation with 
other South Asian nations. We hope that development of 
Sino-Indian relation will be beneficial to the development of 
China's cooperative relations with South Asian countries. 
  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen left Dhaka for Sri Lanka 
yesterday afternoon, ending his four-day state and goodwill 
visit to Bangladesh. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited the 
Parliament House of Bangladesh yesterday morning and met Sheikh 
Hasina, chairman of the Awami League and the leader of the 
opposition.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Following is the 
full text of "Facts About a Few Important Aspects of 
Sino-British Talks on 1994/95 Electoral Arrangements in Hong 
Kong" made public by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman here 
today: 
  From April to November 1993, the representatives of the 
Chinese and British Governments held 17 rounds of talks on the 
arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. Before the 
talks started, the two sides reached an understanding on 
confidentiality of the contents of the talks. Now, without 
prior consultations with the Chinese side, the British side has 
published in the white paper entitled Representative Government 
in Hong Kong, by which it has unilaterally released the contents 
of the talks, and in which it has distorted and attacked China's 
position. This move of Britain was designed to shirk its 
responsibility for the rupture of the talks. The Chinese side 
therefore cannot but bring to light the facts in order to help 
people know the truth. 

<H3>    The British Side Stubbornly Clung to the Constitutional 
Package Which Contravened the Joint Declaration, The Principle 
of Convergence with the Basic Law and the Agreements and 
Understandings Reached Between the Two Sides </H3>
  The 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong are to produce the 
three-tier political structure -- the Hong Kong Legislative 
Council, Urban and Regional Councils and district boards. The 
Hong Kong Legislative Council was established according to 
letters patent. In the long history of over 140 years after its 
institution in 1843, all its members were appointed by the 
governor of Hong Kong. In 1985 after the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration was signed, it began to have indirectly elected 
members and in 1991 direct elections started. In the current 
60-member Legislative Council, 3 were official members, 18 were 
appointed by the governor, 18 directly elected from geographical 
constituencies, and 21 indirectly from functional constituencies. 
  The Joint Declaration between the government of the People's 
Republic of China and the Government of the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the question of Hong Kong 
signed in 1984 contains explicit stipulations for the 
development of the political structure in Hong Kong. Since then 
the Chinese side spent four years and eight months in drafting 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of 
the People's Republic of China on the basis of extensively 
soliciting opinions of the Hong Kong people and subsequently 
promulgated it. Meanwhile, the two sides discussed specific 
matters concerning the development of the political structure in 
Hong Kong, and reached a series of agreements, understandings 
and consensus. The Basic Law was well received by the general 
public in Hong Kong. The British side also made commitments on 
several occasions to convergence of the development of the 
political structure in Hong Kong with the Basic Law before 1997. 
  However, in his first policy address delivered in October 
1992 after he took office, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten 
proposed a constitutional package, which spelled out, among 
other things, specific arrangements for the 1994/95 elections. 
The package contravened the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
principle of convergence with the Basic Law and agreements and 
understandings already reached between the two sides both in its 
contents and in the way it was produced. 
  Annex II of the Joint Declaration stipulates that the 
Chinese and British Governments should enhance cooperation in 
the second half of the transitional period in Hong Kong and 
jointly work out measures to ensure a smooth transition leading 
to 1997. As the 1994/95 elections will have a direct bearing on 
the transition, there must be agreement between the Chinese and 
British Governments on the electoral arrangements through 
consultations. Before October 1992, the Chinese side had 
suggested that the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group begin at an 
early date its consultation on this issue. However, without 
prior consultations with the Chinese side, the British side 
suddenly and unilaterally made public a constitutional package 
in gross violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the 
Joint Declaration. 
  The Basic Law states that the political structure in Hong 
Kong shall develop "in accordance with the principles of gradual 
and orderly progress" and "in the light of the actual situation" 
there. Annex II of the Basic Law and the relevant decision of 
the National People's Congress set out clearly the specific 
ratio and number of directly elected members of the first, 
second and third Legislative Councils of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region to be gradually increased. Chris Patten, 
however, has introduced in its package drastic changes to the 
existing political structure in Hong Kong and attempted to apply 
direct elections to all the members of the Legislative Council 
in 1995 in disguise. The package has also tried to change the 
nature of the election by functional constituencies and 
contained proposals obviously contradictory to the Basic Law on 
many specific issues. 
  This package has also contravened the series of agreements, 
understandings and consensus already reached between the two 
sides, especially those reached by the exchange of letters 
between the two foreign ministers in early 1990. 
  After it was made public, the package naturally met with 
strong opposition from the Chinese Government and provoked sharp 
criticism among Hong Kong people. Under these circumstances, 
the British Government was forced to ask for talks with the 
Chinese Government on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements in Hong 
Kong. Proceeding from the overall interests of effecting a 
smooth transition and maintaining prosperity and stability in 
Hong Kong, the Chinese Government agreed to such talks with it 
and the two sides reached agreement on the basis for talks, i.e. 
Observance of the Joint Declaration, the principle of 
convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements and 
understandings already reached between the two sides or the 
three principles in short. 
  The Chinese side wished to see agreement reached in the 
talks 
at an earlier date so as to realize a smooth transition and 
smooth transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997 through 
cooperation between China and Britain. To this end, the Chinese 
side made unremitting efforts in the talks. 
  During the first three rounds of the talks, the Chinese side 
made it plain that as the two sides had agreed upon the three 
principles as the basis for the talks, it believed it important 
for the British side to first of all confirm the agreements, 
understandings and consensus previously reached between the two 
sides, for this was the only way to enable the talks to move on 
the right track. If it was reluctant to do so and wanted to 
amend or overturn them, then it would be impossible to ensure 
compliance of future agreements. Therefore, the Chinese side 
produced an eight-point text which it wished to be confirmed 
(see Annex I). The British side had all along refused to 
confirm some of the agreements and understandings already 
reached between the two sides. For the rest, it tried to avoid 
confirming their substance by paying lip service with no 
intention to observe and implement them when it came to concrete 
matters. 
  In the rounds four to nine of the talks, the Chinese side 
put forward proposals on several major issues in accordance with 
the three principles. It proposed to focus on the electoral 
arrangements for district boards and municipal councils before 
moving on to discuss the 1995 Legislative Council elections. 
But it was rejected by the British side. During this period, 
the British side moved to offer some new views different from 
Chris Patten's package. But in essence, it stuck to the 
substance of the package on some major issues. 
  From the 10th to the 13th round of talks, the Chinese side 
made further adjustments to its proposal in order to push 
forward the talks. But as the British side refused to reverse 
its position of contravening the three principles, the talks 
progressed rather slowly. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen once again proposed during his meeting with Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd in New York in October 1993 that the 
electoral arrangements for the district organizations, i.e. the 
district boards and two municipal councils, and for the 
Legislative Council should be discussed in two phases. 
  Starting from the 14th round, the Chinese side once again 
called for separate discussions of the electoral arrangements 
for the district organizations and for the 1995 Legislative 
Council and spelt out its views. The British side agreed to 
China's proposal at first. But when the two sides were close to 
an agreement, it insisted on including the voting method for the 
1995 Legislative Council into the understanding on the electoral 
arrangements for district organizations. When its unreasonable 
demand was rejected by the Chinese side, it unilaterally 
discontinued the talks at the 17th round and submitted to the 
Legislative Council part of the question under discussion 
between the two sides, which directly led to the termination of 
the talks. 

<H3>    The British Side Attempted To Interfere in the Affairs 
Falling Within the Scope of China's Sovereignty </H3>
  The topic of the Sino-British talks was arrangements for the 
1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. This was first proposed by the 
British side and then agreed upon by the two sides. This was 
also the objective of the talks. However, at the outset and 
later, the British side insisted on discussing with China the 
following three issues: There should be consultation between 
the two sides about Hong Kong membership of the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]; 
the Chinese Government would support universal suffrage for the 
election of the Legislative Council in 2007, if that was the 
wish of the Hong Kong SAR; and the method of forming the 
election committee in 1995 should be used for the future 
selection committee for the first chief executive of the Hong 
Kong SAR and election committees for its subsequent chief 
executives. 
  The Chinese side made it clear that all the three issues 
raised by the British side went beyond the arrangements for the 
1994/95 elections in Hong Kong and should therefore not be 
covered by the talks. 
  With regard to election of all members of the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong SAR by universal suffrage after 2007, 
Article 68 of the Basic Law and Paragraph 3 of its Annex II 
contain provisions to this effect (see Annex II). It is a 
question to be decided by the Hong Kong SAR itself and it needs 
no guarantee by the Chinese Government. As for the 1995 
election committee as the model, the selection committee for 
producing the first chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and 
election committees for its subsequent chief executive have 
different functions from those of the election committee which 
would elect members of the Legislative Council in 1995. The 
decision of the National People's Congress [NPC] on the method 
for the formation of the first government and the first 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region adopted in April 1990 (see Annex III) and Annex I of the 
Basic Law (see Annex IV) have all clearly provided for how to 
produce the selection committee for the first chief executive 
and the election committees for the subsequent chief executives. 
To replace or revise the relevant provisions is out of the 
question. On the question of consultation between the two sides 
on Hong Kong members of the preparatory committee, it is 
entirely within China's sovereignty to organize the said 
preparatory committee. According to the relevant NPC decision, 
the chairman and members of the preparatory committee to be set 
up in 1996, including those from Hong Kong, should be appointed 
by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. 
  Apparently, the Basic Law and the NPC decisions have 
explicit 
provisions for all the three issues. They are matters within 
China's sovereignty. The motive of the British side in raising 
these questions is obvious. 
  Agreements and Understandings Reached Between the Two 
Sides on the Election Committee Must Be Observed 
  In early 1990, the foreign ministers of China and Britain 
exchanged seven messages on how to make the 1995 Hong Kong 
Legislative Council elections converge with the Basic Law so as 
to guarantee a smooth transition in 1997 and reached agreements 
and understandings on a series of issues, including the 
composition and ratio of the election committee. With regard to 
the election committee for 1995, Foreign Minister Qian made it 
clear in his letter dated 8 February 1990 that "the provisions 
on the composition and ratio of the election committee as 
specified in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (draft) 
must followed, because Annex I was approved by a two-thirds 
majority of the membership of the drafting committee at its 
eighth plenary session. The Chinese side is of the view that 
the above-mentioned composition and ratio are appropriate and 
need no alteration." In his letter of reply dated 12 February, 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with the Chinese 
proposal by saying that "I agree in principle with the 
arrangements which you propose for an electoral committee, which 
could be established in 1995. The precise details of how this 
should be done can be discussed between our two sides in due 
course." Thus the foreign ministers of the two countries did 
reach an unequivocal agreement and understanding on the 
composition and ratio of the 1995 election committee. 
  According to provisions of Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the 
Basic Law, the election committee shall be comprised of members 
from the following four sectors: the industrial, commercial and 
financial sectors; the professionals; the labour, social 
services, religious and other sectors; members of the 
Legislative Council, representatives of district-based 
organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's 
Congress, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, with each sector taking up one fourth 
of the total membership (see Annex IV). 
  However, Chris Patten's plan proposed that "the 1995 
election 
committee should draw all or most of the members from the 
directly-elected district boards". This directly contradicted 
the agreement and understanding reached between the two foreign 
ministers in early 1990. 
  During the talks, the British side flatly denied the fact 
that there had been agreement or understanding between the two 
sides on the election committee. After patient reasoning by the 
Chinese side, it only agreed to part of the Chinese proposal 
that the composition and ratio of first three sectors of the 
election committee may follow the relevant provisions of 
Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. But it still insisted 
that the fourth sector should be composed of representatives of 
the district-based organizations in the place of those as set 
out in Paragraph 2 of Annex I, which meant a significant change 
to Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. 
  The election committee should have a broad representation. 
This was a common understanding reached between China and 
Britain a long time ago. The British side, on its part, was not 
opposed to the principle of balanced participation either. 
According to its proposal, however, Hong Kong deputies to the 
National People's Congress, Hong Kong members of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] and members of the Legislative Council would 
be completely excluded from the election committee, contrary to 
the provisions of Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. The 
election committee composed in such a manner would obviously 
impair its broad representation. 
  The British side insisted all along that "the election 
committee should be composed of people who had themselves been 
elected... in Hong Kong". Actually it knew full well that with 
Hong Kong still under the rule of the British Government before 
1997, it was not possible to have the NPC deputies and CPPCC 
National Committee members elected in Hong Kong. As provided 
for in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law, Hong Kong 
deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC National Committee 
will all be members of the election committee. Since the term 
of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and its members elected in 
1995 may extend beyond 1997, the 1995 elections would be 
special. Therefore, the Chinese side could not accept exclusion 
of the Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC 
National Committee from the 1995 election committee. 
  The Chinese side further pointed out that the election 
committee was only a transitional arrangement. Its original 
purpose was to make it possible for those representative figures 
who enjoyed prestige in the society in Hong Kong but were 
unwilling to participate in direct elections to serve on the 
Legislative Council and play their role there. The election of 
the election committee would be indirect, not direct. 
  The Chinese views and position on the election committee 
were 
very straight-forward, i.e. to act strictly in accordance with 
the agreements and understandings reached between China and 
Britain so that conditions could be created for the Legislative 
Council of Hong Kong and its members elected in 1995 to become 
the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and its members. The Chinese side offered 
its specific views on the election committee as follows: The 
election committee would be comprised of members from four 
sectors. Representatives of the first three sectors would be 
produced by a voting method similar to that of functional 
constituencies while the fourth sector would be composed of 
members of the Legislative Council, representatives of the 
district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and 
representatives of Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National 
Committee as prescribed in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic 
Law. Members of the Legislative Council and the representatives 
of the district- based organizations mentioned here referred to 
those who would be members of the Legislative Council and 
representatives of district organizations after the SAR 
Government was formed in 1997 and they would not be in place at 
the time of the 1995 Legislative Council elections. Therefore, 
the Chinese side proposed that they be substituted respectively 
by members of the present Legislative Council and the 
representatives of the members of the district boards, regional 
and urban councils to be elected in 1994/1995. 
  As for the size of the election committee, the two sides had 
never reached any agreement or understanding. The nature and 
functions of the election committee that would elect 10 members 
of the Legislative Council in 1995 would be different from those 
of the selection committee that would produce the first chief 
executive of the Hong Kong SAR and those of the election 
committees which would produce its subsequent chief executives. 
The election committee should have a broad representation and 
be easy to organize and operate. In view of all this, the 
Chinese side proposed that the desirable size of the 1995 
election committee could be around 600. The British side did not 
take exception to it. 

<H3>    The Original Purpose of Election by Functional 
Constituencies Must Be Upheld </H3>
  The functional constituencies system was first recommended 
to 
the Chinese side by the British side. The Chinese side on its 
part, taking into account the reality in Hong Kong, accepted 
this recommendation by incorporating it into the Basic Law. In 
fact, China and Britain had long reached an understanding which 
regarded the functional constituencies system as a form of 
indirect election. The basic position held by the Chinese side 
in the talks was as follows: first, election by functional 
constituencies should conform to the original purpose of 
introducing this system and the understanding reached by the two 
sides thereon. It is indirect election, and must not be turned 
into a form of direct election on an occupational basis. 
Secondly, the evolution of the system should follow the 
principle of gradual development. 
  On these grounds, the Chinese side suggested during the 
talks 
that the 1995 elections should follow the principle guiding the 
1991 elections. Those which used the corporate voting method 
and those which used the individual voting method should 
continue to do so. However, according to the British proposal, 
corporate voting would be totally abolished. Even the 
representatives of corporate bodies would only vote on their own 
behalf, rather than on behalf of their corporate bodies. It 
wanted to expand the electorate of functional constituencies to 
include the entire working population of Hong Kong and thus turn 
the system into direct election on an occupational basis. This 
approach obviously ran counter to the British Hong Kong 
Government's original intention in instituting the functional 
constituencies system. It contradicted its own principles and 
the understandings reached between the two sides. 
  The Chinese side also stated that the evolution of the 
functional constituencies system should follow the principle of 
gradual development. The seats returned by the functional 
constituencies would increase from 21 in 1991 to 30 in 1995, 
which in itself was a big progress. With the increase of the 
number of seats, the electorate of functional constituencies 
would surely expand accordingly. Yet the British side insisted 
on a drastic expansion of the electorate from less than 100,000 
in 1991 to 2.7 million voters in 1995. Its subsequent revised 
proposals still aimed to bring up the electorates to 900,000, 
which would mean a nine-fold increase. This certainly could not 
be termed as "gradual development". 
  While pointing out the irrationalities of the British 
proposal, the Chinese side showed flexibility in order to 
advance the talks. With regard to the electorate of functional 
constituencies, it agreed to increase the number of corporate 
representatives provided that the principle of corporate voting 
was adhered to. With regard to the nine new functional 
constituencies in 1995, it proposed at an earlier stage of the 
talks that they should be: the Hong Kong Chinese enterprises 
associations; labour, agriculture and fishery; textiles and 
garment; importers and exporters association; kai fong 
[neighborhood] welfare associations; insurance; maritime and 
sports. Later, to accommodate the views and concerns of the 
British side, and to facilitate the talks, the Chinese side made 
several adjustments to its own proposal which would have the 
following new constituencies: the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises 
Association, insurance, labour, agriculture and fishery, 
textiles and garment, importers and exporters association, 
wholesale and retail, transport, sports, entertainment and 
culture. This fully testified to the sincerity and cooperative 
spirit of the Chinese side. After a period of talks, the two 
sides had narrowed their differences over the electorate 
question and had reached a degree of consensus on such specific 
questions as what constituencies would have more seats in 1995. 
We had expected that the British side would have shown the same 
flexibility and cooperative spirit after seriously studying the 
Chinese proposal. However, up to the last minute, it still clung 
to its basic position which was not in conformity with the 
British Hong Kong Government's original intention in instituting 
the functional constituencies system, or the "guiding 
principles" it had all along vigorously recommended to the 
Chinese side, or the reality in Hong Kong and the wish of people 
from various walks of life in Hong Kong, or the principle of 
"gradual development". Surely, this was not acceptable to the 
Chinese side. 
  Taking account of the special importance of mainland-funded 
enterprises to the socio-economic life of Hong Kong, the Chinese 
side proposed the forming of a constituency of Hong Kong Chinese 
Enterprises Association. As the functional constituencies 
system was designed to let those sectors which play an important 
role in "maintaining prosperity and confidence in the future of 
Hong Kong" have "full representation" in the Legislative 
Council. [sentence as received] At present, there are three 
main categories of Hong Kong's businesses: foreign invested 
businesses, those owned by Hong Kong residents of Chinese 
origin, and mainland invested businesses. The first two have 
already been represented in the Hong Kong Legislative Council. 
Only the last category is not. If the 1995- elected 
Legislative Council is to be carried beyond 1997, it would be 
unreasonable to discriminate against the mainland-funded 
enterprises and deny them of their representation in the new 
legislature. 
  Given the need to strengthen the representation of the 
"labour sector" in the Legislative Council though it already had 
two seats, the Chinese side proposed that the labour sector be 
given one extra seat from the proposed nine new seats. Like the 
existing two seats, the electorate of this new seat should 
comprise of the more than 400 trade unions registered in Hong 
Kong. But the British side, contradicting the original purpose 
of forming functional constituencies, tried to lump together 
employees of one sector with employers or professionals of 
another in an attempt to cause conflict and discord. The 
Chinese side believed that this idea proposed by the British 
side was undesirable. 
  The British side proposed a "civil servant sector" in the 
ninth round of talks, which was designed to make a fundamental 
change in the civil servant system in Hong Kong, undermine the 
principle of political neutrality of civil servants and create 
confusion and discord among them. This grossly contravened the 
principle of convergence with the Basic Law. The British 
proposal was rejected by the Chinese side and met with strong 
discontent expressed by the Hong Kong people, including the 
civil servants. The British side had to give up this proposal 
in the end. 
  The British side repeatedly asserted that the irregularities 
in the 1991 functional constituency elections were due to the 
use of corporate voting and that by changing all the corporate 
voting into individual voting these irregularities could be 
redressed. This is not a convincing argument. In relation to 
the problems which cropped up in the functional constituencies 
for the regional council election in 1991, the Chinese side 
pointed out: 1) the regional council was rather special 
functional constituency with only 36 constituents and would 
remain so in the 1995 elections; 2) this constituency voted by 
individuals during the 1991 election. The British side was 
trying to blame corporate voting for the irregularities caused 
by individual voting. The incongruity is clear for all to see. 
What is more, whatever problems which may occur in the course 
of elections should be resolved in a realistic manner and should 
not be used as a pretext to change the original purpose and 
special role of functional constituencies. Even the British 
proposal could not solve the problem it raised. 
  The Question of Through Train Can Only Be Solved 
Within the Framework of the NPC Decision and Basic Law 
  The so-called "through train" mainly means that members of 
Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon 
confirmation by the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee, member 
of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the 
People's Republic of China upon China's resumption of the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. The 
decision adopted by the National People's Congress in April 1990 
prescribes in Article 6 that: "If the composition of the last 
Hong Kong Legislative Council before the establishment of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is in conformity with 
the relevant provisions of this decision and the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, those of its 
members who uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and 
pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
of the People's Republic of China, and who meet the requirements 
set forth in the Basic Law of the region may, upon confirmation 
by the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, become members of the first Legislative 
Council of the region." 
  It is clear that there are explicit provisions for the 
criteria for the confirmation of the Legislative Council 
members. The NPC decision makes it clear that the composition 
of the last Legislative Council through the 1995 elections 
should conform to the NPC decision and the relevant provisions 
of the Basic Law. Otherwise, "conformation" of these members 
would be out of the question. The Chinese side proposed that 
the two sides first consider and agree on the question of 
conformity between the "composition" and the relevant provisions 
of the NPC decision and the Basic Law, for it was of crucial 
importance to the discussion of the confirmation of the 
Legislative Council members. To discuss the question of 
conformation before it was determined that the composition of 
the Legislative Council conformed with the Basic Law and the NPC 
decision, as insisted by the British side, would be illogical 
and make the discussion devoid of the necessary basis. 
  The British side considered the criteria set forth in the 
NPC 
decision not objective and clear enough. So it proposed its 
own. It believed that a pledge of allegiance as required by 
Article 104 of the Basic Law would be sufficient for a member of 
the 1995 elected Legislative Council to continue to serve on the 
first SAR legislature. On more than one occasions, the British 
side stated that it had no intention to deprive the preparatory 
committee of its functions as set forth in the NPC decision, to 
trespass the constitutional power of the NPC and the preparatory 
committee, or to alter or revise the provisions of the Basic Law 
or the NPC decision, nor had it any intention to seek transition 
of all or some of the members of the Legislative Council. 
  In the interest of a smooth transition, the Chinese side 
agreed that members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council under 
British rule, upon confirmation by the preparatory committee, 
could automatically become members of the first Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China 
in 1997. Given the different nature of the two governments 
before and after 30 June 1997, there was no precedent to the 
Chinese agreement. It fully testified to the sincerity of the 
Chinese side for cooperation. The Chinese side held that the 
confirmation of members of parliament should reflect the 
principle of the state sovereignty and there were clear-cut 
provisions in the decision of the National People's Congress on 
criteria for confirmation. In the NPC decision the task of 
confirming the members of the Legislative Council was entrusted 
to the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee to be set up in 1996. 
The Chinese side could only act in accordance with the 
provisions in the Basic Law and the NPC decision and was not in 
a position to amend them, for it should not infringe upon the 
power of confirming the members of the Legislative Council 
vested in the preparatory committee by the National People's 
Congress. 
  In the view of the Chinese side, the British proposal that a 
mere oral statement by the 1995 elected members of the 
Legislative Council would be sufficient to make them members of 
the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR was in effect 
designed to strip the preparatory committee of the power of 
confirmation and render the confirmation meaningless. The 
British position also contradicted its own statements. Article 
104 of the Basic Law contained provisions on the normal 
procedures that the chief executive, principal officials, 
members of the Executive Council and of the Legislative Council 
of the Hong Kong SAR must go through when assuming office. It 
had nothing to do with the terms for confirming the members of 
the Legislative Council. Continued service of members of the 
Legislative Council on the first Legislative Council of the Hong 
Kong SAR was a matter involving two governments different in 
nature, and members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council could 
become members of the first Legislative Council only after being 
confirmed by the preparatory committee. Prior to this, they 
were not qualified to go through procedures of oath taking 
according to Article 104 of the Basic Law. Therefore, the oath 
taking procedures cannot substitute confirmation of members of 
the Legislative Council by the preparatory committee. 
  In brief, the Chinese side could only discuss with the 
British side the confirmation issue within the context of the 
Basic Law and the relevant NPC decisions. The Chinese side took 
note of the wish of the British side that the Chinese side make 
an explanation of the criteria for confirmation and 
recommendations to the relevant bodies. It expressed its 
willingness to explore an appropriate solution within the 
context of the Basic Law and the NPC decisions. To this end, 
the Chinese side offered some explanatory remarks on the 
criteria for confirmation contained in the NPC decision. It 
spelled out as follows: members of the first Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China 
must (1) pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People's 
Republic of China; (2) love China and love Hong Kong, uphold and 
abide by the Basic Law, support the resumption by the People's 
Republic of China of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
as of 1 July 1997 and be committed to a smooth transition and 
transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997 and its long-term 
prosperity and stability; (3) support the principle of "one 
country, two systems." Any act of violating the Basic Law, 
participation or playing a leading role in any action aimed at 
subverting the central government of China or changing the 
socialist system in the mainland would be regarded as failure to 
uphold and abide by the Basic Law and contravening the principle 
of "one country, two systems". (4) Meet the requirements set 
out in the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. For example, a 
member of the first Legislative Council must be a permanent 
resident of Hong Kong and should not have committed any criminal 
offense. 
  It was in the spirit of seeking a settlement that the 
Chinese 
side put forward the above views. In fact, the talks between 
the two sides on the "through train" was still going on, and the 
two sides could have continued their exchange of views and 
worked out an appropriate solution. But the British side used 
the media under its control to publicly distort the views of the 
Chinese side outside the talks. A thorough and balanced study 
of the Chinese explanations would have enabled one to come to a 
just conclusion. 

<H3>    The Chinese Side Made Tremendous Efforts for Agreement on 
Arrangements for District Organization Elections </H3>
  To push forward the talks, the Chinese side put forward a 
proposal as early as the fourth round of the talks that the two 
sides first reach agreement on the arrangements for the 
elections of the district boards and municipal councils and then 
move on to the discussions on the arrangements for the 
Legislative Council elections in 1995. This proposal was not 
accepted by the British side. In the discussions that followed, 
it refused to move away from Chris Patten's constitutional 
package, which was the cause of slow progress in the talks. In 
order to achieve a breakthrough, Vice Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen, during his meeting with British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd in New York on 1 October 1993, once again 
proposed to discuss and settle the question of arrangements for 
the district organization elections first. Mr. Qian said in 
explicit terms: As matters related to the district organization 
elections are relatively easy and time is pressing, the two 
sides may discuss them first and try to reach agreement. The 
1995 Legislative Council elections are more complicated and 
there is still some time left to allow the two sides to discuss 
them at a later stage. This was what the Chinese side meant by 
separating discussions on the two phases of the elections in 
accordance with the principle of "starting from the easier part 
and then moving on to the more difficult part". On that 
occasion, the British side did not express agreement. During 
the thirteenth round, it said it could accept the proposal on 
condition that the voting age be lowered from 21 to 18, the 
voting methods proposed by the British side be adopted and 
appointed membership be abolished. While welcoming the 
long-awaited British agreement to discuss arrangements for the 
district organization elections first, the Chinese side pointed 
out that to set preconditions was not a constructive approach. 
  The Chinese side raised three major issues of concern at 
the preliminary stage of the discussions on the arrangements for 
district organization elections: 
  1. In the last few years of the transitional period, the 
nature of the district boards and municipal councils as not 
being organs of political power and their current functions 
should remain unchanged so as to converge with the relevant 
provisions of the Basic Law. 
  2. In order to converge with the Basic Law, the Chinese side 
asked the British side to amend the relevant provisions in the 
Hong Kong election ordinance so as to enable Hong Kong deputies 
to Chinese people's congresses at various levels to stand for 
elections in Hong Kong. 
  After long procrastination, the British side finally agreed 
to this request. 
  3. Appointed membership in the district organizations. Both 
the chairmen and the members of the district boards and 
municipal councils were opposed to the total abolition of the 
appointed membership. In view of this wish of the people of 
Hong Kong and considering the actual operation of the district 
boards and municipal councils, the Chinese side believed that to 
keep the appointed seats was in conformity with Hong Kong's 
reality and could enable those concerned to play a positive role 
in safeguarding the welfare of the residents of their districts. 
It therefore maintained that the existing appointed seats in 
both the district boards and municipal councils should be kept. 
The British side, however, insisted on a total abolition of all 
these seats on the ground that the appointed membership of the 
Legislative Council would be abolished in 1995. The Chinese 
sides said that there was no automatic link between the 
appointed membership in the district boards and municipal 
councils and the Legislative Council elections, because the two 
were different both in nature and functions. Nevertheless, in 
order to move the talks forward, the Chinese side offered to be 
flexible to a certain extent on the proportion of the appointed 
seats provided that the British side agree in principle to 
maintain the appointed membership. The British side refused to 
make any concession. In face of this situation, the Chinese 
side made another effort by agreeing to reduce the proportion of 
the appointed seats from the current figure of over one third to 
one fourth of the total members in accordance with the principle 
of gradual development. Again it was rejected by the British 
side. Considering that this was the only difference left between 
the two sides on the 1994 elections and desiring to reach an 
early agreement with the British side on the district 
organization elections, the Chinese side put forward at the 
fifteenth round another proposal which accommodated the 
positions of the two sides and bypassed their difference. 
According to this proposal, the two sides would state in an 
understanding: "The British side stands for the abolition of the 
appointed membership in the district boards and the municipal 
councils in the 1994/95 elections while the Chinese side stands 
for the maintenance of an appropriate proportion of the 
appointed seats. The number of appointed seats in the district 
boards and municipal councils will be left to Hong Kong SAR 
Government to determine, on its own, after 30 June 1997 in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law." 
In fact, by this proposal, the British side did not have to 
retain appointed seats before 30 June 1997 and after that date 
the Hong Kong SAR Government may, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Basic Law, retain an appropriate proportion of 
appointed seats as the people of Hong Kong had wished. This 
proposal of the Chinese side was entirely positive and 
constructive. 
  During the discussions on appointed membership in district 
organizations, the Chinese sides also expressed agreement to 
lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 and indicated that it 
would take no exception to the "single seat, single vote" system 
proposed by the British side for the district board and 
municipal council elections. This shows that the Chinese side 
had actually accepted most of the British proposals on the three 
issues of voting age, voting methods and appointed membership in 
relation to the district board and municipal council elections. 
Since two other related questions were basically resolved, 
i.e., confirming that the nature and functions of the district 
organizations would remain unchanged and commitment to remove 
provisions barring Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese people's 
congresses at various levels from standing for elections, the 
two sides were close to agreement on all issues related to the 
arrangements for the district organization elections. If the 
British side had the minimum sincerity, the two sides would have 
been able to reach agreement on this question after the 
fifteenth round of the talks. 
  What the British side did was to raise new demands in its 
response to the Chinese proposal through diplomatic channels 
before the sixteenth round. It asserted that the "single seat, 
single vote" voting method for the district board and municipal 
council elections must also be applied to the geographical 
elections for the 1995 Legislative Council. The Chinese side 
pointed out that it was inappropriate to include this point in 
the present agreement. The Chinese side had made major 
concessions to the British side on the three questions of 
concern to it related to the district organization elections. 
Now the British side raised new issues. It was really going 
too far. 
  During the sixteenth and seventeenth rounds, the British 
side insisted on including the provision that the Legislative 
Council elections would also use the "single seat, single vote" 
method in the memorandum of understanding on the arrangements 
for the district organization elections. It explained that by 
insisting on this method in the Legislative Council elections, 
it wished to have a balanced agreement out of both practical and 
political considerations. The Chinese side believed, however, 
that none of the British explanations was tenable. 
  1. To address the British concern about "balance", the 
Chinese side submitted to the British side the draft text of a 
verbal understanding (see Annex V) during the seventeenth round 
of the talks, proposing to confine the three questions of voting 
age, voting methods and the removal of restrictions on Hong Kong 
deputies to Chinese people's congresses to the elections of the 
district boards and municipal councils and to leave all 
questions related to the Legislative Council elections to a 
later stage. This new proposal aimed at seeking a solution was 
rejected by the British side out of hand. 
  2. The British side alleged that the legislation on the 
voting method for Legislative Council elections needed to be 
passed as early as possible; otherwise, there would have to be 
two separate legislations on the question of voting methods, 
which would be a waste of time. In the view of the Chinese 
side, to have two separate legislations was only a technical 
question. There was no natural link between the voting methods 
for the district board and municipal council elections and those 
for the Legislative Council elections, not to mention there had 
been separate legislations on these two sets of elections. 
Since Legislative Council elections would not be held until 
September 1995, there was not much time pressure. It was not 
necessary to drag the question of the voting methods for 
Legislative Council elections into the understanding on the 
district board and municipal council elections now. It was 
entirely possible and proper to leave this matter to the later 
discussions between the two sides on Legislative Council 
elections. Otherwise, it would only complicate the talks. While 
saying that there was not much time left for the district board 
and municipal council elections, the British side insisted on 
dragging the issue of the voting methods for Legislative Council 
elections into present discussions, which could well be settled 
at a later stage. By so doing, it was placing obstacles to the 
talks and trying to delay them. The Chinese side found it 
difficult to understand. 
  3. The British side alleged that a motion on using the 
"single seat, single vote" system in the 1995 Legislative 
Council elections had been adopted by the Legislative Council 
and that leaders of the two main parties in the current 
Legislative Council all supported this method. The Chinese had 
always regarded the Hong Kong Legislative Council as Hong Kong 
governor's advisory body in legislative matters. If the British 
side insisted on following the views of the Legislative Council 
in the talks between the two governments, it would be totally 
unacceptable to the Chinese side. As far as the Chinese side was 
concerned, this was a matter of political principle. 

<H5>    The British Side Deliberately Scuttled the Talks </H5>
  As the British side had insisted that it be written into the 
memorandum of understanding on district organization election 
arrangements that the "single-seat, single-vote" voting method 
be applied also to the Legislative Council's geographical 
elections in 1995, the Chinese side, at the beginning of the 
16th round of the talks, refuted this unreasonable British 
demand as an artificial complication. But the British side made 
counter-charges that the Chinese side had retrogressed from its 
previous position on the question of appointed membership. In 
response, the Chinese side reiterated its position enunciated 
during the 15th round and pointed out that there was no 
retrogression at all of the Chinese position. It suggested in 
unequivocal terms that should the British side go along, the two 
sides could reach agreement. Evidently, the British accusations 
of Chinese retrogression of position were merely aimed at 
misleading the public and absolving itself from the 
responsibility for its reluctance to reach agreement with the 
Chinese side. 
  In fact, it was the British side that had retrogressed. 
Take for example the elections for the district boards and the 
municipal councils. The British side gave approval to the 
Chinese proposal for a settlement of the question of appointed 
seats after the 15th round, accepting almost all the wording 
proposed by the Chinese side. At the 17th round, the wording of 
the British proposal on the same question was on the whole 
similar to the Chinese proposal. But later, the British side 
unexpectedly questioned the legitimacy of the Chinese Government 
in representing the unborn government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region to discuss with the British side on 
appointed membership of the district boards and municipal 
councils. It went so far as to accuse the Chinese side of 
causing an erosion of the autonomy promised to the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region under the Joint Declaration and 
the Basic Law. This was entirely unjustifiable. The first draft 
of the five points of understanding proposed by the Chinese side 
during the 15th round contained a sentence which read: "The 
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will 
determine on its own the number of appointed seats of district 
boards and municipal councils in accordance with the provisions 
of Article 98 of Basic Law." The words "on its own" were later 
taken out for the sake of terseness, without altering the 
original meaning. By the time the talks broke down, the British 
side stated repeatedly that failure to reach an understanding 
with the Chinese side on district organization elections was due 
to the Chinese refusal to have the voting method of the 
Legislative Council included. But now, the British side 
switched to listing the so-called Chinese refusal to totally 
abolish the appointed seats as an important cause. Such 
inconsistency could hardly justify the British position. 
  During the 17th round of talks, the Chinese side made one 
more major effort and submitted to the British side the draft 
text of the above-mentioned five points of understanding on 
"complete separation" of the discussions on the election 
arrangements for 1994 from those for 1995. However, this 
constructive proposal of the Chinese side was promptly rejected 
by the British side, which read out a so-called "carefully 
thought-out" statement announcing that the British side was 
unable to continue its discussions with the Chinese side on an 
understanding of the first phase. Subsequently, the Chinese 
side formally reminded the British side that as early as 7 April 
1993 when the two sides agreed to hold talks, the Chinese side 
stated that, should the British side submit the so-called 
"constitutional bills" to the Legislative Council for 
deliberation before the two sides reached agreement through 
talks, that would mean the breakdown of the talks and the 
Chinese side was not to be held responsible for it. The British 
side turned a deaf ear to the Chinese warning. On 10 December, 
the governor [of] Hong Kong published a draft legislation of the 
first stage constitutional package and submitted it to the 
Legislative Council on 15 December, thus scuttling Sino-British 
talks on electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. 

<H5>    Concluding Remarks </H5>
  From the above-mentioned facts, one can see that the British 
side had no sincerity in the talks on the 1994/95 electoral 
arrangements in Hong Kong. Although it agreed at the first to 
base the talks on the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the existing 
agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain, 
it refused to keep its words during the talks. It was this 
trick of paying lip service played by the British side that 
prevented the talks from moving on the right track. The British 
side had attempted, at the very outset of the talks, to include 
in the agenda the three items that fell within the scope of 
China's sovereignty, thus setting obstacles to the talks. Soon 
after the beginning of the talks, the British Hong Kong 
authorities carried out electoral arrangements which ought to be 
agreed upon by the two sides through consultations. Finally, it 
concocted some excuses and left the negotiation table. 
Furthermore, it submitted the first part of the "constitutional 
package" to the Legislative Council, leading to the breakdown of 
the talks. Now, the British side has not only refused to 
withdraw the first part of the "constitutional package", but has 
even gone further by announcing that it would submit its second 
part to the Legislative Council as well. It is determined to 
shut the door to negotiations once and for all. It is the 
British side which shall bear full responsibility for the 
rupture of the talks. 
  The Chinese proposals for the 1994/95 electoral 
arrangements are based on the three principles guiding the Sino- 
British talks. They are designed to facilitate a smooth 
transition in Hong Kong and ensure its residents a happy and 
peaceful life. They are conducive to the convergence with the 
Basic Law and reflect the general wish of the people of Hong 
Kong. However, the British side has made unjustifiable 
accusations against China on these proposals, saying that the 
Chinese proposals would make it difficult to "maintain the rule 
of law" and could lead to "possible manipulation of elections". 
In fact, it is the violation of the Basic Law that would cause 
disruption of the rule of law and it is the British side that is 
attempting to manipulate elections. The British side has 
criticized the Chinese proposals concerning election by 
functional constituencies, asserting that they may cause 
"corruption and vote-rigging". These allegations are totally 
untenable and also reflect their disrespect for the voters and 
present members of the Legislative Council elected by functional 
constituencies. The British proposal concerning the electoral 
methods for the functional constituencies not only runs counter 
to the original purposes of the functional constituencies, but 
also fails to follow the principle of gradual development. The 
British insistence on the elimination of the appointed seats in 
the district boards and the two municipal councils is against 
the wishes of the majority of the Hong Kong [HK] people. On the 
issue of "through train" or confirmation of the Legislative 
Council members, the British side has tried to deprive the 
Preparatory Committee for the HK SAR of its actual confirmation 
right. It has up to now refused to acknowledge the agreements 
and understandings reached between the two foreign ministers on 
the question of the election committee. 
  All this fully reveals that the true intention of the 
"constitutional package" the British side clings to, taking 
advantage of the remaining years of the British rule in Hong 
Kong and waving the banner of "democracy", it tries to create 
division and confusion, place obstacles to a smooth transition 
in Hong Kong and turn the last elections of the three-tier 
structure to be held before 1997 in Britain's favour so as to 
maintain its influence over Hong Kong for as long as possible 
after 1997 and to manipulate the political situation there. 
  The core of the controversy between China and Britain over 
the political structure in Hong Kong is not whether democracy 
should be promoted or whether there should be "openness and 
fairness" as claimed by the British side, but rather whether 
international commitments should be honoured, whether there 
should be convergence with the Basic Law, and whether a smooth 
transition in Hong Kong should be achieved. The whole 
controversy was started by a shift of Britain's Hong Kong 
policy. Facts will prove that this policy shift will not serve 
the British interests and will hurt Hong Kong as well. 
  The Sino-British talks have broken down as a result of the 
British disruption. The Chinese side deems it necessary to 
reiterate in all seriousness that in accordance with the 
provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the British 
administration of Hong Kong shall come to an end on 30 June 1997 
and the Chinese Government shall resume the exercise of its 
sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. The last district 
boards, the two municipal councils and the Legislative Council 
which form part of the political structure of Hong Kong under 
the British administration, will stop functioning along with the 
conclusion of the period of the British administration. The 
political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region after 1 July 1997 will be built in accordance with the 
relevant decisions of the NPC of the People's Republic of China 
and the provisions of the Basic Law. 
  Hong Kong will soon return to the embrace of its motherland. 
Nobody can stop it. The Chinese Government and people are 
confident and capable of resuming the exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong as scheduled, implementing the policy of "one 
country, two systems" and the Basic Law and ensuring long-term 
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. 
  Annex I 

<H5>    Chinese Draft of Points To Be Confirmed by the Two Sides </H5>
  In late April 1993, the representative of the Chinese 
Government, Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu, and the 
representative of the British Government, Ambassador Robin 
McLaren, in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, 
the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the relevant 
agreements and understandings reached between the two sides, 
held two rounds of talks on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral 
arrangements. 
  1. The two sides reaffirm that pursuant to the consensus 
reached between them, the Joint Declaration, the principle of 
convergence with the Basic Law and the relevant agreements and 
understandings reached between the two sides should serve as the 
basis for their talks. 
  2. Both sides confirm that, before 1997, Hong Kong's 
political structure should develop gradually on the basis of the 
Joint Declaration and the reality in Hong Kong and should 
converge with the Basic Law. 
  3. Both sides confirm that before 1997 the "executive-led" 
political structure should be maintained in Hong Kong so as to 
converge with the Basic Law. 
  4. As the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong bear on the smooth 
transition to 1997, the Chinese and British sides shall conduct 
serious consultations with a view to reaching consensus. 
  5. Both sides confirm that before 1997, the nature of Hong 
Kong's district boards and two municipal councils as not being 
political organs and their functions shall remain unchanged, so

the provisions of Article 97 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong

  2. The British side agree that those provisions of the 
electoral legislations for the district boards and municipal 
councils which prevent the participation in those bodies of 
members of congresses or parliaments and salaried officials from 
countries and regions outside Hong Kong shall be amended, with a 
view to removing the restrictions on deputies to people's 
congresses of the People's Republic of China at all levels while 
retaining the existing restrictions on members of congresses or 
parliaments and salaried officials from other countries and 
regions. 
  3. The two sides agree that the minimum voting age in 
elections to the district boards (and) municipal councils shall

municipal councils. 
  5. The British side propose that the appointed membership of 
the district boards and municipal councils should be abolished 
effective from September 1994 and March 1995 respectively. The 
Chinese side propose that an appropriate proportion of 
membership of the district boards and municipal councils to be 
formed in 1994 and 1995 should be appointed. The Chinese side 
declare that, as from 1 July 1997, the Government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region shall, in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law, determine the number 
of appointed seats in the district boards and municipal councils. 
  The foregoing points constitute a verbal understanding 
between the two sides and shall be implemented accordingly. 
  The two sides state that they will continue, in a positive 
and constructive spirit, discussions on the (other) issues 
relating to the 1995 Legislative Council elections on the basis 
of the Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the 
Basic Law, and relevant agreements and understandings reached 
between China and Britain and strive for an earliest possible 
agreement.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman today made public facts concerning several major 
issues in the Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 election 
arrangements in Hong Kong. 
  The spokesman pointed out: From April to November 1993, 
representatives of the Chinese and the British Governments held 
17 rounds of talks on the 1994-95 election arrangements in Hong 
Kong. Prior to the talks, the two countries reached an 
understanding of confidentiality of the contents of talks. Now 
the British, without having consultation with China, have 
unilaterally published the contents of the talks, distorting and 
attacking the Chinese stance in an attempt to shift 
responsibility for disruption of the talks. China is compelled 
to make public relevant talks on this to ensure a correct 
understanding of the facts. 
  The facts published by the spokesman concerning several 
major 
issues in the Sino-British talks consist of seven issues and a 
postscript. The seven issues are: 1) Britain obstinately clings 
to the "three violations" political system program during the 
talks; 2) Britain attempts to interfere with affairs which fall 
within the scope of Chinese sovereignty; 3) The agreement and 
understanding reached between the two countries on the issue of 
the Election Committee must be honored; 4) The original 
intention of functional constituency elections must be upheld; 
5) The issue of the "through train" can only be resolved within 
the scope of the National People's Congress decision and the 
relevant provisions of the Basic Law; 6) China has exerted great 
efforts to reach agreement on the issue of election arrangements 
of regional organizations; and 7) Britain has deliberately 
disrupted the talks. 
  The spokesman pointed out: The essence of the dispute 
between China and Britain on the issue of Hong Kong's political 
system is not a question of whether or not we want to develop 
democracy, but one of whether or not we should keep good faith 
internationally and converge the Basic Law with the realization 
of Hong Kong's smooth transition. The dispute has been started 
by the changes in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong. Facts will 
prove that such changes do not conform with Britain's interests 
and will cause damage to Hong Kong. 
  The latest Sino-British talks have broken down because of 
Britain's disruption. China deems it necessary to sternly 
reiterated that in accordance with the stipulations of the Sino- 
British Joint Declaration, British administration of Hong Kong 
ends on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. The 
components of the political system structure of the British 
administration of Hong Kong -- the last British Hong Kong 
District Board, the two municipal councils, and the Legislative 
Council -- must be dissolved along with the end of the British 
administration period. From 1 July 1997, the political system 
structure of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region will be 
organized and established according to the NPC decision and the 
relevant provisions of the Basic Law. 
  In conclusion, the spokesman emphatically pointed out: 
Nobody can obstruct Hong Kong's forthcoming return to the 
motherland's embrace. The Chinese Government and people are 
entirely confident that they will be able to resume the exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule, and to implement the 
principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law to 
preserve Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.

scientific management with high standards and strict measures. 
  He also addressed the conference about the measures in the 
improvement of service quality in civil aviation services. 
  On the reform of civil aviation services, he said that the 
first step will focus on the quality of service. 
  He called for streamlining the relations between various 
airlines and subsidiaries and perfecting the contract system. 
  He said that the second step will focus on solutions to some 
deep-lying problems involving the whole administrative system 
and the functions of the various civil aviation administrations.

  [Text] Guiyang, February 24 (XINHUA) -- People suffering 
from arsenic poisoning owing to the burning of arsenic-bearing 
coal in Guizhou Province, south-west China, are receiving good 
treatment, according to local officials. 
  The first cases of arsenic poisoning were discovered in 1991 
in one of Guizhou's Prefectures inhabited by ethnic minority 
people, and so far 1,908 victims have been diagnosed in the 
province. 
  During the past three years the Guizhou Provincial 
Government 
has allocated 288,000 yuan to treat 1,696 such patients free of 
charge. Most of them are recovering well. 
  This year the government will set aside another 500,000 yuan 
for its treatment program. 
  Relevant government departments have also made comprehensive 
surveys of the coal mines to close down those producing coal 
with too high an arsenic content, to prevent any further arsenic 
poisoning.

  [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie has 
carried out investigation and study in Guanghan City over the 
past few days. 
  During his inspection of Guanghan, Comrade Xie Shijie 
stated: 
Guanghan City is the banner of Sichuan's county-level 
comprehensive economic structural reform and has had a positive 
influence on the entire country in this connection as well. At 
present, Guanghan should continually make every possible effort 
to seize each and every opportunity to further emancipate the 
mind, intensify reform, and expand opening up to the outside 
world and should strive to take the lead in the county-level 
comprehensive economic structural reform in the years ahead. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie emphatically stated: Reform has 
substantially boosted Guanghan's development. In the years 
ahead, Guanghan should continually hold aloft the banner of 
reform, firmly bear in mind all major tasks set for this year by 
the central authorities, and firmly seize each and every 
opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, push ahead with 
development, and maintain stability. We are currently being 
confronted with a completely new situation in which we should 
follow good examples and help relatively backward areas to catch 
up. Only by successfully developing the economy will we be able 
to remain in an invincible position. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie expressed the hope that Guanghan City 
will 
conscientiously draw upon the successful experiences and 
practices of all fraternal counties and cities across the 
province. It is a good phenomenon, he noted, that various 
counties, cities, and prefectures across the province have 
already started competing with one another and learning from 
each other. Only by invigorating and successfully developing 
the county-level economy will Sichuan be able to stand a very 
good chance of success. 
  Comrade Xie Shijie maintained: The leading organs should 
both strengthen internal solidarity and support and help each 
other. Within each leading organ, given each individual's 
different personal experiences, members play different roles. 
It is therefore necessary for members of every leading organ to 
learn from one another's strong points and offset any 
weaknesses. Only by so doing will we be able to create a 
unifying force, fully develop collective superiority, and lead 
the broad masses of the cadres and people to overcome all types 
of difficulties and push Guanghan's economic development onto a 
new stage.

  [Text] Kunming, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Yunnan People's 
Broadcasting Station has started sending out family planning 
programs in five languages of minority nationalities. 
  The five-tongue programs take up eight hours a day. They 
include the languages of the Dai nationality in Dehong 
Prefecture and Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Jingpo nationality, 
Lahu nationality and Lisu nationality. 
  Yunnan Province has 25 minority nationalities, with 12.34 
million people, accounting for one third of the total population. 
  Since the 1970s, the minority nationalities in Yunnan 
Province have come to realize the connection between raising the 
quality of life and carrying out family planning policies. 
  According to the fourth national census in 1990, in the 
eight 
years from 1982 to 1990, the growth rate of the minority 
nationalities in the country was 34.8 percent, but the rate in 
Yunnan Province was about 19.6 percent. 
  Dong Xiuying, a chief editor at the Department of Minority 
Nationalities of Yunnan broadcasting station, who is herself 
from the minority Va nationality, said that many of the ethnic 
people do not understand the Han language and it was necessary 
to start broadcasting these programs in their own languages. 
  There are eight autonomous prefectures of minority 
nationalities in Yunnan. The broadcasting stations in four of 
the prefectures, including Dehong, Xishuangbanna, Nujiang and 
Diqing, also started ethnic language programs.

  [Text] Siqu grain shop in Hepingli which was very old and 
shabby one month ago has now been newly furnished. The workers 
there were full of spirit and joy to welcome the visit of Chen 
Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee. This small 
grain shop has changed greatly in the short span of one month. 
  As soon as Chen Xitong entered the grain shop yesterday, he 
first found female worker Lu Wenmei who had complained tearfully 
that the grain shop suffered deficits and the workers received a 
low income last month and said to her cordially: Thank you for 
speaking the truth. You have made us realize the actual 
situation and pay more attention to helping money-losing 
enterprises "shake off poverty." This time you must also speak 
the truth. What is the situation now? Lu Wenmei grimed from ear 
to ear and said emotionally: Thank you for your kind concern; 
the grain shop has changed completely; everybody here is full of 
enthusiasm for work and have the confidence to work hard to 
bring about an upsurge. 
  While inspecting sanitation work on 21 last moth, Chen 
Xitong, Zhang Baifa, and Ouyang Wenan suddenly changed the 
district authorities' schedule to make a spot check on this 
grain shop. At that time, Lu Wenmei reflected tearfully the 
actual difficulties in the living standards of workers of this 
grain shop. According to Dongcheng District's investigation, 
about one-third of this kind of grain shop suffered deficits. 
Chen Xitong was very concerned about this and instructed 
Dongcheng District to devise plans to solve this problem within 
a month. Thus, efforts to make major breakthroughs of strategic 
significance in realizing the goal of becoming well-off ahead of 
schedule began. 
  Dongcheng District and the government immediately 
established 
a work group to study and formulate the initial plan for making 
"Hepingli grain shop and all money-losing grain shops in the 
whole district shake off poverty and become comparatively 
well-off" along with the district grain bureau and Hepingli Siqu 
grain shop. The newly appointed manager of Siqu grain shop did 
not go home for a week. He studied with workers ways to reform 
and invigorate the grain shop, to shake off poverty, and to 
become prosperous. They raised 50,000 yuan to refurnish and 
renovate the shop, increase operational facilities, and improve 
the shopping environment. Internally, this shop implemented the 
operational and job contracting system and shared the contract 
base figure to all operational groups. After implementing the 
contract system, this grain shop, in addition to ensuring grain 
and cereal oil supply, also carried out diversified 
undertakings, added some new service items, increased 
commodities like bread, small packages of miscellaneous grains, 
and daily necessities to over 190 varieties, and set aside a 
part of the shop to run a restaurant. This small shop put on a 
new look and generated a business volume of 7,000 yuan in three 
days, doubling that of the previous month, and enabled the 
income of workers to greatly increase. 
  At a forum following the investigation and study, Dongcheng 
District grain bureau gave a work briefing on helping the 
money-losing grain shops shake off poverty and become 
prosperous. During the past month, all grain enterprises 
conducted general discussions on how to emancipate the mind and 
reach a common understanding: After the decontrol of grain and 
cereal oil prices, they failed to make their business keep pace 
with the situation, and their ideology basically remained at the 
level of complaining, laying bare the difficulties, and asking 
for policies from the higher levels. It is necessary to carry 
out the socialist market economy in the course of development. 
It is impossible for us to return to the old track of the 
planned economy and to lead a life by relying on state 
subsidies. It is also impossible for the state to make us 
prosperous by giving subsidies. Therefore, we must cut off the 
road to retreat and blaze a new trial. The district grain 
bureau and grain management office have urged all cadres to each 
give an order to change the outlook of 42 money-losing grain 
shops in the district in line with Siqu grain shop's 
requirements of shaking off poverty and becoming prosperous. 
According to the briefings of the district party committee and 
government, the grain enterprises should take the lead in this 
work, consider helping poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools 
and households shake off poverty and become prosperous as a 
strategic issue, accelerate the development of the whole 
district, and realize the goal of becoming well-off ahead of 
schedule. 
  During the forum, Executive Vice Mayor Wang Baosen said: The 
municipal party committee and government have been greatly 
concerned about the low income issue of workers. The economic 
departments dealing with comprehensive work should study the 
experience of Dongcheng District, emancipate the mind, deepen 
reform, help the poor shake off poverty and become prosperous, 
do more practical things for the masses, and care for and make 
good arrangements for the living of low income workers, 
particularly before the Spring Festival period. 
  Ouyang Wenan, member of the standing committee of the 
municipal party committee, said: The low income issue of 
workers has a bearing on social stability and becoming well-off 
ahead of schedule. It is necessary to conscientiously conduct 
investigation and study and devise specific measures for solving 
this issue. 
  Chen Xitong also gave a speech, in which he said: It makes 
me happy to see the improvements of this grain shop today. The 
Dongcheng party committee and government have realistically 
regarded solving the low income issue of workers as a major 
task, and showing that they have kept the people and workers in 
mind. Making breakthroughs in Siqu grain shop, promoting this 
experience to the whole district, and helping poverty-stricken 
shops, plants, schools, and households shake off poverty and 
become prosperous is a good method. We have great hopes for 
realizing the goal of becoming well-off ahead of schedule. 
  Chen Xitong said: Workers of grain enterprises across the 
municipality have done much hard work in conscientiously 
implementing the plans of the party Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the municipal party committee and government, which 
showed that this contingent has awareness, has observed 
discipline, and is trustworthy. He thanked and saluted the 
grain enterprises on behalf of the municipal party committee and 
government. 
  Chen Xitong fully affirmed Dongcheng District grain bureau's 
effort in emancipating the mind while tuning out the 
disparities, freeing itself from the ideological shackle of 
complaints, laying bare the difficulties, and asking for help 
from the higher level, enhancing spirit, and in particular, 
recognizing that it is no longer possible to return to the old 
track of the planned economy to lead a life of relying on state 
subsidies and that it is no longer possible for the state to 
make the grain enterprises become well-off by providing 
subsidies. By doing so, this grain bureau has grasped a key 
point. When we have a leap forward in ideology and hope in our 
work, we will be able to find a way to shake off poverty and 
become well-off. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: The Dongcheng District party 
committee and government have made a good start in 
conscientiously studying plans and measures for solving the low 
income issue of workers. All districts and counties across the 
municipality and all departments should study and use Dongcheng 
District's method for reference, devote energy to 
conscientiously conducting investigation and study, grasp 
typical cases, make breakthroughs in some major aspects, and 
solve the problem of the poverty-stricken shops, plants, 
schools, and households. He stressed: Mountainous areas and 
housing and low income issues of workers constitute the most 
difficult points in Beijing's realization of its goal of 
becoming well-off ahead of schedule. He called on leaders of 
the party committees and governments at all levels across the 
municipality and all departments to get moving and go to the 
mountainous areas and poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools, 
and household, and conscientiously conduct investigation and 
study to change this situation. All leaders should always think 
about what they have done to solve poverty-related issues, and 
should visit not only the prosperous areas but also the 
poverty-stricken areas. Under an excellent situation, we must 
never forget that there are also some fairly poor areas. We 
should conscientiously conduct investigation and study, support 
and help the poor, bring about a better situation, and let more 
people see the superiority of socialism and feel the concern of 
the party and the government. The Spring Festival will come 
very soon. We must show concern for the poor households and let 
them spend the Spring Festival happily. This is a most 
practical and good thing we should do.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- In an important 
speech to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission 
for Discipline Inspection [CCDI] this morning, Jiang Zemin, 
general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, stressed: The 
aim of the fight against corruption is, in the final analysis, 
to consolidate and strengthen the party's ties with the masses 
under the new situation and consolidate the CPC position as the 
ruling party so that it will be able to shoulder in a still 
better manner the important historical mission of leading 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization 
  Also present at today's meeting were Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, 
Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao, Zhang Zhen, Ren Jianxin, 
Chen Muhua, Chi Haotain, Li Guixian, Luo Gan, Zhang Siqing, and 
Wu Xueqian. 
  Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and secretary of the CCDI, presided over the meeting. 
  Jiang Zemin said: This CCDI plenary session is very 
necessary to sum up the anticorruption drive in the previous 
period and make plans for the next stage in accordance with the 
Central Committee's suggestions. Comrade Wei Jianxing delivered 
a very good report to the session. I'm in full agreement. We 
should redouble our efforts and make new progress on top of the 
achievements already made. 
  Assessing the anticorruption efforts in the previous stage, 
Jiang Zemin said: There are four points that should be 
stressed: First, we have been fairly successful and achieved, 
by and large, the expected results. Thanks to the common 
efforts of all quarters, we have achieved varying degrees of 
success in the three tasks set by the Central Committee for the 
near future. The results are even more pronounced in localities 
and departments that have done a better job in implementing this 
work. Facts have shown that although the anticorruption drive 
involves considerable difficulties, we are able to cut, step by 
step, corrupt phenomena to a minimum so long as the leadership 
takes it seriously, enlists the participation of the masses, and 
works together with them with one heart and one mind. Second, 
the work has proceeded in a healthy manner. In setting the 
short-term plan for fighting corruption, the Central Committee 
pronounced a number of specific principles and policies which 
have fundamentally guaranteed that this work will be closely 
integrated with reform and construction. Practice has shown 
that this work has -- rather than standing in the way of reform 
and construction -- served as an important guarantee for reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. Third, judging from the 
problems that have been exposed, corrupt phenomena are serious. 
We must continue our efforts with determination. Fourth, the 
tasks are tremendous and we must not slacken our efforts. In 
view of the actual problems that are out there and the people's 
demands of us, the work we have done so far falls considerably 
short. Many problems have not been solved well and the masses 
remain dissatisfied. We must continue to pay close attention to 
the anticorruption drive. In short, we must affirm the 
achievements, take note of the problems, sum up experience, keep 
a clear head, and redouble our efforts to implement the 
anticorruption drive well. 
  Speaking of the next stage of the anticorruption drive, 
Jiang 
Zemin pointed out: The Central Committee has set the basic 
policy and overall requirements for the work of the whole party 
in 1994. The anticorruption drive must subordinate and serve 
these basic principles and overall requirements and it must be 
implemented in a deepgoing, sustained, and more effective 
manner. This is the general requirement. It can't be expected 
that the anticorruption drive will be completed in a single 
battle. Rather, we should solve the problems one by one, 
investigate the cases one by one, deepen the drive step by step, 
and push it forward phase by phase. We should be prepared to 
fight a prolonged war. We must not slacken our efforts to the 
slightest degree; we must never provide a "pliable environment" 
for corrupt behavior; and we must never allow the corrupt 
elements to act willfully and get off scot-free. In addition to 
the three main tasks set by the Central Committee last August, 
the current session has put forward some new requirements. All 
localities and departments must earnestly carry them out. Those 
departments or localities that did pay adequate attention to 
this work in the previous stage must bestir themselves and catch 
up. 

    Jiang Zemin said: We gained an important experience 
from the anticorruption drive in the early period; namely, we 
must firmly believe and rely on the masses and must combine the 
arousing of the masses to report corruption cases to the 
authorities with the special organs' investigating them 
according to law. We must continue to adhere to this 
experience. We must resolutely conduct a thorough investigation 
of the corruption problems exposed, especially the big and 
important cases, and sternly deal with them. We must pay 
attention to policies and stress focal points when rectifying 
unhealthy practices and fighting corruption. While launching 
the anticorruption drive, we must make improvement and build the 
party as well as a clean and honest government; we must address 
the issue by looking into both its root cause and symptoms. We 
must conscientiously sum up experiences and lessons by directing 
our efforts in this connection against the problems exposed and 
the loopholes existing in control, rules, and regulations; we 
must improve our rules and regulations, strengthen control, and 
resolutely get rid of bureaucracy. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: The key to launching an in-depth and 
sustained drive against corruption more effectively lies in 
strengthening leadership. The party committees and governments 
at all levels must properly handle the relationship between 
reform and development and between development and stability; 
they must firmly grasp the central task of economic 
construction; they must persist in attaching equal importance to 
two types of work [promote reform and opening up and, at the 
same time, crack down on all kinds of criminal activities]; they 
must make overall plans and take all factors into consideration; 
and they must successfully integrate the anticorruption drive 
with deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, 
and maintaining stability. Principal party and government 
leaders must personally handle the task and solve important 
problems. They must support the work of discipline inspection, 
supervisory, and judicial organs and coordinate the 
relationships between all departments concerned so as to join 
forces and promote in-depth development of the anticorruption 
drive. 
  In his speech, Jiang Zemin called on the whole party to 
further consolidate and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties 
between the party and the masses of the people. He said: The 
ties between the party and the masses of the people is a 
fundamental political issue that has a bearing on the success of 
the party's cause and on the matter of its life and death. This 
principle must be stressed repeatedly; the alarm must be sounded 
for a long time to make sure that all comrades of the party 
attach a high degree of importance to it. Our party represents 
the people to take control of political power; all its 
activities are conducted for the sake of protecting and 
fulfilling the interests of the broad masses of the people. If 
we fail to strengthen the ties between the party and the masses 
of the people, do not pay attention to eliminating the phenomena 
of divorcing ourselves from the masses, and let corruption 
spread unchecked, we would lose popular sympathy. We must 
resolutely criticize and correct various mistakes of divorcing 
ourselves from the masses. The masses are the source of our 
strength; the mass line and mass viewpoint are our cherished 
heritage. The vast numbers of cadres and, in particular, 
leading cadres must study hard the Marxist mass viewpoint, 
adhere to the party's mass line, constantly immerse themselves 
among the masses, and improve their ideological and work style 
in a down-to-earth manner. They are a necessity not only for 
implementing the party's line, principles, and policies, but 
also for successfully fulfilling various tasks, for continuously 
remolding world outlook, and for resisting corruption and 
preventing [peaceful] evolution. So far as Communists are 
concerned, the issues of stand, ideology, and feelings are 
fundamental ones. When communists divorce themselves from the 
masses, are indifferent to the masses' weal and woe, and become 
apathetic, their thinking will inevitably degenerate and it 
becomes hard for them to avoid corruption in action. 
  At last, Jiang Zemin said: The current situation in the 
whole country is very good. However, we must be aware that some 
contradictions and problems still confront us in our march 
forward and that some destabilizing factors still exist in 
society. We must attach a high degree of importance to these 
issues and must not lower our guard. Leading cadres at all 
levels and, in particular, principal leading cadres must 
personally take a hand in successfully solving the conspicuous 
problems in their own local areas. The tasks undertaken by the 
party committees and governments at all levels are very heavy. 
They must steadfastly rely on party organizations at all levels 
and on the masses. The party and its cadres must work together 
with the masses with one mind to maintain political stability; 
to create a favorable social environment; to accelerate the 
establishment of a socialist market economy; to maintain 
sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development [bao

and to promote smooth progress of the undertaking to build 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Today's meeting was held at the Great Hall of the People. 
Comrades in charge of all departments of the organs directly 
under the CPC Central Committee, comrades in charge of all CPC 
Central Committee organs and state organs, and comrades 
attending the All- Army Discipline Inspection Work Conference 
also participated in the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Statistical Communique of the State Statistical Bureau of </F>
the PRC on 1993 National Economic and Social Development (28 
February 1994)" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- In 1993, all 
localities and departments implemented thoroughly the guidelines 
of the 14th CPC National Congress, taking new steps in reform, 
opening up and the modernization drive, and scoring positive 
results in strengthening macro-economic regulation and control. 
As a result, the national economy grew rapidly and in a 
sustained way, the living standard continued to improve, and 
social undertakings further advanced. Preliminary statistics 
indicate that the total value of gross domestic product [GDP] 
was 3,138 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the previous year. 
Of this, the value-added [zeng jia zhi 1073 0502 0237] of the 
second industry was 1,624.5 billion yuan, up 20.4 percent; and 
of the tertiary industry was 848.5 billion yuan, up 9.3 percent. 
The major problems in the economic performance were: high 
market price rises, an overextended scale of investment in fixed 
assets; and the incompatibility of development of basic 
industries and infrastructure with the demand of rapid national 
economic growth. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  A good harvest was registered in agricultural production; 
and 
farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery continued to 
develop. The value-added of the agricultural sector for the 
whole year was 665 billion yuan, up 4 percent over 1992. 
  Of the major farm products, the output of grain and 
oil-bearing crops was an all-time high; bumper harvests were 
again registered, but the output of cotton and sugar-bearing 
crops dropped. 
  The output of major farm products was as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  New success was made in forestry and afforestation. The new 
afforested area in 1993 was 88.33 million mu. The afforestation 
quality was improved; notable progress was made in key state 
afforestation projects; and the work to prevent forest fires and 
control plant diseases and insect pests was strengthened. An 
increase was made in both the afforested area and the amount of 
forest reserves, and the forest cover rate continued to rise. 
  Animal husbandry developed steadily, and the production of 
meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and other animal products, as well as 
the amount of livestock, continued to grow. 

    The output of major animal products and livestock 
inventories was as follows:

  Continued increase was registered in the production of 
aquatic products. the output of aquatic products in 1993 was 
17.85 million tonnes, up 14.6 percent over 1992. Of this total, 
the output of freshwater products was 7.41 million tonnes, up 
18.9 percent and that of marine products was 10.44 million 
tonnes, up 11.9 percent. Agricultural production conditions 
were further improved. By the end of 1993, the aggregate power 
of the country's farm machinery reached 318 million kw, an 
increase of 4.8 percent over the figure at the end of 1992. 
There were 720,000 large and medium tractors, a drop of 5.3 
percent; 7.84 million small and walking tractors, up 4.4 
percent; 680,000 heavy-duty trucks, up 6.3 percent; and 
irrigation and drainage equipment with a total power capacity of 
75.45 million kw, up 2.8 percent. Rural consumption of 
electricity was 125.3 billion kwh, up 13.2 percent. However, 
unauthorized occupation of 
cropland remained serious, impeding the steady growth of 
agricultural production. 
<H5>  II. Industry and Construction </H5>
  Industrial production continued to grow at high speed. The 
completed value-added industrial output for the whole year was 
1,414 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent. In the total industrial 
growth, the growth of state enterprises was 6.4 percent; of 
collective enterprises, 28.6 percent, including 41.3 percent 
increase from industries run by townships; and of Sino-foreign 
joint ventures, cooperative and solely foreign-owned 
enterprises, 46.2 percent. The increase of large and medium 
enterprises was 14.1 percent, maintaining the momentum of steady 
growth. 
  Light and heavy industries developed in an all-round way. 
The value added output of light industry for the whole year was 
660 billion yuan, up 19.9 percent over 1992; that of heavy 
industry was 745 billion yuan, up 22.2 percent. Due to 
fluctuations of market demand, there were both increases and 
decreases in major industrial products.

  Industrial economic efficiency showed some improvement. The 
composite economic efficiency index of industrial enterprises 
rose from 89.5 in the previous year to 96.6 in 1993. Of this, 
the sales rate of industrial products rose from 95.5 percent to 
96.4 percent, the profit and tax rate on capital increased from 
10.1 percent to 10.6 percent, the profit-cost ratio climbed from 
4.2 percent to 4.7 percent, and the turnover rate of working 
capital increased from 1.66 times to 1.71 times. Overall labor 
productivity, calculated in terms of added value, increased 19.8 
percent. The rate of added industrial value, however, decreased 
0.6 percentage point from the year earlier. The proportion of 
deficit-ridden state-owned enterprises climbed from 26.4 percent 
to 30.3 percent, with increased amounts of losses. 
  The construction industry continued to make rapid progress 
in 
production and management. The construction industry's added 
value for the entire year was 210.5 billion yuan, up 15 percent 
from the previous year. The floor space of houses built by 
state-owned construction enterprises totaled 305 million square 
meters [sq m], an increase of 17.8 percent, with completed floor 
space exceeding 100 million sq m. Overall labor productivity 
rose 8.5 percent from the previous year, and per capita profits 
and taxes totaled 900 yuan, an increase of 4 percent. 
  New headway was made in geological surveys. In 1993, 166 new 
major mineral sites were discovered or verified as containing 
industrial deposits, new major discoveries were made in 90 
mining areas where surveys were conducted, and 30 minerals were 
found to have increased proven reserves. Of these reserves, 
coal, iron, copper, and bauxite ores totaled 763 million tonnes, 
145 million tonnes, 2.58 million tonnes (metal), and 75.86 
million tonnes, respectively. The geological survey industry 
completed 7.5 million meters of machine core drilling work. 
<H5>  III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  Investment in fixed assets grew rapidly. Completed 
investment in fixed assets throughout society for the entire 
year totaled 1,182.9 billion yuan, an increase of 50.6 percent 
(22 percent in real terms after being adjusted for price 
increases) from the previous year. Of this, investment by 
state-owned units, collectively owned units, and urban and rural 
residents totaled 832.1 billion yuan, 209.2 billion yuan, and 
141.6 billion yuan, respectively, representing increases of 57.8 
percent, 53.9 percent, and 15.8 percent. Of the investment by 
state-owned units, the amounts for capital construction 
projects, technical upgrading and transformation, the 
construction of commercial buildings, and projects in other 
fields totaled 464.7 billion yuan, 219.2 billion yuan, 113.8 
billion yuan, and 34.4 billion yuan, representing increases of 
54.2 percent, 50.1 percent, 124.9 percent, and 17 percent 
respectively. The overall investment scale for fixed assets 
under construction, however, was overextended, and the 
investment structure was not very rational. The total planned 
investment by state-owned units in capital construction projects 
and in technical upgrading and transformation stood at 2,327.1 
billion yuan at year's end, up 41.5 percent from the end of the 
previous year. Excluding completed volume, outstanding 
investment volume at year's end totaled 1,320 billion yuan, an 
increase of 60 percent. 
  Of the investment by state-owned units, the amount for 
primary industry totaled 15.8 billion yuan, up 19.6 percent from 
the previous year, with the investment proportion declining from 
2.8 percent to 2.2 percent. Investment in secondary industry 
amounted to 385 billion yuan, up 37.1 percent, with the 
investment proportion decreasing from 58.9 percent to 53.6 
percent. Of this, the investment proportion for the energy and 
raw and semifinished materials sectors dropped from 39.5 percent 
to 35.6 percent. Investment in tertiary industry was 317.5 
billion yuan, up 73.7 percent, with the investment proportion 
increasing from 38.3 percent to 44.2 percent. Of this, 
investment in the communications and transportation sector and 
in postal and telecommunications services expanded 
substantially, with the investment proportion rising from 14.7 
percent to 20.2 percent. There were, however, too many 
construction projects related to expensive office buildings, 
auditoriums, and guesthouses, as well as luxury villas, vacation 
complexes, and recreational facilities. 
  Large and medium capital construction projects completed and 
put into operation throughout the year numbered 133, and 
above-quota technical upgrading and transformation projects 
totaled 128. Key projects completed and put into operation 
mainly included Shanxi's No. 2 Shentou Power Plant with a 
generating capacity of 1 million kw, Wuxi's Ligang Electric 
Power Limited Company with a generating capacity of 700,000 kw, 
the laying of an additional 309.7 km of track along the trunk 
line of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang multiple track, the laying of an 
additional 143.9 km of track along the trunk line of the 
Zhejiang-Jiangxi multiple track, the first-stage project in 
Qingdao's Qianwan harbor with a freight-handling capacity of 15 
million tonnes, Shanghai's 300,000-tonne ethylene project, the 
Luoyang General Petrochemical Plant capable of processing 5 
million tonnes of crude oil annually, and Changchun's Shuangyang 
Cement Plant with an annual cement output of 660,000 tonnes. 

    New increases in production capacity of the whole nation 
through capital construction projects in 1993 included: 8 
million tonnes of coal, 14.38 million kw of power, 15.42 million 
tonnes of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas (both 
including the capacity through technical updating projects and 
investment in other types of projects), 1 million tonnes of iron 
ore, 235,000 cubic meters of timber, 1.92 million tonnes of 
cement, 274 km of railways, 553 km of double-tracked railways, 
192 km of electrified railways, 37.52 million tonnes of 
cargo-handling capacity of harbors, and 3,556 km of highways, of 
which 493 km were superhighways. 
<H5>  IV. Transport, Posts and Telecommunications </H5>
  The transportation and communications, posts and 
telecommunications sector grew steadily. The increased value 
for the whole year was 166.1 billion yuan, up 7.5 percent over 
1992. However, in railway transportation the problem caused by 
"bottleneck" restrictions was still serious, and there was a 
further drop in rate of availability of carriages. [A service 
message transmitted by XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 
1707 GMT on 28 February instructs that the two paragraphs 
starting from "IV. Transport, Posts" to "availability of 
carriages." be deleted]

  The development of posts and telecommunication service 
accelerated, with business volume growing by 24 billion yuan, up 
55 percent over 1992. The total post and telecommunication 
business volume in 1993 was 46.1 billion yuan, an increase of 
58.9 over 1992. The growth rate of radio paging and mobile 
telephone services exceeded 100 percent. Telephone service 
became a consumer item of ordinary resident households. By the 
end of 1993 the number of telephone-using households was 7.826 
million, up 367,200 households over the same period in 1992. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Commerce and Market Prices </H5>
  The domestic consumer goods market was brisk. The total 
value of retail sales of consumer goods in 1993 was 1,223.7 
billion yuan, up 26.1 over 1992 (a real growth of 11.6 percent 
if price increase is deducted). Of the total retail sales of 
consumer goods, the sales in cities totaled 717.6 billion yuan, 
up 31.2 percent over 1991, and those in rural areas were 506.1 
billion yuan, up 19.5 percent. 
  Analyzed from the sale of various categories of consumer 
goods, a steady growth was registered in food. Of which, sales 
of edible vegetable oil were up 7.1 percent, aquatic products 5 
percent, and liquor 4 percent, grain, but those of grain, pork, 
fish, and sugar were down by various degrees. Among clothing 
items, the sale of cotton cloth was about the same as that in 
1992, whereas the sales of other garments rose 16.1 percent. 
The sales of woolen and silk fabrics were down 3.6 and 4.4 
percent respectively. Growth by various degrees was scored in 
the sale of all durable consumer goods, except for electric 
fans, black-and-white TV sets, and bicycles. Of the sales of 
durable consumer goods, those of color TV sets were up 17.4 
percent, audio recorders 8.9 percent, video recorders 6 percent, 
cameras 6.5 percent, washing-machines 22.1 percent, and 
refrigerators 23.9 percent. 
  The capital goods market was brisk. In 1993 the total 
purchase of means of production by material supply and market 
enterprises at and above the county level was 742.3 billion 
yuan, up 34.6 over 1992, while sales totalled 779.6 billion 
yuan, up 32.2. However, the total retail sales of means of 
production for agriculture in 1993 were 135.6 billion yuan, or a 
real decline of 7.8 percent if price increases are deducted. 
  Price reform was further deepened. In 1993, the state 
further accelerated price reform, decontrolled the prices of 
most steel products and a portion of coal earmarked for unified 
distribution, raised the prices of railroad transportation and 
electric power, decontrolled the prices of cement earmarked for 
unified distribution, raised the prices of crude oil, and 
continued to decontrol the purchasing and selling prices of 
grain. These price readjustment measures played an important 
role in changing the condition of prices of basic products and 
infrastructural facilities remaining low for many years and in 
promoting the formation of a market mechanism. 
  Market prices rose by a big margin. In particular, prices in 
large and medium cities soared, and the growth in the prices of 
services was even higher.

<H5>  VI. Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  The scale of imports and exports expanded. Customs 
statistics showed that in 1993, the value of exports was $91.8 
billion, up 8 percent over 1992, while the value of imports was 
$104.00 billion, up 29 percent. Further improvement was made in 
the structure of import and export trade. Of the products 
exported, the share of machinery and electrical products rose 
from 23 in 1992 to 24.7 percent, while the ratio of traditional 
primary products dropped considerably. Of the products 
imported, the share of raw and semifinished materials, 
machinery, and transportation equipment in short supply in China 
rose by a clear margin. Exports of foreign-invested enterprises 
grew by a large margin, with an annual export volume of $25.24 
billion, up 45.4 percent over 1992, and its share in total 
exports rose from 20.4 percent in 1992 to 27.5 percent. Their 
annual exports exceeded imports by $4.6 billion if goods whose 
payments were not paid in foreign exchange are excluded. 
  Large increases were scored in the utilization of foreign 
capital. In 1993, China signed new agreements on the 
utilization of foreign capital which involved a total of $122.7 
billion, an increase of 76.7 percent over the previous year; 
foreign capital actually used during 1993 was $36.77 billion, up 
91.5 percent. Of this total $122.7 billion, $110.9 billion was 
in the form of contracted direct foreign investment, and the 
actual investment realized in 1993 was $25.76 billion, up 90.7 
percent and 130 percent, respectively. By the end of 1993, the 
number of registered foreign-invested enterprises in China was 
167,500, or 83,100 more than at the end of 1992. 
  Noticeable progress was made in economic and technical 
cooperation with foreign countries. In 1993, construction and 
labor projects contracted by China with foreign countries 
totalled $6.77 billion, up 2.8 percent over 1992, and business 
revenue reached $4.52 billion, up 48.2 percent over 1992. 
  International tourism generated good results. In 1993, 41.53 
million tourists from foreign countries, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
Macao, as well as overseas Chinese, visited our country for 
purposes of travel and visits and to engage in commercial and 
other activities. This was up 9 percent from a year earlier. 
Foreign exchange income from tourism totaled $4.68 billion, up 
18.7 percent. 
<H5>  VII. Banking and Insurance </H5>
  In 1993, the banking sector earnestly implemented the 
central 
guidelines on tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation 
and control, implemented stable monetary policies, promptly 
redressed problems in banking work, and made great efforts to 
attact savings deposits while containing the overextended fixed 
assets investment scale, curtailing the relatively large money 
supply, and maintaining currency stability. It also increased 
input in credit without delay; readjusted the credix mix; 
guaranteed funds to satisfy the reasonable demands of key state 
construction projects, industrial and agricultural production, 
and the procurement of farm and sideline products; alleviated 
the shortage of working capital in some key enterprises; and 
effectively supported sustained, rapid, and healthy national 
economic development. 
  By the end of 1993, various savings deposits in state banks 
totaled 2324.5 billion yuan, 433.9 billion yuan more than at the 
end of the year earlier, or an increase of 23 percent. Of these 
deposits, 767.2 billion yuan were savings of enterprises and 
1,476.4 billion yuan were urban and rural savings deposits, 
which were 85.59 billion yuan and 321.9 billion yuan, 
respectively, more than at the end of the previous year, 
representing increases of 12.6 percent and 27.9 percent. The 
amount of various bank loans totaled 2,646.1 billion yuan, 484.6 
billion yuan more than at the end of the previous year, or an 
increase of 22.4 percent. Of these, loans for use as working 
capital totaled 1,868.9 billion yuan, up 19.5 percent, while 
those for fixed assets investment amounted to 517.1 billion 
yuan, up 31.7 percent. By the end of 1993, the amount of 
currency in circulation amounted to 586.5 billion yuan, an 
increase of 35.3 percent from a year earlier. The amount of 
money put into circulation totaled 152.9 billion yuan, and the 
M-2 -- the broad gauge of money supply -- showed an increase of 
24 percent from the preceding year. 
  The country's foreign exchange reserves increased. By the 
end of 1993, the country's cash reserves stood at $21.2 billion 
(excluding the People's Bank of China's foreign exchange 
reserves), an increase of $1.76 billion from the beginning of 
the year. 
  The insurance business developed further. In 1993, property 
insurance coverage totaled 5,137.2 billion yuan nationwide, up 
12.6 percent from a year earlier. Nationwide, 776,000 
enterprises bought enterprise property insurance, 130 million 
residents took out household property insurance, and 250 million 
people purchased personal insurance. Insurance companies 
handled 6.903 million cases of compensation pertaining to 
domestic property insurance, paying out 13.7 billion yuan in 
indemnities and 9.1 billion yuan in insured money to 6.64 
million people covered by personal insurance. 
<H5>  VIII. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>
  The ranks of scientists and technical personnel expanded. By 
the end of 1993, state-owned enterprises and institutions had 
25.51 million professional and technical personnel of all types, 
an increase of 2.3 percent from the end of the previous year. 
Nationwide, state-owned independent research and development 
institutes at and above the county level numbered 5,852, 
scientific research institutes run by colleges and universities 
totaled 3,000, and scientific research institutes run by large 
and medium industrial enterprises numbered 10,200. A total of 
2.345 million people engaged in scientific and technological 
activities, of whom 1.373 million were scientists and engineers. 
  Financial input in science and technology increased. In 
1993, funds spent by scientific and technological institutes, 
colleges and universities, and large and medium industrial 
enterprises on scientific and technological activities totaled 
56.3 billion yuan nationwide, up 33.7 percent from the previous 
year. Of this, research and development spending amounted to 
19.6 billion yuan, representing an increase of 16 percent and 
0.62 percent of the gross domestic product. 

    Science and technological work developed dynamically. In 
1993, 33,000 major scientific and technological results at or 
above the provincial and ministerial levels were achieved. Of 
these results, 781 were awarded by the state, of which 175 won 
the state's invention awards, 52 won the state's natural science 
awards, 441 won the state's scientific and technological 
progress awards, and 113 won the state's spark awards. In the 
same year, 77,000 domestic and foreign patent applications were 
accepted for examinations, of which 62,000 were granted patents 
-- respectively, 15 and 97 percent more than in the previous 
year. Four key state laboratories were built in 1993. As of 
the end of 1993, 52 state-level new- and high-technology 
industrial development zones had been approved for 
establishment, housing 14,000 new- and high-technology 
enterprises. 
  Further improvements were made in quality examination and 
testing, in standardization work, and in weather forecasting. 
In 1993, the country had 1,500 product quality monitoring 
centers, of which 233 were state examination and testing 
centers. In the same year, 1,411 state standards applying to 
various fields were established or revised, and 1,874 
ultra-shortwave transmitting stations for weather warning 
services were built across the country. 
  The country's technology markets were more active in 1993 -- 
246,000 technology contracts, with a total business amount of 
20.76 billion yuan, were signed in 1993, 4.4 and 37.4 percent 
more than the year before, respectively. 
  New progress was made in educational work in various fields 
and the ranks of the country's higher education continued to 
increase. In 1993, 42,000 graduate students were enrolled across 
the country, or 9,000 more than in the previous year; graduate 
students in schools totalled 107,000, or 13,000 more than in the 
year before. Ordinary schools of higher learning enrolled 
924,000 undergraduate students and students for professional 
training, 22.5 percent more than in the year before -- 
increasing the student total to 2.536 million, or 351,000 more 
than in the previous year. At the same time, secondary 
vocational and technical education continued to develop. In 
1993, there were 7.623 million students in secondary vocational 
and technical schools of various categories (including 1.739 
million students in technician training schools), accounting for 
53.7 percent of the total -- 14.19 million -- students at the 
senior middle school level. 
  Elementary education developed steadily in 1993 and new 
developments were made in popularizing 9-year compulsory 
education. In 1993, the country had 40.82 million junior middle 
school students and 124 million primary school students. About 
97.7 percent of children at the primary school age attended 
school, and the percentage of primary school graduates pursuing 
higher study increased from 79.7 in 1992 to 81.8 in 1993. The 
drop-out rates of ordinary junior middle school students and 
primary school students were 7.1 and 2.3 percent, respectively. 
  Enrollment of adult education students increased sharply and 
technical training in various forms developed dynamically. In 
1993, adult schools of higher learning enrolled 863,000 
undergraduate students and students for professional training 
(including students in ordinary classes of television, 
correspondence, and evening universities), an increase of 45.8 
percent over the year before -- increasing the student total to 
1.863 million, or 26 percent more than in the previous year. 
Students in adult secondary professional training schools 
totalled 2.068 million in 1993, an increase of 324,000 over the 
previous year. In 1993, adult technical training schools turned 
out 53.42 million graduates; 8.563 million students attended 
adult secondary and primary schools; and 5.482 million 
illiterate people received education. 
  Cultural undertakings continued to develop. By the end of 
1993, there were 2,723 art troupes, 2,897 cultural centers, 
2,585 public libraries, 1,116 museums, 3,585 archives, 983 radio 
broadcasting stations, 725 medium- and short-wave radio 
broadcasting and relay sites, 683 television stations, 1,085 
television transmitting and relaying sites, each with a capacity 
of over 1,000 watts, and 113,000 film-projection units 
throughout the country. In 1993, China produced 154 feature 
films and distributed 222 new (full-length) movies, 30 of which 
were awarded prizes at international film festivals. In 1993, 
national and provincial newspapers issued 19.9 billion copies, 
and 2.43 billion copies of magazines and 6.4 billion books were 
published in the whole year. 
  Steady progress was made in public health. By the end of 
1993, there were 2.795 million hospital beds in the country, up 
1.9 percent over the figure at the end of 1992. Full-time 
health workers numbered 4.117 million, up 1.1 percent, of whom 
1.832 million were doctors (including 1.373 doctors of 
traditional Chinese and Western medicine), up 1.3 percent, and 
1.056 million were hospital technicians and nurses, up 1.6 
percent. 
  Striking progress was made in sports. In 1993, Chinese 
athletes won 103 world championships in 18 events; 38 athletes 
and 7 teams broke 57 world records on 124 occasions; 81 athletes 
and 3 teams broke 81 Asian records on 242 occasions; 176 
athletes and 16 teams broke 173 national records on 368 
occasions. Participation in sporting events by ordinary people 
developed rapidly. The "National Standards for Physical 
Fitness" were implemented in nearly 89 percent of schools, with 
86 percent of the students meeting the requirements. 
<H5>  IX. Population and People's Life </H5>
  In 1993, the national birth rate was 18.09 per thousand, and 
the death rate was 6.64 per thousand, resulting in a natural 
growth rate of 11.45 per thousand. China's population was 
1,185.17 billion at the end of 1993, up 13.46 million over the 
figure at the end of 1992. 
  The income of residents increased steadily. In 1993, the 
annual per-capita income of urban residents that could be used 
for living expenses was 2,337 yuan, up 28 percent over 1992, or 
a real growth of 10.2 percent allowing for price rises. The 
per-capita net income of rural residents was 921 yuan, up 17.5 
percent over 1992, or a real growth of 3.2 percent allowing for 
price rises. However, the gap between incomes in different 
regions and in urban and rural areas widened, and the living 
standards of some residents declined. 
  Reform in the labor field was accelerated, and the 
employment 
service system was further improved. In 1993, the number of 
employment centers at various levels reached 13,000, and 7.05 
million people were given jobs in cities and towns. By the end 
of the year, the unemployment rate in cities and towns was 2.6 
percent. Some 128,000 unemployed staff and workers received 
livelihood relief funds from the state. Fairly significant 
progress was made in the contract labor system, and the number 
of workers employed by state enterprises on a contract basis was 
23.30 million, accounting for 21 percent of the total number of 
staff and workers employed by state enterprises in cities and 
towns. By the end of 1993, staff and workers in China numbered 
150.4 million, or 2.48 million more than at the end of 1992. 
There were 11.16 million individual workers or workers employed 
by private enterprises in cities and towns, 2.78 million persons 
more than at the end of 1992. 
  The wage level of workers and staff members improved 
further. 
In 1993, the total payroll of workers and staff members 
throughout the country was 477 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent 
from the preceding year. The average pay of workers and staff 
members was 3,236 yuan, an increase of 19.4 percent. 
  Living conditions in urban and rural areas continued to 
improve. In 1993, 266 million square meters and 570 million 
square meters of new residential buildings were built in urban 
and rural areas, respectively. 
  Social welfare services continued to develop. In 1993, there 
were 954,000 beds and 706,000 residents in various social 
welfare institutions nationwide. Recipients of state relief, 
who were the targets of various types of social relief, numbered 
40.51 million in urban and rural areas. Nationwide, 31.5 
percent of townships and towns established rural social security 
networks. Fairly rapid progress was made in establishing urban 
social service networks, resulting in the establishment of 
97,000 various community service facilities. The proportion of 
overall social planning for old-age insurance for workers and 
staff members continued to widen. 
  Environmental protection continued to develop at a faster 
pace. By the end of 1993, there were 81,000 people working in 
the national environmental protection sector. There were 2,290 
environmental monitoring stations at all levels and 33,000 
environmental monitors. Ten of the country's nature reserves 
joined the international reserve network, encompassing the human 
ecosystem and the biosphere. There were 77 state-level nature 
reserves. By the end of 1993, 313 environmental protection 
criteria were instituted, 2,935 smoke control zones covering 
10,492 square kilometers [sq km] were built in 472 cities 
throughout the country, and 1,774 zones which measured up to 
noise pollution standards and which covered 3,689 sq km were 
built in 363 cities. A total of 5,737 projects aimed at 
eliminating environmental pollution within specified periods of 
time were completed in 1993, with a total investment of 2.54 
billion yuan.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Central Bank To Cool Fixed </F>
Assets"] 
  [Text] The central bank plans to exercise stringent 
control over the money supply this year by reigning in 
fixed-asset loans and barring the Finance Ministry from dipping 
into its coffers. 
  The new policies aim to protect `sound' economic investment 
but still curb inflation, said Zhou Zhengqing, vice-governor of 
the People's Bank of China (PBC). 
  PBC views this as its primary role this year. 
  Meanwhile, China will also consider allowing foreign banks 
to 
do business in renminbi, Zhou said. But that will not come 
until domestic and foreign banks have equal tax systems. 
  The State Council has targeted fixed-asset investment, 
urging 
government departments to impose strict control over the 
ballooning sector. 
  "Without the government's approval, any specialized bank and 
financial institution will not be allowed to exceed their quota 
of fixed assets investment this year," Zhou noted. 
  And starting this year, the Finance Ministry is prohibited 
from overdrawing its PBC accounts or borrowing money from the 
bank to finance debt. 
  Deficits should now be met through issuing treasury bonds to 
the public, he added. 
  PBC will also strictly control loans to specialty banks and 
financial institutions. 
  China will try to diversify its loan system by broadening 
banks to include mortgage and discount loans. 
  Zhou said these measures will further serve the bank's 
effective control of the money market. 
  PBC will increase efforts to write rules governing 
commercial 
banks as part of the major task of converting the specialty 
banks, Zhou said. 
  But it still has a long way to go towards achieving this 
end, 
he added. 
  However, as the first step, three policy-lending banks will 
be created this year. They include the State Long-Term Credit 
Development Bank, the Import and Export Bank and the 
Agricultural Development Bank. 
  These banks will supply low-interest loans to support key 
industrial and agricultural projects, infrastructure 
construction programmes, and the purchase of grain, cotton and 
edible oil from farmers. 
  Zhou said that while implementing the State's demand of 
low-interest financing, these banks must be careful not to run 
in the red. 
  After the three banks are established, the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank and 
the Agricultural Bank of China will further commercialize their 
business. 
  Once these four specialized banks go commercial, they will 
compete directly with foreign banks in renminbi business. 
  Since the unification of the foreign exchange rate on 
January 
1, the renminbi's exchange rate against U.S. dollar has been 
stable at around 8.69 to 8.71.

  [Text] Beijing is set to announce tough measures this week 
to fight inflation by restoring price control on at least 24 
commodities and services. 
  And in what amounts to a setback to price reform, the State 
Planning Commission will be given more authority to ensure that 
prices will not rise beyond the ability of urban citizens to 
absorb the shock. 
  Informed sources said the commission would soon announce a 
system of inspection and supervision to stem urban inflation, 
which has reached more than 20 percent according to figures. 
  Under the new regulations, enterprises and commercial 
outlets 
that want to increase the prices of their products by up to 
eight percent will have to register the increase with their 
local Price Administration Bureau. 
  However, businesses which intend increasing prices beyond 
the 
eight percent ceiling -- or which plan to raise their prices 
more than once within a designated period -- will have to apply 
beforehand to the bureaus. 
  It is understood the commission has asked the bureaus to 
turn 
down most such applications through "outright denials of 
approval, persuasion, interference, and providing guidance" to 
the enterprises concerned. 
  Bureaus in all cities must report local price levels to a 
price coordinating centre at the commission twice a month. 
  The commission will be empowered to impose strict price 
ceilings on particular commodities and services should an 
emergency such as panic buying occur. 
  At least 24 commodities and services will be subjected to 
price control. They include foodstuffs like grain, oil, and 
vegetables, popular clothing items; consumer products such as 
colour television sets and bicycles; and services such as rent, 
water consumer electricity, and various types of transport. 
  The sources said it was the first time the Government had 
imposed controls on the services. Most cities will be asked to 
stockpile essential commodities, particularly grain and staple 
foodstuffs. 
  The sources added that before the National People's Congress 
(NPC) opened on March 10, the Government would announce two 
largescale, nation-wide price inspections. Analysts said 
Beijing was anxious to convince the populace inflation could be 
brought under ten per cent the goal for the mid-199Os. 
  They said the central Government had timed the announcement 
of the measures ahead of the NPC, where inflation, which was 
inching towards 30 percent in many cities, would likely become a 
contentious issue. Economic analysts in Beijing, however, 
indicated they were not optimistic that the price spiral could 
be controlled soon. A cut in credit would hurt state 
enterprises, and the analysts said Beijing could not deal with 
the political problems that would follow in the wake of the 
massive layoff of workers. Bank loans are scheduled to grow by 
at least 470 billion yuan (HK$471 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) 
this year, while the currency in circulation would expand by 180 
billion yuan. "Beijing has sacrificed price reform to fight 
inflation," said a Western diplomat. "Enterprise reform will 
also be dealt a blow as the powers earlier granted them to fix 
the prices of their products will be largely suspended."

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's electronics 
industry will keep developing at a fast pace of above 20 percent 
this year, and its production value will reach 170 billion yuan, 
a government minister disclosed here today. 
  Hu Qili, minister of electronics industry, said at the 
opening ceremony of the national electronics trade working 
conference, that the taxation and profits of the industry are 
expected to exceed ten billion yuan this year, which demands an 
increase of more than 18 percent. The taxed profits will climb 
over five billion yuan. 
  Party leader Liu Huaqing and Vice Premier Zou Jiahua sent 
letters of greetings to the meeting. They hoped that the 
electronic industry should enhance research effort and follow 
closely world advanced level so as to serve better the country's 
modernization drives. 
  According to Hu Qili, the industry will put more effort into 
developing export-oriented business. The export volume of 
electronics products will break through the ten billion U.S. 
dollars level. 
  Construction of major projects in the industry will be 
accelerated, such as large integrated circuit, mobile 
communication network and video recorder production. 
  China will also improve or establish ten to 15 various 
electronics research and development centers and major 
laboratories, in order to enhance the self-development ability 
of the industry and commercialize scientific research 
achievements. 
  He said computer and other communications products, which 
ask 
for state investment, will occupy 25 percent of the total of 
electronics products produced this year, compared with 22.4 
percent last year. 
  Production of some consumer goods, such as TV sets and video 
recorders, will be expanded and quality will be raised to a 
higher level. Development of micro-electronic products and 
new-type electronic components will witness sharp progress. 
  Hu also intimated that in 1993, China's electronics industry 
had utilized overseas contracted investment of 3.5 billion U.S. 
dollars. Overseas-funded enterprises in the trade reached 5,000. 
  According to statistics from the customs department, the 
export volume of electronics products totalled 8.11 billion U.S. 
dollars, up 18.1 percent over the previous year. 
  Overseas-funded enterprises found that their general export 
volume was 54.6 percent of the total, which amounted to 4.43 
billion U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> [First of seven lectures cosponsored by the State Economic </F>
and Trade Commission and the State General Administration of 
Taxation entitled "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' 
Implementation of the New Tax System," moderated by Xu Shanda, 
deputy director of the Tax Reform Department of the State 
General Aministration of Taxation; the first lecture is entitled 
"Introduction" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Video opens with shots showing three men and one 
woman seated at a long table in a room, then cuts to show the 
moderator introducing the three speakers. Video shows medium 
shots of the speakers when they are introduced and speak] [Xu] 
Viewers and friends: The program you are now watching is called 
"Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of 
the New Tax System." This program is being introduced to answer 
questions raised by taxpayers on how to further implement the 
new tax system. Now, I would like to introduce the leading 
comrades who are here today. This is Comrade Chen Qingtai, vice 
minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and this is 
Comrade Zhang Zhongcheng, chief economist of the State General 
Administration of Taxation. This is Comrade Jiang Qiangui, 
director of the Enterprise Department of the State Economic and 
Trade Commission. Now, I would like to ask Vice Minister Chen 
Qingtai to speak during the first lecture. 
  [Chen] Viewers and comrades: To further study and publicize 
the new tax system and new tax codes, and to promote a smooth 
transition from the old tax system to the new one, the State 
Economic and Trade Commission and the State General 
Administration of Taxation are cosponsoring this program called 
"Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of 
the New Tax System," with the assistance of China Central 
Television Station. It is common knowledge that the current 
reform of the tax system is of great intensity and covers a wide 
range of areas; it is a major measure for our country to 
establish macroeconomic regulation and control in a socialist 
market economy. Generally speaking, the new tax system has been 
implemented smoothly since it was introduced on 1 January, and 
no major problems have arisen. In specific areas, however, we 
have encountered one problem or another, and these problems 
require further efforts on our part. The first concerns our 
understanding of the new tax system. Some people, enterprises 
included, do not quite understand the new tax system. For 
example, they cannot clearly distinguish between taxes included 
in the calculated prices and those not included in those prices. 
They do not understand why the value-added tax should be 
counted as one not included in the calculated prices. Moreover, 
some problems have stemmed from distortions of the 
implementation process. Some localities and enterprises, for 
example, have not issued special invoices under various 
pretexts, thereby increasing the burden on enterprises further 
down the line in the taxation process. Also, the new tax system 
is very rich in content, and some problems arising from 
inadequate coordination exist in management and other specific 
areas. Besides, some special businesses have incurred 
additional tax burdens, and tax reduction and exemption policies 
have been abolished for other businesses as a consequence of the 
current reform of the tax system. These businesses find this 
hard to accept. We should seriously study these problems and 
solve them step by step. 
  It should be noted that the current reform of the tax system 
is the sum total of sweeping and structural changes. Speaking 
from the viewpoint of the state, we have the overall situation 
under control by maintaining the total tax burden of enterprises 
at the same level. Changes in tax categories, tax rates, tax 
calculation methods, and taxation sectors, however, have 
inevitably led to increased or decreased taxes for individual 
enterprises. Enterprises should understand and absorb such 
changes. Whether enterprises, which are the mainstay of our 
country's economic construction and development, understand and 
effectively implement the new tax system can affect the stable 
development of our economy as a whole; it is also a basic 
condition that determines whether our tax system can make the 
transition smoothly. Hence, on the one hand, we should redouble 
our efforts to publicize and study the new tax system so that 
enterprises can have a more profound understanding of it; on the 
other, we should constantly uncover and study problems, and 
adopt timely measures to ensure the smooth implementation of the 
new tax system. In dealing with people who take advantage of 
tax reform to increase prices in order to make exorbitant 
profits, the state should take action to mete out punishment, as 
necessary, in accordance with the law, after conducting 
inspections and exercising supervision. For their part, 
enterprises should thoroughly study the new tax codes, master 
the essence of those codes, and protect their legitimate rights 
and interests in accordance with the new tax codes. Moreover, 
enterprises should promptly bring to our attention, through 
normal channels, the lack of convergence and coordination 
between policies, laws, and regulations in the course of 
implementing the new tax system, in order to facilitate the 
solution of such problems. 
  Last year, we successively held three study classes for 
factory directors and managers on reform of the tax system. We 
studied and publicized the basic guidelines and major contents 
of reform of the tax system, and achieved some results in this 
respect. In holding those classes, we realized the problems 
that enterprises might encounter in the course of reforming the 
tax system, as well as problems that were of concern to them. 
Moreover, enterprises have brought to our attention new 
problems arising from this year's implementation of the new tax 
system. Therefore, we decided, after discussion, to introduce 
this special television program, to be presented in a 
question-and-answer format, with the main purpose of answering 
questions, in a single forum, concerning some problems that 
enterprises have encountered in implementing the new tax system, 
especially problems of a common nature. This will help people 
better understand the new tax system and facilitate its 
implementation. Besides, we are introducing this special 
program to promote an in-depth study and implementation of the 
new tax system nationwide. 

    [Xu] Well, now we will ask Chief Economist Zhang 
Zhongcheng of the State General Administration of Taxation to 
speak. 
  [Zhang] The new tax system to be implemented starting this 
year is a relatively complete and profound reform in the history 
of formulating the industrial and commercial tax system. It is 
also a relatively big adjustment in the structure of the tax 
system. The purpose of the current tax reform, to put it in 
short, is to establish a tax system to cope with the need for 
the development of a socialist market economy so as to better 
promote a sustained, fast and healthy development of the 
economy. The guiding principles for the current tax reform are 
as follows: First of all, the principles are to unify the tax 
law, levy tax in a fair manner, simplify the tax system, 
reasonably divide the jurisdiction in taxation, straighten up 
relations between the state and enterprises and between the 
state and individuals, and guarantee the state's revenue income. 
In the current reform of tax system, we have adhered to the 
fundamental principle of strengthening the central authorities' 
macrocontrol and whipping up the enthusiasm of both the central 
authorities and localities. Second, they are to levy tax in a 
fair manner to promote fair competition. Third, they are to 
simplify the tax system. I think we should mention one more 
important principle: that our current reform of tax system has 
followed the principle of maintaining the original level of 
total taxation of society on the subject of the tax burden. In 
other words, we will not increase the aggregate amount of taxes 
on enterprises because of the current reform of the tax system. 
The state revenue income also will not be reduced because of 
the reform of tax system. Basically, we will maintain the 
original level of total taxation of society. However, in the 
current reform, we have changed the tax rates by a great extent, 
in relative terms. Accordingly, it is quite possible that, 
among various enterprises, products and trade, the tax rate of 
some of the enterprises will be reduced, the tax burden of some 
of the enterprises will in the main remain the same, and the tax 
burden of a small number of enterprises may increase somewhat as 
compared with their tax burden before the reform. Therefore, on 
this question, we should implement the State Council's 
guidelines that those enterprises which will have a heavier tax 
burden should strive to change their operational mechanism and 
raise their own economic efficiency to absorb the relatively 
greater tax burden due to tax reform. We can also say that the 
increase of their tax burden will contribute to the entire 
reform of the country. 
  The basic contents of the current reform are generally as 
follows: The current reform, because of the relatively great 
adjustment of the tax structure, will be a new issue for study 
by the broad masses of people as well as the broad masses of 
taxation cadres. So it is necessary to hold a 
question-and-answer session on the new tax system. 
  Prior to answering questions, I wish to put forward some 
requests: First, to the broad masses of taxation cadres and 
taxation organizations at various levels: they must implement 
the tax law in a strict manner, seriously and penetratingly 
understand various problems in implementing the new tax system, 
conduct investigation and study in a deep-going manner, promptly 
and seriously solve all problems within the limit of tax law, 
put forward their suggestions through investigation and study 
for handling problems which cannot be solved by them and 
promptly report those problems to their higher taxation 
organizations up to the State General Administration of 
Taxation. We will solve these problems if they are within our 
power to do so. If we cannot solve these problems, we will 
report them to and ask for instructions from the higher 
leadership. 

    Second, I would like to make several demands on 
taxpayers. 1) They must truthfully act in accordance with tax 
laws. This is very important. They must truthfully file tax 
returns and pay tax according to the regulations. 2) They must 
promptly report to tax office problems in implementing tax laws; 
their rational requests will be earnestly handled by the tax 
office. At the same time, they must further study the new tax 
provisions and, with the help and guidance of the tax office, 
acquire a better understanding of the tax laws and successfully 
implement them. 3) We also welcome people to raise questions to 
ensure that with the help of people in all quarters, the new tax 
system will be smoothly implemented. 
  [Xu] Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and 
Trade Commission, and Zhang Zhongcheng, chief economist of the 
State General Administration of Taxation, have just explained 
the purpose and significance of this program, as well as the 
basics of the new tax law. Now, let us ask Jiang Qiangui, 
director of the Enterprise Department of the State Economic and 
Trade Commission, to briefly discuss the contents of the entire 
program. 
  [Jiang] Viewers, let me brief you on the main contents of 
this special television program: "Answers to Questions Regarding 
Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System." The program 
is divided into seven lectures. You are watching the first 
lecture: "Introduction." The second lecture deals with special 
features of value-added tax. This lecture will be broadcast in 
two installments. The third lecture deals with questions 
related to calculating value-added tax and tax withholding. The 
fourth lecture discusses issues related to receipts exclusively 
for value-added tax. The fifth lecture deals with consumption 
tax and resources tax. The sixth lecture discusses enterprise 
income tax. The seventh lecture discusses special issues 
related to a number of trades. These seven lectures are 
prepared in response to viewers' requests. If viewers, 
particularly those with enterprises, have questions after 
watching our program, we urge you to contact us promptly.

  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA)-- China's booming 
private enterprises, which reappeared about a decade ago, are 
still in an initial development phase, according to a recent 
national sample survey. 
  The survey, the first of its kind in China, was jointly 
conducted by China's Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the 
Research Office of the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce. 
  The researcher said that 1,432 questionnaires were received 
from 1,700 private firms across the Chinese Mainland, a 
cross-section of the country's 184,000 registered private 
enterprises in last June. 
  By last June, there were only about 400,000 registered 
investors in private firms in China, with a total registered 
investment of 45.29 billion yuan, or an investment of 246,000 
yuan per investor. 
  Compared with the state-owned economy, which dominates the 
national economy and the secondary collectively-owned economy, 
the private enterprise sector is rather small, according to the 
survey. 
  Latest statistics show that the total output value achieved 
by registered private firms reached 42 billion yuan, about 1.4 
percent that of collectively-owned enterprises and less than 0.5 
percent of total industrial output. 
  China began to register private enterprises in late 1988 and 
total private enterprises numbered 90,000 in 1989. 
  The total number of private firms jumped to 238,000 last 
year, an increase of 70.4 percent over 1992, with the total 
registered capital climbing to 68 billion yuan, up 79.9 percent. 
  China's private enterprises have been growing rapidly since 
1992, when the private economy was officially recognized as a 
necessary supplement to the state-owned economy. 
  The total number of the country's private firms grew at a 
rate of about 30 percent during the 1992-mid-1993 period, 
compared with less than 10 percent during 1988-1989. 
  Last year, the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce 
and about 25 provinces issued policies encouraging the 
development of private economy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing said here today that China's reform requires a 
contingent of advanced professionals. 
  Li said this in a meeting with some foreign entrepreneurs at 
Zhongnanhai, seat of the Chinese Communist Party's Central 
Committee and the State Council. 
  He noted that the trend of China's reform, which cannot be 
reversed, is correct, adding that the gate of China can only be 
more and more open. 
  To accelerate China's reform, he said, the key point is to 
speed up the training of specialists. 
  Li met respectively council members of the international 
council of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated, John Hunter, 
president of the Coca Cola Company International sector, Chung 
Se-yong, chairman of Hyundai Business Group, Robert Hormats, 
vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, and Lord Griffiths of 
Fforestfach. 
  Li told the visitors, who attended the 40th session of the 
J.P. Morgan Council held here from February 27-28, that China 
requires more advanced specialists having a good command both of 
modern business management and specialized knowledge. 
  The vice-premier indicated that China is willing to 
strengthen international cooperation in the field of personnel 
training through various channels. 
  George Shultz, chairman of the Morgan International Council, 
Lee Kuan Yew, member of the council and senior minister of 
Singapore, and former British foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey 
Howe, took part in the meeting. 
  When meeting with Hunter, Li said that China's market for 
beverages has a great potential, hoping that the Coca Cola 
Company would further its cooperation with the Chinese beverage 
industry through China National Light Industry Council, and 
develop new drinks by using Chinese resources. 
  As the largest international beverage company, Coca-Cola has 
set up 12 bottling factories with a total investment of some 70 
million U.S. dollars, since the first factory of the kind was 
built in Beijing in 1981. 
  Hunter said that the purpose of his current visit is to 
promote the cooperation between his company and the beverage 
industry of China.

  [Text] Washington, March 1 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major agreed today to 
send a joint civil planning mission to Sarajevo to help revive 
the Bosnian capital's water and power supplies and other 
facilities. 
  At a joint press conference at the White House, they said 
the 
two sides were committed to continuing to work for a resolution 
of the 22-month ethnic war in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  Besides Bosnia, Clinton and Major also discussed the issues 
concerning Russia, world trade, Northern Ireland and Hong Kong. 
  They agreed to bring forward to January 1, 1995, the start 
date for implementation of the GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) agreement. 
  "We'll need to consult with other people to see if that's 
practicable," Major said. 
  On Japan, they agreed to pressure Tokyo to further open its 
markets to U.S. and European goods and services. 
  Northern Ireland had been a sticking point in U.S.-British 
relations, the latest incident being Washington's issuance of 
visa to leader of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, a 
move angered London. 
  Major, however, stressed today he would rather look forward 
and see how "we produce a solution to the Northern Ireland 
problem." 
  "I'm not interested in looking back," Major said. 
  For his part, Clinton criticized as a great mistake to 
"overstate the occasional disagreement and understate the 
incredible depth and breadth of our shared interest and our 
shared values." 
  The two leaders also discussed the Middle East peace process 
and developments in South Africa.

  [Text] Moscow, March 1 (XINHUA) -- The Russian counter 
intelligence service said today that it had arrested a Russian 
official working in a military-industrial complex, charging him 
with spying for the British secret service. 
  It said the spy was arrested on January 15 and faced 
criminal 
charges 10 days later, without specifying his name. 
  The charged spy sold information on the latest Russian 
research in new armaments and their technical characteristics, 
the financing of military research and development and the state 
and prospects of Russian military cooperation with foreign 
countries, according to the service. 
  "On orders of British special services and for monetary 
remuneration, the Russian citizen collected and passed 
classified information of military and economic character," the 
service pointed out. 
  According to the preliminary investigation, the Russian 
official received instructions on using hiding-places for 
supplying information to the British Embassy in Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia's 
counter-intelligence agency today declared that it has arrested 
a top official of the country's war industry spying for Britain. 
  The official, whose name is not made public, was arrested on 
January 15 on a charge of treason. Criminal proceedings against 
him began 10 days later. 
  He was found providing the British intelligence agency with 
military and economic information, which covered Russia's latest 
developed arms, the amount of money for research in the 
country's defense and cooperation with other countries in 
military technology. 
  The official has reportedly confessed all the crimes he had 
committed. 
  The exposure of the case came after Russia's expulsion 
Monday 
[28 February] of a U.S. diplomat accused of being involved in 
spying activities. 
  Earlier last month, the United States lodged a protest with 
Russia over an espionage case involving a top U.S. intelligence 
official and his wife, who had spied for Russia and the former 
Soviet Union for about nine years.

  [Text] Washington, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats reached a preliminary agreement here today on 
establishing a Muslim-Croat federation that would eventually 
include the Serbs to turn Bosnia into a two-republic country. 
  Secretary of State Warren Christopher of the United States, 
which brokered the talks, said the agreement "shows that peace 
is possible." 
  The agreement was signed at the U.S. State Department by 
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Croatian Republic's 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Bosnian Croat Leader Kresimir 
Zubak. 
  Under the agreement, the federation would be made up of 
cantons where the majority of residents are either Muslim or 
Croat and both groups would have equal rights. 
  The federation, which according to the U.S. initiative would 
eventually combine with a Serb republic, would have a central 
government taking care of foreign affairs, commerce and overall 
defense. 
  And the cantons would be responsible for local police, 
education, culture, housing, public facilities and radio and 
television. 
  The federation's legislature would include two chambers, and 
lawmakers would elect the president and vice president. The 
Croats and Muslims would alternate yearly in holding the two 
positions.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Rodovan Karadzic today agreed in Moscow to lift the blockade of 
Tuzla airport to allow in UN humanitarian relief operations, but 
demanded Russian supervision for fear that it would be used for 
shipping arms to Muslims. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev agreed to the demand 
during the talks with Karadzic, who is visiting the Russian 
capital. Kozyrev also promised that the first aircraft arriving 
at Tuzla airport would be a Russian one, reports reaching here 
said. 
  Also today, Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in former 
Yugoslavia, inspected Tuzla airport to observe its preparations 
for receiving relief supplies. 
  However, Bosnian Muslims have expressed opposition to the 
presence of Russian military observers in Tuzla airport, 
claiming it would be "an insult to the United Nations." 
  They also opposed Russian intervention in the Bosnian issue, 
saying that by backing the Serbs Russia had abandoned neutrality. 
  Meanwhile in Zagreb, a top official of the UN peacekeeping 
forces in Bosnia praised the Russian-Serb accord describing it 
as another Russian diplomatic success in the international 
efforts to bring peace to Bosnia. 
  Last month, Russia succeeded in persuading the Serbs into 
withdrawing heavy guns from around Sarajevo before a deadline 
set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization left them open to 
air strikes, thus defusing the Sarajevo crisis. 
  Western countries have expressed a similar desire to use the 
tactics at Sarajevo to solve the Tuzla airport impasse, the 
biggest military airport in the former Yugoslavia under Muslim 
control. 
  The airport was closed down at the beginning of May, 1992 
due 
to a Serbs blockade aimed at preventing the use of the airport 
for shipping arms to Muslims in the nearby town of Tuzla. 
  Last year, the United Nations declared Tuzla a security 
region and has repeatedly called for the opening of the airport 
to help them supply relief goods to the inhabitants of the 
Serb-besieged city. 
  After the Sarajevo crisis was over, the Tuzla airport issue 
was put on the agenda again. On February 25, Akashi secured 
Serbian support for the opening of the airport.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 KYODO -- China's veteran leader Deng 
Xiaoping has instructed Chinese policy makers to fully support 
North Korea's economic reform policy and realize President Kim 
Il-song's visit to China, a diplomatic source said Wednesday [2 
March]. 
  The source said Deng issued the call after he received a 
briefing on North Korea from Ding Guangen, a Politburo member of 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
  Ding has met Hwang Chang-yop, a North Korean parliamentary 
committee chairman, who made a trip to China leading a 
five-member delegation in January. 
  During his stay in China from January 15 to 23, Hwang 
discussed with Chinese leaders Pyongyang's economic policy and 
Kim's planned visit to China, the source said. 
  In a meeting with Ding, Hwang, who is chairman of the 
Foreign 
Affairs Committee of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly and 
in charge of relations with China and the United States, 
conveyed North Korea's intention to adopt a Chinese-style open 
economic policy. 
  North Korea announced in 1991 a plan to set up free economic 
zones in Nachin and Sonpong, in the northeastern part of the 
country, as part of a Tumen river development program. 
  North Korea made a rare and candid admission early in 
December that the country is in serious economic difficulties 
and carried out a leadership reshuffle in an apparent move to 
revitalize its economy. 
  "The targets of the total scope of industrial output and 
some 
major indices including electric power, steel and chemical fiber 
envisaged in the third seven-year plan failed to be attained due 
to international events and the acute situation created in 
(North) Korea," Pyongyang's official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY 
(KCNA) reported. 
  Seoul's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported in mid-January in a 
dispatch from Beijing that Kim plans to visit China for in-depth 
talks with Chinese leaders over the situation on the Korean 
peninsula and possible favorable moves in connection with North 
Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  YONHAP quoted Western sources as saying Kim's visit to 
China, 
expected soon, is being discussed through diplomatic channels 
and China has reacted positively to the move. 
  Hwang surfaced as a core member of the North Korean power 
hierarchy during the December session of the Supreme People's 
Assembly, along with Kim Il-song's brother Kim Yong-chu.

"DPRK Opens Up Its Nuclear Facilities to International 
Inspection"] 
  [Text]Seven-member Team, Two-week Inspection 
  A seven-strong International Atomic Energy Agency inspection 
team arrived yesterday in Pyongyang for a two-week inspection of 
the DPRK's seven nuclear facilities. The DPRK's acceptance of 
nuclear inspections is prompted by its desire to improve 
relations with the United States. It might also face 
international economic sanctions if it continues to refuse entry 
to international delegates to carry out inspections. The DPRK's 
economy is going through a very difficult time. Continued 
isolation from the international community could aggravate the 
domestic political and economic situation, which is already 
grim. Following the DPRK's acceptance of international nuclear 
inspections, annual ROK-U.S. military exercises will be called 
off, and a third round of talks between high-ranking officials 
from the DPRK and the United States has been scheduled for the 
second half of March -- both will help the DPRK break its 
international isolation. For the United States, the biggest 
worry in the Korean peninsula security question is its suspicion 
about the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons, especially when 
the DPRK announced on 12 March last year that it was withdrawing 
from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to free itself from 
restraints on its independent development of nuclear arms. 
<H5>  Does Pyongyang Really Have Nuclear Weapons? </H5>
  Does Pyongyang really have nuclear weapons? This is a 
concern for the United States and its neighbors, such as the 
ROK, Japan, and China. The long-term closed-door policy of the 
Pyongyang authorities has made it next to impossible for the 
outside world to know anything about the DPRK's national 
defense, let its alone nuclear development. Japan is extremely 
concerned about possible nuclear developments in the DPRK. 
Around the world, four countries are suspected to be developing 
nuclear warheads: Israel, South Africa, Iraq, and Pakistan. 
Unlike those four, the DPRK's geographical location means that 
it can launch two or three nuclear warheads against Japan. But 
the DPRK has consistently denied it is developing nuclear 
weapons and says that its nuclear technology only serves the 
construction of nuclear power plants. The DPRK used to have 
close ties with the former Soviet Union, and it is entirely 
possible that Soviet nuclear and missile experts have helped 
Pyongyang with its nuclear development. Japan believes that if 
the DPRK has nuclear weapons, Japan should also be making them. 
The United States says that it would not be unusual for the DPRK 
to have more than 10 kg of plutonium by now, and that the DPRK 
has been secretly developing nuclear warheads and carrier 
rockets for two years and experimenting with detonators for 
three years. Another expert view holds that the DPRK is 
incapable of developing nuclear weapons. It is true that 
Pyongyang badly wants to study and develop them, but it does not 
have the economic strength and suffers acutely from electricity 
shortages; the development of a nuclear industry requires 
enormous electricity supplies. 
<H5>  Pyongyang Develops Relations With ASEAN </H5>
  The DPRK's economic situation also precludes it from 
developing costly nuclear weapons. Last year, it completed its 
third seven-year economic construction plan without achieving 
the planned target of a 10-percent industrial growth rate -- 
officials said it was only 5.6 percent. The government has 
designated the next three years as a period of economic 
restructuring with the focus on developing food and light 
industry and foreign trade. Such a move is bound to slow down 
nuclear developments. The greatest disadvantages for the DRPK 
are insufficient energy and food shortages. Its trade with 
China has grown rapidly over the last two years from around $500 
or $600 million to $900 million last year, mostly energy and 
food imports from China. The view of the United States, Japan, 
and the ROK is that the DPRK wants to develop nuclear weapons 
very much but has shelved the project because of practical 
difficulties. It remains to see whether the international 
investigative team can get full cooperation from the DPRK and 
can conduct its work smoothly there. However, the DPRK has 
realized that Asia is the center of economic development and 
hopes to strengthen its economic ties with the Asia- Pacific 
region with requests to participate in the ASEAN economic 
conference. All of this signals a policy change toward 
embracing the international community. Opening the country to 
nuclear inspections is part of that change.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea today agreed to a South Korean 
proposal to hold inter-Korean working-level contacts on Thursday 
[3 March] to discuss the exchange of presidential envoys. 
  The local press reported that the head of the DPRK 
delegation 
today telephoned South Korea's chief negotiator and said that 
South Korea's proposal was "a matter for rejoicing". 
  The exchange of presidential envoys is an urgent matter 
which 
could not be delayed, he said. 
  The three previous rounds of working-level contacts failed 
to 
make progress on the issue of dispatching envoys to Pyongyang 
and Seoul. 
  According to an agreement reached last Saturday between the 
DPRK and the United States, if the DPRK allows nuclear 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
opens a dialogue with South Korea, South Korea and the U.S. will 
contemporaneously announce the suspension of joint military 
exercises. 
  The U.S. also will issue the agenda for a third round of 
U.S.-DPRK negotiations. 
  A seven-member team of IAEA inspectors arrived here today.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- A seven-member 
delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
arrived here today to begin a two-week inspection of seven 
nuclear sites in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK). 
  The inspections will be carried out in accordance with an 
agreement reached between the DPRK and the IAEA on February 15 
in order to "safeguard the continuation of the nuclear 
facilities' security." 
  This action will be the first of its kind since a three-man 
inspection team came to the DPRK to change monitoring devices at 
a nuclear site in the Yongbyon region last August. 
  The inspections are one of the measures called for in an 
agreement reached between the DPRK and the United States on 
February 25. Under this agreement, the DPRK accepted 
inspections by the IAEA and agreed to resume inter-Korean 
working level contacts. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. announced the cancellation of this 
year's 
military maneuvers with South Korea, and agreed to hold the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. meetings in Geneva on March 21.

for establishing a new international political and economic 
order. 
  In an interview with local journalists, Qian said, "After 
the 
end of the cold war, the world peace can be maintained, but 
there are sill power politics and hegemonism in the world as 
well as regional confrontations and turbulences". 
  He pointed out that the economic environment of many 
developing countries are worsening and the gap between North and 
South are widening. 
  Thus so, Qian noted that maintaining the world peace and 
developing economy has become the main task of the world today. 
In order to achieve this task, "China stands for establishing 
an new international political and economic order which should 
be founded on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Co-existence". 
  "If we say that China can play a certain role in this 
process, China should be a factor for promoting the world peace 
and economic development". 
  Asked about China's market economy, Qian said, "The 
objective 
of China's economic reform is to build a socialist market 
economy. This is a new trial and China's experience in the 
recent past has proved that this new trial is very successful." 
  "Over the past 15 years, market economy in China has been 
gradually instituted and the economic growth has continued", 
Qian said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 2 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan 
and the United States are working together on a patent and 
trademark reciprocal protection agreement on the third day of 
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection talks here in 
Taipei. 
  Chen Tzuo-chen, deputy director-general of the National 
Bureau of Standards (NBS) under the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs, said that a reciprocity pact will ensure better 
protection for inventions by peoples of the two countries. 
  The US delegation to the talks, now in their third and final 
day, was originally concerned that revisions to Taiwan's patent 
law did not stipulate jail sentences for violations, Chen said. 
  But American delegates said they were satisfied after 
learning that the revised law increases fines to the equivalent 
of twice the damage incurred by violation, he noted. 
  The three-day IPR consultations between Taiwan and the 
United 
States are expected to conclude late Wednesday [2 March].

  [Text] Taipei, March 2 (CNA) -- Several Republic of China 
[ROC] legislators Wednesday [2 March] quoted US customs 
statistics which show that the US is the world's sixth largest

  Five Kuomintang legislators, including Lin Shou-shan and Lin 
Chih-chia, called on the Clinton administration to require the 
same export inspections of US software as the US Trade 
Representative officials have recommended for Taipei. 
  Noting that US customs statistics show US IPR violations are 
only one percent behind those of Taiwan, the legislators called 
for equal treatment for the two countries. 
  "It is fair to ask the US to impose a similar export 
inspection system to curb IPR violation," they said in a joint 
statement released Wednesday morning. 
  The statement also called on the US to revise its patent law 
to add prison terms for IPR violators, as Taiwan is being asked 
to do the same. 
  Legislators Ting Shou-chung, Wei Yung and Chao Yung-ching 
also signed the statement.

  [Text] Taipei, March 1 (CNA) -- It would be easier for the 
Republic of China [ROC] to gain admission to the United Nations 
if it could win diplomatic recognition from 40 to 50 countries, 
Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said Tuesday [2 March]. 
  However, Chien said, th ROC will not forge diplomatic 
relations with a number of "mini" states simply to reach that 
goal. 
  "We'll develop formal ties only with those countries whose 
ecoomies are complementary with ours and whose political 
situations are stable," Chien told a press conference at the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  The ROC currently maintains diplomatic ties with 29 
countries, mostly in Latin America and Africa. 
  "The government needs the support of the press and academic 
communities as well as the Legislative Yuan in seeking to expand 
diplomatic frontiers," Chien said. 
  He stressed that the government will continue to seek 
membership in major international organizations and forge 
diplomatic ties with more countries under the "one China" policy. 
  "China is divided and ruled by two separate governments," 
Chien said. "As a sovereign state, the ROC, which controls 
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, is entitled to have a role in 
the world arena." 
  Chien said that although Beijing has spared no efforts to 
block Taiwan's international presence, the ROC won't abandon its 
bid to join the United Nations and other important world bodies. 
  Chien added that he is reserved toward a proposal made 
recently by a Taiwan affairs official in Beijing that the two 
sides stop their "cutthroat" competition on the diplomatic front. 
  "It is Beijing that has adopted a `zero-sum' strategy 
against 
Taiwan in diplomatic arenas," Chien said. "In forging ties with 
other countries, we have never asked them to either totally cut 
relations or reduce exchanges with Beijing." 
  "Under the current conditions, I doubt the Chinese Communist 
Party leadership will accept the so-called `diplomatic truce' 
overture," Chien said, adding that unless Mainland China's 
political system changes, cross-strait relations are unlikely to 
make great headway.

  [Text] The Executive Yuan has completed an assessment 
report about the impact which the nation's agricultural sector 
will have when the Republic of China [ROC] seeks to join the 
GATT. It was disclosed, however, that the results of the 
assessment are so negative that the government so far is afraid 
to publicize it. The assessment report was immediately recalled 
even after it was read by ministers and council heads attending 
a ministerial meeting called by the Executive Yuan not long ago. 
  A scholar participating in the assessment pointed out that, 
in accordance with the assessment report, after the ROC joins 
the GATT, it will not be able to attain its zero-growth target 
in its agricultural development, and the nation may have 
negative agricultural growth -- and even a substantial decline 
-- for a long time to come. 
  The scholar indicated that, since the bottom line set in the 
assessment report for opening up ROC's agricultural sector is 
one based on a relatively optimistic assumption, and yet the 
assessment results are still negative, he thought the set bottom 
line is merely a wishful thinking, considering the nation's 
eagerness to join the GATT by the end of the year, the U.S. 
side's unyielding attitude, and the lack of bargaining chips on 
the part of the ROC during the negotiations. 
  Moreover, in view of the prospects that agricultural 
associations have planned to organize farmers to demonstrate in 
streets next month to demand the government to come up with 
measures to deal with agricultural problems arising after the 
ROC becomes a GATT member, (Sun Ming-hsien), chairman of the 
Executive Yuan Agricultural Council, indicated that ROC's 
countermoves will be adjusted periodically, based on the results 
of the negotiations, as well as the terms set for ROC's GATT 
membership. He indicated that he has begun dialogues with 
farmers for this reason.

<F P=106> [Report by Ho Chinming; from the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] In answering an interpellation at the Legislative 
Yuan, President of the Executive Yuan Lien Chan yesterday [25 
February] said there are many possibilities for the 
reunification of China in the future. A federation [lien pang] 
or confederation [pang lien] should be considered as a way. 
However, he believed that, under the condition that Communist 
China still takes an ossified policy toward Taiwan and 
disregards the fact that we are a political entity, Communist 
China will not be ready to leap one hundred steps and instantly 
discuss the system of a federation or confederation. 
  Legislator Chao Shao-kang expressed his view during an 
interpellation at the Legislative Yuan yesterday that, under the 
situation of close economic and trade relations between the two 
sides of the strait, with the amount of bilateral trade 
exceeding the amount of trade with the United States and Japan, 
it is extremely unwise for the two sides to contend with each 
other in diplomatic and military affairs. He asked the 
government to change the current conservative, shrinking, and 
defensive policy toward the mainland and to readjust our 
strategy and adopt a positive and active mainland policy so our 
side can take an offensive as well as a defensive position in 
dealing with Communist China. Therefore, he advocated 
establishing the Republic of the Chinese Federation [chung hua 
lien pang kung ho kuo] through cross-strait talks. Although 
Communist China may object, we can at least shift the problem to 
Communist China. 
  Premier Lien Chan said the relationship between the two 
sides 
of the strait is a crucial political issue for the country at 
present and in the future. Judging from the view of our country 
and nation, the present vicious contention between the two sides 
of the strait in the political, economic, military and other 
fields and the situation of a life-and-death struggle [ni su wo 
huo ti chu mien] are merely squandering away the resources of 
the country and is very unsatisfactory. Therefore, he held that 
taking the initiative to design a political structure, planning 
national development in the future, and thinking about the 
future path of the Republic of China are all good ideas. He 
also affirmed Chao Shao-kang's suggestion on forming a 
federation. He held that it is quite creative. 
  In addition, in answering an interpellation, Premier Lien 
Chan also said that the so-called summit meeting is merely for 
stressing each other's stand and cannot solve practical 
problems. Therefore the problems between the two sides of the 
strait should still be handled in a rational and good-will 
manner, and in this way we can naturally have a bright future. 
Meanwhile, he held that the idea of a federation or 
confederation is not the direction for reunification in the 
future. In answering an interpellation by Chao Shao-kang, 
Premier Lien said: 
  [Begin recording] [Lien] The future reunification of China 
may take many forms. However, a confederation [pang lien] or 
federation [lien pang] may be accepted after all as a way for 
consideration. The Soviet Union was an example of the 
unification of states in modern times. In past decades, we have 
seen many such examples in the United Nations. [end recording] 
  In fact, the policy toward the mainland became the 
legislators' focal point of concern in the general 
interpellation of government administration on 25 February. 
Earlier, Legislator Ting Shou-chung had a wonderful dialogue 
with Premier Lien Chan on the possibility of holding a summit 
between the two sides of the strait. 
  [Begin recording] [Ting] I solemly suggest that the 
president should immediately hold a cross-strait summit with 
Deng Xiaoping. To go out to the world, Taiwan's leader must 
first have the courage to face Communist China. We have seen 
that President Li can avoid sensitive questions, disregard 
status and formalities, and go abroad to hold talks with leaders 
of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand and exchange 
experiences on national construction. Why can he not hold 
dialogs with leaders on the mainland with the same sentiment and 
tolerance and in the same informal way? 
  [Li] I personally always think that summit meetings cannot 
solve problems. The government leaders only express their 
stands and stress their own particular viewpoints in summit 
meetings. They cannot possibly solve any practical thing. [end 
recording] 
  Generally speaking, Premier Lien's view on a policy for 
cross-strait relations is still consistently the same, that is, 
the relations between the two sides of the strait should be 
two-sided. Our side has already shown enough sincerity, but so 
far the government still has not felt any goodwill from 
Communist China in response. Therefore, the current policy 
toward the mainland still should not be changed rashly.

  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA) -- Mainland China absorbed 
66.52 percent of Taiwan's total foreign investment in 1993, 
increasing Taiwan's dependence on the mainland, according to a 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) report released Monday. 
  Between January-October of 1993, Taiwan approved U.S.$4.56 
billion worth of foreign investment with U.S.$3.038 billion 
going to Mainland China, the report said. 
  A total of 9,167 mainland investment applications were 
recorded during the period, the report indicated. 
  Taiwan's total trade dependence on Mainland China grew from 
4.83 percent at the end of 1992 to 5.3 percent during the 
ten-month period, up 9.73 percent, the report said. 
  Taiwan's export reliance on the mainland grew 14.51 percent 
to reach 8.84 percent during the period, up from 7.72 percent 
registered at the end of 1992. 
  However, the degree of Mainland China's trade dependence on 
Taiwan only increased 0.45 percent over the ten months to reach 
4.92 percent. The mainland's export reliance on Taiwan was 
limited to 1.3 percent, down 0.02 percent, according to the MAC 
report. 
  Taiwan investors mostly concentrated their investments in 
manufacturing industries, including those producing rubber, 
plastic, electronic, electric, basic metal, food, beverage, 
textile, and chemical products. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan's trade dependence on Hong Kong, an 
entrepot for mainland trade, also grew 12.4 percent during the 
period. Taiwan's export reliance on the british colony grew 2.7 
percent to reach 21.6 percent in 1993, compared with 18.9 
percent in 1992, the report noted.

  [Text] Taipei, March 1 (CNA) -- A seven-member delegation 
of US wildlife conservation officials will arrive in Taiwan 
Tuesday [2 March] evening to inspect conservation efforts here. 
  The delegation, led by Kenneth Stansell, director of the 
Office of Management Authority of the Fish and Wildlife Service 
under the Department of the Interior will visit the Council of 
Agriculture (COA), the Department of Health, the Ministry of 
Justice, the Directorate General of Customs, and the National 
Police Administration during their five-day stay in Taiwan. 
  The inspection tour will help determine whether the US 
Government will impose trade sanctions against Taiwan for 
alleged trade in endangered species parts. 
  COA Chairman Sun Ming-hsien pledged that the council will do 
its best to act on advice and guidance from the US delegation or 
other conservation groups at home and abroad in order to improve 
Taiwan's protection of endangered wildlife. 
  He added that he will also seek a rhino horn identifying 
agreement with the US when meeting with the delegation. 
  "We will take this opportunity to communicate with the 
delegation members in the hopes that a rhino horn identifying 
technique agreement with the United States will be signed as 
soon as possible," Sun added. 
  The US Government's willingness to enter into such a pact 
demonstrates its goodwill toward Taiwan's wildlife conservation 
efforts, he noted. 
  The US Department of the Interior, under pressure from 
international conservation groups, last September identified 
Taiwan as an area trading in rhino horn and tiger bone and asked 
President Bill Clinton to call for trade retaliation against the 
island. 
  Meanwhile, the Geneva-based Convention on International 
Trade 
in Endangered Species (CITES) Standing Committee will meet March 
21-25 to decide whether to call for an international economic 
boycott against Taiwan. 
  Two CITES delegations visited Taiwan in November and January 
respectively to evaluate Taiwan's wildlife protection measures. 
  Results of the CITES meeting are expected to be influential 
in the US Government's decision in late April, Sun said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 1 (CNA) -- Police arrested two drug 
dealers Tuesday [1 March] and confiscated 159 kilograms of 
mainland Chinese "Double Lion" heroin, marking the largest 
heroin seizure in Taiwan history. 
  The 443 small bricks of heroin have an estimated street 
value 
of NT$10 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (US$377.34 million), 
police said. 
  Police identified the drug dealers as Chang Chi-ching, 28, 
and Chang Ming-hui, 32. Both have close ties with international 
drug rings, according to an officer at the Taipei city police 
headquarters. 
  Police began an investigation of the two late last year 
after 
discovering they might have ties with a drug trafficking ring 
headed by Lin Kwang-cheng. Lin was arrested last December. 
  Police found that the two men had developed an islandwide 
drug distribution network and maintained close relations with 
international drug traffickers. 
  Chang Chi-ching told the police that the drugs seized in 
Tuesday's raid were smuggled into Taiwan from Bangkok in early 
February. 
  "The drugs were smuggled into Taiwan at the Chiching fishing 
port near Kaohsiung on the eve of the lunar new year holiday," 
Chang said. 
  He admitted that his ring used to smuggle heroin into Taiwan 
from Thailand's Golden Triangle and re-export the drug to the 
United States and Italy. Because of sluggish sales in the 
American and European markets in recent years, Chang said his 
group began to make inroads into the Southeast Asian market.

<F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Gan Cheng (3927 2110): "The Fate of </F>
the Last Three-Tier Government of Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The first 
part of Chris Patten's constitutional reform package was adopted 
by the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 24 February. 
Immediately after this, London and the Hong Kong Government 
simultaneously made public an abstract of the contents of the 17 
rounds of Sino-British talks and the remainder of Chris Patten's 
constitutional reform package was published in the government 
gazette. The package will be submitted to the Legislative 
Council for examination and discussion on 9 March. 
  The opportunity for resuming the Sino-British talks on 
constitutional reform has now been completely destroyed. It 
will be difficult to find a mechanism for the convergence of the 
Hong Kong constitution around 1997; the arrangements for a 
through train have thoroughly vanished; and the opportunity for 
Sino-British cooperation on Hong Kong's constitutional 
development is equivalent to zero. 
  This is something that the Chinese side is extremely 
unwilling to see. The Chinese side has repeatedly said: As far 
as the Chinese side is concerned, the door to talks is wide 
open, but the prerequisite is that the British side must 
withdraw the partial constitutional reform package that has 
already been submitted to the Legislative Council. The British 
side, however, is bent on confronting the Chinese side to the 
very end and on deviating farther and farther away from the road 
of cooperation. 
  Although Chris Pattern is still putting on a show and has 
said that the possibility of reopening dialogue with the Chinese 
side on the constitutional issue of Hong Kong has not been ruled 
out, he has started to tear down one of the supports of the 
mansion that will soon be returned to its owner, while at the 
same time saying that he is willing to cooperate with the owner 
to construct a taller building. By acting this way, he himself 
may be the only one cheated in the end. The Chinese side and 
the people of Hong Kong have ears as well as eyes. Their eyes 
will not miss any of Chris Patten's damaging moves. 
  According to Chris Patten's way of doing business, he will 
exert himself to the utmost to promote -- in accordance with his 
constitutional reform package -- the election of the three-tier 
councils in 1994 and 1995 in a bid to extend Britain's colonial 
influence beyond 1997. Although the voice of opposition within 
the Legislative Council is not low, it will not be too difficult 
for Christ Patten to affix the seal with his hand. 
  However, the Chinese side has repeatedly reiterated that, 
without an agreement between China and Britain, any 
constitutional reform package adopted by the Legislative Council 
of Hong Kong will not be accepted. The Chinese side will 
certainly dissolve and reorganize Hong Kong's three-tier 
councils on 1 July 1997. This means that the three-tier 
councils to be elected in 1994 and 1995, the birth of which 
Chris Patten is unilaterally expediting, are bound to be 
short-lived. The Legislative Council to be elected in 1995 can 
only last 20 months. 
  Britain must return Hong Kong to China in 1997, and by that 
time China will certainly have restored its sovereignty over 
Hong Kong. This is a fact which no one can change. The 
three-tier councils of Hong Kong to be elected in 1994 and 1995 
without an agreement between China and Britain are only one part 
of the British Hong Kong constitutional structure, and their 
terms of office are provided for by the British Royal 
Instructions and the relevant regulations. Following the end of 
the British rule over Hong Kong on 30 June 1997, the Royal 
Instructions and all other relevant laws, being in conflict with 
the Basic Law, will certainly become invalid, and all the 
three-tier councils of the Hong Kong Government will be 
dissolved at that time. The Chinese Government will reorganize 
the constitutional structure on 1 July 1997 in accordance with 
the Basic Law and the decision of the National People's 
Congress. This is very natural. 
  Although Chris Patten has clung to his course, he and the 
British Government have absolutely no chance of changing the 
fate of the last three-tier councils of the Hong Kong 
Government. Percy Cradock, former foreign affairs adviser to 
the British prime minister, pointed out that, because the talks 
broke down, the British Government will have no say about the 
blueprint for Hong Kong's future development. 
  Recalling the experience of the previous Sino-British talks 
on Hong Kong's future, Percy Cradock pointed out that the 
British side was in fact in an inferior position, while the 
Chinese side was in an overwhelmingly dominant position. 
Therefore, one of the ways to work together with China is to 
avoid confronting the tough with toughness and to hold talks and 
discussions. 
  In commenting on the results that were achieved in the 
Sino-British talks on Kong Kong at that time, CPC elder Deng 
Xiaoping once pointed out, "What is the reason behind the 
success of the talks on Hong Kong? It was not due to the 
special skills of the participants from our side, but was 
primarily because our country has developed over the past few 
years and has become a prosperous and flourishing country, a 
country with strength, and a trustworthy country. We pay 
attention to trustworthiness, and we keep our word." 
  Chris Patten is doomed to failure because he is ignorant 
about China today. His understanding of China and even Britain 
seems to be identical to that of some people in 1840.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhu Yucheng Criticizes British Hong Kong </F>
Government for Attempting To Shift Debt Onto the Hong Kong 
People"] 
  [Text] Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, made a criticism yesterday, saying that the British 
Hong Kong Government changed the Airport Authority into the 
Airport Corporation with the intention of shifting debt onto the 
government of the future special administrative region, and that 
the Chinese side would not allow the debt to be ultimately 
passed on to the people of Hong Kong. 
  At the Spring Festival party and inaugural ceremony for the 
43d Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform 
Association last night, Zhu Yucheng said: On the airport issue, 
the Chinese side has always acted in accordance with the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the Airport, but it was only 
after a very long delay that the British side put forward the 
fourth proposal. There is still the big question of a more than 
HK$20 billion [Hong Kong dollars] debt in this financial 
proposal. 
  He said: By making the Airport Authority into a company, the 
British Hong Kong Government wants to shift the debt onto that 
company. The Chinese side has pointed out that, like the Mass 
Transit Railway Corporation, the Airport Corporation is a 
company which is fully funded by the Hong Kong Government, and 
the debt will ultimately be shouldered by the government of the 
future special administrative region. Therefore, the Chinese 
side maintains that, regarding the airport issue, there must be 
a supervisory organization, that the airport authorities cannot 
be allowed to spend money indiscriminately, and that the 
supervisory organization must reflect the will of the Hong Kong 
people. In response to a reporter's question as to whether the 
Airport Consultative Committee could play a supervisory role, 
Zhu Yucheng said: It depends on whether its composition 
represents the will of the Hong Kong people, and this must be 
considered in light of the situation at the time. The 
composition of the Airport Consultative Committee itself has yet 
to be studied. He said that the new airport has four essential 
elements, the airport runway, airport support facilities, 
airport control system, and airport traffic system. He said 
that the British Hong Kong Government's practice of offering 
these services as separate contracts, as opposed to approving 
them as an integral whole, is not conducive to the management of 
the airport. He pointed out that the Chinese side does not want 
the various elements of airport management to be separated, 
because an airport is different from other types of businesses. 
He said that all one can do is wait and see how the Hong Kong 
Government divides up the new airport. 
  Zhu Yucheng said: The Hong Kong people should pay special 
attention to these areas. The goals of the British before their 
withdrawal are very clear: Economically, they want to reap the 
maximum benefit. Politically, they are preparing their own 
people in an attempt to force the government of the special 
administrative region to accept the exercise of British rule 
without their presence. He said: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
discussed these problems very clearly before. The problems he 
mentioned have now occurred one after another. The current 
problems between China and Britain are something that the 
Chinese side does not wish to see." He hoped that the Hong Kong 
people will stop dreaming and said that they can no longer 
expect a colonial official to leave anything good for the Hong 
Kong people. He said that the British officials will only grab 
the maximum benefits for the British side and cited a proverb, 
saying that it is easier to move mountains and change the course 
of rivers than for one to change one's character. Zhu Yucheng 
added: The Chinese side has already made it very clear that, on 
the airport issue, the British Hong Kong Government has to 
conform to the Memorandum of Understanding by leaving HK$25 
billion to the government of the special administrative region 
and by borrowing no more than HK$5 billion. He said: The 
question should have been settled, but the British Hong Kong 
Government is playing a game of figures by putting forward this 
and that proposal and intends to pass the debt on to the 
government of the future special administrative region after all. 
  In response to a reporter's question as to whether the 
airport issue is being affected by the Sino-British dispute and 
by the deterioration of relations, Zhu Yucheng said: In the 
past, the Chinese side always hoped that politics and economics 
would be separated. But it appears that the road the British 
Hong Kong authorities are taking has completely blocked the road 
of Sino- British cooperation. Therefore, it will be very 
difficult for China and Britain to travel on the road of 
cooperation again in the next three years or more. Since the 
first day of his arrival in Hong Kong, Chris Patten has chosen 
the path of Sino-British confrontation, and now it seems that he 
will continue this confrontation to the very end. This will 
surely have an impact on cooperation in all areas of the Hong 
Kong economy. He said that there is a Memorandum of 
Understanding for the airport and that it is now up to the 
British side to abide by it. Zhu Yucheng said: In the past, we 
had the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the 
agreements reached between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries before, but the British side has ruined these three 
foundations of cooperation. Now let us see whether the British 
side will abide by the Memorandum of Understanding. 
  In addition, regarding the White Paper published 
unilaterally 
by the British side, Zhu Yucheng said that the British side has 
unilaterally violated the principle of confidentiality. He 
said: "Last time, I said that the British side did some editing 
and merging, and you editors should be aware of this. They 
themselves have also admitted that they have not released the 
whole story; that is to say, they took those elements that they 
needed, but did not reveal the entire real substance of our 
talks." 
  Zhu Yucheng said: The Chinese side set forth a five-point 
foundation at the beginning of the talks, which Deputy Director 
Zhang Junsheng has also discussed publicly. The Chinese side 
had discussed these issues, but the British side did not keep 
its promise. He said: "As a government, it has to be 
responsible. It must not be irresponsible in the remarks it 
makes. It is not good if one says one thing today and then says 
another tomorrow. A government must be responsible, must admit 
when it has said or done something, and must be honest. We say 
we all speak the truth and we must not act like they do." Zhu 
Yucheng added that whatever the Chinese side says is true, and 
the Chinese will make a response very soon. He urged the 
reporters to be patient and said that a comprehensive reply 
would be given very soon.

<F P=106> [By political editor Mary Binks and M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The standoff between Britain and China over the 
political future of Hong Kong continued yesterday as the gulf 
widened between their respective accounts of why cooperation had 
not been possible. 
  The two sides, in separate accounts of the failed 17 rounds 
of negotiations, blamed each other for the impasse on 
arrangements for the final elections under British rule. 
  Governor Chris Patten declined to retaliate to Beijing's 
accusations that the British side had deliberately sabotaged the 
negotiations and interfered in China's sovereignty. 
  Mr Patten resisted calls by legislators to issue the 
unabridged version of the negotiations in order to clear up 
differences between the two accounts of why the talks failed. 
  "Even if you were to produce all the other documentation, 
you 
would still have differences in interpretation and analyses ... 
people can look from one document to the other and by and large, 
the facts are the same in both," he said. 
  The 17,000-word Chinese document published five days after 
Britain's White Paper on the content of the negotiations, 
accused Britain of "distorting the position of the Chinese side". 
  Meanwhile, China's most senior official dealing with the 
territory, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping, 
stressed the talks had been intended to provide legislators with 
a through-train enabling them to serve their terms beyond 1997. 
  Local Xinhua News Agency official Lee Wui-ting said the 
version of the talks published by the Chinese side would allow 
the Hong Kong people to determine the cause of the political 
deadlock. 
  Speaking after a meeting of the Preliminary Working 
Committee 
(PWC) in Beijing yesterday, Mr Lee said the Chinese version 
demonstrated that the British side had pushed Mr Patten's 
constitutional reform proposals from the beginning of the talks, 
hindering progress. 
  "The Hong Kong people can judge which side was 
unco-operative," Mr Lee said. 
  But, in Beijing, Britain's Ambassador to China, Sir Robin 
McLaren claimed the Chinese account of the negotiations was 
incorrect in its interpretations. 
  Sir Robin also criticised the Chinese government for not 
providing him with a copy of the document before it was made 
public. He said Britain had extended that courtesy to China 
before issuing its White Paper on the failed negotiations. 
  China's account of the talks was yesterday published in 
Beijing's two major official newspapers, the PEOPLE's DAILY and 
CHINA DAILY, in Chinese and English respectively. 
  Sir Robin said Britain would stand by its version, saying 
the 
White Paper was a more accurate assessment of the reasons for 
the impasse. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton yesterday made clear he fully 
supported Mr Patten's proposals, after a meeting with visiting 
British Prime Minister John Major.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Hong Wen (1738 5113): "Guard </F>
Against Hong Kong Government's Move To `Spend Extravagantly'"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 27 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- This 
Wednesday, the financial secretary is going to announce a fiscal 
budget, the third since Chris Patten took up the governorship of 
Hong Kong. Before this, the Hong Kong Government published the 
part of the budget relating to public expenditures, which shows 
that the total budgeted expenditures for the next fiscal year 
will reach as high as HK$146 billion, representing a substantive 
increase of 6.3 percent over the current year's budget, or 
breaking the principle that the increase in expenditures must 
not exceed the rate of economic growth which the Hong Kong 
Government has pursued all along. In view of this, many people 
in the community are worried whether the new fiscal budget to be 
introduced soon will further deviate from the traditional 
financial management principle of making both ends meet, and 
whether money will be spent extravagantly for reasons other than 
economic ones. 
  Judging from the newly released expenditure figures, this 
worry is completely reasonable. Although the authorities have 
argued insistently that the growth in budgeted expenditures has 
slowed obviously, Legislative Councillor Lau Wah-sum, a former 
financial official of the Hong Kong Government, argued that the 
authorities do not include the operational funds in the 
government expenditures because they attempt to "prevent" people 
from seeing the limitations of a 5 percent growth in 
expenditures. 
  As history unfolds, the original intention that government 
expenditure should not be higher than the local economic growth 
rate was intended to avoid stimulating inflation. However, 
after Chris Patten -- a former politician -- assumed the 
governorship, the first fiscal budget under his administration 
leadership "discarded the old and introduced the new," setting a 
precedence of allowing the growth in public expenditure to be 
higher than the economic growth rate. What is noteworthy is that 
the forthcoming fiscal budget probably will push the proportion 
of public expenditure to another new height. 
  According to estimates by the Hong Kong General Chamber of 
Commerce, the Taxation Society, and people from accounting 
circles, the deficit in the new fiscal year will reach HK$10 
billion. The huge deficit will be due mainly to the sharp 
growth of many large infrastructural and capital expenditures. 
It is believed that the government will continue to run a 
deficit over the next four years. In other words, spending 
extravagantly in the good days of the transition period may mean 
bad days after 1997 and may lead the future special 
administrative region into dire straits. 
  Although the government seems to be running an increasing 
surplus, this sharp surplus increase -- in all fairness -- is 
derived from the unexpectedly "satisfactory" income from the 
sale of land and from the stock market boom. Unfortunately, it 
is impossible for this kind of income to remain steady and 
regular in the long run. Moreover, the policy of pushing up 
land prices leads directly to a sharp rise in property prices 
and to high inflation, making it indescribably difficult for 
mortgage-paying residents and leading to a daily decreasing 
quality of life. 
  The saying runs "one who does not look far ahead will find 
himself face to face with immediate trouble." Faced with an 
uncertain political environment in the remaining years of the 
transition period, in view of the periodic fluctuations in 
economic development and the possible influence on Hong Kong's 
economy that the British side's obstinacy regarding the 
political system will have, the Hong Kong Government surely has 
the responsibility to consider the long-term interests of Hong 
Kong people, bear future needs in mind, stick to the policy of 
making ends meet, and retain a sufficient financial capability 
to cope with contingencies. Otherwise, the prosperity bought by 
spending extravagantly now may change into trouble for Hong Kong 
people in the future, once they encounter an adverse situation. 
In the case of welfarism, many Western countries have stumbled 
over this, so it is important for the Hong Kong Government to 
draw a lesson from this. 
  Generally speaking, sticking to the financial management 
tradition of making ends meet is an important factor 
contributing to the Hong Kong miracle. The Basic Law also 
provides that the fiscal budget of the special administrative 
region must uphold the principle of making ends meet. For this 
reason, there is a need to warn the Hong Kong Government that it 
should not play a game of figures by formulating a deficit 
budget with expenditures much greater than income so as to 
mislead the community.

(2733 7787 2494): "Wang Fengchao Says China Sets Up Another 
Kitchen in Reaction to Britain's Violation of the Agreement and 
Will Fully Implement the Basic Law in Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25th (HSIN PAO)--Wang Fengchao, State 
Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy director, said 
this morning that when China mentioned "another kitchen" this 
was aimed against Chris Patten's move to set up "another 
kitchen" because Britain violated the principles of the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law and China could only set up 
"another kitchen" so that Hong Kong can enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy, Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, and fully implement 
the Basic Law. 
  Wang Fengchao said he would try to visit Hong Kong this year 
if he had the time. 
  In his news conference given this morning to the media 
before 
a meeting with the Preliminary Work Committee Political Affairs 
Panel, Wang Fengchao, promoted from second department director 
to deputy director late last February, said that China would act 
according to the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law, safeguard Hong Kong's executive sovereignty together 
with Hong Kong people, and properly handle preparations in 
various areas. After 1997, a high degree of autonomy will be 
allowed according to the policy of one country, two systems to 
lay a foundation for Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong. 
  He continued: China's wish is cooperation with Britain in 
the latter period of transition and working for a stable 
transition and smooth political changeover according to the 
Basic Law. 
  However, he pointed out, as Britain has refused to cooperate 
politically with China, turned its back on the relationship of 
cooperation with China, persisted in its course, got itself in 
deeper and deeper, and ruined the basis of cooperation. Without 
an atmosphere of cooperation, it is difficult for work in other 
areas not to be affected. This is something China did not want 
to see and the responsibility lies entirely with Britain. 
  Regarding "setting up another kitchen," Wang Fengchao said 
Britain did not recognize the agreements and understandings for 
the transition it made with China and set up another kitchen; 
because of this China could only "set up another kitchen" based 
on the blueprints outlined by the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law. On the current division of labor within the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, he said Deputy Director Wang 
Qiren has been transferred to the Bank of China as its 
president. There are now three directors. Director Lu Ping 
oversees general affairs; Chen Zhiying takes charge of the work 
of Sections 1 and 3, that is Hong Kong and Macao affairs. Wang 
himself is responsible for the work of Section 2 (that is Hong 
Kong political and social affairs) and the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Research Desk. Wang said that he felt the heavy burden 
of responsibility after he became deputy director. Fortunately, 
he could see the direction clearly.

  [Text] Sino-British co-operation on the new airport 
project has suffered a further setback with negotiations 
unlikely to resume for another four weeks following the latest 
political row. 
  Senior government sources said yesterday they were not 
expecting China to agree to a meeting of the Sino-British 
Airport Committee for at least another four weeks. 
  The opinion conflicts with Chief Secretary Anson Chan's 
statement last week that she hoped a date would be set for talks 
this week. 
  The future of airport talks was clouded last week when China 
accused Britain of slamming the door on talks on economic issues 
by pushing ahead with the second stage of Governor Chris 
Patten's constitutional reform bill and releasing a White Paper 
on the 17 rounds of Sino-British political talks. 
  Sources said the Hong Kong government was expecting a 
month-long war of words between the two sides before tempers 
cooled enough for talks to resume. 
  The government would have to form a contingency plan in May 
or June this year for the additional injection of funds into the 
multibillion-dollar project if China continued to refuse to 
discuss the issue. 
  The latest injection of funds will carry airport works until 
July this year but an agreement is hoped for before that time. 
  A senior source said the airport would not be completed by 
mid- 1997, but if works remained on schedule it should be 
finished about three months later. 
  Meanwhile, Meeting Point leader Fred Li said the government 
had agreed that the posts of the Airport Corporation Chairman 
and the Chief Executive should belong to two individuals. 
  A pro-democracy political faction urged the government to 
devise a stringent mechanism to control the charges and 
management of the future airport. 
  The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) 
submitted its last-minute recommendations on the Airport 
Corporation Bill to Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu 
yesterday following the closure of a two-month consultation 
period on the bill. 
  ADPL vice-chairman Leung Kwong-cheong said the government 
should establish an effective system to regulate the charges of 
the new airport. 
  He also suggested one-third of the corporation's Board of 
Directors should be directly elected legislators.

  [Text] Former Hong Kong permanent residents with foreign 
passports will lose the right of abode in the territory after 
1997, but will be provided privileges of free entry and 
unconditional stay upon return. 
  China's working group on transitional matters, the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), yesterday removed doubts 
over the right of abode after 1997 by issuing clear guidelines. 
  PWC members found ambiguity in the Basic Law over the 
definitions of permanent residence of the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR). 
  Under Article 24, section 1 of the Basic Law, Chinese 
citizens born in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of 
the SAR shall be permanent residents. 
  An argument arose whether Hong Kong-born Chinese who 
obtained 
foreign nationalities would be able to preserve their right of 
abode in Hong Kong according to Article 24 section 1. But the 
PWC ruled that the section would not be applicable to such 
people. 
  Speaking after the opening day of the PWC's public security 
group sessions in Beijing yesterday, the mainland group leader 
Wang Shuwen said people who obtained foreign nationalities were 
no longer regarded as Chinese citizens but as foreign citizens. 
Mr. Wang said Article 24, section 4 of the Basic Law was 
applicable to those who were no longer Chinese nationals but had 
returned to Hong Kong permanently. Section 4 set a requirement 
of seven years' continuous residence in Hong Kong for persons 
not of Chinese nationality to obtain the right of abode. 
  However, the SAR government would take a lenient attitude 
and 
would welcome returning migrants who were ethnic Chinese and 
were formerly permanent residents of Hong Kong. They would be 
allowed to enter the territory without visa requirements and 
stay and work in Hong Kong as long as they liked. 
  Hong Kong group leader Rita Fan said the members agreed 
returnees would automatically have the right of entry and the 
right of unconditional stay in Hong Kong. But they would not 
have the right to vote, the right to stand for elections or the 
right to social welfare in Hong Kong according to the Basic Law 
unless they regained permanent residence status. No consensus 
has yet been reached in the PWC on the methods of defining the 
seven years' continuous residence in the territory to regain the 
right of abode. 
  Mr. Wang revealed that four different views were expressed: 
  -- Seven years' residence in Hong Kong before moving to a 
foreign country should be counted; 
  -- The seven years' residence should not be counted if the 
person moved away from the territory more than once; 
  -- If a migrant returned to Hong Kong permanently within a 
certain period after the establishment of the SAR, seven years' 
residence in Hong Kong before emigration should be counted; 
  -- Seven years should be counted from a new beginning when a 
migrant returned to Hong Kong. 
  Mr. Wang said it was a very complicated issue and further 
studies would be needed to reach a conclusion.

  [Text] Beijing's advisory body on transitional issues has 
suggested that Hong Kong's chief executive heading the post-1997 
administration be chosen 18 months early -- in effect a shadow 
governor before the end of British rule. In deliberations in 
Beijing yesterday, the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) said 
Hong Kong's most senior bureaucrat in the post-1997 government 
would be chosen in increasingly difficult circumstances of 
Sino-British non-co-operation. The Beijing-appointed think-tank 
preparing for the post-1997 administration ruled that the future 
chief executive of the first Special Administration Region (SAR) 
be selected under special arrangements earlier than had been 
envisaged by either side. 
  The PWC's government and administration group leader Leung 
Chun-ying said the first chief executive should be selected 18 
months before the transfer of sovereignty. Mr Leung said there 
would be a chief executive selected before British rule of the 
territory ended because it was impossible to select a person on 
30 June 1997. He noted that there should be enough time for the 
chief executive-elect to prepare for the establishment of the 
SAR government. Mr Leung declined to comment on whether the 
selected person would affect the power of Britain's last 
colonial governor, Chris Patten. 
  Hong Kong PWC member Lau Siu-kai conceded it was inevitable 
that two power centres would be created through the early 
selection of a chief executive while the British-appointed 
governor was still in Hong Kong. Polarisation was inevitable 
but the duplication would also help to stabilise the confidence 
of the civil servants who would know earlier who they would be 
working for after the handover, Dr Lau said. 
  Under the Basic Law, the first SAR chief executive would be 
selected by 400-member Selection Committee by means of an 
election or consultation held in the territory. Dr Lau said the 
Basic Law gave an open interpretation to the formation of the 
Selection Committee and the method used to choose the chief 
exective. Therefore the Preparatory Committee set up in 1996 
would have more flexibility in forming the Selection Committee 
and in deciding the method of selection.

  [Text] The China-appointed Preliminary Working Committee 
said yesterday the Hong Kong Government's latest financing 
arrangements on the Chek Lap Kok airport and its associated rail 
link failed to address their concerns. 
  Speaking after a two-day session, Hong Kong co-convenor 
Nellie Fong Wong Kut-man said they were unhappy with the size of 
borrowings, since the level of $23 billion had gone beyond the 
threshold of $5 billion as stated in the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the airport projects. They urged the 
Government to count borrowings for the airport body and the 
airport railway as government debts. 
  Members also insisted that the land grant of the sites along 
the airport railway should be included in the annual land 
disposal programme, and a monitoring body to control 
construction costs should be set up, Mrs. Fong said. 
  Although the financing package failed to address their 
concerns, Mrs. Fong declined to say whether they had found the 
proposal unacceptable. She said they would like to see an early 
resumption of the airport experts' talks. Mrs. Fong said if the 
British/Hong Kong side maintained that debts for the airport 
body and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation should not be 
taken as government borrowings, it would not be possible for 
both sides to make any progress on the issue. 
  Another working committee member, Tam Yiu-chung, said they 
were worried that the Government might borrow another $5 billion 
on top of the $23 billion loans for airport and rail link if 
they were not taken as government debts. The Hong Kong 
Government has said that the $5 billion ceiling only applied to 
government borrowings and should not include borrowings by the 
two bodies. 
  The Chinese side co-convenor, Gao Shangquan, added that if 
the total amount of debts exceeded $5 billion, it should then be 
subject to negotiations between both sides. 
  A source close to the Chinese side said Beijing would like 
to 
see Britain make clear the size of debts which had gone beyond 
the $5 billion level and then formally seek Chinese approval for 
the extra borrowings. 
  Mr. Tam said they felt that the Government should be able to 
increase its cash injection in the airport projects given its 
strong fiscal reserves. 
  Mrs. Fong said the 58 hectares of land along the airport 
railway should not be granted in one go as requested by the 
British side. She said all land grants should be part of the 
Land Commission's land disposal programme. Mrs. Fong gave an 
assurance that China had already pledged to grant all 58 
hectares along the airport railway before 1997. 
  Asked if the Government should revise estimates on the land 
sale income along the rail link, Mrs. Fong said it was not a big 
problem because all the income would go to the public funds 
regardless of its source. Referring to reports about abuse of 
funds in the Provisional Airport Authority, Mrs. Fong said 
members felt it was necessary to form a monitoring group to 
control costs as well as to ensure progress of the construction 
works. She said the Airport Consultative Committee had failed 
to control costs of the airport projects.

  [Text] The offices of Hong Kong's leading political party 
have been bugged. Legislators with the United Democrats of Hong 
Kong (UDHK) revealed yesterday that bugging devices had been 
detected during counter-surveillance sweeps of the party's 
offices. UDHK elected member for Kowloon West, James To, told 
the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD that bugs had been found in the 
party's Kowloon head quarters and in the office of a UDHK 
legislator. 
  "When we set up our Kowloon office (on Nathan Road) near 
Prince Edward, we had a person go around with a field meter to 
try and detect any devices," he said. "The result was positive. 
That means there was a bug in the office. But we didn't hire 
anybody to remove the bug at that time since we had no secrets. 
When we tried the experiment on (legislator) Lau Chin-shek's 
office (in Tsim Sha Tsui), the pointer on the meter moved even 
more vigorously. That meant there were several devices in the 
room." 
  Mr Lau is director of the Christian Industrial Committee, an 
organisation that has been active in the pro-democracy movement 
since the 1970s. A mainlander by birth, he has close ties with 
leading Chinese dissidents, including trade union leader Han 
Dongfang, who was last year refused permission to reenter China. 
Mr Lau said yesterday that he believed he had been followed 
both in Hong Kong and in China. 
  During the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD's investigation into 
political bugging in Hong Kong, it was revealed that a bug had 
also been removed from a UDHK legislator's office in May last 
year. The latest development in political espionage in the 
territory follows last week's revelations that Australian spies 
had been hired by the British intelligence service MI6 to spy on 
Chinese political and commercial activities in Hong Kong. UDHK 
chairman Martin Lee admitted that security was a problem for the 
party. "At some stage last year we had a discussion because we 
were worried about security," he said. "I don't remember the 
details or what happened exactly." 
  Liberal Party legislator Selina Chow said her party did not 
take any special precautions beyond basic security measures. 
"It is difficult for us as a political organisation to be 
entirely full proof [as published]," she said. "We are 
conscious of possible problems but nothing has surfaced yet." 
  A recent investigation by the HONGKONG STANDARD revealed 
that 
espionage was becoming a serious problem for business and 
industry in Hong Kong. Listening devices have been found placed 
under desks, in telephones, light sockets, electrical plugs and 
in walls. Frank Knight, chairman of Asian Security and 
Investigation Services, said: "Certain organisations have the 
most superior equipment." He said such devices could pick up 
sounds 100 metres away. The signals could then be transmitted 
to a receiver outside the building. He said the point of a 
listening device placed in a wall need be no bigger than a pin 
head. Private investigation companies charge anything between 
$3,000 and $14,000 for counter-surveillance undertakings.
