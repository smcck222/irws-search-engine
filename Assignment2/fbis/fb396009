  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (AFP)--China's most celebrated 
dissident Wei Jingsheng was taken from his elder brother's house 
by Beijing police Friday morning, his secretary Tong Yi said by 
phone. He was taken away at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) by three police 
officers, Tong said, adding that Wei had telephoned later in the 
afternoon to tell her to cancel all his appointments for the 
next two days. According to Tong, Wei gave no indication as to 
why he had been picked up or when he would be released. 
  During a meeting in Beijing with U.S. Undersecretary of 
State 
John Shattuck last Sunday, Wei had called on the U.S. Government 
to take a tough stand with China over human rights. 
  Wei, 43, was released from prison on September 14, six 
months 
before the end of a 15-year sentence handed down in 1978 for 
counter-revolutionary activities. Wei played a leading role in 
the 1978 Democracy Wall movement when he called for full 
democracy in China and denounced senior leader Deng Xiaoping as 
a despot.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This 
reporter has learned from the relevant department in Beijing 
that Zhou Guoqiang [0719 0948 1730], who has colluded with 
hostile forces outside the border in carrying out lawbreaking 
activities such as opposing the government, instigating others 
to cause trouble, and disrupting social order, is today being 
interrogated by the public security organ which is acting 
according to law. 
  According to the relevant department, Zhou Guoqiang, 39, is 
a 
legal consultant with the Beijing Audio-Visual Equipment 
Company. He actively participated in the riots which were aimed 
at overthrowing the government in Beijing in 1989, and he was a 
member of the illegal "Autonomous Federation of Workers" 
organization. From June to September 1989 he was detained and 
interrogated, then released after writing a letter of 
repentance. But in recent years Zhou Guoqiang has continued to 
collude with hostile organizations and elements inside and 
outside the border to carry out activities against the 
government. In October 1993 Zhou held a meeting of members of 
illegal organizations and compiled articles instigating 
activities against the government; he then unlawfully held a 
reception for foreign reporters, to distribute those articles; 
and he also used a fax machine, which was illegally installed 
without applying for approval from the posts and 
telecommunications department, to send the articles to Hong 
Kong, in order to create some influence outside the border. 
This year, Zhou Guoqiang has actively planned to print a large 
number of "culture shirts [wen hua shan 2429 0553 5904]," which 
are aimed at causing discontent; he has also planned to 
distribute these "culture shirts" on 8 and 10 March when the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and the National People's Congress are 
under way, claiming that he wanted to "create as much influence 
as possible." He has also planned to sell these "culture 
shirts" in society on an extensive scale, to stir up discontent 
among the masses and disrupt social order.

  [Text] Beijing police yesterday detained the lawyer who 
helped the dissident unionist, Han Dongfang, file a lawsuit 
against the Chinese authorities. The lawyer was picked up for 
counter-revolutionary offences according to a semi-official news 
agency. 
  Zhou Guoqiang, 39, was held by public security officers for 
questioning over a series of alleged anti-government activities, 
the Hong Kong China News Agency (HKCNA) [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] 
said quoting sources from relevant departments in Beijing. 
  Unconfirmed reports said three other dissidents were taken 
away by police in Beijing early yesterday morning, including a 
Beijing University scholar, Yuan Hongbin, and a Beijing-based 
labour activist, Qian Yumin. The identity of the other 
dissident remained unclear. Last night, Shanghai police picked 
up dissident Bao Ge "for a chat", his family said. 
  The detentions raised fears of a fresh round of persecution 
of political dissidents to ensure stability as the annual 
session of the National People's Congress draws near. 
  The action coincides with a series of high-level meetings 
between senior U.S. official John Shattuck and Beijing officials 
on China's human rights. It will provide new ammunition for US 
congressmen who are campaigning for Washington to place greater 
pressure on China to improve its human rights record in order to 
secure an extension of its trade privileges. 
  Mr. Zhou is a close friend of Mr. Han, who was leader of the 
outlawed Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation, formed at the 
height of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations. 
  Mr. Han, who was prevented from entering China from Hong 
Kong 
after his expulsion late last year, claimed last night a 
large-scale crackdown against dissidents was underway. 
"Although this is not the first time they have taken Zhou away 
for questioning...they may have decided to put him behind bars 
for some time." 
  The unionist said the detention would cause a very bad 
impact 
on China's chance of renewing its Most Favoured Nation (MFN) 
trading status this year. "I am afraid the Chinese authorities 
do not really seem to care about the MFN now. It looks like 
they are rounding up people now so that they can release some 
when the time comes," he said. 
  The HKCNA report said Mr. Zhou had been involved in 
"collaboration with hostile forces outside the country" and 
unlawful anti-government activities incitement and disruption of 
social order. 
  Mr. Zhou is now the legal adviser at a audio-visual 
appliances company in Beijing. A member of the federation in 
1989, he was detained from June to September that year. He was 
later freed after showing an attitude of repentance, the report 
said. But "relevant departments" told the news agency that Mr. 
Zhou had continued to forge ties with unnamed foreign hostile 
forces to engage in anti- government activities. 
  It claimed that the dissident convened an unlawful meeting 
last October to compile an "anti-government article" and then 
held a press conference for foreign journalists. He was also 
accused of using an unregistered facsimile machine to send the 
article to Hong Kong, "creating a bad influence outside China", 
the HKCNA said. 
  Mr. Zhou joined a group of lesser-known dissidents in 
publishing a Peace Charter last October, calling for an 
improvement in human rights and the replacement of one-party 
rule with a multi-party system. At least three of the nine 
signatories of the charter have been detained for questioning by 
police. Only Qin Yongmin remains behind bars. He was sentenced 
to two years in a reform-through-education camp outside Wuhan 
earlier this year. 
  According to the HKCNA, Mr. Zhou had organised the 
production 
of a large number of "culture T-shirts" emblazoned with slogans. 
He had planned to distribute the T-shirts during the upcoming 
congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
annual sessions, it said. 
  According to Mr. Han the T-shirts prepared by Mr. Zhou and 
his friends mainly carried slogans concerning the labour 
movement in the mainland and were not for distribution during 
the congress. 
  "I understand they haven't yet printed those T-shirts. It's 
still cold in Beijing and they plan to sell them in the summer," 
he added.

  [Excerpt] Four prominent dissidents have been detained in 
Beijing in advance of next week's convening of the national 
legislature. 
  Two dissidents, Zhou Guoqiang, an outspoken member of the 
political reformist Peace Charter group, and Yuan Gongbing, an 
editor of a banned book, were arrested in the past two days for 
alleged illegal activities. 
  The arrests come at a time when a U.S. official in Beijing 
has claimed Chinese leaders may be considering again whether to 
abolish a law by which thousands of people have been made 
political prisoners. Dissident sources said police also picked 
up Qian Yumin, a fellow member of the Peace Charter group, early 
Wednesday morning and activist lawyer Wang Jiaqi. 
  The detention of Mr. Zhou was confirmed last night by the 
semi-official Hong Kong China News Agency, which said he was 
being investigated for his contacts with hostile overseas forces 
and anti- government activities. 
  Mr. Yuan, a Beijing University law lecturer, was arrested on 
Wednesday at his home in the city by police after a recent 
petition to the law committee under the standing committee of 
the National People's Congress (NPC). He was alleged to have 
committed criminal offences, a Chinese source told THE HONGKONG 
STANDARD. 
  Analysts believe the detentions are related to the opening 
of 
the legislature, which in the past has been marked by a 
tightening of security. The news agency said Mr. Zhou had 
planned to distribute "cultural T-shirts" with slogans airing 
grievances at next Thursday's opening of congress. In 1992, Mr. 
Yuan sued the government for banning his book, The Tide of 
History. The court refused to accept the case. 
  The arrests coincided with the current visit by United 
States 
Assistant Secretary for Human Rights John Shattuck to Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- China's ambitious plan 
to wipe out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and 
clothing shortages for its now-remaining 80 million 
poverty-stricken citizens, will certainly be realized as long as 
arduous efforts are made, Chinese president Jiang Zemin said 
here today. 
  Speaking at a national conference on poverty elimination, 
which was attended by Premier Li Peng and other senior Chinese 
leaders, Jiang said that the most important experience which 
China has gained from its progress in past poverty reduction is 
the shift of the poverty alleviation policy from merely material 
aid to comprehensive social and economic development strategy in 
poor areas. 
  Practice shows that a poverty reduction strategy which is 
market- oriented, relies on advancement of science and 
technology and exploitation of local resources, will not only 
provide enough food and clothes for the poverty-stricken people, 
but also a way to prosperity, said Jiang Zemin, who is also 
general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC). 
  He described the shift as fundamental and said it should be 
continued in a long period of time to come. 
  Elimination of poverty and common prosperity is the basic 
requirement of socialism and reflection of the advantages of a 
socialist system over others, he noted. 
  He pointed out that capable cadres should be selected and 
all 
walks of life should be mobilized to help poor areas. 
  The party leader also stressed the need for local people's 
self- reliance and arduous efforts in the nationwide poverty 
reduction drive. 
  Premier Li Peng said that it was an unshirkable historical 
responsibility of communists of his generation and people's 
governments of all levels to eliminate abject poverty by the 
year 2000, solving food and clothes shortages for the 80 million 
poor. 
  The plan is a strategic measure to gradually narrow the gaps 
between China's developed east and the developing west, he said. 
  The premier said that coastal areas and large and 
medium-sized cities, which have become relatively rich, should 
be encouraged to help the poor areas. 
  The central government should give adequate financial 
support 
to the poor areas, said Li. 
  He added that priority should be given to the poor areas 
when 
selecting a location for important investment projects. 
  The premier also spoke of the need to rationalize the 
pricing 
of raw materials and primary products, which will benefit the 
poor areas that are rich in resources. 
  Earlier, State Councillor Chen Junsheng announced on Monday 
at the meeting that the ambitious seven-year poverty reduction 
plan includes raising the annual net income of the majority of 
the 80 million people. 
  According to the plan, China will begin from this year to 
improve infrastructure construction in poor areas, solving 
drinking water shortages for the people and their domestic 
animals, making electricity available to most poor towns and 
connecting remote areas with national or regional road networks. 
  As part of the plan, China will improve the cultural, 
educational and public health levels in backward and poor areas, 
wipe out illiteracy among the young and middle-aged population, 
offer professional training to grown-ups and hold the natural 
population growth rate under the official limit. 
  "The realization of the plan will be of great significance. 
It will mean that the rights to subsistence of the Chinese 
people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population, 
will have been secured," said the state councillor, who is in 
charge of agriculture as well as China's poverty reduction 
efforts. 
  Most of the 80 million people are in remote mountain 
regions, 
rocky regions, loess plateau areas and remote deserts. 
  During the 1986-1992 period, poverty was eased among about 
45 
million poor people, an average of 6.8 million each year. 
  He disclosed that China will increase its investment in poor 
areas and has designated 582 counties as priority targets for 
poverty elimination. 
  China's poor had decreased from 125 million in 1986 to 80 
million in 1992.

<F P=106> [By Chang Mu (1728 3092): "To Implement Decision By the CPC </F>
Central Committee, the Government Work Report to NPC Session 
Will Announce a 20-Character Guideline"] 
  [Text] The Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC], scheduled for 10 March, is an important 
meeting designed to implement the "Decision on Several Issues 
Relating to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure" (the "50 Articles"), which was adopted by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to 
nominate 1994 as a year of crucial importance to reform. It is 
also a large- scale policymaking meeting designed to keep the 
economic growth momentum stable, strive for resumption of 
China's status as a GATT signatory state, expand cross-strait 
relations to make innovative advances, and accelerate the 
construction of the Shanghai, Bohai Bay, and Three-Gorges 
Projects. 
<H5>  Why Did All Party Elder Statesmen Make Public Appearances? </H5>
  The current session will place greater stress on the 
principle of "doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching 
equal importance to both," upholding social stability and the 
correct guidance of public opinion and, while taking economic 
construction as the center, maintaining the position of the CPC 
as a ruling party, ensuring the steady and orderly progress of 
political structural reform, and preventing the emergence of 
unnecessary social disturbances. Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, 
Peng Zhen, and other CPC elder statesmen made public appearances 
one after another before and after the Spring Festival. Let me 
keep comments on what effects their public appearances produced 
to one side for the time being. The public appearances were 
intended to clarify rumors about the leaders and stabilize the 
overall situation. 
<H5>  The New Stage of Rapid Growth </H5>
  In recent years, while maintaining a peaceful environment 
with surrounding countries and the rest of the world, the CPC 
has done its utmost to maintain the mainland's stability, 
prevent errors and ups and downs in policymaking, and to 
gradually improve the operational mechanism of the market 
economy by deepening economic structural reform to ensure 
implementation of Deng Xiaoping's line on reform and development 
and to strive for a relatively long period of sustained and 
rapid development. It is believed that this policy decision 
will certainly be accepted by the deputies of the NPC and 
members of the CPPCC National Committee. Nevertheless, there 
are bound to be lively discussions on such issues as reform 
intensity, development priorities, interest readjustment, 
anticorruption, and clean government. 
  During the last 10 days of February, Premier Li Peng held a 
State Council plenary session to solicit opinions on the 
"Government Work Report." Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the 
State Council Research Office, took charge of drafting the 
report. It is believed that after broadly soliciting the 
opinions of leaders of various party, government, and army 
departments, democratic parties and organizations, and various 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the report 
will undergo repeated revisions. The gist of the report 
is the 20-character principle guiding the work for 1994, which 
was decided by top CPC leaders through repeated discussions, the 
principle of: "Grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
wider, promoting development, and stabilizing the overall 
situation [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, guoda kaifang, cujin 
fazhan, wending daju 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 7245, 
2368 1129 7030 2397, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 4489 1353 1129 
1444]. This principle will be unchangeable. 
<H5>  Three Tasks for This Year </H5>
  It has been reported that the CPC authorities have made 
a plan for this year's economic development: The growth 
rate of the national economy will be 9 percent; the general 
level of retail price rises will be kept within 10 percent and 
the total amounts of currency issued and investment will be kept 
lower than last year's increased amounts; financial deficits 
will be minimized; and the previous quantitative type speed will 
be transformed into a combined speed and efficiency type and the 
planned economy based on quota management will be transformed 
into a market economic structure based on supply management. 
  Li Peng holds that the arrangements this year, 
though aggressive, allow room for maneuver. It is 
necessary to concentrate our attention on the overall 
development of the rural economy, efficient operation of 
state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises, and the 
intensification and improvement of macroeconomic regulation and 
control. To make proper arrangements to implement all the 
major reformatory measures with the aim of establishing and 
perfecting the macroeconomic regulation and control system, 
focus should be placed on the reform of the financial and 
taxation system and of the banking system; it is necessary to 
actively, steadily, and appropriately carry out price reform; 
and it is necessary to establish a modern enterprise system that 
suits the needs of the developing socialist market economy. 
  All countries believe that China is bound to emerge as a 
first- rate world power in the next century so long as it can 
keep the momentum of wholesome development. The American 
scholar of Chinese descendant and Nobel Prize for Physics winner 
Chen-ning Young said: If China has the qualified personnel it 
needs, can maintain discipline, be determined, and has economic 
support, it will enjoy greater development. For China, the 
first three conditions mentioned above are available in this 
century. I am confident that all the four conditions will be 
available by the 21st century. For this reason I am absolutely 
optimistic about China's prospects for development of science 
and technology in the 21st century. 
<H5>  Seeking a Balance Between Reform and Stability </H5>
  The CPC higher leadership maintains that the most 
important task for the forthcoming NPC session is seeking a 
harmonious relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. While putting forward a major reform plan, it 
is necessary to properly solve the problem concerning relations 
between the central authorities, on the one hand, and localities 
and various departments, on the other; to avoid widening the gap 
in income between different localities and strata; to persist in 
the long-term effort to fight corruption and promote clean and 
honest government; to cope with local eventualities; and to 
conscientiously improve public security and social order. 
CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee members Li Peng and Zhu 
Rongji, and other policy-makers, have reiterated time and 
again: the workload will be very heavy this year, and 
there will be quite a lot of difficulties. One must be fully 
mentally prepared for this. It is necessary for us to work more 
cautiously and in a down-to-earth manner. We must solve, 
through reform, new problems arising in our way ahead. 
Reform is the means, development is our goal, and 
stability is the basis. We must make every effort to 
stabilize the market, make things convenient for people in their 
daily life, and satisfy people's daily needs. Once the supply 
of daily subsistence to the people is not ensured, the community 
will become unstable. At the moment, we are facing an excellent 
situation. But in the meantime, we have seen a lot of "sparks" 
too. For instance, evacuation of residents from one site to 
another and the migrant laborer tide, as well as other 
incidents, may very easily arouse chaos if we fail to pay enough 
attention to them on the outset. 
<H5>  Public Opinion Should Be Prepared To Be Favorable to Reform </H5>
  The CPC held a national meeting on ideological and 
propaganda 
work in late January. This was not only the first meeting of 
this sort ever held over the past 15 years since the reform and 
opening up process was initiated, but also the most important 
national conference on ideology held since 1957. Jiang Zemin, 
Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen, who is a member of the 
CPC Political Bureau and the director of the CPC Central 
Committee Propaganda Department, all delivered important 
speeches at the meeting. All of them stressed that propaganda 
should mainly be dedicated to positive aspects, and should serve 
economic construction, and it is necessary to pay attention to 
the efforts to guide public opinion and safeguard a political 
situation characterized by stability and unity. 
  Deng Xiaoping repeatedly reminded his colleagues: "We 
certainly must attach great importance to work on the 
ideological front, this must be done conscientiously and in real 
earnest, and it brooks no slackness." "The work on the 
ideological front as a whole must be intensified." He demanded 
that the party's leading organ devote most of the time and 
resources to ideological and political work, while taking charge 
of formulation and implementation of principles and policies and 
employment of important cadres. At present, as China is 
shifting from the planned economy to the market economy, cadres 
at different levels have somewhat slackened ideological and 
political work, and some problems regarding party style and 
general social mood badly need to be dealt with. Jiang 
Zemin pointed out: Many party members have failed to keep 
up with the new situation, meet the requirements of new tasks, 
and keep abreast of rapidly developing and changing objective 
reality. Some party members are wavering in their ideals and 
faith, and swerving from their former world outlook and value 
concepts, while indulging in money worship, creature comforts, 
and extreme egoism. Corrupt practices, such as seeking personal 
interests by abusing official power, graft, and bribery, have 
been spreading. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen and 
improve education for party members. It is necessary to 
strengthen education with specific aims in mind, uphold the 
principle of integration of positive teaching and 
self-education, uphold the principle of education according to 
the needs of different types of folks and different strata, and 
uphold the principle of integration of intensifying education, 
tightening administration, and strictly enforcing party 
discipline. The CPC authorities demand that ideological 
and propaganda work does not create confusion nor cause trouble, 
but helps promote economic construction and other works by 
enlisting popular support. A million-strong force composed of 
theoreticians, journalists, publishers, writers, artists, and 
grass-roots propagandists will be formed to serve as the 
propeller for reform and opening up. 
  The rural economy in Shandong province has grown 
substantially in recent years. The key to the province's 
success is said to lie in intensification of socialist education 
in rural areas. This year the province is to start its fourth 
round of rural socialist education drive. The province has been 
praised by the CPC higher leadership for efforts in this aspect. 
This indicates that the CPC is striving very hard to retain the 
socialist system with a view to securing its ruling party status 
in the long run and preventing a Soviet-type political avalanche 
and political evolution. It cannot be denied that this attempt 
to stabilize the political situation has been quite effective, 
owing to the success in the economic structural reform and 
marvelous achievements in economic construction. 
  This year is the crucial year to determine the prospects for 
reform in China through the turn of the century. Deeply 
impressed by their past experience in reform, CPC leaders noted 
that whenever a major reform of a deep-rooted structure is to be 
launched, some members of the public will always anticipate 
another round of price hikes, thus starting another round of 
panic purchasing. In this connection, Zhu Rongji demanded that 
leading cadres at all levels concentrate their efforts on 
publicizing and explaining the major reform measures that were 
to be introduced, properly prepare public opinion for reform, 
dismiss misgivings among the public, iron out conflicts and 
resolve problems, enlist the support of the broad masses of 
people for reform, and encourage them to play a part in reform. 
<H5>  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Is a Gordian Knot </H5>
  At present, for the CPC, the Gordian knot of the reform 
still 
lies in whether a macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism 
can be perfected. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "To make the 
reform a success, we must carry it out in an organized and 
orderly manner. If we fail to do so, the reform will be plunged 
into chaos, and everybody will act his own way. This just 
cannot be tolerated." And, "to achieve macroeconomic regulation 
and control, the central authorities must do what they have said 
they would do." "If the CPC central leadership and the State 
Council have no authority, they will not be able to keep the 
situation under control." Now that we are introducing the 
tax division system and reforming the monetary investment 
structure, the existing interests distribution pattern will no 
doubt undergo a massive restructuring. In the latter half of 
last year, the macroeconomic regulation and control operation 
under Zhu Rongji's leadership curbed some symptoms of overheated 
economic growth and stopped the trend toward "bubble economy" 
stemming from the craze in real estate and development zone 
projects. Since the "pumping-the-brake" and "soft landing" 
strategies were adopted, drastic economic growth and slumps were 
avoided and tremendous losses were saved. However, this has not 
fundamentally changed the existing investment, banking, 
financial and taxation structures under macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and the country's capital investment scale remains 
colossal. It is reported that 15 international airports are 
going to be built in the Zhu Jiang Delta area alone. These are 
duplicate construction projects, and running so many projects at 
the same time is beyond the country's financial capacity. 
  Zhu Rongji said: This year, we still have to 
continue to intensify and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures, and then we will develop a regulation and 
risk-control mechanism for investments in fixed assets. The CPC 
authorities have decided to assign the newly founded National 
Development Bank to exercise centralized control over the volume 
of credit extended to finance capital construction projects and 
key basic industrial projects. Those projects that have been 
suspended and put off as ordered last year must not be restarted 
without approval. This year, in principle, no more applications 
for starting new projects will be approved. On the other hand, 
all localities and departments are required to adopt practical 
and effective measures to tighten macroeconomic regulation and 
control of investment; they must concentrate their financial and 
material resources to ensure completion of key projects; they 
must prevent further expansion of construction scale--any 
organizations which have started projects without approval, and 
their people in charge as well, will be held responsible for 
their acts; no financial institutions are allowed to divert 
inter-bank loans they have in hand to finance any fixed asset 
investment projects; it is necessary to strengthen regular 
administration over the capital market, and no financial 
institutions are allowed to expand the scale of bond 
distribution and the scope of joint-stock system pilot projects; 
investments in real estate construction projects and the 
financing of such projects must be put under the state plan 
regarding investment in fixed assets and related financing; it 
is also necessary to strengthen guidance and regular 
administration for direct investment projects run by foreign 
businessmen. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of 
seeking truth from facts and that of acting according to one's 
capacity, set store by efficiency and returns, and always bear 
in mind the country's overall interests. 
  Of course, it is necessary to make every effort and 
concentrate all resources available to accomplish those 
infrastructure projects that have a bearing on the overall 
interests and are to meet the urgent needs of economic 
development. It is the CPC higher leadership's belief that only 
in this way will China be able to seize the opportunity; will it 
be able to plan, run, and manage infrastructure projects well in 
a centralized manner, based on a rational distribution; and thus 
squeeze the greatest returns possible out of the socialist 
economy. 
  Judging from the present situation, the Pudong 
development of Shanghai, the economic zones situation on the rim 
of the Bohai Bay, and the 3-gorges project are eye-catching key 
projects and hot topics. 
  Under Deng Xiaoping's direct concern and encouragement, 
Shanghai municipal leadership has proposed speeding reforms and 
development, has taken the lead in constructing a socialist 
market economic operating mechanism, and is spearheading reform 
and opening up in an attempt to turn Shanghai into one of the 
centers of international economy, finance, and trade. Municipal 
leaders have also said that they would "train 100 
high-ranking party and government leading cadres, 1,000 
high-level management talents, and a large number of various 
experts." 
<H5>  The "Treasury Vault" Around Bohai Bay </H5>
  The Bohai Bay Rim region includes the six provinces and 
cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, and 
Shanxi, all of their economic achievements and growth rates 
ranking first in the country. The average GDP of this region is 
well over four times the national average; its average social 
output value is 4.5 times higher than the national average. 
Turnover of its major ports account for 38 percent of the 
national volume; steel output 37 percent; crude oil output 41 
percent; and agricultural output 24 percent, while it has only 
18 percent of the country's farmland. Experts around the world 
look at the Bohai Bay rim region as a "treasury vault" with the 
greatest value for future economic development. The total 
deposits of iron, petroleum, and natural gas, and three of the 
110 kinds of minerals discovered so far, respectively account 
for 44 percent, 37 percent, or 24 percent of the country's 
totals; while deposits of gold and diamonds amount respectively 
to 20 percent and 97 percent of the country's totals. Here there 
is a first-rate air, sea, and land transport network, and here 
is the golden zone connecting East and North Asia, not to 
mention the 4.2 million or so scientists and technologists, who 
make the region a place with the highest concentration of 
scientific and technological talents in the country. The 
Bohai Bay rim zone is estimated to become the "spearhead" for 
economic development in China's northern region. 
  The 3-gorges hydropower nexus project--reputed to be a 
first- 
class world engineering feat--is now in the early-phase work 
preparatory stage. Development, resettlement, investment, 
works, and management offices have moved onto the site, and the 
official inauguration of construction is not far away. Li Peng 
stressed that it is a world first-class project and must have 
first-class work quality and modern management. 
<H5>  Legislature No Longer a Rubber-stamp </H5>
  As a range of significant reformist programs are going to be 
unveiled this year, corresponding legislative work has also 
picked up speed; especially reformist legislation revolving 
around the construction of a modern corporate system, finance, 
taxation, banking, foreign trade, and the planned investment 
system; and establishing a market circulation and social 
security system--all these will be submitted to the National 
People's Congress [NPC] and its standing committees for 
deliberation. This will correct the phenomenon where 
legislation work falls behind. 
<H5>  Why Was the Meeting Advanced </H5>
  There have been reports that the bills the current NPC will 
deliberate on include "a state budget law," "protection for 
Taiwan businessmen's investment," and so on. A casual perusal 
will tell us that the Eighth NPC session had been advanced more 
than once from the date when it was usually convened in the 
past--it has been moved from the second to the first half of 
March. It is understood that the reason behind this was that 
the NPC session last year did not end until the middle and 
second half of April, and almost six months had passed before 
delegates returned to their provinces, cities, and counties. 
From this we know that the state plan and financial revenue and 
expenditure budget had been conveyed to all levels when it was 
being tabled at the NPC. The deliberation and adoption of the 
budget at the session therefore did give one the feeling of a 
"rubber stamp." Many NPC delegates shared such a view. And 
strengthening NPC legislative functions is one of the major 
agendas in Deng Xiaoping's political reforms. Slowly advancing 
the NPC session convening date to such a time, when effective 
supervision can be pursued over the annual economic plan 
proposed by the State Council--this is aimed at establishing the 
authority of the country's highest legislature. There have been 
reports that in the future the convocation of the NPC session 
may be advanced to as early as early in the year.

<F P=106> [By Cheng Teh-Lin (6774 1795 2651): "Deng Xiaoping Hopes </F>
That Retired Cadres Will Not Try to Earn Extra Income"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Deng Cautions Others Against Exaggerating His 
Contributions </H3>
  According to a source, when meeting with party, government, 
and military leaders during his stay in Shanghai from last 
December to this February, Deng Xiaoping again and again urged 
them not to blow out of proportion his part in promoting China's 
reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  Deng said that it was mainly the leadership exercised and 
the 
part played by the collective comprising the party Central 
Committee, the Standing Committee, and the Political Bureau that 
made possible the rapid economic growth of the last two years 
(1992 and 1993). 
  My opinions, including my office's opinions, are for 
reference of the central authorities and the departments 
concerned only, he said, adding that while those opinions which 
are correct, reasonable, and positive could be seen as good 
suggestions, those which are not on the right track, do not fit 
in with China's actual conditions, and are unpracticable, should 
be shelved, and those which are incorrect should be criticized. 
He told them not to treat his opinions as directives. Only the 
resolutions adopted by the central authorities can be regarded 
as directives, he said. 
  "I am a member of the party, so I must unconditionally 
submit 
myself to the party central committee in words and deeds," he 
stated. 
<H3>  Deng Hopes Veteran Cadres Will Continue to Display Party 
Spirit </H3>
  Deng continued: "I consider it important for a party member, 
especially leading party and government leaders, to display 
party spirit and observe party discipline. If local party and 
government leaders are not pure in party spirit and not strict 
in discipline, they can achieve nothing even if the line and 
policies are correct. This is a common occurrence, so it is 
necessary to guard against it. 
  When meeting with a number of veteran cadres in Shanghai in 
early February, Deng said: "We have gone into retirement now, 
but we must not indulge in seeking ease and comfort. We should 
do something solid for the party including propagating its 
policies. We must not go too far in our words and deeds and 
must see to it that our family members and relatives behave 
well, because this is what the party expects of its members. We 
must not earn extra money by obtaining nominal positions or 
titles everywhere and attending ceremonies. The present party 
leadership holds us in high esteem simply because we have made 
contributions in the past. We must treasure our past and all 
the more respect and support the incumbent leadership. I hope 
you will set strict demands on yourselves, conduct yourselves 
with dignity, and continue displaying party spirit. 
<H5>  Macrocontrol Is Not an Expedient Measure </H5>
  When speaking about central macrocontrol in Shanghai, Deng 
said: "Strengthening central macrocontrol is a long-term policy 
adopted by the central authorities. It is not a personal 
decision, nor an expedient measure. Some local cadres thought 
themselves clever in claiming that it is an expedient policy. 
This shows they are not pure in party spirit and lack a sense 
of organization and discipline. In this way they tend to make 
big mistakes. The central authorities should criticize such 
cadres. They should dismiss and punish those cadres who incur 
losses producing great undesirable impact, because such cadres 
must not sit on the leading body any more. If they violate the 
law, they must be punished according to law. Otherwise, the 
central policies and decisions will not be implemented in full 
and the authority of the central authorities will suffer.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- At a symposium on Deng 
Xiaoping Thought on Education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang 
6772 1420 1627 2403 5148 1835 1927] today, Li Lanqing, member of 
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 
Vice-Premier, pointed out: To study, publicize, and put into 
practice Deng Xiaoping thought on education are important tasks 
for China's educational and theoretical communities; they are 
also the basic requirements for party and government leaders at 
all levels in upgrading their leadership ability over the 
modernization drive. 
  The symposium, which was sponsored by the Research Center of 
Educational Development [RCED] of the State Education 
Commission, is aimed at studying and understanding Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping thought on education [deng xiao ping tong zhi de jiao 
yu si xiang 6772 1420 1627 0681 1807 4104 2403 5148 1835 1927], 
and discussing how to implement the "Outlines of Educational 
Reform and Development in China". 
  In his speech Li Lanqing said: Education makes up a very 
important part of the treasure-house and overall strategy of 
Deng Xiaoping's theory [deng xiao ping li lun bao ku 6772 1420 
1627 3810 6158 1405 1655]. In probing ways -- and finding an 
answer on how to -- solidify, develop, and build socialism, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always treated education as one of the 
strategic issues which is of vital importance to the overall 
situation of China's socialist construction and the historical 
fate of socialism. He personally took charge of educational 
work, published a series of brilliant writings and statements, 
and formed well-developed educational theories with Chinese 
characteristics and the features of the times, which developed 
into a scientific theoretical basis and powerful ideological 
weapon for guiding China's educational reform and development. 
  Li Lanqing said: To lay a solid foundation for the 
modernization drive, we must make the study of Deng Xiaoping 
thought on education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang] the 
component part of the study and implementation of the theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Leadership at 
all levels should take the lead and inspire popular enthusiasm 
for such a study so that education will truly be carried out as 
a strategic priority of socialist modernization; will serve 
socialist construction better; and education and socialist 
construction will -- as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said -- complement 
one another and advance in harmony. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: In studying Deng Xiaoping thought on 
education [deng xiao ping jiao yu si xiang], we should, first of 
all, study his far-sighted strategic perspective encompassing 
the overall situation and his approach of stressing, reforming, 
and developing education from the high plane of socialist 
construction. On these fundamental issues in particular -- on 
which the destiny of the state and nations hinges -- Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping established education as a strategic priority in 
socialist modernization. He held that we should exercise 
patience on other aspects, or even sacrifice some speed, in 
order to make a success of educational work. His theses 
represent not only a major breakthrough in educational theory 
but also in the theory of socialist construction. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's approach to 
China's educational problems is one that tackles, from the high 
plane of ideology, theory, and strategy, the issues in terms of 
direction, course, and general policy; and, at the same time, 
lays special emphasis on increasing input into education, 
improving the material benefits and political treatment of 
intellectuals, and helping solve practical problems like housing 
shortages faced by teachers. He also proposed that he himself 
be assigned the job of providing logistics support for the 
development of education, science and technology, a fact that 
testifies to his determination as a party leader to solve the 
numerous practical problems facing education. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping has set a glorious example for us. He has taught us by 
his own actions how to exercise leadership over education and 
how to make China's education a success. Li Lanqing stressed: 
We are running the world's largest education enterprise in a 
poor, economically undeveloped country. We are faced with 
numerous practical problems. Only by solving these problems one 
by one in a down-to-earth manner and with perseverance will we 
be able to ensure quick, sound development of our educational 
undertakings. 
  Lei Jieqiong and Wang Guangying, vice chairmen of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and 
leaders of relevant departments including Zhu Kaixuan, Pang 
Xianzhi, Liu Ji, Li Qi, and Hu Zhaoguang attended the symposium 
held in the Great Hall of the People. Officials from the 
Central Party Literature Research Center, the RCED, the Academy 
of Social Sciences, and Central Party School; scholars and 
experts from the educational community; and officials from 
Dalian's Huada Corporation conducted academic exchanges at the 
symposium.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Proposals put forward 
by members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC), non-communist parties and other relevant 
people's organizations across the country have been well 
received. 
  Information from relevant departments reveals that by 
February 15 of this year, 1,881 out of the 1,900 items put 
forward by CPPCC members and members of non-communist parties 
since the First Session of the Eighth National Committee of the 
CPPCC have been answered through concerted work of 157 
organizations, including the Chinese Communist Party central 
community [as received] and the State Council. 
  This accounts for 99 percent of the total number of matters 
put forward. 
  Many of the proposals, which concentrated on the reform, 
opening- up and modernization drive, on the establishment of a 
socialist market economy, on strengthening the ideological and 
cultural build- up, as well as the construction of a clean 
government and the improvement of the Communist Party's working 
style have been accepted by relevant departments. 
  For instance, many CPPCC members submitted ideas and 
proposals for a fair, rational tax rating and taxation system, 
in a bid to concentrate the central government's power of 
taxation and strengthen its management. 
  On the basis of this proposal, the Central Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party and the State Council decided to 
implement a new financial system of tax assignment starting this 
year. 
  Practice proves that over the past year, CPPCC members, non- 
Communist Party members, and relevant people's organizations 
have been playing an increasingly greater role in carrying out 
the spirit of the 14th National Congress of the CPC, deepening 
reform, promoting economic and social development, and for 
solidifying unity and stability, by way of putting forward 
proposals to perform their function of political consulting and 
democratic supervision.

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- More non-communists 
and members of non-communist parties have been invited to be 
special supervisors to oversee the work of the Beijing Municipal 
Government and Communist Party Committee in a bid to build a 
clean government. 
  The 14 newly-selected special supervisors, who come from all 
walks of life, received their letters of appointment at a 
meeting on special supervision work here yesterday afternoon and 
will start their duties soon. 
  This was the third group of the kind since the special 
supervision system was established by the municipal government 
four years ago. 
  These supervisors will take part directly in the city's 
clean 
government construction drive, in investigating serious cases 
and in studying of issues of city administration and major 
policy-making, in line with the relevant stipulations framed by 
the municipal government. 
  Previously there were more than 130 non-communists engaged 
in 
the special supervision work at all government levels in the 
city. 
  At the meeting Mayor Li Qiyan lauded the great achievements 
and contributions the supervisors have made to the city's clean 
government drive and anti-corruption campaign over the past few 
years. 
  He also urged the municipal party committee, the government 
and people's congress, as well as people of all walks of life, 
to give firm support to the supervisors' work. 
  State Councilor Chen Xitong and other senior leaders from 
the 
municipal government and party committee also attended the 
meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Leading officials from 
15 key ministries pledged to do their part in implementing the 
central government's plan to wipe out abject poverty by the year 
2000. 
  The ministries, including major economic decision-makers, 
told the National Conference on Poverty Reduction that they will 
continue to support economic and social development in poor 
areas, making water, electricity, education, roads and 
telecommunications services available to China's 80 million 
poverty-stricken citizens. 
  Chen Yaobang, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission 
(SPC), said that SPC will continue to give priority to the poor 
areas in industrial and agricultural planning, investment 
allocation and material distribution. 
  Most of the 80 million poor live in remote mountainous 
regions, plateau areas and remote deserts, making it an arduous 
task to produce enough food, have adequate drinking water and 
access to electricity, and provide education and health services. 
  Despite the difficulties, the minister said he is optimistic 
about the completion of the poverty reduction plan. 
  The experience China has gained from past poverty reduction 
efforts, the growing awareness of the whole society and 
expanding international cooperation, will help fulfill the task. 
  Vice-minister of Finance Li Yanling promised to increase 
investment to the best of the ministry's ability. 
  According to Vice-Minister of Power Industry Lu Yancha, 120 
million people had no access to electric power by 1992. 
  Under a plan drawn up by the ministry, the majority of all 
the towns and villages will have access to electric power, 
making it available to 95 percent of rural families. 
  Vice-Minister of Communications Li Juchang said that 
inaccessibility is one of the major causes for the backwardness 
in poverty-stricken areas. 
  The huge potential for economic development in China's vast 
poor areas, which are rich in land, mineral, forest, labor and 
tourism resources, cannot be tapped without convenient 
communications, the minister said. 
  Vice-Minister of Water Resources Zhou Wenzhi promised that 
water conservancy departments will step up the construction of 
water supply projects in rural areas and work hard to complete 
the task set by the central government to solve the drinking 
water shortage for the majority of the poor and their domestic 
animals. 
  Officials from other ministries, such as the Ministry of 
Telecommunications, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, 
the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Labor, also 
announced their plans to help the poor areas.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China's 1993 population 
natural growth rate turned out to be a record low of 11.45 per 
thousand, officials sources said today. 
  The record low rate was achieved between a 18.09 per 
thousand 
birth rate and a 6.64 per thousand death rate in the same year. 
The sources said the death rate is also at one of the lowest 
level since 1949. 
  By the end of 1993, China had a population of 1.18517 
billion, which was 13.46 million more than in 1992, the sources 
said. 
  The sources attributed the drop in the death rate to the 
rise 
in people's living standards and quality, and the improvement of 
health care for women, children and the aged. 
  In 1993, the average income of urban residents went up 10.2 
percent over 1992, and that of rural residents by 3.2 percent. 
The number of hospital beds rose by 1.9 percent and medical 
professionals by 1.1 percent in the same period, the sources 
added.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Approval of the latest 
Beijing development blueprint by the Chinese State Council has 
unveiled a vision of a new modern world metropolis at the end of 
the century. 
  The State Council stressed the importance of Beijing as the 
capital of the People's Republic of China and the country's 
political and cultural center. 
  The blueprint, published together with the approval by the 
municipal government last month, maps out the course of the 
building of the city into a cultural and economic center with 
first-class public utilities, infrastructure facilities and 
living environment. 
  It also calls for important government buildings and 
cultural 
institutions to be located in downtown areas, such as along the 
north-south axis of the city, Chang'an Boulevard and the second 
ring road. 
  Buildings relegated to this class include the economic and 
trade office of the State Council, the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, Communications and Culture, the National Grand Theater 
and National Women's Center. 
  According to the city's layout for 1991-2010, the future 
urban construction will place emphasis on the characteristics of 
the capital, and on the adjustment of the industrial structures 
and the use of land. 
  Start-ups of new heavy industrial plants, especially big 
power- consumers and those that may cause serious water and air 
pollution, will no longer be allowed in urban districts. 
Meanwhile, the existing ones would not be expanded. 
  The total population of permanent residents in the city will 
be brought under stricter control, to a limit of 12.5 million by 
the year 2010. 
  Air, water, garbage and noise pollution will be reduced 
drastically in the coming 20 years, with the aim of making 
Beijing a pollution-free city by the year 2010. 
  The document stipulates that all environmental quality 
indices will reach the government's standard in that period. 
  The city will cut its use of coal greatly in the coming two 
decades by piping natural gas in from Shaanxi and Gansu 
Provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest 
China. 
  In addition, several hydroelectric power stations will be 
built to supply heat to most of the urban residents who still 
use coal for heating. 
  The emission of exhaust gas will be put under control to 
further reduce air pollution. 
  People in Beijing will also be drinking cleaner water, as 
major reservoirs and underground water sources will be better 
protected. The city also plans to build 16 new sewage-treatment 
plants in the next 20 years. 
  Meanwhile, more trees will be planted, and ecological zones, 
shelterbelts and parks will be built in the urban areas. By 
2010 the total green land will climb to 6,400 ha [hectares] from 
3,00 ha at present. The forest coverage will rise to 40 percent. 
  Officials say that Beijing has achieved major progress in 
environmental protection over the past few years. So far, some 
25 percent of urban sewage is treated before it is discharged 
into rivers, and the forest coverage rate in the urban areas has 
reached 30.7 percent. 
  The document also urges a quickening of the pace of the 
urban 
infrastructure modernization drive. The focus will be on the 
expansion of the city's transportation, including subways, light 
rail traffic and expressways. 
  As a city with a long history and serving as the capital of 
several dynasties, the future construction will also be 
integrated with the brilliant culture of the nation. Beijing's 
cultural relics and scenic spots will be better protected, 
according to the blueprint.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Cities Set Looser Rules on Residency"] </F>
  [Text] Several cities and provinces have adopted policies 
that relax control over where people can live and work. 
  By giving cards to non-residents, these areas hope to 
attract 
more investors and workers. 
  Shanghai has issued a Blue Seal Card to investors and a 
Labour Permit Card to rural residents. A county in Beijing has 
also issued the Blue Seal Card. 
  A Blue Seal Card carrier enjoys the same benefits that a 
permanent resident, or a Red Seal Card holder, receives in 
housing and education. 
  Meanwhile, Shandong Province has allowed some farmers to 
change their census title from "peasant" to urban dweller," 
aiming to attract more farmers to work in factories and 
businesses in small cities. 
  The change gives them all the entitlements of a city 
resident. 
  Many towns in provinces such as Shaanxi in North China, have 
also introduced similar measures. 
  The policies are aimed at reforming the country's old census 
system, rigidly enforced since the 1950s, that divides people 
into "farmers" and "urbanites" to strictly control the 
population flow into cities. 
  Farmers who are not city residents are not eligible for 
subsidized housing and school fees. 
  But China's fast economic growth in the past decade has 
lured 
many farmers into cities to seek more money. 
  And when cities began eliminating grain coupons last years 
farmers began flocking to urban centres. 
  Incomplete statistics show that more than 50 million rural 
workers seek jobs in cities or towns each year, a sign many 
think is conducive to China's booming economy. 
  Shanghai has 2.5 million migrant workers that account for a 
seventh of its population. 
  This population pressure has pushed city governments to 
reform their census systems. 
  Shanghai and Beijing's Pinggu County took the lead by 
introducing Blue Seal Cards to foreign and domestic investors. 
  Shanghai's Blue Seal Card system started on February 1. 
  Those qualified for the card include: 
  -- foreigners who operate enterprises for two or more years 
with an investment of more than $200,000; 
  -- foreigners who buy commercial apartments larger than 100 
square metres: 
  -- domestic investors who pump at least 1 million yuan 
($115,000) into the city over a two-year span; 
  -- technical workers from the inland who have worked in the 
city for more than three years. 
  Blue Seal Card holders can eventually apply to be a 
permanent 
resident, giving them the additional right to vote in city 
elections. 
  In Beijing, eastern Pinggu County has the same policies, 
although investment requirements are lower. 
  The card is given to foreign investors who inject $150,000, 
residents from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan who invest 200,000 
yuan ($22,988) and domestic investors who pour in 100,000 yuan 
($11,494). 
  In another development, an official from the Public Security 
Ministry said over the weekend that several ministries under the 
State Counci] are drafting a plan to reform the country's census. 
  The plan is expected to be released during the first half of 
the year. 
  The official declined to give further details. 
  Many analysts say the census changes will encourage farmers 
seeking more money to settle in small cities and townships 
rather than big cities. Mainly because of the closer proximity 
townships are to their hometowns.

  [Text] The China Daily Group of Newspapers yesterday took 
another major step in going electronic for global desktop 
delivery. 
  Authoritative business-oriented news in English published in 
the China Daily, the Business Weekly, Tender Announcements in 
English, and the Shanghai Star will be conveniently accessible 
on the same day of publication from the reader's computer, 
whether in the office, at home, or on the road. 
  This state-of-the-art technology in print media delivery is 
made available in co-operation with IBNet, a globally accessible 
telecomputing service dedicated to facilitating international 
trade, investment and strategic co-operation. 
  The China Daily Group has been quick to adopt new electronic 
technology in the print media. 
  Since June 1, 1992, subscribers to DataTimes, a database 
network corporation based in Oklahoma City, the United States, 
have been able to access China Daily staff-written stories, 
features, commentaries and CD News items. 
  On August 15 last year, the China Daily Group of Newspapers 
signed an agreement with Reuters Limited. Under the deal, 
subscribers of Reuters Historic Text Products division and 
Reuters third party distributors receive political, economic, 
finance and business reports published by the China Daily 
newspaper group. 
  Subscribers to this service will be able to retrieve news 
stories from the China Daily Group up to a period of 12 months, 
thus eliminating the need to maintain one's own reference 
library.

<F P=106> ["Short commentary": "An Important Task for Maintaining </F>
Social Stability"] 
  [Text] Reforming criminals and educating law-breaking 
youth through labor is a consistent policy of the party and the 
state. Making proper arrangements for people who have been 
released after serving prison sentences or who have been 
relieved of reform- through-labor terms and giving them help and 
education, so that they can truly be reformed, is the 
continuation of the effect of this policy. The practice in many 
areas proves that wherever this task is given adequate 
attention, the effect is always good and crime can be reduced; 
in areas where such people do not receive proper arrangements 
and help and education, there is a high recidivism rate and some 
of them go on to commit bigger crimes, seriously jeopardizing 
social wellbeing. In the new context of the establishment of a 
socialist market economic system, this task involves many new 
conditions and new problems. It is necessary to carry on with 
the good methods that have proved effective on the one hand, and 
to keep improving work methods on the other. Six central 
departments, including the Central Committee for Comprehensive 
Management of Social Security, put forward working 
recommendations [gong zuo yi jian 1562 0155 1942 6015] for 
solving this problem after investigation and research. This is 
of great significance to maintaining social stability. 
  Helping those who have been released after serving prison 
sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor 
terms to find means of livelihood is a key link in preventing 
recidivism. It is necessary to support and assist them in 
seeking jobs on their own; and to encourage enterprises and 
various kinds of economic entities to accept and give employment 
to such people. Meanwhile, appeals have been made for all 
circles in society to show concern for and take part in 
providing placement, help, and education, so that such people 
can find means of livelihood and employment. 
  Those who have been released after serving prison sentences 
or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms enjoy, 
by law, citizens' rights and should perform their obligations as 
citizens. In job placement, housing distribution, and provision 
of social relief, they should be treated in the same way as 
anyone else without being discriminated against. Meanwhile, we 
should also recognize that a considerable proportion of them do 
have much difficulty in finding employment and should be given 
some special care. They still have some mental obstacles to 
overcome, so education for them should be strengthened. In this 
sense, those who have been released after serving prison 
sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor 
terms are a special social group. To give them more assistance 
and education and help them narrow and eliminate the gap they 
feel in a social and psychological sense after they return to 
society as quickly as possible is the common responsibility of 
the whole society. Naturally, however, while stepping up our 
efforts to make arrangements for them, we should selectively 
strengthen help and education for those who have more 
deep-rooted negative traits or who have not been so well 
reformed and show a tendency toward recidivism; and sternly 
punish those who break the law and commit crime again. 
  To make a good job of the placement, assistance, and 
education for those who have been released after serving prison 
sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor 
terms requires close attention and support from the party and 
government leaders at various levels, the cooperation of 
relevant departments, and concerted efforts from all circles in 
society, so that joint and comprehensive management can be 
achieved. We believe that with the joint endeavors of the whole 
society and timely implementation of various work measures, more 
of those who have been released after serving prison sentences 
or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms will 
embark on the road of rebirth, the incidence of recidivism will 
drop, and society will be more stable, peaceful, and harmonious.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Convicts To Get More State Aid After </F>
Prison"] 
  [Text] Local governments and Party committees are being 
encouraged to step up efforts to bring released inmates into the 
mainstream of society rather than turning back to a criminal 
life. 
  Ex-inmates will be treated with more flexible policies to 
steer them toward a new life, a circular published this week 
said. 
  The circular urged local governments and Party committees to 
help re-settle and educate these ex-inmates. 
  Presently, about 300,000 inmates every year finish their 
sentences, posing a societal dilemma: How should they be 
resettled to prevent them from committing new crimes? The 
matter is even more important because of the new socialist 
market economy China is striving to establish. The principle 
measures in the circular include providing technical skill 
training and ideological education for inmates while serving 
their terms; then help them find a job or start their own 
business, after being released from prison. 
  They will enjoy the same rights as non-convicts to open up 
businesses or engage in other economic affairs. 
  They should not be discriminated against in getting jobs, 
furthering education, buying houses and land or receiving social 
subsidies. 
  However, the circular also stressed re-educating them to 
keep 
them from becoming career criminals. 
  Through China's reform-through-labour camps, the rate of 
repeat criminals has always been low, lingering between 6-8 per 
cent. 
  Two similar circulars were published in the 1950s and 1980s, 
but the new sheet includes measures in light of the new 
socialist market economy. 
  Incomplete statistics from the Justice Ministry showed rural 
people accounted for 56.9 per cent of all criminals, urban 
workers 18.6, and vagrants 12.2. 
  Convicts have had particularly tough times getting jobs once 
they are released from prison despite government efforts. 
  The resettlement and re-education measure, signed by the 
Commission for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security 
(CCMPS) with five other ministries, was viewed as an important 
step toward improving public security. 
  The circular covers those ex-convicts who left prisons in 
the 
past three years and still have not found jobs.

<F P=106> ["Commentator's article:" "Speed Up Fostering of New </F>
People"] 
  [Text] Over more than 20 years, Bao Qifan, an ordinary 
longshoreman who had just received junior secondary education, 
worked diligently, exerted himself to make progress, silently 
made contributions, and became an outstanding state-level young 
expert having rendered outstanding meritorious service, a 
national labor model, and a progressive party member in 
Shanghai. From his deeds, people may feel the soaring 
aspiration of a son of the Chinese people who is determined to 
serve his nation and the brilliant dedicated spirit of a 
Communist Party member. 
  At the ordinary work post of loading and unloading ships, 
Bao 
Qifan loved his job and became an expert in this trade. He 
successfully added modern additions to this time-honored trade. 
While making contributions to the development of modern science 
and technology, he also successfully developed himself and 
realized the sublimation of his life value. The practice of 
making painstaking efforts in difficult conditions to do a 
pioneering job fostered his profound love toward his great 
motherland and his fellow workers, aroused his soaring 
aspirations for reinvigorating China, and strengthened his 
consciousness of giving play to the vanguard exemplary role of a 
Communist Party member. He not only faithfully performed his 
duties at his work post but also strove to make selfless 
contributions. He maintained and carried forward Lei Feng's 
spirit. 
  The great era of reform and opening creates an extremely 
good 
opportunity for the regeneration and reinvigoration of their 
nation, and also for Chinese people to display their talent and 
ability in serving their motherland. The times call for the 
appearance of a new generation of people with a lofty ideal, 
moral integrity, good education, and a sense of discipline, who 
will cherish, grasp, and properly use this opportunity, who will 
master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and who will make new achievements in 
conscientiously practicing the party's basic line and building 
material and spiritual civilization. Bao Qifan is precisely an 
outstanding representative of such a new generation of people. 
He represents the spirit of patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism, and he conscientiously resists money fetishism, 
hedonism, and extreme egoism. His noble character should be 
introduced to and emulated by the whole nation. 
  To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his lofty ideal 
and firm belief in communism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "In 
the past, we continued to work and struggle in extremely 
difficult conditions a number of decades, and we relied on the 
firm belief of uniting the people and encouraging them to fight 
for their own interests. Without such belief, we shall have no 
rallying force and shall have nothing." Making the people 
better off and the country strong and realizing communism is the 
objective and historical mission of the CPC, and is also the 
mental pillar for the Chinese people to exert themselves to 
overcome difficulties and strive for a better live. Bao Qifan 
could stand the test of the difficulties in acquiring knowledge 
and could resist the enticement of material lust. He firmly 
adhered to a correct course in his life, because he never gave 
up the lofty ideal and belief, and gained mental strength from 
such ideals and beliefs, thus advancing in the forefront of the 
reform tide and marching into the palace of modern science and 
technology step by step and making great contributions to the 
nation and the people. 
  To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his master spirit 
of setting great score by the state and collective interests. 
Bao Qifan could make unusual contributions at his work post, 
maintain a worker's determination when facing good offers, and 
use the grab buckets he invented to recover wealth of several 
million yuan for the Shanghai Harbor but not to reap even one 
cent for himself, precisely because he has the strong sense of 
responsibility. This is a powerful counter to the behavior of 
seeking private gain at the expense of public and state 
interests appearing in society. 
  To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his pioneering 
spirit of making progress, seeking knowledge, and participating 
in reform. To realize socialist modernization in our country, we 
must not let the extremely good opportunity slip, and should 
study hard and work in a down-to-earth manner. We should make 
unceasing efforts to make progress. Young people and 
intellectuals with lofty aspirations should model thenmselves on 
Bao Qifan, and strive to acquire real knowledge and abilities 
and to render meritorious service. They should take this as a 
mission given by the times. 
  To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his selfless 
spirit. Making selfless contribution is the character of 
Communist Party members, and is also an admirable value in any 
society. Advocating and carrying forward such a dedicated 
spirit is our party's responsibility and also its advantage. 
Bao Qifan faithfully honored the pledge he made when joining 
the party and cherished the morality of a party member. He did 
not claim credit for himself, always cared about the masses, and 
safeguarded the image of a Communist Party member. All 
Communist Party members should behave like him and 
conscientiously take the dedicated spirit as the orientation of 
social values. Thus, in the conditions of a market economy, 
there will not only be attractive competition but also the 
warmth of making selfless contributions in our society; the 
economy will become vigorous and interpersonal relations will 
become warm. 
  Bao Qifan is a model appearing in the period of reform and 
opening. We should emulate and give publicity to his deeds and 
spirit, and should, like him, make our youth relish the course 
of creation and make our lives sublime in the course of 
dedication!

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- A senior official of 
the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said here 
today that the CAAC is to put flight safety first to ensure a 
healthy, steady and continued development. 
  Applications to open new air companies will be scrutinized 
strictly, according to sources with the CAAC. 
  Import of new planes will be strictly controlled, according 
to the official, who added that investment will shifted to 
training and ground facilities. 
  Sources quoted the unidentified official as saying at a 
working conference here that in the past few years business 
volume of the CAAC kept growing at 30 percent annually, a rare 
phenomenon in the development of international air companies. 
  "It is not the will alone that decides what the development 
speed should be. Flight safety will certainly be endangered if 
we keep seeking quick results and work against the realizable 
possibilities," the official was quoted as saying. 
  Previously there were six sub-administrative bureaus under 
the CAAC and ten flight fleets, which have by now been expanded 
into 33 air companies and 45 flight fleets, with 754 planes of 
all kinds. 
  In 1986, total passenger seats in CAAC topped 15,400, with 
288 domestic and international air routes and business amounting 
to 1.5 billion ton-kilometers, while in 1993 the seats increased 
to over 50,000, with 610 home and international air routes and 
business totalling 5.1 billion ton-kilometers.

  [Text] A Chinese Christian leader urged the Government to 
protect unregistered church activities and strongly criticised 
biased cadres who abused religious rights of the Chinese people. 
  In a speech given at a Spring Festival gathering in Beijing 
in January, Bishop Ding Guangxun, President of the China 
Christian Council (CCC), said that there were cadres who were 
biased towards religion and used administrative methods to 
control and attack law-abiding churchgoers. 
  "The situation is serious," he said in a speech revealed 
yesterday by Amity Foundation, a Hong Kong based Christian 
group. China regulates church activities through the Chinese 
Three-Self Patriotic Movement and the CCC. 
  In addition to the estimated seven million Protestant 
Christians recognised by the Government, a greater number fall 
outside the official record, and with whom the CCC have no 
contact. Bishop Ding called for their protection saying that 
they were patriotic and upheld socialism. 
  Bishop Ding said unity and communication between the 
Christians recognised by the Government and those not recognised 
had been hampered by cadres who considered the latter 
law-breakers. He added that cadres had attacked and destroyed 
many meeting points, forcing them to go underground. 
  In certain places, the bishop said, churches were 
increasingly run by cadres instead of church members. "They do 
not understand religion, they do not appreciate believers' 
thinking and feelings," he said. "To a greater or lesser 
extent, they despise religion, and they also have a duty to 
propagate atheism," he said. 
  "What they are doing is making religion fit their own 
interests," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Gao Anming from the "Opinion" page: "Think Tank </F>
Heads Decide To Get Real"] 
  [Text] China's largest social sciences think tank will 
revise its research agenda to cater to the changing requirements 
of the country's socialist market economy. 
  During its annual conference which ended last Friday, the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) decided to cut 
unnecessary research, so as to concentrate on key studies that 
"comply with the times. 
  CASS president Hu Sheng said that priority projects could 
only be given the attention they deserved by scrapping some of 
the other subjects. And if the cuts weren't made the academy 
would find it impossible to break new ground and would lose its 
lead in existing studies. 
  But the readjustment was not a passive move merely caused by 
a lack of funds said CASS vice-president Ru Xin. The move was 
more of a bid to adapt the academy to the changing demands of a 
market economy he said. 
  The government allocated more than 90 million yuan ($10.3 
million) to the 5 000-member academy last year. 
  And the academy listed more than 700 key research subjects 
in 
1993 while the 30 or so institutes under CASS listed another 700 
said academy research chief He Bingmeng. 
  But with only 1,600 senior research fellows on the staff, 
the 
academy was overstretched. The fellows were being overworked, 
often having to head several research groups at once. 
  And when new social and economic problems arose requiring 
in- 
depth study, the academy was finding it difficult to squeeze 
them onto its research agenda. 
  Such an over-extended programme inevitably affected the 
quality of academy studies, He said. 
  To ensure that the academy's research keeps up with the 
times, projects that are outmoded or are relatively difficult to 
complete will be dropped. 
  In addition, the academy will require regular update reports 
from its long-term theoretical programmes. 
  And the humanities will have to look at reality, he said. 
  For example, the philosophy of history will this year be 
replaced by the study of socialist morality and ethics. The 
academy also hopes that the institute will strengthen its human 
rights studies. 
  The Institute of Literature will initiate a programme on 
contemporary humanism, while the Institute of Modern History is 
embarking on a history of modern Chinese civilization in the 
hope of cultivating patriotism, he said . 
<H5>  Forecast </H5>
  The director said the academy has decided to select 60 to 70 
key subjects this year. These include annual analyses of 
economic, social and international affairs, the impact of 
foreign-funded businesses upon China, and Asia-Pacific regional 
economic and political trends. 
  CASS has also established a Research Centre on Socialism 
with 
Chinese Characteristics headed by Wang Renzhi, former director 
of the Party's Central Propaganda Department and now 
vice-president of the academy. 
  In addition, the academy is experimenting with a bidding 
system that will tender out some of the larger research projects. 
  Successful bidders will be granted a modicum of financial 
autonomy: they will take responsibility for keeping within 
budget and in return will receive bonuses if their research is 
conducted well. 
  The research on modern Chinese humanism is likely to be 
tendered out, he said. 
  And CASS will widen academic co-operation with its foreign 
counterparts, according to the director. At the moment 
Sino-foreign joint projects are relatively few and far between. 
  Last year, CASS published a record-breaking 464 books. It 
also published 3,532 academic papers, 532 research reports, 157 
translations of foreign publications and 144 dictionaries. 
  Two studies in particular won great acclaim from Chinese 
leaders and fellow scholars. They were "The Macro Guidelines, 
Principles and Framework of the Socialist Market Economy," 
edited by former CASS vice president Liu Guoguang, and 
"Theoretical Research and Suggestions on Establishing a Legal 
System for the Socialist Market Economy," written by the 
Institute of Law. 
  Two other projects also were highly commended: The research 
on contemporary capitalism, which was assigned to the academy by 
Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and conducted by the 
Institute of International Economics and Politics; and the 
Institute of Economics study of the history of Chinese 
capitalism. 
<H5>  Invention </H5>
  The Institute of Rural Development examined the developing 
non- agricultural sector in the countryside--the share-based 
co-operative businesses,which many agricultural experts consider 
the third wave of Chinese rural development. 
  The Institute of Philosophy completed a project on human 
rights last year. 
  Also, researchers from the Institute of Quantitative and 
Technical Economics, headed by Liu Guoguang, last year wrapped 
up an economic development strategy for the Shenzhen Special 
Economic Zone (SEZ). This report, conducted at the request of 
the Shenzhen government, outlines the future of the other four 
SEZs in China.

Computers"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Public Security will soon inspect 
computer information networks, a ministry official said 
yesterday in Beijing. 
  A regulation that went into effect on Wednesday tightened 
the 
regulation of computer systems. 
  It was the country's first regulation pertaining to computer 
security. 
  Incomplete statistics show that over 500,000 computer 
information networkers have been installed nationwide in 
businesses, schools and research institutions. And the number 
is growing rapidly. 
  But network security is lax and problems abound. 
  Computer crimes have been reported and such cases are 
increasing, said Lu Xiaobin, an official with the Computer 
Management and Supervision Department. 
  He refused to give details, but said one case involved 14 
million yuan ($1.6 million). 
  Computer viruses are also a serious problem. It was reported 
that 70 to 80 percent of computers in 30 provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions have been hit by 
infections. 
  According to the regulation, anyone found putting viruses 
into a network can face fines up to 5,000 yuan ($575).

<F P=106> [Article by Wei Jing from the "Opinion" page: "Higher </F>
Education Must Respond to Market Demands"] 
  [Text] Colleges and universities should be more 
market-conscious when setting courses and majors, according to a 
recent People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] forum. 
  And the government should the measures to guarantee pupils 
nine-year compulsory education. 
  Education lags behind economic development due to the more 
than four decades of centrally planned economic development 
which preceded the market reforms of the early 90s. 
  And experts say that the geographical distribution of 
universities and colleges is irrational--they are sited 
according to old administrative district boundaries. 
  Most of the country's universities and colleges are located 
in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Xian while backward 
areas, where talent must be nurtured as a matter of urgency, 
still have to rely on government allocation of university places. 
  In many colleges, the curricula lack flexibility and are 
limited in scope. 
  As a result college students graduate with little knowledge 
of areas outside the subjects they have majored in and may find 
it difficult to fit into the work environment. 
  Universities usually emphasize theoretical knowledge at the 
expense of practical know-how. 
  For decades, the country's education system has been 
government- dominated. The State used to pay tuition fees and 
had the final say in the students' job assignments. 
  Though the situation has improved quite a bit in the last 
few 
years, public enthusiasm in the form of donations--money, 
facilities, private schools--has been either neglected or 
discouraged, experts say. 
  Enterprises failed to play their role in helping students 
combine theoretical studies with work experience. 
  But as local governments get more industrial power and new 
geographical economic blocks take shape, it is inevitable that 
the distribution of the country's colleges and universities will 
become more rational, experts say. 
  And the "invisible hand" of the market will also stretch out 
and influence university curricula, the experts point out. 
  But the State, while loosening its grip on university 
management, should not completely give up its educational 
control. The government should see to it that due attention is 
paid to underpinning courses like teacher training. These 
courses, the experts point out, are vital to the country's 
national long-term interests. 
  Out in the business market, success will depend on workforce 
training programmes, according to enterprises managers in the 
People Daily's forum. 
  After all, high-level technical and managerial personnel 
help 
enterprises improve product quality which in turn brings the 
firms more profits. 
  And professional management skills in key civil service 
sectors like the treasury, tax office and judiciary are vital to 
the creation of a sound business environment for manufacturers, 
the managers agreed. 
  Both experts from universities and managers of enterprises 
are concerned about the situation of the country's basic 
education. 
  Academics and businessmen concerned about the future of 
education in China have all called upon the government to be 
responsible for financing the country's basic education. 
  Primary and secondary education provides youngsters with 
basic knowledge which is vital, if they are to go on and learn 
specialized skills. 
  Basic education does not aim at getting immediate economic 
returns. But it develops the youthful potential. And since the 
young are the labourers of the future, their enhanced capacity 
for professional knowledge can only profit the country. 
  So it is not surprising that many countries have set up 
compulsory, free basic education system, which guarantee poor 
children a schooling. 
  China has already launched a nine-year compulsory education 
system. However, many localities have failed to effectively 
implement the compulsory system. 
  And random collection of fees from students in primary and 
secondary schools has deprived many poor children of their 
rights to a basic education. 
  Statistics show that more than 10 percent of the country's 
pupils and middle school students quite school last year. And 
prohibitively high school charges were one of the biggest reason 
behind this. 
  Some localities also try to shirk their financial 
responsibilities for basic education under the cover of giving 
schools more say in their own management. 
  Government financing and management aid should be made 
available to support the compulsory education system, according 
to experts. 
  The government should campaign to encourage individuals and 
groups to give financial and social support to basic education, 
experts say.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Grants for students from 
Tibet studying in other parts of China are being raised by 
nearly 49 percent, it was announced on Tuesday [1 March]. 
  The Tibet Autonomous Region, in south-west China, has 
allocated 17.35 million yuan (1.99 million U.S. dollars) to be 
used mainly as stipends for Tibetan students. 
  The move was announced by Soinam Daje, deputy secretary 
general of the local Tibet Government. 
  The yearly grant for Tibetan students studying in inland 
provinces is being increased from 706 yuan (81.2 U.S. dollars) 
to 1,050 yuan (120.7 U.S. dollars), he said. 
  Many inland and coastal provinces, including Beijing and 
Shanghai, have special schools or classes for Tibetan students, 
besides schools set up in Tibet itself. 
  For students studying in local Tibetan schools, 
fourth-graders (fourth-year pupils in a primary school) and up, 
who since 1984 have received free boarding, lodging and 
clothing, will now receive a monthly stipend of 57 to 95 yuan, 
the official said. 
  About 4,000 teachers in Tibet will also benefit from the 
extra investment in education, he said. 
  In addition, he said, a five million yuan (about 570,000 
U.S. 
dollars) education fund for the region, was set up yesterday. 
  He said the investment "mostly comes from the central 
government, that is to say, from the support of all 
nationalities across the country." 
  He added: "Without the support and aid, it would be 
impossible for us to adopt these special measures to develop 
education."

<F P=106> ["Salt Smuggling Is Running Wild in China"--ZHONGGUO TONGXUN </F>
SHE headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Reports 
from departments concerned reveal that salt smuggling is running 
wilder and wilder in China inland in recent years, which may 
impair the national economy and the people's health as well. 
  Statistical data show that the amount of salt output and 
sale 
that was not covered by the state plan totaled more than 800,000 
metric tons last year. Because of tax evasion, this portion of 
salt sales did not contribute to tax revenue but had impact on 
the domestic salt market. 
  The value of salt is not high. Then why does salt smuggling 
run wild? The root cause lies in the pretty high levy on salt. 
The state makes a levy of about 200 yuan on each metric ton of 
salt. For instance, from January to November 1993, some 30,000 
metric tons of smuggled salt was seized in Sichuan province, 
which implies that about 6 million yuan of salt tax drained 
away, not to mention the actual amount of smuggled salt which 
could be very much higher. Therefore, salt smugglers can reap 
staggering profits from their deals, at the expense of 
considerable losses on the part of the state. A source from the 
Sichuan Provincial Salt Industry Bureau said some 200,000 metric 
tons of smuggled salt was sold on the market in Sichuan last 
year, incurring a 40 million yuan loss in tax revenue to the 
state. 
  What is more worth to be brought to our attention is that 
the 
spread of salt smuggling may directly impair consumers' health. 
As some salt of inferior quality has been sold to some 
impoverished areas, cases of poisoning or even death caused by 
salt consumption have taken place from time to time. There have 
been also some cases where industrial salt was sold as edible 
salt, and the consumption of iodine-free salt was the cause for 
the increase in the amount of iodine deficiency in areas where 
iodine is in short supply. 
  The source concerned noted that the spread of salt smuggling 
is a reflection of the fact that laws are not observed. The 
department concerned suggests that administrative actions, 
economic legislation, and other means be applied to a 
comprehensive operation to curb salt smuggling.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Xie Yicheng: "Airlines Make Vow To Be </F>
More Punctual"] 
  [Text] Chinese airlines will be more punctual this year 
and airport security will be tightened, the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China (CAAC) said yesterday. 
  Chen Guangyi, the new director of CAAC, made the 
announcement 
at an ongoing aviation conference that opened on Monday. 
  Improvements in the national airlines will focus on rigid 
and 
modernized management. 
  "Serious flying accidents and air piracy must be put to an 
end," Chen said. The sector must stick to scientific management 
with high standards." Chen said last year was one of the worst 
in Chinese aviation history, with five crashes that killed 76 
people. 
  Several planes were hijacked to Taiwan as well. 
  Chen said most accidents were a result of lax security 
checks 
or flying code violations. 
  To combat this, flying teams are to reinforce technical 
instruction and train 600 personnel a year to ease the pilot 
shortage. 
  CAAC punished more than 120 people last year for flying 
accidents. Three pilots were discharged and 68 had their 
licenses suspended or downgraded. 
  Chen said CAAC also seriously disciplined Hainan Airlines 
for 
hiring pilots from other airlines and letting unlicensed 
personnel fly passenger jets. 
  Furthermore, domestic airports this year will intensify 
ground security and install more devices to detect illegal 
weapons. 
  Last year, CAAC punished 31 people, including 6 safety 
checkpoint chiefs, for poor security. 
  As part of the airline's dedication to service, it aims to 
raise flight punctuality to 86-88 percent this year, up from 85 
percent last year. 
  "Flight delays and cancellations are the biggest complaint 
of 
our travellers," Chen said. 
  In a push to improve service of carriers, CAAC will 
regularly 
publish the percentage of their flights arriving on time. 
  Official inspection and opinions from passengers last year 
listed China Eastern Airlines and Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport as 
the best in terms of service among the 12 major airlines and 12 
airports. 
  Chen also said passengers should get flight information and 
other queries answered promptly. In particular, he said, food 
and lodging must be arranged for travellers that are delayed. 
  Last year 33.7 million passengers and 696,000 tons of goods 
and mail were transported by air, up 16.8 and 21 percent from 
1992.

called on Chinese women to fully play their "half-of-the-sky" 
role and make more efforts to greet the fourth World Women's 
Conference, to be held in Beijing next year, and to further 
promote women's development. 
  Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress, said at a women's public lecture 
held here today that this year is the "most important" year for 
China to prepare for the fourth World Women's Conference. The 
conference has been regarded as a major event for both the 
Chinese Government and Chinese women. 
  "China is very pleased to make contributions to the United 
Nations and World Women's Development," said Chen, who is also 
president of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF). 
  Public lectures were given by 11 women who come from 
different walks of life and have made outstanding contributions 
to social development. 
  Organized by the All-China Women's Federation and other 
organizations, the lectures are aimed at praising the exemplary 
women's good morals and urging all of Chinese society to care 
for and support women's development, said the organizers.

<F P=106> [Article by Zong Jie: "Pioneers in 'New Experience' </F>
Fiction"] 
  [Text] Truth is stranger than fiction, the saying goes. 
Well, strange or not, truth can certainly be a gripping 
addition to an otherwise fictional tale, as a group of Beijing 
short story writers have recently demonstrated. 
  Using a style called "new experience fiction," the writers 
set their fictional narrators firmly in the maelstrom of real 
life. Real policemen, real doctors, even real millionaires 
provide the nitty-gritty details that form the springboard from 
which the narrator leaps into the world of the imagination. 
  The ensuring tale is a form of contemporary history--with a 
spin. 
  With support from a number of literary magazines in Beijing, 
the first batch of "new experience" works has already been 
published. 
  The pioneer is Chen Jiangong, a Beijing-based writer. His 
first nouvelle [word as published throughout] in the style is 
"With a Criminal Record," published last September in the 
Chinese language literary bi-monthly, Chinese Writers. 
  The nouvelle reveals what the first-person narrator sees, 
hears, and feels about the work of a policeman in charge of 
neighbourhood security. 
  Every bit of the detail is real, Chen claims. The story 
records what the policeman says and does, what happens to the 
policeman and the people around him and, above all, what 
thoughts these events trigger in the writer himself. 
  "New experience fiction' should, first of all, tell the 
personal experience of the narrator--who is not just a 
bystander, but also a participant in events," Chen Jiangong 
explains. "In this way, the story links the material world with 
the mental world, where fiction or non-fiction can take place 
with cause and effect, or without cause and effect." 
  He believes that the personal accounts, which bear some 
traits of news-feature style, may be more readable than 
conventional fiction. 
  "New experience" writers may spend exhausting weeks of 
research preparing for a story. 
  For example, Bi Shumin, before writing her nouvelle 
"Appointment with Death," visited many hospitals and 
crematoriums, jotting down volumes of notes, and even lay down 
in hospital beds where sick patients had been. 
  "Tears ran down my cheeks many times when I did interviews 
at 
a hospice in Beijing," she recalls. "I am not a woman who 
always sheds tears, but I was so saddened there that I seemed to 
be immersed in salt water." 
  However, when she began to write, "I became very detached," 
she says. 
  And she learn from the experience. "It was death that gave 
me courage and joy, and taught me to treasure life and love the 
elderly." 
  She created a story that linked scattered scenes in the 
minds-eye of her fictional narrator. 
  "Can writers write like this only after having personal 
experience?" some one asked Bi. 
  She replied: This is the way I write this kind of fiction. 
I simply hammer into pieces the true-life stories I have 
collected and grind and mash them together with my own ideas and 
emotions to form a whole." 
  Xu Moqing, another writer now living in Beijing, has also 
ventured into "new experience" fiction. 
  His most recent nouvelle is called "How Much Time Does It 
Take to Become Rich." 
  Xu tries to answer the question posed by his books's title 
by 
setting himself up as narrator against Ke Zijiang, a millionaire 
in Fujian Province. In this way, he says, "I can dissect myself 
so as to see the world more clearly, as if using an X-ray." 
  As a result, instead of "playing god" as the narrator does 
in 
conventional fiction, the "new experience" fiction drives the 
narrator into the mundane world and makes him or her see his or 
her own weakness," Xu said. 
  "The narrator joins the men-in-the-street in their joys and 
sorrows." 
  "New experience" fiction has aroused keen interest among 
literary critics and writers. 
  Critic Xing An says that a style similar to "new experience" 
already exists, for example, Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood," 
which the author describes as "non-fiction". 
  Because "new experience" fiction stresses the need for the 
writers to involve themselves in the real world, it depicts a 
complicated and broad social arena that readers may understand 
more easily, Xing says. 
  "New experience' fiction is not only a literary creation," 
he 
says. "It also is the writer's involvement in making 
contemporary history." 
  Writer Mu Guozheng says that "the word used most in tens of 
thousands of literary critiques since the founding of New China 
is 'death'." 
  Throughout New China's various social periods, from the 
Great 
Leap Forward Movement (1959) to the "cultural revolution" 
(1966-76), critics invariably prompted literary works that had 
"death." 
  However, as time passed, novels once widely-acclaimed as 
having "deep social implication" are now almost forgotten, Mu 
says. 
  Over the past decade, there have also been works of "depth," 
but many--borrowing ideas and philosophy from the West--are very 
difficult to understand. 
  After going through so many twists and turns over the years, 
Mu says he believes that "new experience" fiction may attract 
more readers to Chinese literature because it departs from the 
pursuit of "depth" and tries instead to give vivid portrayals of 
the lives of common people. 
  Whatever the critics' comments, "new experience" fiction is 
sure to stay and grow for a while, but it will take time to see 
whether it will catch on with the public.

  [Text] According to ZHONGGUO CEHUI BAO [CHINA SURVEY AND 
CARTOGRAPHY NEWS], global positioning system [GPS] technology is 
being applied extensively at an unprecedented pace by various 
departments and in numerous fields in China. This is 
demonstrated by the following: 
  1. GPS technology is being used to serve the nation's 
economic and social development. In 1992, the State Bureau of 
Surveying and Cartography, in cooperation with relevant 
departments, completed outer operations surveying [wai ye guan 
ce 1120 2814 6034 3261] work for the state's high-precision GPS 
main control network [zhu kong zhi wang 0031 2235 0455 4986]. 
It is now organizing the testing of the state's high-precision 
earth control network [da di kong zhi wang 1129 0966 2235 0455 
4986]. Using GPS technology, it has established high-precision 
urban control networks for Haikou, Xiamen, Nanning, and dozens 
of other cities. Since the beginning of the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan, it has used GPS standard [shui zhun 3055 0402] measuring 
technology to precisely measure China's earth standard surface 
[da di shui zhun mian 1129 0966 3055 0402 7240]. At the same 
time, GPS is also being used in large and key engineering 
projects to position and measure the deformation [xing bian 1748 
6239] of engineering works. The technology was used to 
establish a high-precision control network between Changjiang's 
Three Gorges Dam site and the Gezhou Dam. Construction of a GPS 
satellite tracking network is being accelerated. 
  2. Vigorous efforts are being made to disseminate GPS 
technology. The State Bureau of Surveying and Cartography has 
held a series of GPS training and study classes as well as 
symposiums. 
  3. Software development and basic research have also been 
carried out.

<F P=106> [By reporters Xu Hong (1776 3126), Wang Jiabin (3769 0163 </F>
2430): "China Aerospace Industry Seeks Extensive International 
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- China 
Aerospace Industry Corporation [CAIC] today presented 93 
projects, which require a total investment of $1.28 billion, for 
extensive international economic and technological cooperation. 
  A person in charge of the CAIC announced at this evening's 
news briefing that the corporation, now hallmarked by its Long 
March rocket series undertaking the launching of foreign 
satellites, is moving toward the outside world in a fresh 
manner. This year, the corporation will hold four large 
exhibitions and international cooperation meetings in Chicago, 
Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, and Beijing, at which nearly 100 
projects of cooperation will be presented. 
  The CAIC is a scientific and technological industry giant 
founded on the basis of the aerospace section of the former 
Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry in June 1993. 
Through the development over the past 30 years or so, China's 
aerospace industry has expanded to a considerable size and 
reached considerable sophistication. So far, many models of 
strategic and tactical missiles and carrier rockets have been 
successfully developed, and a total of 36 aerospace launchings 
have been conducted, sending 41 satellites, including five from 
abroad, into outer space. At the moment, the development of 
China's Dongfanghong-3 telesat, Fengyun-2 meteorological 
satellite, and Ziyuan-1 resource satellite is making smooth 
progress and the first two satellites will be launched and go 
into operation soon. A prototype of the Long March rocket 
series is being developed, and the products in this series are 
going through systematization, generalization, and 
standardization, as a result of which the corporation is now 
capable of providing the international market with a wider 
spectrum of services. As to satellites, after starting the 
exportation of technology and parts, China is striving to 
improve its satellite technology and the ratio of satellite 
performance to price, in an attempt to be able to export 
complete satellites around 2000. 
  The projects for cooperation presented today cover a number 
of areas, such as electronics, machinery and equipment, 
automobiles and auto parts, and real estate development. It is 
said that the corporation has begun adjusting its product mix 
and will soon start developing the following products as part of 
the "signature projects" in the development of China's aerospace 
products for civil purposes: a satellite information system, a 
mobile communications substation series, a global television 
transmission system, a satellite digital communications VSAT [as 
received] station, an aerospace satellite digital mobile 
communications and localizing system, and so on. Digital 
control, engineer control [gong kong 1562 2235], robot, 
detection radar, special chemical industry, special materials, 
and microwave, infrared, and millimeter-wave technlogy will also 
be considered key objects of development. Apart from 
strengthening cooperation with old and new partners in the above 
areas, the CAIC is also willing to expand the scope and size of 
cooperation in the following areas: Coinvestment in, or 
codevelopment of, such applications as communications, resource, 
meteorological, and navigational satellites and various kinds of 
scientific experiment satellites; provision of the ground 
application systems and equipment for various kinds of 
satellites; and the establishment and joint management of a 
satellite application system, with the CAIC's satellites and 
carrier rockets contributed as its share of investment; and so 
on and so forth. 
  The person in charge of the corporation also answered 
questions from reporters. When a foreign reporter asked about 
the alleged exportation of M11 missiles by China to Pakistan, 
this person replied that the corporation does not have this 
missile model at all, so the alleged export of M11 missiles to 
Pakistan is pure rumor.

  [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- China's only maritime 
signal satellite ground station passed acceptance tests today. 
Its successful establishment has filled another blank in 
China's high- technology field. 
  It has been learned that during its trial operation, the 
station connected for various mobile consumers nearly 200,000 
domestic phone (including fax) calls and telexes, and nearly 
100,000 international calls. 
  The maritime signal satellite ground station is a link 
between the satellite and the ground via telecommunications 
systems. The Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station 
can provide telecommunications links between mobile 
telecommunications systems users in the Pacific and Indian 
Oceans and users of stationary equipment on land, and supply 
reliable and mobile satellite telecommunications services to 
users at sea and on land. 
  The construction project of the maritime signal satellite 
ground station was completed in two phases. The first phase's 
station type-A can provide telecommunications links between 
mobile telecommunications systems users at sea and on land 
whereby they can exchange phone calls, telexes, facsimiles, and 
data. At present, most of China's oceangoing vessels have been 
equiped with terminal facilities. Once certain buttons are 
pressed during a shipwreck, distress signals will be transmitted 
directly via the Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground 
Station to China's maritime search and rescue centers. Such a 
connection has provided a safe and reliable guarantee for 
vessels in distress. Mobile terminal systems on land can 
provide mobile users with convenient services for remote border 
areas, news coverage, and geological exploration. The second 
phase's station type-C, smaller in size than station type-A, can 
provide global telecommunications services relaying messages and 
data, including weather reports and stock quotations. It also 
has stronger signals. It is favorably termed as a "mobile 
office." 
  The Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station was 
built by the Ministry of Communications with loans from the 
Norwegian Government. According to Wang Jialin [3769 1367 
7792], deputy director of the Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite 
Ground Station, the station has plans to develop future digital 
systems types-B and M.

<F P=106> [Reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee [CPCCC] and vice chairman of the Central 
Military Commission [CMC], spoke today at the All-Army 
Discipline Inspection Work Conference. He stressed the need to 
uphold high standards in the army's anticorruption and 
clean-administration work. He called on leaders at all levels, 
senior cadres in particular, to strictly enforce rules and 
regulations formulated by the CPCCC and CMC on party style and 
clean-administration building; and to become models of 
whole-heartedly serving the people and abiding by discipline. 
  Liu Huaqing said the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection was a very important 
meeting at which General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an 
important speech. The CMC decision to call the All-Army 
Discipline Inspection Work Conference was aimed at the timely 
study of General Secretary Jiang's important speech; 
implementation of guidelines set forth at the plenary session of 
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection; and further 
strengthening party style and clean- administration building in 
the army in line with the arrangements worked out by the CPCCC. 
  Liu Huaqing expounded the achievements the army has scored 
in 
party style and clean-administration building in 1993. He said 
that as a result of making a conscientious study of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's expositions on enhancing party style and clean- 
administration building, CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin's relevant 
instructions, and the CMC's decisions, the army has increased 
awareness on combating corruption and clean-administration 
building. Party committees at all levels have extensively 
strengthened ideological work and improved workstyle, carried 
out in-house checks and self-correction, and conscientiously 
investigated and dealt with some major law-breaking and 
discipline-breaching cases; thereby educating servicemen, 
helping to improve leadership style, and promote army building 
in all areas. 
  Liu Huaqing pointed out the need for all comrades in the 
army 
to have a profound recognition of the long-term nature and 
arduousness of strengthening party style and 
clean-administration building. This year, the army will 
resolutely implement the CPCCC decision on the anticorruption 
struggle in party style and clean-administration building. He 
called on the army to gain a new and heightened ideological 
understanding, and gain new breakthroughs in investigations and 
dealing with major and important cases; to devote more efforts 
to important parts and important links; and to make new strides 
in the areas of establishing systems, and of supervising and 
checking these systems. Liu Huaqing said with the powerful 
ideological weapon of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the strong leadership of 
the CPCCC and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, and 
cooperation from everyone in the army, our army's anticorruption 
and clean- administration building work will surely achieve new 
results. 
  Liu Huaqing stressed: Under the new situation, our army 
shoulders a major historical mission: It must provide a strong 
and forceful security guarantee for the state's reform, opening 
up, and modernization construction. This requires us to make 
ourselves very strong so we will be able to accomplish the tasks 
given by the state under any circumstances. The fact the CPCCC 
set clear demands on the army to stand at the forefront of 
building socialist spiritual civilization demonstrates a high 
degree of trust in it. The CPCCC set very high demands on army 
building. As party style and clean- administration building are 
important for building spiritual civilization, it is natural for 
the army to do an even better job in this area. Therefore, 
party committees and leaders at all levels must uphold high 
standards, make strict demands, and further enhance their 
awareness and sense of responsibility in fighting corruption and 
building a clean-administration. 
  Liu Huaqing pointed out: The party committee is the key to 
doing a good party-style job in a unit. If a party committee is 
strong, it will be able to consolidate the fruits of the 
anticorruption and clean-administration efforts; even if 
problems arise, a strong party committee will solve them easily. 
Criticism and self-criticism sessions should be conducted 
within the party. We should oppose liberalism [zi you zhu yi]. 
Opposition to liberalism is the excellent tradition of our 
party and our army, and we must continuously carry forward that 
excellent tradition under the current new situation of 
anticorruption and clean-administration building. It is 
necessary for party committees at all levels to implement the 
party's system of democratic centralism and organizational life. 
Party secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees 
must uphold principles, take the lead in stressing party spirit, 
and in organizing criticism and self-criticism sessions. 
  When touching on the need for leading cadres to set 
exemplary roles in party style and clean-administration 
building, Liu Huaqing said senior cadres in the army must foster 
the concept of taking the interests of the whole into account 
and strictly abide by political discipline. They must 
resolutely implement all decisions reached by the CPCCC and CMC; 
absolutely refrain from doing things which are definitely banned 
by law; honestly execute whatever the system dictates; and 
genuinely speak and act in line with the CPCCC politically, 
ideologically, and in action. Leading cadres, senior cadres in 
particular, must be consistent in their speech and behavior when 
it comes to the matter of honestly fulfilling their official 
duties and of practising self-discipline; they must practice 
what they advocate. They must strictly enforce systems and 
regulations worked out by the CPCCC and CMC on party style and 
clean-administration building; they must be models of 
whole-heartedly serving the people and of enforcing discipline. 
  The All-Army Discipline Inspection Work Conference opened on 
25 February in Beijing. The major purpose of the conference was 
to sum up and analyze the army's anticorruption and 
clean-administration building work in 1993, particularly its 
experience in implementing the arrangements mapped out by the 
CPCCC and CMC on anticorruption and clean-administration 
building work; and to study and arrange the anticorruption and 
clean-administration building work for the army in 1994. Zhou 
Ziyu, secretary of the CMC commission for discipline inspection 
and deputy director of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
General Political Department, delivered a work report. 
  Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Fu Quanyou, and 
others attended today's meeting. Also attending today's meeting 
were responsible comrades from the major units of the PLA 
General Staff Department, General Political Department, and 
General Logistics Department in Beijing; discipline inspection 
commission members from the military system; discipline 
inspection commission members from the CMC; major units from the 
army; and secretaries and discipline inspection heads of the 
discipline inspection commission of the armed police units. 
  Yu Yongbo, member of the CMC and director of the PLA General 
Political Department, chaired the meeting, and made arrangement 
for transmitting and implementing the guidelines set forth at 
the Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission for 
Discipline Inspection and at the All-Army Discipline Inspection 
Work Conference.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Ruiqing (2612 3843 3237): "All-Army </F>
Discipline Inspection Work Meeting Stresses More Effectively 
Combating Corruption and Encouraging Clean Administration"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--"With Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and his thinking of army building in the new 
period as the guide, efforts should be made to keep implementing 
the CPC Central Military Commission's decision on carrying 
forward the fine tradition and strengthening the building of 
clean administration and taking measures step by step to carry 
out the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean 
administration in a lasting, in-depth, and more effective 
manner." This was the aim stressed by the all-Army discipline 
inspection work meeting which was held yesterday. 
  With the approval of the CPC Central Military Commission, 
the 
General Political Department and the Commission for Discipline 
Inspection of the CPC Central Military Commission decided to 
call the all-Army discipline inspection work meeting when the 
Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for 
Discipline Inspection was being held. According to the 
instructions given by leaders of the CPC Central Military 
Commission, this meeting was mainly to analyze and sum up the 
situation and experience of the Army in implementing, in 
particular, the work plans of the CPC Central Committee and the 
CPC Central Military Commission on combating corruption and 
encouraging clean administration and to discuss and draw up a 
plan for strengthening the work of building party discipline and 
clean administration in the Army. 
  Xu Huizi, deputy chief of general staff and deputy secretary 
of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Military 
Commission, presided over the meeting, and Zhou Ziyu, deputy 
director of the General Political Department and secretary of 
the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Central 
Military Commission, delivered a report entitled 
"Conscientiously Implementing the Guidelines Laid by the Third 
Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection, Doing Well the Building of Party Discipline and 
Clean Administration in an In-Depth and Lasting Manner." 
  In the report, Zhou Ziyu reviewed the greater achievements 
scored by the whole Army in the work of combating corruption and 
encouraging clean administration in 1993. After that, he said: 
If we take measures step by step, we will have clearer 
objectives, more appropriate demands, and more concrete 
measures, which help promote the work of combating corruption 
and encouraging clean administration step by step. The general 
response is good. 
  Regarding the key tasks of planning the work of combating 
corruption and encouraging clean administration in the Army in 
1994, the report pointed out: It is necessary to understand and 
grasp the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean 
administration in the Army from the high plane of the overall 
situation of state and army building, and the work must be 
subordinate to and serve the overall situation of state and army 
building. Leading cadres must take the lead in setting an 
example to their subordinates in the building of clean 
administration, and this is a demand which can never be altered. 
However, as far as self-discipline is concerned, efforts must 
be made to constantly add more concrete details to it and 
substantiate it in light of new conditions. We must continue to 
implement, in a conscientious manner, the five stipulations laid 
down by the central authorities last year on leading cadres' 
honesty and self-discipline. The Third Plenary Session of the 
CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection put forward and 
restated the five stipulations, and leading army cadres must 
carry out them in an exemplary manner. An important mark to 
profoundly combat corruption and encourage clean administration 
is to accomplish the work of investigating and handling cases. 
Party committees at all levels must enhance their leadership of 
handling cases, and discipline and law enforcement departments 
must handle cases in an impartial manner. We must buttress up 
and maintain mass enthusiasm for fighting against negative and 
corrupt phenomena and, at the same time, teach and guide party 
members and the masses to properly exercise their democratic 
rights and to present problems to party organizations in a 
down-to-earth manner. Regarding the five outstanding issues of 
ideology and work style mentioned by the CPC Central Military 
Commission in the decision of enhancing the building of clean 
administration, we must keep devoting every effort to solving 
them and to consolidating our achievements and scoring greater 
success. 
  As stressed by the report, as far as the work of discipline 
inspection in the Army is concerned, we still have a very 
important task, that is, we must maintain our party's political 
discipline and ensure implementation and enforcement of the 
party line, principles, and policies as well as the decisions, 
instructions, and orders made by the CPC Central Military 
Commission. Party committees and party commissions for 
discipline inspection at all levels must teach and guide party 
members and cadres to uphold the principle of democratic 
centralism to conscientiously subordinate the whole party to the 
CPC Central Committee and to maintain a high degree of unity 
with the CPC Central Military Commission. When various reform 
measures adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the CPC 
Central Military Commission are introduced, we must 
conscientiously study and grasp their essence, analyze and 
predict problems which may arise, and set relevant demands of 
discipline on party members to guide their conduct. We must 
inspect the situation of implementing relevant reform measures 
taken by the CPC Central Committee and of the CPC Central 
Military Commission and resolutely redress and seriously handle 
misconduct which severely violates political and organizational 
disciplines, such as not implementing orders, not enforcing 
bans, or each going his own way. 
  The report called for stronger leadership and a down- 
to-earth work style to ensure implementation of the tasks of 
combating corruption and encouraging clean administration. To 
carry out the work of combating corruption and encouraging clean 
administration in an in-depth and lasting manner, we must pay 
attention to education and take precautions against corruption, 
which is the way to get at the root of the problem. To do a 
good job in studies and education, the most essential thing is 
to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to arm party members' and cadres' minds, 
to foster a correct outlook on life and on value, to lay a solid 
ideological foundation against corruption and degeneration, and 
to enhance our capability of resisting the corrosive influence 
of money worship, radical individualism, and decadent 
life-style. All units and departments must proceed from reality 
and take such forms as sending teams for investigation to 
strengthen supervision and inspection. Units and departments at 
each level must be accountable to their immediate superiors. 
Supervision and inspection must be linked to cadre assessment, 
and whether or not a cadre is honest should be used as an 
important yardstick for promoting him. Under the unified 
leadership of party committees, all departments of leading 
organs must conscientiously bear responsibility for the task of 
combating corruption and encouraging clean administration in 
accordance with the principle that those who are in charge 
should be responsible for it, thus ensuring fulfillment of the 
task in their own departments and affiliated organizations. 
  Members of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection coming from the Army, members of the CPC Central 
Military Commission, secretaries of commissions for discipline 
inspection of various major units and of the Armed Police 
Headquarters, and leading comrades of discipline inspection 
departments attended the meeting.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Civil Production of Anhui's National </F>
Defense Scientific and Technological Industry Reaches New Level"] 
  [Text] Information obtained from the just-concluded 
provincial national defense scientific and technological 
industry working conference revealed that thanks to the 
persistence in the policy of "combining the production of 
military hardware with the production of products for civil use" 
and in the policy of reform and opening up, a profound change 
has occurred to the province's national defense scientific and 
technological industry. This industrial system became one of 
the three pillars for production of civil products in 1993, with 
the gross output value and sales turnover of the entire 
industrial system jumping to 45 percent and over 50 percent, 
respectively, over those in 1992. 
  In 1993, the number of enterprises from province's national 
defense scientific and technological industry with an annual 
output value exceeding 100 million yuan and over 50 million yuan 
totalled three and six, respectively. Among them was Swan Air 
Conditioner Company, which realized an output value of 260 
million yuan, posted an increase over 50 percent in terms of 
production and sales over those in 1992, acquired the capability 
to produce 300,000 air conditioner units annually, despite 
having been hit with another unseasonably cool summer. Huaihai 
Machinery Plant rolled out over 10,000 Flying Tiger brand cars, 
quadrupling output value to 254 million yuan and generating 
14.85 million yuan of profits and taxes for the state from those 
in 1992, acquiring the capability to annually turn out 20,000 
Flying Tiger cars, thus initially meeting the requirements for 
large-scale production. Wuhu Shipyard began building the first 
10,000 [dead weight ton] dwt-class vessel -- a 12,000 dwt 
low-waterline freighter which can dock at harbors along the 
Changjiang -- thus opening the way for 10,000 dwt-class 
freighters to call at ports along Changjiang all the year round 
as well as bringing good market prospects for Wuhu Shipyard to 
build 10,000 dwt-class freighters. In 1993, in addition to 
becoming one of the three pillars for production of products for 
civil use, the province's national defense scientific and 
technological industrial system also set up an assembly line for 
production of 200,000 hinge joint sets for sedans, an assembly 
line for 20,000 car air conditioners, and an assembly line for 
1,500 gear reducer sets, thus constituting new growth areas for 
the province's national defense scientific and technological 
industry in 1994. In 1993, the province's national defense 
scientific and technological industrial system invested 210 
million yuan in technological transformation, a 49-percent 
increase percent over 1992. 
  The province's national defense scientific and technological 
system also developed 102 new products. Among them were an 
international-class colloidal core for ring-type antisprayers 
[huan xing fang pen qi jiao xin 3883 1748 7089 0899 0892 5231 
5361], a colloidal core for antisprayer valves, a container for 
super-fine filters, portable microwave communications equipment, 
and a water recycling and cooling system. Some 90 new products 
were put into mass production, with their output rate reaching 
22.97 percent. 
  Industrial product mix experienced a profound transformation 
thanks to a large scale technological transformation carried out 
by the province's national defense scientific and technological 
industry and to its development of new products in 1993. Based 
on the achievements in 1993, in 1994, provincial national 
defense science and industry office will, making key enterprises 
and key products to serve as the point of departure, promote the 
economic development of the entire system; strive to increase 
output value by 35 percent and efficiency by 80 percent; 
establish four and eight enterprises with output value over 100 
million yuan and over 50 million yuan, respectively; and further 
expand the results of the entire system to switch from military 
production to civil-product production.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- Addressing a national 
conference on helping poor areas through development today, 
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin said 
so long as leading cadres at all levels always keep 
poverty-stricken areas in mind; share weal and woe with the 
people there; adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line; persist in helping poor areas through developing 
production in line with actual conditions with necessary 
assistance from the state and all sectors of society; work 
persistently; and pay attention to efficiency, they will 
certainly fulfill the plan to wipe out abject poverty by the 
year 2000. 
  At the conference, Premier Li Peng delivered a speech 
entitled: "Helping Poor Areas Through Development Is an 
Important Strategic Task." 
  The conference, convened by the State Council, ended in 
Beijing today. Attending were Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, Wen 
Jiabao, Li Guixian, Ismail Amat, Peng Peiyun, and Luo Gan. Also 
attending were leaders of democratic parties and the Federation 
of Industry and Commerce, including Li Peiyao, Feng Zhijun, Feng 
Kexu, Chen Xunli, Song Jinsheng, Lu Rongshu, Chen Mingshao, Cai 
Zimin, and Chen Jingxin. 
  Today's conference was presided over by Chen Junsheng, head 
of the Leading Group for the Economic Development of 
Impoverished Areas under the State Council. At the conference, 
leaders of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities 
under the central government, including Yunnan, Xinjiang, Hebei, 
Shandong, Beijing, and Ningxia, made reports on their plans to 
implement the National Poverty Elimination Plan. 
  In his speech, Jiang Zemin began by affirming the great 
historic achievements scored in assisting impoverished areas 
through promoting development since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee. He said: The most important 
experience China has gained from its progress in poverty 
reduction is the establishment of a new aid-the-poor principle, 
shifting from merely relief aid to aiding poor areas by 
promoting social and economic development. Practice shows that 
aiding poor areas through social and economic development by 
heeding market demands, relying on the advancement of science 
and technology, exploiting local resources, and developing 
commodity production, will not only provide enough food and 
clothes for poverty-stricken people, but will also help them 
free themselves from poverty and become well-off. Thus, the 
principle of helping poor areas through social and economic 
development by combining state assistance to poor areas, and the 
self-reliant spirit and hard work of cadres and people in the 
impoverished areas, constitutes a fundamental change in this 
work; it is an important creation which must be continued for a 
long time to come. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: We are still faced with arduous 
tasks in our effort to help poor areas. To solve the problem of 
providing sufficient food and clothes for 80 million people in 
the next seven years, the State Council has drawn up a national 
poverty elimination plan. This is a good plan. The key is that 
we must have the determination to tackle the problem and 
resolutely continue the work for a long time to come. 
  Pointing out that it is necessary to further understand the 
importance of aiding poor areas through social and economic 
development, Jiang Zemin said: Elimination of poverty to 
realize common prosperity is required by the essence of 
socialism and is the embodiment of the superiority of socialism. 
In leading the people in making revolution and building 
socialism, the party aims at emancipating and developing 
productive forces to enable people to become prosperous. Since 
the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, we 
have allowed and encouraged some people and regions to become 
well-off first. The aim is that common prosperity can be 
achieved in a better way because people and regions which become 
well-off first will give an impetus to other people and other 
regions to strive for prosperity. In developing a socialist 
market economic structure, we should not only seek efficiency in 
resource allocation but also take into account the principle of 
fairness, that is, we should do better in adopting effective 
policies to assist impoverished areas. Jiang Zemin said: 
Elimination of poverty to realize common prosperity is required 
by reform and opening up to the outside world, and is also an 
important condition for maintaining stability. Development in 
various areas is uneven; some areas are developing fairly 
rapidly, while other are developing relatively slowly. This is 
unavoidable. However, in this process we must keep an eye on 
economic development in the impoverished areas and help them 
free themselves from poverty and become well- off, so as to 
achieve the goal of common prosperity. 
  Pointing out that to resolutely carry out the work of 
assisting poor areas through development for a long time to 
come, party committees and governments at all levels must 
improve leadership over this work, Jiang Zemin said: Helping 
poor areas through development is not only an important economic 
task but also a political task concerning the masses -- which 
includes the building of material civilization as well as 
spiritual civilization. Party committees and governments at all 
levels should, as always, strengthen leadership over the work to 
aid poor areas. Jiang Zemin called on the principal leaders of 
party committees and governments at all levels to show concern 
for this work, attend to it, and regard it as an important means 
of caring for the masses' hardships and improving ties between 
the party and masses. He also called on them to make an overall 
plan, concentrate on tackling weaknesses, and make frequent 
visits to poor areas and nationality minority areas to help 
cadres and masses there solve practical problems. He said: 
Principal leaders should dispatch cadres, on a rotational 
basis, to poor areas to help with their work. Cadres should be 
selected from provincial, prefectural, and county organs, and 
sent to impoverished townships and villages to work there for a 
certain period of time. While there, they should publicize 
party policies among the masses, assist them in improving 
leading bodies, and help them find a way to free themselves from 
poverty and become well-off by bringing in professional 
personnel and technologies, and organizing them to develop 
explorative undertakings. Achievements in helping poor areas 
free themselves from poverty should be used as a criterion for 
evaluating and promoting county and township leading cadres. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Party committees and governments should be 
good at mobilizing and organizing all sectors of society to 
bring about a new situation in the work of assisting poor areas. 
When conditions permit, state organs, the People' Liberation 
Army, the democratic parties, social organizations, and 
enterprises and institutions, should, as always, actively 
support and take part in the work of aiding poor areas to the 
best of their ability. In aiding poor areas, investment is 
necessary. Financial and other monetary departments should 
render their support by providing funds on preferential terms. 
They should also organize comparatively economically developed 
areas and underdeveloped areas to help one another in order to 
promote mutual benefit, common development, and common 
prosperity. 
  Pointing out that it is necessary to give full play to the 
innovative spirit of self-reliance and hard work of cadres and 
masses in impoverished areas, Jiang Zemin said: It is 
absolutely necessary for the state to provide some assistance to 
impoverished areas and for all sectors of society to participate 
in helping these areas. However, in the final analysis, the 
poor areas should rely on themselves to solve the problem of 
food and clothing, and to free themselves from poverty and 
become well-off. This requires cadres and masses in 
impoverished areas combat adverse natural conditions and develop 
their economy by displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard 
work. Difficulties can easily be overcome with a hard- working 
spirit. This spirit is our party's fine tradition and also 
constitutes our basic experience in helping poor areas become 
well- off. 
  He stressed: While relying on our own efforts and working 
diligently, we should think of new ideas for helping poor areas 
through economic development. We should free ourselves from the 
fetters of traditional concepts and forces of habit, genuinely 
implement reform, open up to the outside world, and invigorate 
the economy. We should emancipate our minds and find the 
correct path. Many impoverished areas have suffered losses 
because they have not sufficiently emancipated their minds and 
have not sufficiently opened up ways to develop their economy. 
While their barren hills, slopes, and land still remain 
uncultivated, their surplus labor also remains idle. Excessive 
labor should be taken as an asset, not a burden. To do a good 
job in helping poor areas through development, it is necessary 
to exploit local resources. At the same time, labor should be 
exported in an organized and planned way. He said: Training 
professional people by adhering to the spirit of self- reliance 
and hard work is the key to success. It is necessary to 
transform this innovative spirit into a material force. 
Finally, it is necessary to rely on giving play to the wisdom 
and intelligence of laborers. Therefore, importance must be 
given to helping poor areas and developing intellectural 
resources by relying on science and education. At the same 
time, family planning must be carried out successfully. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out emphatically: Whether the innovative 
spirit of self-reliance and hard work can be carried forward 
depends, to a large extent, on how in touch leading bodies in 
poor areas are and how strong the basic organizations of these 
areas are. It is necessary to strengthen work in impoverished 
counties. In line with the needs of the work to assist 
impoverished areas through development, outstanding cadres who 
are capable, can endure hardships, and maintain close ties with 
the masses should be promoted to assume the posts of county 
party committee secretaries and county heads. Relative 
stability regarding these posts should be maintained. It is 
necessary to strengthen the organization of party branches in 
impoverished villages. A good experience has been learned from 
the work of assisting impoverished areas -- that is, "while 
providing relief in money and material, it is more important to 
build up a good party branch." 
  Li Peng began his speech by stressing that it is the 
historical responsibility of the CPC and the government to 
assist poverty-stricken areas to change their undevelopment 
features through carrying out the plan to eliminate poverty by 
the year 2000. He pointed out: Solving the basic food and 
clothing problems of 80 million people in rural areas and 
assisting them to become comparatively well off during the next 
seven-year period are historical responsibilities which 
communists of this generation and people's governments at all 
levels must not evade. We must ensure the success of this major 
strategic plan, which has political as well as economic 
significance. Leading comrades of party committees and 
governments at all levels and persons in charge of all 
departments must consider this project as an important task, 
attend to it earnestly, and accomplish it according to schedule. 
  Li Peng stressed: Implementing the plan to eliminate poverty 
by the year 2000 and assist poverty-stricken areas to develop 
their economy is a strategic measure for gradually reducing the 
differences between the eastern and western parts of China. He 
said: Over 80 percent of the nation's 80 million people -- for 
whom basic food and clothing problems have yet to be totally 
resolved -- live in central and western parts of China, with the 
majority living in southwest and northwest parts of China. In 
this sense, solving the basic food and clothing problems of 
people in impoverished areas and helping them shake off poverty 
and become comparatively well off is an issue of reducing the 
developmental differences between eastern and western parts of 
China. He said: Differences do exist objectively. While it is 
impossible to totally eliminate the differences within a short 
time owing to historical, natural, geographical, social, and 
economic factors, we must exert positive efforts to gradually 
reduce and eventually eliminate the differences. We uphold the 
policy of encouraging some people and some regions to become 
affluent ahead of others through honest labor and legitimate 
businesses and then guide and assist the less developed areas in 
development. This is for the purpose of achieving nationwide 
prosperity. If we all are poverty-stricken, then nobody is able 
to assist anybody. Only when some regions have developed first 
and have developed a stronger economic ability can they be in a 
position to assist the less developed areas. He said: We have 
accomplished a great deal of work in reducing differences and 
achieving common prosperity. From a vertical point of view, 
both developed areas and poverty-stricken areas are developing; 
and from a lateral point of view, the differences between 
poverty- stricken areas and developed areas are still widening. 
Thus, party committees and governments at all levels must 
attach great importance to this problem and take effective 
measures to reduce the regional differences. 
  The eight measures which Li Peng mentioned in his speech 
are: 
Encouraging the prosperous and developed coastal areas and the 
large and medium cities to guide and assist the poverty-stricken 
areas; the state will provide poverty-stricken areas with 
adequate financial and monetary support; the state will give 
poverty-stricken areas preferential treatment with regard to 
major construction projects; gradually rationalizing through 
reform the prices of raw and semi-finished materials and primary 
goods; improving the competence and scientific and technical 
proficiency of people in poverty-stricken areas; carrying out 
open, experimental aid-the-poor projects on the basis of 
carrying out developmental aid-the-poor programs; mobilizing 
people in all social quarters to support developmental and 
construction projects in poverty-stricken areas; and encouraging 
poverty-stricken areas to foster the spirit of self- reliance 
and arduous struggle. 
  Li Peng stressed: To implement the plan to eliminate 
poverty by the year 2000, graduated responsibilities, especially 
responsibilities discharged by provincial governors, will be 
carried out under the centralized leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council. This means that principal 
leading comrades of provincial party committees and provincial 
governments must be concerned with aid-the-poor programs and 
properly attend to these programs. One point must be clear: 
Provincial governors must take personal charge. Executing the 
plan for eliminating poverty and resolving the masses' basic 
food and clothing problems by the year 2000 is a systems 
engineering project involving economic activities of financial, 
banking, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, industrial, 
and commercial sectors as well as operations of departments in 
charge of culture, education, public health, and planned 
parenthood. Thus, the government must have an overall plan and 
make comprehensive arrangements. He pointed out: Whether this 
plan can be accomplished according to schedule so that the basic 
food and clothing problems in impoverished areas can be resolved 
is a specific target which leading cadres at various levels must 
meet to see whether or not they really do things which are in 
the interest of the people and whether or not they care for the 
plight of the people. When we judge the performance of a 
province, a region, or a city, we cannot simply look at its 
economic growth, we must also examine how good the results are, 
how fast the people's living conditions have been improved, and 
how the basic food and clothing problems in impoverished areas 
have been resolved. Leading comrades at various levels should 
not only pay attention to developed areas, but more importantly, 
we must show concern for the problems of the people in 
poverty-stricken areas. In accordance with the plan to 
eliminate poverty in poverty-stricken areas by the year 2000, 
all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must draw 
up their individual plans. Moreover, they must check their 
progress and performance every year. By no means should efforts 
be slackened in the least. All government departments must 
continue to consider the fulfilment of aid-the-poor 
developmental programs as their own responsibility and draw up 
their respective aid-the-poor programs in accordance with the 
plan to eliminate poverty by the year 2000. 
  Present at today's meeting were persons in charge of 
governments of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions; and persons in charge of relevant central departments 
and committees.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Central Leader Reiterates That </F>
Resolute Measures Will be Implemented To Keep Scale of 
Investments in Fixed Assets Under Control"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 February (TA KUNG PAO)--Recently a 
central leader emphatically pointed out that it is necessary to 
continue to adopt resolute measures to solve the problem of 
investment in fixed assets and effectively strengthen the macro 
management of real estate and development zones. 
  The leader said: The central authorities' policy decision on 
strengthening and improving macroregulation and control is 
entirely necessary and correct. Nevertheless, the task of 
solving outstanding contradictions and problems is still quite 
arduous. Some advances have been made in controlling the scale 
of investment in fixed assets and readjusting the investment 
structure in the previous stage. However, overall, the action 
we have taken in this regard is very limited. Those projects 
which ought to be suspended or postponed have not been suspended 
or postponed. Problems such as an overexpanded scale of 
production and an overextended construction front still exist. 
If this situation continues to develop, this will be 
detrimental to both the local and overall situations. This 
being the case, all localities and departments must genuinely 
unify their thinking and actions on the central authorities' 
major policy decision on strengthening and improving 
macroregulation and control; take resolute and powerful measures 
to solve problems in fixed assets investment; seriously examine, 
check, and prioritize the projects under construction; and 
effectively ensure that funds are concentrated on key projects. 
  The leader said: It is necessary to put newly launched 
projects under strict control, effectively strengthen the macro 
management of real estate and development zones, earnestly and 
comprehensively screen real estate companies of all types, and 
stipulate that the government will withdraw land from real 
estate companies whose development capital is less than 25 
percent of their land purchase funds or sell their land within a 
year, they are prohibited from selling their land if their 
development capital is less than 20 percent of the land purchase 
funds, and, in future, in commercial developments by real estate 
companies, the proportion of residential housing units with 
minimal profits should not be less than 20 percent of the total. 
Efforts should be made to standardize the source of 
independently raised investment funds and strengthen supervision 
of the use of foreign loans. At present, a considerable amount 
of independently raised funds has exceeded the ceiling set by 
previous stipulations concerning the source of independently 
raised funds. A strict definition should be made to standardize 
the source of independently raised funds. Taking on foreign 
loans should be approved, and it is necessary to expedite reform 
of the investment structure and pay close attention to 
investment legislation. 
  According to another news report, the State Council recently 
made clear that the power to make industrial policy is that of 
the State Council, and the State Planning Commission is the 
relevant industrial policy management department specifically in 
charge of the study, formulation, and implementation of 
industrial polices. Other relevant departments in charge of 
comprehensive economic management and specialized departments 
also shoulder corresponding responsibilities, and departments 
concerned and localities should coordinate with them in many 
ways. 
  A State Council leader said: In the new situation, to do a 
good job of industrial policy, it is first of all necessary to 
have a firm grasp of the overall situation and stress the main 
points. Efforts should be made to comprehensively develop 
agriculture, strengthen the construction of infrastructure and 
basic industries, and invigorate the four pillar industries of 
machinery and electronics, the petrochemical industry, auto 
manufacturing, and the building industry. Next, it is necessary 
to have a clear picture of the market, meet the needs of the 
market, guide the market, and regulate and control the market. 
All sides concerned should coordinate with each other in this 
regard under unified policy decisions. Finally, it is 
necessary to strengthen standard basic rules and regulations.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China improved its 
financial situation last year through strengthened 
macro-economic control measures to support a sustained, stable 
and healthy economic development. 
  Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics Bureau, said 
today that China adopted a secure monetary policy to curtail the 
undue fixed assets investment and excessive money supply, absorb 
savings deposits, increase the input and adjust the structure of 
credit and loans. 
  These measures guaranteed the supply of capital for state 
key 
projects, in industrial and agricultural production, in 
purchasing farm and sideline products and in alleviating the 
shortage of circulating capital encountered by some important 
enterprises, he added. 
  At the end of 1993, he said, savings in various forms in 
state banks totalled 2,324.5 billion yuan, an increase of 433.9 
billion yuan or 23 percent more than the total a year before. 
The money in circulation amounted to 586.5 billion yuan, up 
35.3 percent, and the money supply in 1993 was 152.9 billion 
yuan. 
  At the same time, China's foreign exchange reserve 
increased, 
standing at 21.2 billion U.S. dollars in cash (savings deposits 
in foreign exchange at the Bank of China excluded), 1.76 billion 
more than at the beginning of that year, statistics showed. 
  Zhang said China's insurance service also made big strides 
in 
1993. Property insurance of various kinds totalled 5,137 
billion yuan, up 12.6 percent over 1992. Over 776,000 
enterprises joined in enterprise property insurance, 130 million 
households participated in household property insurance and 250 
million persons in life insurance programs. 
  He said that insurance companies tackled nearly 7 million 
claims of property loss and paid an indemnity of 13.7 billion 
yuan for settled cases. Another 9.1 billion yuan was paid to 
6.64 million persons as reparations in life insurance programs.

  [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- China's rural 
waterpower generating capacity has reached more than 2,000 kw, 
with an annual electrical energy production of over 59.4 billion 
kw. 
  An on-going meeting on national rural hydropower 
construction 
revealed that 14 out of 200 counties selected to undergo full 
electrification by the State Council in 1991 have now attained 
the goal ahead of time. 
  Over the past three years, rural areas of the country have 
added a generating capacity of 3.77 million kilowatts, according 
to the meeting. 
  Also, the total generating capacity of waterpower projects 
which are now under construction is expected to reach about 9.6 
million kilowatts this year. 
  Controls on electricity prices for users on rural hydropower 
networks have been lifted, and newly-built power stations have 
adopted a new price system of capital repayment with interest. 
  According to the meeting, the nation's total investment in 
waterpower construction in 1993 was seven billion yuan. 
  It also said that agricultural banks throughout the country 
provided loans of 8.64 million yuan to build medium- and 
small-sized power stations, 6,855 of which have been put into 
operation and more than 400 of which are still under 
construction. 
  The focus of the hydro-power construction drive over the 
past 
few years has been on the development of local electricity 
networks and joint stock companies. 
  More than 40 trans-county regional companies have been set 
up, and nearly 150 companies have been reorganized or rebuilt in 
line with the share-holding system or joint stock system. 
  The electrification in recent years has boosted economic 
development in rural areas, in mountainous areas in particular. 
  The average area of irrigated land per capita in the 
initially electrified counties increased to nearly half a 
hectare, with an average grain output per capita reaching more 
than 360 kilograms, according to the meeting. 
  The electrification drive enabled 33.2 million farmers in 
poverty-stricken mountainous areas to use electricity, the 
meeting said.

  [Text] Being worried that the inflation rate that has 
remained high would have a negative impact on the forthcoming 
National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee sessions, or 
even on social stability across the country, the Beijing higher 
leadership have decided to adopt a series of measures soon to 
keep down commodity prices. It is disclosed that as the fifth 
anniversary of the 4 June incident is drawing nearer and nearer, 
Zhongnanhai has ordered that "every measure be taken at whatever 
expense" to maintain stability across the country. 
  Information has it that the mission to keep down commodity 
prices has become the "central" task for China's major economic 
management sector. Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning 
Commission, and Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the commission, 
have been named to run this massive price-curbing operation, 
which will be carried out with the involvement and cooperation 
of a few other departments. In order to mitigate the 
drastically soaring trend of commodity prices, a series of 
actions will be adopted soon, including convening an urgent 
national telephone conference, launching a nationwide general 
inspection of commodity prices, and taking some necessary 
administrative actions to set price ceilings for some means of 
subsistence. The whole operation will be fully launched by 7 
March, with different phases started one after another. 
  The margin of price hikes in China has remained at a 
two-digit level since last year. Despite the macroeconomic 
regulation and control policy that was introduced in last July 
with the aim of cooling down the economy, the momentum of price 
hikes has not been curbed, with the commodity price index rising 
from 19.5 percent in May to 22 percent in August in 35 major 
cities. Then, last November, the country experienced a drastic 
increase in the prices of grain, edible oil, and foodstuffs, 
with grain prices alone rising by over 40 percent in some 
localities. Although grain prices were temporarily stabilized 
after 5 billion kg of grain reserves were sold on the market and 
some administrative actions taken by the state, the price 
increase trend was not completely halted. The price index in 35 
major cities for January this year, as released by the State 
Statistics Bureau, remained as high as 23.3 percent. Some 
Beijing experts noted that China is now facing the fourth 
commodity price "blast wave" after the three price increase peak 
periods in 1985, 1986, and 1988. 
  An informed source in Beijing revealed that the CPC higher 
leadership is deeply worried about the persistent high inflation 
rate. And the commodity price issue will be a politically 
sensitive one this year, particularly because this will be a 
"year of reform" and also the year to see the fifth anniversary 
of the 4 June incident. 
  Early this year, a central department concerned pointed out 
in a most confidential document: This year will see the fifth 
anniversary of the 1989 "Beijing contretemps" (that is, the 4 
June incident), "hostile forces" at home and abroad will be 
doing something. From last year onward, more and more of those 
who went abroad before and after 1989 will be returning to China 
(many of them have acquired the right of residence in foreign 
countries). Meanwhile, those who were arrested because of 
involvement in the 4 June incident are now being discharged from 
prison, and they may still be playing a role as "unstable 
factors," although most of them have now turned to work in the 
economic field. In view of this fact, the document noted that 
it is necessary to step up the "anti- subversion struggle" in 
the economic field, pay close attention to these people's 
activities after joining the business circles, and guard against 
any attempt by them to confront the authorities or engage in 
illegal political activities by making use of economic means or 
under economic camouflage. It is said that to cope with this 
development the Chinese public security and state security 
sectors have set up special departments to keep watch on the 
economic circles as well as dissidents in business circles.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Beijing aims to attract 
investment from some 200 to 300 trans-national companies in the 
next few years in a bid to bring a fast development to the local 
economy. 
  That is part of a package of plans announced by Lu Yucheng, 
vice- mayor of Beijing, in a recent meeting here. The plans are 
expected to help the capital reach the goal of a 
relatively-comfortable life three years earlier than the 
nation's schedule. 
  So far, more than 60 well-known trans-national firms have 
come to Beijing to invest, according to the latest statistics. 
  The investment fields that the municipal government tries to 
attract foreign investment in cover infrastructural 
construction, renovation of outdate houses, high-tech and 
new-tech sectors, economic and technological development zones, 
the service industry and modern commercial buildings. 
  In addition, the government attempts to lure foreign 
investment into such fields as high-efficiency farming, tourism 
and financial sectors. 
  Lu said Beijing also plans to expand its foreign trade by 
over two billion U.S. dollars this year through building more 
export- oriented firms and factories. Last year's total exports 
topped 1.68 billion U.S. dollars. The shareholding system will 
be promoted in more trade companies. 
  Officials said they hope to set up a total of 4,000 foreign- 
funded enterprises involving 1.25 billion U.S. dollars by the 
end of this year, up 39 percent over last year. 
  To achieve that goal, the vice-mayor said that more than 
10,000 high-level specialized experts involving international 
finance, international trade and modern management will be 
trained.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Geng Jun (5105 6511): "Looking Ahead at </F>
the `Two Sessions:' Market Economy Will Be the Keynote"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Last year, 
there were two key events in China's political and economic 
process: First, at the first session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC], "the state practices the socialist 
market economy" were written for the first time into the PRC 
Constitution, the fundamental law of the country. Second, the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee held 
late last year formulated the general framework of China's 
market economy. 
  The two points on both ends of the year formed the main 
course of China's reform. That is, the ship of China's economy 
eventually sailed into the main course of the market economy 
after passing the stages of a planned economy, an economy with 
planning as the mainstay and market as the complement, and a 
planned commodity economy. 
  On the whole, the current Chinese economic structure remains 
in the transitional stage from a planned to a market economy. 
In addition, five major reform measures in the taxation and 
financial, banking, investment, foreign trade, and modern 
enterprise management systems adopted this year will cover and 
effect a wide scope of activities to an intensive degreea and 
more problems and contradictions in the reforms will arise. 
Therefore, some experts expected that the forthcoming second 
session of the Eighth NPC would mainly discuss the operation of 
the market economy and realistically analyze and settle various 
problems in the market economy. This may be different from last 
year's NPC session, which just called for "grasping the 
opportunity for development" and establisheg the objective of a 
market economy. 
  The deputies to the NPC, who come from the forefront of the 
economic work, will pay more attention to the following 
questions: How to handle the relationship between the rate of 
growth and economic efficiency in the course of development; how 
to optimize the environment for fair competition, overcome the 
unevenness in regional development, and break local economic 
blockades and monopolies in some trades; how to quicken the 
process of building up an integrated legal system; how to deal 
with the obvious backwardness of the markets for production 
factors; how to transform government functions and turn the 
participants in market competition into creators of an 
environment for fair competition; how to solve such problems as 
why large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises lack dynamism 
in operation and entering the market; how to strengthen overall 
price control and establish various types of risk funds and 
reserve systems; and how to maintain the stability of the farm 
produce market. 
  In retrospect, the year since the first session of the 
Eighth 
NPC was a year recording the enhancement of the overall 
marketization degree of the Chinese economy. 
  The market system has been further maturing. There are now 
more than 1,600 wholesale markets for farm produce, more than 
1,000 wholesale markets for industrial consumer goods, and some 
1,800 wholesale markets for producer goods in the whole country. 
  Markets for production factors have also emerged. On the 
financial market, there are now 85 securities companies and more 
than 500 intermediate securities institutions in the whole 
country. On the technological market, there are some 2,800 
institutions of all types engaged in technology trade, and over 
10,000 information institutions of all types. On the labor 
force market, there are some 13,000 job placement institutions, 
which help some 8 million people find jobs each year. On the 
real estate market, there have emerged some 12,000 development 
companies. 
  The market pricing mechanism is also forming, and the 
proportion of prices fixed according to state plan has 
substantially decreased. Among farm produce and industrial 
consumer goods and capital goods, the proportions of prices 
being basically formed by market forces separately reached 90 
percent and 85 percent. The proportion of products controlled 
by the state's mandatory industrial production plans in the 
gross industrial output value of the whole country fell to only 
4 percent. 
  The Eighth NPC Standing Committee also created a remarkable 
record in the past year as it passed 20 laws, made 13 
law-related decisions, and basically scrutinized eight draft 
laws. This was the most laws the NPC Standing Committee has 
ever deliberated and enacted in a year. The "company law" has 
played a role in regulating and standardizing the operation of 
1.03 million business companies of all types in the market 
economy. The "anti-improper competition law" provides the legal 
standards for market behavior. 
  It is expected that some other subjects will also be 
discussed by the deputies at the forthcoming NPC session, but 
the experts held that all of them were just problems in the 
course of advances and development of the Chinese economy and 
were just interludes of the main melody. 
  Sensibly raising, analyzing, and resolving these problems at 
the "two sessions" will enalbe the ship of the Chinese economic 
reform to move ahead along the course of the market economy by 
braving winds and waves.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 4 (XINHUA) -- China's foreign 
exchange business has been brisk in recent years, as witnessed 
by the growth of swap and securities markets, according to a 
senior finance official. 
  Song Haipeng, deputy director of the State Administration of 
Exchange Control, made the statement at a recent international 
financial symposium in this special economic zone in Guangdong 
Province. 
  Song said that there are 2,292 financial organs in China 
handling foreign exchange business, including 90 foreign-funded 
banks or Sino-foreign banking joint ventures. 
  Chinese financial organizations have 230 billion U.S. 
dollars 
in foreign currency assets. They deal with various kinds of 
business in international and domestic financial markets. 
  More than 100 swap markets in the country make it possible 
for enterprises and individuals to buy and sell their foreign 
currency. The transaction volume during the past two years has 
reached some 25 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Since 1991, when China began to issue B shares to overseas 
securities investors, 30 types of B-share stocks have been 
listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, pooling 
more than one billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. 
  Meanwhile, a number of state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises have listed their stocks on the Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange. 
  In addition, Chinese enterprises succeeded in issuing bonds 
in Tokyo, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Luxembourg and the 
United States last year. 
  Beginning April 1 this year, a nationwide unified interbank 
foreign currency transaction system will be adopted to make it 
more convenient for currency sellers and buyers to conduct their 
business. 
  Song said that during the past few years China's economy has 
been growing at a high speed and the country is opening wider to 
the outside world. As a result, China has become a major 
participant in international trade. All these factors will 
further promote China's foreign currency business, Song said.

  [Text] Chinese private businessmen are growing confident 
in State policies and market development prospects as evidenced 
by the sharp increase of private enterprises last year. 
  More than 98,200 private enterprises began last year, 
bringing the total figure to about 268,000, China Business Times 
reported. 
  Private firms' total tax turnover surpassed 29 billion yuan 
($3.33 billion) in 1993, a 43 percent rise over 1992. This 
brings more social and economic benefits to the nation. 
  One new and important development was that private 
enterprises began to re-invest more in business expansion. 
  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which 
oversees private enterprises, said their registered capital hit 
68.05 billion yuan ($7.82 billion). The average registered 
capital for a private business increased last year 80 per cent 
from 159,000 yuan ($18,276) in 1992 to 286,000 ($32,870). 
  And private enterprises with at least 1 million yuan 
1$114,900) in registered capital reached 8,784, the paper 
reported. 
  This was a 380 per cent growth in one year. 
  Meanwhile, 5,302 private enterprises employed 100 to 499 
workers and 303 had more than 500 worker. Many private 
enterprises have turned toward limited liability systems. 
  Last year a record 48,580 private companies with limited 
liabilities were set up and their registered capital made up 64 
percent of the total private enterprises capital. 
  While vying with State-owned enterprises in the domestic 
market 2,000 private firms extended their businesses abroad last 
year. earning about 1.58 billion yuan ($181.6 million) in 
foreign exchange. 
  The quality of workers in these plants is also improving as 
more university graduates and scientific and technical workers 
are looking for jobs in the private market. 
  Another encouraging development, according to the newspaper, 
was that more private enterprise owners have switched their 
business focus to scientific and technological advisory services 
and the tertiary industry. 
  Almost 60 percent of last year's 98,000 new private 
enterprises are engaged in the tertiary services, especially 
those providing high-tech services such as computer technology, 
software development and private education services. 
  Despite the rapid development in the past decade, experts 
say, the private economy is only at an infant stage in China and 
its strength is still quite limited.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China earned a total of 
30 billion U.S. dollars through the export of light industrial 
products last year. 
  With a big rise of 15.17 percent over the previous year, the 
export volume from the light industrial sector took up one-third 
of the total export volume for the whole country. 
  And 64.9 percent of the export volume was achieved by the 
export of 14 major light industrial products, which yielded 
19.46 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The export volume of timepieces, household appliances, 
leather shoes, toys and plastic products surpassed 1.3 billion 
U.S. dollars each. 
  The export volume of machinery and electronics products 
registered a sharp rise of 27.2 percent over the previous year. 
  Yu Zhen, head of the China Council of Light Industry (CCLI), 
said that as a pillar of China's national economy, light 
industry has established a production network which can not only 
fulfill domestic demands, but also wield a certain competitive 
edge on the world market. 
  As Yu put it, China's light industry will expand 
international cooperation, introduce advanced overseas 
technology and facilities, and further improve the quality of 
products. 
  About 218 representatives from China's famous light 
industrial enterprises today signed a declaration here, to mark 
the "International Consumers Day", which was set to be March 15. 
  The declaration pledged their determination to contribute to 
providing more famous-brand products.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Hong Fei (7703 7378): "As Tax Reform </F>
Triggers Price Surge, the Chinese Government Is Urgently Seeking 
Countermeasures"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 2 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--As of 1 
January this year, the Chinese authorities substantially 
reformed the tax system. The main purpose was to simplify it, 
unify tax rates, fairly share tax burdens, and create an 
environment for comparatively fair competition inside and 
outside enterprises according to the requirements of the market 
economy. However, shortly after the adoption of the new tax 
system, many manufacturers raised the prices of their products, 
and many wholesalers and retail shops also "followed suit," thus 
causing price disorder. In January and February, prices 
increased by an average of over 20 percent. This caused 
resentments among the masses. The authorities could not but 
decided to adopt price control measures as of 1 March. 
  Reportedly, this year's taxation reform included the 
following four main points: 
  First, reforming enterprise income taxes. In the past, 
different tax rates were applied to different types of 
enterprises. For example, the tax rate for foreign-funded 
enterprises was 33 percent, while the tax rate for state-owned 
enterprises was 55 percent. Thus, the state-owned enterprises 
were situated in an unfavorable position in market competition. 
After taxation reform, a unified tax rate of 33 percent was 
applied to all enterprises regardless of their ownership nature. 
  Second, reforming circulation taxes. The original unified 
industrial and commercial taxes levied on foreign-funded 
enterprises were removed, and new circulation taxes, including 
value-added, consumption, and business taxes, were established 
and applied to all domestic-funded and foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  Third, reforming individual income taxes. For Chinese 
citizens, the part of personal income above 800 yuan per month 
is taxable; for non-mainland citizens, the part of personal 
income is that above $550 per month. It is a six-tiered 
progressive taxation system. The tax rate for the bottom tier is 
5 percent and for the top tier 40 percent. 
  Fourth, reforming other taxes. This included the imposition 
of land value-added taxes, securities transaction taxes, 
inheritance and gift taxes, and urban maintenance and 
construction taxes. 
  According to an official in the State Administration of 
Taxation, after the completion of the taxation reforms, China's 
industrial and commercial taxes will decreased from 33 taxes in 
the past to 17, and the tax structure will become more 
reasonable. This will be conducive to the establishment of a 
market economic structure. 
  The authorities repeatedly stated that taxation reform was 
just a structural adjustment. With the exception of a very 
small number of enterprises, the tax burden on enterprises would 
not increase. However, after the adoption of the new taxation 
system, the prices of many commodities increased immediately. 
Statistics show that in January, the prices of consumer goods 
in 35 large and medium-sized cities increased by 23.3 percent 
over the same period of last year. The prices of many 
commodities in Guangdong increased by 22 to 39 percent over the 
same period of last year. Some enterprises in Fujian even added 
a 17-percent tax to the enhanced prices. Ordinary people were 
naturally discontented with this situation, and complaints could 
be heard everywhere. 
  According to a survey, the recent price hikes were mainly 
attributed to two reasons. First, some tax payers did not 
completely understand the new taxation system, and thought the 
value-added taxes meant that an amount equal to 13 percent or 17 
percent of original prices would be added; and some even thought 
that a 17-percent value-added tax would be levied on every link 
of commodity circulation. Second, some tax payers took 
advantage of this opportunity to reap higher profits by raising 
prices. 
  While facing the situation of price hikes, the tax 
department 
has more clearly explained the new taxation system, and in late 
February, the State Planning Commission and the State 
Administration of Taxation jointly issued a "Circular on the 
Necessity of Keeping Prices Stable After the Reform of the 
Taxation System" which stressed: "The difference between 
purchase prices and sale prices (calculated according to the 
current tax-included prices) for all consumer goods and producer 
goods (including chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and other farm 
production materials) must be kept unchanged in all wholesale 
and retail links. All taxes will be levied within the 
difference rate. No enterprise and unit can expand the 
difference rate without authorization." The circular also 
announced: "Severe disciplinary action should be taken to 
immediately correct the practice of changing the prices of 
commodities subject to prices fixed by the state without the 
approval of the price control department and the practice of 
raising prices without authorization in order to reap higher 
profits by taking advantage of taxation reform or doing this 
because of misunderstanding the new taxation system." 
  Because the price hikes were not checked, the government 
then 
issued another decree, ordering that shops in the whole country 
must sell goods at prices approved by the authorities; 
otherwise, they may be fined up to 10,000 yuan. Then, the 
government announced that price controls will be exercised on 24 
commodities which are people's daily necessities, and organized 
inspecting personnel to check shops in order to stabilize prices 
in the shortest possible period of time.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Feb (XINHUA) -- China has launched a 
reform in industry and business tax system in an all-round way, 
with turnover tax and income tax as the main contents, since 1 
January. The new tax system has been implemented for nearly two 
months to date; judged by situations in various localities, the 
new tax system has smoothly entered a course of normal operation 
and has basically undergone a stable transition. 
  Following the passage of the new individual income tax law 
by 
the National People's Congress Standing Committee on 30 October 
1993, the State Council successively promulgated six sets of 
interim regulations on the collection of value-added tax, 
consumption tax, business tax, institutional income tax, 
incremental tax on land value, and resource tax. Until now, 
except for incremental tax on land value, regulations or rules 
for the implementation of the interim regulations governing six 
other taxes have been promulgated and enacted. The State 
Council recently issued a circular deciding to cancel market 
transaction tax, livestock transaction tax, special tax on fuel 
oil, bonus tax, and regulatory tax on wages, and delegating the 
rights of collecting taxes on slaughtering animals and banquet 
taxes to local authorities. This indicates that the major parts 
of China's general tax reform package, particular the reform 
measures for main categories of tax, have all been released. The 
reform of financial and taxation system is the focus of China's 
current reform package as a whole, and tax reform is the most 
important part in the reform of the financial and taxation 
system. The smooth implementation of the new tax system has laid 
a firm foundation for stepping up the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure in China. 
  The present tax reform is an overall, comprehensive, and 
structural reform. It involves the readjustment of interests 
for every enterprise and individual; therefore, it is more 
difficult, has more contradictions, and may involve great risks 
if it is not handled properly. The CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council have attached great importance to tax reform. 
Leaders from the State Council have personally taken charge of 
this task and have given many important directions. To ensure a 
smooth implementation of tax reform, cadres, staff, and workers 
of taxation departments at all levels have done a great deal of 
work. Since the beginning of October 1993, taxation organs at 
all levels have launched various forms of training for the broad 
masses of taxation cadres and factory directors, as well as 
enterprise managers, finance and accounting personnel, 
tax-handling persons, and even persons in charge of marketing 
and purchasing, so that the overwhelming majority of taxation 
cadres and enterprises will understand the importance of current 
tax reform and fundamentally grasp its major contents and 
operating points. 
  Except for the great concern from the CPC Central Committee 
and the State Council, leaders of all localities and departments 
have also shown full concern over and support for tax reform. 
Principal leaders of many provinces, municipalities, regions, 
and departments have made statements to publicize the new tax 
system and demanded that their subordinate departments 
coordinate the implementation of the new tax system. In a 
"national taxation propaganda day" campaign organized by the 
State Administration of Taxation on 23 January, tens of 
thousands of taxation cadres and enterprise finance officers and 
accountants around the country, led by local party and 
government leaders, went to the streets to publicize the tax law 
and offer consultation services to the public. Meanwhile, to 
successfully carry out the new tax system and resolve all kinds 
of problems in a timely manner, the State Administration of 
Taxation has given more directions and strengthened the 
management -- in nearly the past two months since the beginning 
of the year, it has issued some 60 documents and fax messages of 
various sorts and held two national telephone conferences with 
the participation of taxation directors at and above the county 
level to directly convey relevant guidelines and requirements to 
grassroots taxation bureaus, thus making sure government decrees 
go down to all parts of the country without obstruction. 
  There are several important indicators to tell if the tax 
reform is a success: Whether the reform causes fluctuations in 
commodity prices and significant price hikes; whether revenue 
grows steadily or slides; whether a great quantity of forged 
special vouchers for value-added tax and the chaos of tax 
evasion through issuing vouchers is revealed; and whether the 
reform produces positive or negative influences on production. 
  -- Reviewing the situation of implementation over the past 
two months, commodity prices, the most troublesome problem, did 
not fluctuate or rise greatly because of the tax reform. The 
irrational sales of electrical appliances and other commodities, 
caused by a misunderstanding that consumption tax is an 
additional tax added to current commodity prices, soon passed 
after an explanation given through propaganda. After the 
introduction of the value-added tax, some people misunderstood 
the 17-percent tax, which was excluded from the commodity price, 
as an additional tax added to the price already including tax. 
After repeated explanation by taxation organs and intensive 
checks by departments concerned, this problem has been basically 
cleared and corrected. 
  -- The revenue still maintains a trend of higher growth. By 
20 February, the state's revenue from industry and business 
taxes amounted to 40.7 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent over the 
same period last year. 
  -- Generally, the institution of new tax system did not 
adversely influence production and circulation; industrial 
production still grows rapidly. According to statistics of the 
State Administration of Taxation, the country's industries at 
and above township levels achieved 290.3 billion yuan in total 
output value in January, up 33.2 percent over the same month 
last year. After the extensive launch of value-added tax, many 
small-scale taxpayers have encountered some problems in their 
production and operations during a certain period of time, but 
taxation departments swiftly took effective measures to correct 
and resolve the problems. 
  -- The special vouchers for value-added tax were all in 
place 
before 1 January. No big problems occurred in the process of 
printing, delivery, distribution, and application. Moreover, 
improvement has been made to the vouchers' columns, size, and 
anti- forgery mark in line with actual conditions; at the 
request of enterprises, septuplicate vouchers are now available 
in addition to the quadruplicate ones. The State Administration 
of Taxation also decided that anti-forgery vouchers unitedly 
printed by the banknote printer be used across the country 
beginning 1 May to forestall the emergence of counterfeit 
vouchers. 
  It can be said that all walks of life and most enterprises 
have greeted the new tax system quite comfortably; foreign 
investors in China have dismissed their apprehensions because 
their tax burden did not become heavier following the 
implementation of the new tax system. 
  However, we should also be aware that despite the fact that 
new tax system has been launched for nearly two months, some 
unavoidable frictions still exist in the course of transferring 
from the old tax system to the new one. Therefore, in a recent 
interview with this reporter, Jin Xin, deputy director of the 
State Administration of Taxation said: The achievements we 
scored so far are merely preliminary ones, which are not enough 
to demonstrate that the new tax system is a complete success. 
Many new problems and conditions have yet to fully emerge; 
therefore, we should remain sober-minded and study and handle 
all kinds of problems in time. 
  It is noteworthy that China's current tax reform is aimed at 
establishing a taxation system that is suitable to a socialist 
market economic structure, conforms to international practice, 
and tallies with China's actual situation. The guiding ideology 
of the reform is: unifying tax laws, imposing taxes fairly, 
streamlining the tax system, dividing power rationally, 
rationalizing distribution relations, and standardizing 
distribution methods. The design of the reform package has 
upheld the basic principle of keeping the general level of the 
tax burden unchanged. However, because of the uneven levels of 
tax burden under the original tax system, it is impossible to 
keep every taxpayer's vested interests unaffected after 
extensively adopting the value-added tax system. We demand that 
all sectors concerned keep the overall situation in mind, 
support the implementation of a new tax system from the 
perspective of overall and long-term interest, and never 
encourage price hikes just because some enterprises have a 
heavier tax burden. We should be aware that tax reform is the 
foundation for establishing a socialist market economic 
structure; once the tax reform is put in place and reaches the 
expected results, it will greatly step up the pace of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure. Thus the 
reform is in the interests of us all from a long-term view.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Yuan: "Bank Plans To Expand Credit </F>
Card Business"] 
  [Text] More Chinese will be using credit cards if the plan 
by the leading savings bank succeeds. 
  The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China announced 
yesterday it will vigorously expand its credit card business 
this year. 
  Chen Xiaoyan, director of the bank's credit card department, 
said the goal is to increase the number of its Peony credit card 
holders from 2 million to 3.5 million. 
  And the bank expects holders to spend 100 billion yuan 
($11.49 billion) with the cards--twice last year's figure. 
  The number of stores accepting the card is to expand to 
30,000, 5,000 more than last year. 
  Services will also be expanded in railroad stations, 
hospitals, securities markets and other facilities, Chen said. 
  To support the plan, the bank has decided to speed up 
efforts 
to unify and standardize computer systems at all its branches. 
  The effort will not only make operations more efficient but 
also make life easier for card holders, Chen said. 
  With a unified computer network, Beijing card holders, for 
instance, will be able to draw cash from automatic teller 
machines (ATM) or charge goods at stores in Guangzhou. 
  At present, the bank has more than 600 ATMs nationwide, 
mainly in large and medium-sized cities. 
  The bank also plans to co-operate with the Ministry of 
Internal Trade to open more credit card services in department 
stores this year. 
  Last year the bank's credit card business grew rapidly. The 
number of card holders and transaction volume increased 100 
percent and 455 percent respectively over 1992. 
  At present, the bank's 2 million card holders account for 
half of the country's total. 
  The People's Construction Bank of China, the Bank of China 
and the Agricultural Bank of China have issued their own credit 
cards. Internationally known Master Card and Visa have also 
entered the Chinese market in co-operation with Chinese banks. 
  Credit cards made their debut in China in the mid-1980s and 
have become a status symbol, especially in the coastal and 
southern areas of the country. 
  Because the "plastic money" also helps banks attract more 
deposits and reduces the flow of bank notes, the Chinese 
government has encouraged their development. 
  Chen predicted China will have 7 million card holders this 
year, nearly twice the number last year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- Beijing, China's 
capital, is making headway in housing construction, with 
billions of yuan earmarked for improving residents' living 
conditions. 
  According to a top municipal government official, the city 
has spent 26 billion yuan in building residential quarters over 
the past 15 years, with newly-built apartments totalling some 80 
million square meters in floor space, six times the amount in 
1949 when New China was born. 
  Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa, in a report delivered at a 
meeting on housing, said that more than 1.3 million families 
have moved into new homes since the start of China's reform and 
opening to the outside world. 
  The average living space per capita increased to 8.3 square 
meters in 1993 from 4.55 square meters in 1978, the official 
said. 
  The pace of urban housing construction has quickened since 
the 1980s. To date, more than 110 residential areas have been 
built in urban districts, and 69 old and dangerous housing zones 
have been rebuilt. 
  The official added that the current housing construction 
drive has greatly improved both the citizens' living conditions 
and the urban environment. 
  He said that the city has broken ground for about 10,000 
square meters in newly-designed "comfortable apartment 
buildings", with the aim of improving housing for people with 
low incomes. 
  But, he noted, there are about 200,000 households still 
living in very bad quarters, with an average living space of no 
more than four square meters. 
  The official revealed that the city's goal for this year's 
residential construction is 6.55 million square meters. 
  He urged government departments and leaders at all levels to 
pay close attention to the work and to mobilize the broad masses 
to promote housing construction and reform.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- A non-governmental 
horizon market survey and analysis company has opened a 
subsidiary in Los Angeles in a move to expand its business 
worldwide. 
  The subsidiary is the first of its kind ever opened by a 
Chinese investigation company in other countries. 
  Yuan Yue, president of the Beijing-based Horizon Company, 
who 
has just returned from the U.S., said that his company's 
subsidiary in Los Angeles will help Chinese businesses 
investigate the credibility of American investors in China and 
assess the value of these investors' equipment. 
  "Our subsidiary will also make feasibility studies of 
investment projects in America and conduct U.S. market surveys 
for Chinese clients," he said. 
  The company can also investigate the credit ratings of Hong 
Kong and Taiwan investors in the mainland and conduct market 
surveys for mainland clients, he added. 
  Shortly after its founding in September 1992, the company 
conducted a survey of the growth of major private companies in 
China, together with the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce and other organizations. 
  The company became known all over China for the survey of 
100 
private companies in 15 provinces, each with assets exceeding 
one million yuan. 
  By the end of 1993, the company had conducted 46 market 
surveys and polls and opened subsidiaries in the big cities of 
Nanjing, Shenzhen, Dalian and Chengdu. 
  According to President Yuan Yue, the investment projects for 
which the company has made feasibility studies involve a total 
investment of 200 million yuan. 
  "Expanding our business worldwide is our company's goal," he 
said. 
  To this end, it has forged cooperative relations with market 
survey companies in Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and Japan, 
he said. 
  It is now discussing with a number of American universities 
and survey companies the possibilities of conducting market 
surveys in China, which will cost hundreds of thousands of U.S. 
dollars. 
  The company has decided to invite foreign experts to serve 
as 
its advisers on technological progress in a bid to better serve 
overseas customers, he said.

  [Text] Changchun, March 4 (XINHUA) -- A car of their own is 
the dream of numerous Chinese families. And quite 
understandably, it is the aim of China's car manufacturers to 
make this dream come true. 
  The dream seems to have advanced a step closer to the truth, 
as a minicar, named "Haishen", or Poseidon, was developed just 
before the traditional Chinese New Year in early February, in 
this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, where China's 
first automobile was produced. 
  The four-seat minicar, with a maximum speed of 80 kph, was 
developed by the Haishen household car institute. 
  To put the minicar into mass production, the North Haishen 
Automobile Stock Company will be established later this year. 
Li Weidong, the chief initiator, said the company plans to 
produce 1,000 Haishen minicars in 1994 and 10,000 in 1995. 
  The prototype of Haishen was produced here last August by 
senior researchers and engineers with the Changchun Automobile 
Research Institute. 
  Though it is designed to be China's first car for common 
people, and meanfully named as "Sankoule", or "a happy 
three-member family", an appropriate name with regard of China's 
one-child policy, some people refuse to admit it to be a car, 
saying that it is merely a motorcycle with a top. 
  In fact, Haishen is not the first, nor the only attempt by 
the Chinese automobile industry to produce a car for the 
ordinary Chinese residents. 
  The idea was first put forward by the Xiali Automobile 
Company in Tianjin. However, its 90,000-yuan price militated 
against its promotion strategy. 
  Meanwhile, a plant under the No. 1 Automobile Factory of 
Jilin has developed a four-seat minibus and has put it into 
small-scale production. 
  The Nanjing Automobile Plant of Jiangsu Province, east 
China, 
developed a three-seat minicar named "little squirrel". And in 
southwest China's Sichuan Province a minicar is to be produced 
by a former defense factory. 
  Besides being small, all these minicars share the same 
traits 
in that they consume less gasoline, and unlike their more 
sophisticated counterparts, all their parts are China-made. 
  Their biggest common point, however, is that they all strive 
to be as cheap as possible, so that they can be acceptable to 
the ordinary people. 
  At present, the Jilin minibus sells at 40,000 yuan, the 
Haishen at 30,000 yuan, and the "little squirrel", the cheapest, 
at 5,000 yuan. 
  But doubts and worries continue about whether they are 
genuine cars, how to improve their quality and how they can be 
put into mass production. 
  However, some experts hold that the minicar is probably a 
must if the Chinese automobile industry, the sector with the 
deepest impact on the centrally-planned economy, is to step into 
the market economy. They even hint that minicar will possibly 
bring the prosperity that the automobile industry has waited for 
so long. 
  The minicar -- is it a dream coming true?

  [Text] Hefei, March 3 (XINHUA) -- "Spend Spring Festival in 
the first month of the year and begin farming in the second 
month". So goes a saying along the Huaihe River flowing through 
east China's Anhui Province. 
  However, the reality proves that the saying is getting old. 
  Just days after the Spring Festival, which fell on February 
10 this year, this correspondent paid a visit to Fengyang County 
in Anhui. 
  In 1978, 19 households of farmers of Xiaogang Village in 
southeastern Fengyang divided the farmland between themselves 
and initiated the now-renowned household contract system in 
China. That pioneering contract, which carried the 
finger-prints of the villagers, is now kept in the Chinese 
Revolutionary Military Museum. 
  The mist of firecrackers still hung over the county. Farmers 
could be seen watering and spreading fertilizers in the fields 
which were turning green. Now and then vehicles carrying 
fertilizer moved past on country roads. Farmers went to the 
county for buying seeds and farm tools. 
  Early in the morning this correspondent arrived at Guangou 
Township of the county. It has just dug seven pools and 
transformed more than 100 ha of low-yield farmland. 
  More than 60 young men were studying at "green certificate" 
classes, which teach agricultural knowledge. Party Secretary 
Jin Xuejin and township Magistrate Hu Baoping were busy 
distributing seeds imported from Japan and Taiwan. 
  In a village called Chenyu Village, old men and children 
were 
sitting in sunlight and few grown-ups were to be seen on the 
streets. 
  This correspondent met 40-year-old villager Zhang Qiliang 
near a school. He said excitedly that farmers of Fengyang had 
tasted the sweetness of the market last year. Quality rice was 
sold for a yuan per jin (500 g), which meant that every family 
in the village earned some 1,000 yuan more last year. 
  With a few words, he said goodbye and went to plant 
vegetables. 
  In Linhuai Township, a lad squatted by the roadside studying 
a brand-new two-wheel tractor which he had just bought for 3,600 
yuan. He contracted some land from those who have left the 
village to work in larger cities and his cattle could not cope 
with all the field work. 
  In Xiaogang Village, which was lauded as the birthplace of 
the rural reform in China, party Secretary Yan Junchang said 
that the majority of the villagers still cling to the land and 
the market reform of agriculture and grain price increases 
greatly heightened the people's initiatives. 
  In 1993, the village saw a per capita added income of over 
300 yuan. The secretary's family collected some 25 tons of 
grain last year. 
  Fengyang County was well-known as a poor place in history 
and 
it is now among the top 100 grain producing counties of China. 
In 1993, the per capita income of farmers increased by 55 
percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province has invested 100 million yuan in the 
resettlement program for the Three Gorges Project last year. 
  About one million local residents need to be moved out of 
the 
area where a reservoir will be built on the middle reaches of 
the Chang Jiang River, according to experts involved in the 
project. 
  Preparations for the resettlement of local residents in the 
province started in 1985, and the pace of evacuation was 
quickened last year. 
  The local government has also paid close attention to the 
rebuilding of the towns and major enterprises that have to be 
relocated. 
  The present stage of resettlement has focused on land 
development. A total of 1,865 hectares of land was used for the 
resettlement in 1993 and about 2,000 hectares of arid land was 
turned into irrigated farmland. 
  And now in the province, a range of newly-built cities and 
towns with good roads, housing, sufficient drinking water and 
electricity are being built for the resettled to enjoy a better 
life there.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anhui's Commercial System Attains </F>
Goals Set for 1993"] 
  [Text] Last year, Anhui's commercial system achieved new 
results by changing its thinking, deepening reform, and 
exploring news ways in expanding its business. In accordance 
with the statistics, the total amount of purchased commodities 
in 1993 reached 10.2 billion yuan, a 20-percent increase over 
the previous year. The amount of commodities sold in 1993 was 
11.6 billion yuan, a 16.5-percent increase over the previous 
year. 
  The commercial system has comprehensively fulfilled its goal 
set for 1993. In light of the goal set by this term of the 
government to "achieve great economic development in three years 
and enter a higher stage of economic development in five years," 
the commercial system has conscientiously carried out its tasks. 
In the past year, it has overfulfilled its assigned goals in 
four areas: Direct retail sales increased by 16.8 percent; 
after subtracting for policy factors, actual profits reached 
43.46 million yuan; more than 1,300 small state-owned 
enterprises are run by civilians, accounting for 44.2 percent of 
the total; and 10 large commercial networks, including the 
Shangzhidu and Wuhu commercial buildings which are to be 
completed before the end of this term of the government, began 
construction. 
  Reform of the commercial system is deepening. First of all, 
more than 600 large and medium-sized commercial enterprises have 
consolidated and improved their deregulation reforms and have 
changed their management mechanisms, thus accounting for more 
than 70 percent of all enterprises. Second, the reform of the 
shareholding system has taken an initial step. Eight 
enterprises have been approved to implement the shareholding 
system (the Hefei and Wuhu Department Stores have been 
reorganized into a limited liability stock company). Another 18 
companies are now being set up. Third, enterprises are 
accelerating their structural reform. The provincial commercial 
system has established seven enterprise groups, merged seven 
companies, and auctioned off 18 small enterprises. Fourth, 
according to the principle of restructuring, changing product 
lines, and leasing out, more than 1,300 state-owned small 
enterprises are run by civilians, accounting for 44.2 percent of 
all enterprises in the same category. Fifth, the reform of 
commercial administration has been further deepened, thus paving 
the way for the reform of government organizations. 
  Marked achievements have been made in building commercial 
networks. In recent years, localities in the province have 
seized opportunities and have accelerated the construction of 
commercial networks. They have tried to pool funds through many 
channels and in various forms including loans, issuing bonds, 
the holding and buying of shares, and joint ventures. In 1993, 
the provincial commercial system has built, rebuilt, and 
enlarged more than 900 commercial networks, with a total floor 
space of more than 900,000 square meters. The total investment 
in the project has reached 500 million yuan. Among these 
commercial networks, 18 have more than 10,000 square meters of 
floor space. 
  The provincial commercial system has focused on stabilizing 
the market and bringing into play its role as the main channel. 
In light of the relatively great changes in the market since 
last August and particularly during last November, the 
provincial commercial department has concentrate its efforts on 
commodity supplies for festival seasons. At the beginning of 
last December, the department began to arrange commodity 
supplies for festival seasons. In mid-December, the department 
held a meeting attended by directors of commercial bureaus at 
the prefecture and city level and set concrete requirements for 
arranging the market supplies for the Spring Festival. On the 
eve of the 1994 Spring Festival, the department sent 12 people 
to inspect the work in four areas. All localities actively 
organized commodity resources to ensure the supply by the 
market. They also adopted many price-control measures, 
including limiting the prices of important commodities and goods 
in great demand, supervising and controlling price fluctuations, 
and establishing a reserve system. The situation of market 
supplies was rapidly improved, thus bringing into play the 
state-owned commercial sector's role as a main channel.

  With favorable natural and geographic conditions, the zone, 
opened to the outside world in November 1993, is expected to 
become the third largest development zone after Pudong area in 
Shanghai and Yangpu in south China's Hainan Province. 
  To date, the zone has invested nearly 800 million yuan to 
upgrade its infrastructure and has worked out a series of 
preferential polices in a bid to attract more overseas investors.

<F P=106> [By station correspondents Li Zhaohui and Xu Yingxiang; from </F>
the "Provincial News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] The province has determined the focuses of its 
taxation work this year -- to attain two objectives of struggle. 
One objective is to ensure the full and smooth implementation 
of the new tax system, the other being to ensure a steady growth 
in tax revenues. 
  The provincial taxation work conference, which concluded 
yesterday [23 February], revealed that the new tax system has 
been functioning normally on the whole (?without increasing the 
overall burden on enterprises) since the province began 
implementing it more than a month ago. While the provincial tax 
revenue in January was up 80 percent over the same month last 
year, commodity prices did not fluctuate violently because of 
the tax reforms. 
  The provincial tax bureau demanded that the vast number of 
taxation cadres in the province conscientiously take good charge 
of the study, propaganda of and training in the new tax system, 
as well as fully and correctly implement the new tax system. 
The cadres should also earnestly strengthen the administration 
and use of the special receipt for value-added tax and further 
do a good job in the [words indistinct] of value-added tax. 
Taxation departments at all levels should earnestly and 
properly track and supervise the implementation of the new tax 
system. 
  Vice Governor Yu Xingde attended and addressed the meeting.

  [Text] Qingdao, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Qingdao, the largest 
port city in east China's Shandong Province, is succeeding in 
its attempt to develop its foreign trade by deepening reform and 
improving its investment climate. 
  Last year Qingdao's import and export volume was 1.388 
billion U.S. dollars-worth, 56.7 percent higher than in the 
previous year. 
  Its export volume was over one billion U.S. dollars-worth in 
1993, 50.9 percent more than in 1992. 
  The city government has made special efforts to attract 
overseas funds. 
  Early last year Mayor Yu Zhengsheng led a delegation to Hong 
Kong where he announced a package of projects available for 
investors. 
  Later, Qingdao sent missions to countries including the 
United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Singapore, Russia 
and Germany for the same purpose. 
  At the same time, foreign trade companies in Qingdao have 
reformed and readjusted their operation and management methods 
in their accounting, labor and distribution systems. 
  Various contract forms have been set up by companies, 
linking 
enterprise efficiency with employees' incomes. 
  Experiments in joint-stock systems and setting up foreign 
trade groups engaging in industrial, agricultural and technical 
production have been made in this port city in a bid to expand 
markets internationally. 
  Light industry, food and edible oil, and textile companies 
have set up permanent offices in Russia, the ROK, Japan and 
Argentina. The city now has over 30 sales agencies overseas. 
  Last year 17 trade and industrial enterprises in the city 
each exported over 10 million U.S. dollars-worth of goods. 
  Qingdao now has over 300 foreign-funded enterprises which 
are 
export-oriented. 
  Qingdao exports mainly to Hong Kong and developing countries 
in Latin American, African and Asian countries. 
  Last year its exports to Japan reached 230 million 
dollars-worth, exceeding the value of exports to Hong Kong and 
making Japan Qingdao's biggest foreign trade partner. 
  The year 1993 also witnessed a big increase in foreign 
investment. Some 1,629 foreign-funded projects were approved by 
the city, with contracted foreign funds totalling 1.85 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  Some 68 projects approved in 1993 each had a total 
investment 
exceeding 10 million U.S. dollars, 66 percent more than the 
average in 1992. 
  The investors are from 41 countries and regions. The 
investment from Taiwan, the ROK, Singapore, and the United 
States increased by 166 percent, 167 percent, 597 percent and 13 
percent, respectively. 
  By the end of 1993 Qingdao had approved 2,420 foreign-funded 
enterprises with total contracted capital of 3.32 billion 
dollars, and the actual use of foreign funds was 790 million 
U.S. dollars. 
  Last year 581 foreign-funded firms went into operation in 
Qingdao, bringing the total to 847. They made a total export 
volume of 460 million U.S. dollars-worth and made profits of 210 
million yuan (about 25 million U.S. dollars). 
  In the field of technical co-operation Qingdao signed 112 
contracts with other countries on construction projects and 
labor service. The contracted volume was 49.745 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  The city now has 1,878 workers working abroad. It has 
invested 3.218 million U.S. dollars to set up 13 firms overseas. 
  A total of 120 contracts on importing technologies and 
equipment were signed last year with a contracted value of 
72.934 million U.S. dollars. 
  Last year the city received 7,072 foreign business people, 
and send 1,336 trade and economic groups abroad.

  [Text] The provincial party committee and government held 
their eighth on-the-spot work conference at the township 
enterprise bureau on the morning of 2 March. Jiang Chunyun, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, emphasized at the 
conference the need to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, 
face up to challenges, maintain the good development trend of 
township enterprises, concentrate efforts to upgrade their 
quality and level to a new height, and make township 
enterprises, a new force, come to the fore for the second time. 
  Attending the conference were Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee and provincial governor; Li 
Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and 
provincial vice governor; Chen Jianguo, standing committee 
member of the provincial party committee and provincial vice 
governor; and responsible persons of pertinent provincial 
departments. 
  Shandong's township enterprises continued to maintain the 
trend of robust development and created 482.5 billion yuan in 
output value last year. The industrial output value they 
created was 359.3 billion yuan, accounting for more than 60 
percent of Shandong's total. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Shandong's township enterprises 
registered the fastest and best development rate last year. 
Compared with advanced provinces and municipalities, however, 
we still lag rather far behind in many aspects. We should 
remain clear-headed to note that the endeavor to accelerate 
establishment of the socialist market economy system not only 
provides a good opportunity and opens up a vast world for 
township enterprise development but also brings new challenges. 
All localities should continue to regard township enterprise 
development as the strategic priority of Shandong's economic 
development, add impetus to reform, and make township 
enterprises more vigorous in development. In the reform of 
township enterprises, we should greatly extend the shareholding 
system in compliance with the requirement for establishing the 
socialist market economy system; bring property right relations 
into better balance; achieve success in the merge and 
cooperation between the enterprises of different ownerships and 
trades; promote lease, merge, and auction; and do a good job in 
the organization and management of enterprise groups. In 
deepening the reform of township enterprises, we should put it 
in the most important place to emancipate the mind, seek truth 
from facts, and change ideas; embrace as soon as possible the 
new concepts and new ideas compatible with the socialist market 
economy; be brave in exploration and active in pioneering; and 
create a new advantage and new pattern of township enterprises 
by deepening reform. 
  Jiang Chunyun emphasized: We should further clarify the 
guiding thought and truly shift the work focus of township 
enterprises to the improvement of economic efficiency. We 
should pay close attention to weak links to facilitate township 
enterprises' development of the export-oriented economy and the 
tertiary industry. We should further improve the investment 
climate, attract foreign funds, and develop the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises. Geared to the world market, we 
should broaden our field of vision, make friends with others 
extensively, and bring in projects and capital from abroad. We 
should adopt preferential policies and feasible measures to 
encourage and guide more enterprises to establish plants and 
offices outside the country and outside the province in order to 
directly participate in the competition of the world and 
domestic markets.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Anyone who wants a 
job or wants to change jobs in this, China's largest economic 
center may go to a labor placement center. 
  The center consists of 379 labor service organizations 
located in different streets, towns and rural parts of the 
Shanghai area. 
  Besides recommending jobs, these organizations offer 
technical training courses, unemployment insurance and 
consultancy services. 
  By the end of last year Shanghai had 400,000 contract 
workers, accounting for 12 percent of the total employees in the 
city. Last year the departments concerned in Shanghai granted 
unemployment benefits and medical allowances totalling 77.25 
million yuan to 831,000 people. 
  The city set up its first job-recommendation office in 1991. 
By the end of last year it had 20 official centers of this kind. 
  The past two years have seen these offices receive requests 
from more than 2,000 enterprises and organizations, which wanted 
to employ qualified people, and 120,000 people who wanted to 
find jobs. Some 30,000, or 25 percent, of the job seekers have 
found satisfactory jobs. 
  A survey shows that Shanghai's labor departments have set up 
19 job-training centers involved in industry and the service 
trades. So far more than 110,000 people have been trained. 
  At present, there are 15,000 job-recommendation stations 
across the country.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 3 (XINHUA) -- Zhejiang Province, 
which took the lead in setting up commodity markets in China, is 
promoting its markets for the means of production. 
  A survey shows that the province has about 1,000 markets 
specializing in labor service, information, technology and real 
estate. 
  By the end of last year, Zhejiang had established more than 
4,000 commodity markets with annual transactions amounting to 
65.1 billion yuan. 
  One example is a labor market consisting of 71 exchange 
centers and over 500 employment offices. It has helped more 
than 700,000 people to find new jobs over the past year. 
  The Hangzhou Enterprise Property Rights Exchange Center, 
which opened for service two months ago, has already admitted 10 
enterprises as members. 
  With the encouragement of the provincial government, 
research 
institutions and scientists have set up more than 2,000 non- 
governmental research organizations, and 3,000 technology 
associations, in addition to eight technology markets. 
  The province concluded 150,000 contracts on technology 
transfer involving more than 700 million yuan last year.

Secretary Xie Fei and Provincial Vice Governor Lu Ruihua met in 
Guangzhou with consul generals of seven countries, specifically, 
Japan, Thailand, Australia, the United States, Malaysia, 
Vietnam, and Poland, as well as their respective entourages. 
  During the meeting, Secretary Xie Fei primarily briefed his 
guests on Guangdong's plan for expanding opening up in 1994. He 
said: One of the important tasks facing Guangdong Province in 
1994 is to continually expand opening up to the outside world.

in foreign funds, accounting for one third of the total amount 
of foreign funds absorbed by the province over the past decade 
or so ever since reform and opening up. 
  Secretary Xie Fei stated: In the years ahead, Guangdong will 
try to annually absorb at least $10 billion in foreign funds and 
will strive to create favorable conditions as well as a 
favorable environment for foreign investors. Secretary Xie Fei 
concluded: Guangdong represents a huge investment market. I 
sincerely hope that all consul generals who are present here 
today will contribute more to our bilateral economic cooperation 
in 1994.

  [Text] Hong Kong people visiting Shenzhen this weekend 
may be forced to scramble for taxis as a strike by drivers looks 
set to continue. Ninety percent of the 10,001 taxis are said to 
be involved in the three-day strike, which was organised by a 
loosely- formed "union' and started yesterday. 
  Drivers are protesting against the Government's recent 
approval of an extra 2,000 taxi licences, a move bound to 
intensify competition. The drivers are also outraged that 
Public Security Bureau and People's Liberation Army officials 
often use threats to get free rides. 
  The strike went on quietly without any protests although 
public security officers were on standby. Many drivers said 
they were "just having days off". Violence was reported on the 
outskirts of the city, where the windscreens of strike-breakers 
were damaged. 
  Nine trucks were deployed outside the Shenzhen Government 
building early yesterday morning to tow away any taxis trying to 
take part in a blockade. 
  Traffic in Shenzhen was unusually smooth although passengers 
had to wait slightly longer for taxis at the railway station. 
  "Even longer waiting time is expected on Saturday when more 
Hong Kong people visit Shenzhen. Hong Kong people account for 
about 50 per cent of our business," a striker said. Some 
drivers said 90 percent of the ranks supported the strike. But 
some taxi companies contacted denied any involvement. The 
Government appealed to drivers not to take part in the strike 
through radio broadcasts while some state-run companies 
threatened to sack strikers. 
  The strike went ahead although Shenzhen Vice-Mayor, Zhu 
Yuening, had held a meeting with representatives of the drivers 
on Wednesday to discuss how to improve the operation of the 
industry. A taxi driver who worked yester day said he had not 
heard reports of violence against strike-breakers. "But, of 
course, I am afraid. They can smash your car windows by throwing 
stones while you are driving. Had it not been for my debts, I 
would have supported the strike." He said he was also "ordered" 
to do business by his taxi company. 
  One striker said: "Our business is made more difficult by 
the 
fact that some Public Security Bureau officers and soldiers 
often ask for a free ride. If we object, they will use force. 
  The strikers are expected to lose about $1,000 business for 
taking part in the strike. But they said it was worthwhile as 
they wanted to vent their dissatisfaction.

with close relations with Hainan Province. In Hawaii, the two 
sides discussed ways and means of expanding bilateral economic 
cooperation in the future. We also briefed the U.S. side on 
Hainan's latest developments, gave an account of those projects 
still awaiting foreign investment in Hainan, and expressed the 
hope that U.S. entrepreneurs and businessmen will come and 
invest in Hainan, thereby further expanding bilateral 
cooperation. The visit was a fruitful one during which the U.S. 
side expressed great interest in and is quite optimistic about 
Hainan's development.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Wang Man-na (3769 2581 1226): "Hainan </F>
Will Not Collect Value-Added Tax for the Time Being"] 
  [Text] An official from Hainan Province disclosed to this 
newspaper that because Hainan takes tourism as a leading form of 
trade and aims at developing relevant tertiary industry, it will 
not consider collecting value-added tax [VAT] on the real estate 
developed by foreign investors this year. At the same time, its 
preferential policy of reducing and remitting taxes on other 
trades in which foreign investors are engaged will remain 
unchanged in the future. 
  According to this official, owing to the rich natural 
resources for tourism in Hainan, the province has taken tourism 
as a leading form of trade to bring along the development of 
tertiary industry in the past few years. The development of 
real estate is a prerequisite for boosting tourism, so when 
examining and approving real estate investment projects, the 
province did not include office buildings, auditoriums, hotels, 
and guest houses as a category in which construction is 
restricted. Instead, it regarded them as means of production in 
the hope that the development of real estate will contribute to 
boosting tourism. Since the exercise of macroeconomic 
regulation and control last year, the central authorities have 
withdrawn many landlocked provinces' funds for real estate 
investment in Hainan, investigated the excessively large scope 
of investment, and imposed sanctions on Hainan by banning 
domestic remittances for any investment project in the province. 
So far, such economic sanctions have not been lifted, but 
trade-related remittances have been relaxed only recently. 
Superficially, the central authorities forbid mainland banks to 
lend money to coastal areas, but in fact the economic sanction 
is applied only against Hainan. Moreover, the central 
authorities openly criticized Hainan by name for its excessively 
large scope of investment. The Hainan official believes that 
Hainan, being the youngest province in the country, has no 
backing among the central authorities, who therefore dare to 
bully only Hainan, but are afraid of offending other major 
provinces or cities. 
  As Hainan is the largest economic region in China, the 
central authorities have provided it with many preferential 
policies and vested in it the power to examine and approve 
projects. Since 1 January this year, the separation of 
financial and taxation departments and the collection of the VAT 
on land have come into effect throughout the country. However, 
in light of the hint given by the central authorities that 
taxation policy in Hainan will not be changed, the province has 
no intention of levying the VAT on any real estate developed by 
foreign investors, as this practice will adversely affect the 
national economic development of Hainan. The provincial 
government hopes that the property market in Hainan will boom. 
At present, a large number of real estate projects have had to 
be laid aside owing to the withdrawal of funds last year. The 
official added: At this crucial juncture, the province will not 
recall the land, but will let the original investors keep it so 
that they can develop it when "spring" comes. 
  This official continued: The Hainan Special Economic Region 
had very remarkable advantages in the past, but as the central 
authorities also practice preferential policies in the 
landlocked areas, such advantages have weakened accordingly. 
The greatest advantage of the province now is that the market 
economy system was being practiced there five years earlier than 
in other provinces in the country, so its basic framework has 
taken shape. In addition, the provincial government is bold in 
action and ready to take responsibility. It always has the 
interests of enterprises and investors in mind. In order to 
reflect the strong points of the special economic region, the 
provincial government has decided to continue practicing the 
preferential policy of reducing or remitting taxes on 
foreign-invested enterprises. In the meantime, the government 
will allow the existence of second- and third-hand property 
markets. 
  It has been learned that last year, Zhu Rongji intended to 
investigate and affix the local government's responsibility for 
the excessively large scope of investment in Hainan because the 
province originally planned to invest 10 billion yuan in 
infrastructural construction, though actual investment came to 
17.5 billion yuan. Although the province has invested 21.7 
billion yuan in capital construction over the past five years, 
infrastructure facilities in the province have been improved 
greatly. Therefore, when Zhu Rongji understood this, he praised 
the rapid development of Hainan instead of criticizing it. The 
province plans to invest another 20 billion yuan this year to 
improve the investment environment.

to concentrate on the following three work aspects: 1) To step 
up local legislative work by focusing on economic legislation 
with an eye on building a socialist market economic structure; 
2) to strengthen supervision over law enforcement and government 
work; 3) to build more competent people's congress organs and 
raise people's congress work to a new level. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin maintained that in order to strengthen 
supervision over law enforcement and government work, it is all 
the more necessary to perfect the existing supervision 
mechanism, clearly define key areas for supervision, and 
intensify supervision work at all levels. Moreover, it is also 
necessary to strengthen and improve CPC leadership over people's 
congress work.

Government's State Security Department: Further Study and 
Publicize the `State Security Law' -- Commemorating the First 
Anniversary of the Promulgation of the 'State Security Law' for 
Implementation"] 
  [Text] The "State Security Law of the People's Republic of 
China" was promulgated for implementation by Decree 68 of the 
president of the People's Republic of China after it was adopted 
by the 30th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh 
National People's Congress. The first specialized law to 
safeguard state security since the founding of the People's 
Republic of China, it provides a strong legal guarantee and a 
powerful weapon in the struggle to effectively prevent and check 
acts which harm state security, to safeguard state security, to 
defend the political power of the people's democratic 
dictatorship and the socialist system, and to defend and promote 
reform, opening to the outside world, and the socialist 
modernization drive. The law marks an important point in the 
bid to develop socialist democracy and improve the Chinese legal 
system, especially the state security legal system. 
  In the year since the law was promulgated for 
implementation, 
state security organs in Tibet, under the leadership of party 
committees, people's congresses, and governments at all levels, 
and supported and coordinated by procuratorial and judicial 
departments, press units, and other departments dealing with 
foreigners, have done a great deal of work in studying, 
publicizing, and implementing the law, thus achieving some 
results. First, attention has been given to organizing study of 
the law and adherence to it by state security police. In 
accordance with the plan drawn up by the State Security 
Department Party Committee, all police officers, on the basis of 
studying, discussing, and memorizing the legal provisions 
themselves, have sponsored classes over five terms to teach the 
"State Security Law." This law has also been incorporated with 
other training courses as part of the compulsory curriculum. 
Fairly good results have been obtained from providing 
rotational training for 90 percent of police officers in Tibet, 
and from providing memorization tests for police officers of 
departmental organs and prefectural and municipal state security 
departments and bureaus. Second, we have seized the opportunity 
to publicize and educate cadres of party and government organs, 
foreign affairs departments, and various enterprises and 
establishments about the "State Security Law." Over the past 
year, state security organs in Tibet have distributed more than 
2,000 wall charts and more than 20,000 booklets on the law -- 
some printed in both the Tibetan and Chinese languages -- to 
various units, departments, prefectures, cities, counties, 
townships, and villages. Meanwhile, departmental leaders and 
leading comrades and law officers at all prefectural and 
municipal state security organs have sponsored more than 10 
lectures on the law for more than 2,000 leading cadres and 
professionals working at various foreign affairs units and in 
prefectural, municipal, and county organs. Third, the 
initiative has been taken to get the support and coordination of 
press units, and public opinion has been exploited in vigorously 
publicizing the "State Security Law." The regional state 
security department, various areas, and city state security 
organs have universally used propaganda tools such as radios, 
televisions, and newspapers to publicize the law. City leaders 
have been invited to make televised speeches and answer 
questions by reporters. Television stations have broadcast 
serial dramas; articles have been published in local newspapers. 
The autonomous regional state security department has published 
more than 10 articles in XIZANG RIBAO and XIZANG FAZHI BAO, each 
of which has publicized the "State Security Law." XIZANG RIBAO 
has also achieved good results through sponsorship of a 
competition on knowledge of the law. Fourth, enforce the law 
with specific targets in mind and intensify propaganda and 
education among specific individuals and units. A few leaders 
or functionaries at some units handling external relations have, 
instead of providing support and assistance to state security 
work, gone so far as to create obstructions. State security 
organs have educated them on the provisions of the state 
security law and these efforts produced immediate results. 
  After a year of study, publicity, and implementation of the 
"State Security Law," law-enforcement skills among state 
security cadres and police has improved to some extent. 
Awareness of state security has increased among leaders at all 
levels, among cadres and workers of relevant departments, and 
among the general population throughout the region. Many people 
believe that implementation of the "State Security Law" is not 
merely a matter of state security; rather, it involves every 
citizen and organization -- "everyone is responsible for the 
security of the state." Some units have taken the initiative in 
providing support and coordination for law enforcement by state 
security departments. We must, however, be soberly aware that 
dissemination of the "State Security Law" has not been carried 
out evenly throughout the region. In areas that have not 
established state security organs, dissemination has been 
carried out on only a very limited scale. In particular, many 
cadres and people in rural and frontier regions have never heard 
of the "State Security Law" or have only just begun to 
understand its provisions. State security organs need to 
upgrade their law- enforcement skills and cadres and police in 
such organs need to enhance their awareness of their exercise of 
powers according to law. Supplementary rules and regulations 
for the implementation of the "State Security Law" need to be 
formulated or amplified. A handful of units and individuals 
have continued to disregard provisions of the "State Security 
Law." Lacking awareness of state security, they refuse to 
provide support or cooperation for state security work and go so 
far as to obstruct functionaries of state security organs from 
executing their official duties. Some refuse to provide 
information and some do not cooperate with state security organs 
in investigations, thereby severely impeding state security 
work. All these problems need to be solved with further efforts 
to study, publicize, and implement the "State Security Law." 
  The current international situation has provided our region 
with a favorable opportunity to promote reform, opening up, and 
the modernization drive. Blessed with economic growth, 
political stability, national unity, and social progress, Tibet 
is a scene of dynamism. We must, however, also be soberly aware 
that, in spite of this excellent situation, peace does not reign 
throughout the world. Some hostile forces outside have never 
ceased activities which jeopardize China's state security. They 
seek to obtain China's political, economic, scientific, and 
military secrets and they are trying to carry out infiltration, 
splittist activities, and sabotage one way or another. A 
handful of extremely anti-socialist elements at home have joined 
with hostile forces from outside to intensify their efforts to 
sabotage the security and interests of the state. Because China 
has been at peace for so long, many are not vigilant about these 
sabotage efforts that jeopardize state security. Some even turn 
a blind eye -- or confuse right with wrong -- when it comes to 
sabotage activities carried out by spy agencies and hostile 
forces from outside, as well as splittist forces inside and 
outside the national boundaries. A handful of people, recruited 
by hostile forces from outside, are engaged in criminal 
activities to disrupt state security. In order to create a 
stable environment for reform, opening up, and economic 
construction; to advance state security work in such a way that 
it is subject to, and serves more effectively, the party's basic 
line and gives full play to its function as part of the people's 
democratic dictatorship on the covert front; and in the face of 
this acute, complex, and grim struggle, we must make the "State 
Security Law" an essential part of the second "five-year plan," 
disseminating knowledge of the law and conducting a region-wide 
study, dissemination, and implementation of the "State Security 
Law" in a thorough and sustained manner. 
  Formulating the "State Security Law" was a formidable 
undertaking; studying, disseminating, and implementing it will 
prove to be more challenging. A precondition for strict 
enforcement of the "State Security Law" law is that it be 
studied and mastered. This is a mandatory task for specialized 
organs at all levels; it is also something every citizen and 
organization should do. State security organs, party and 
government departments at all levels, mass organizations, 
enterprises and establishments in the region must educate and 
guide the vast ranks of cadres to study the "State Security Law" 
so that they clearly understand what sort of criminal act 
jeopardizes state security; they know a citizen's duty and right 
to safeguard state security; they keep firmly in mind the idea 
that "everyone is responsible for the security of the state"; 
they learn how to utilize the law as a weapon in fighting 
criminal activity that jeopardizes state security; and they 
conscientiously safeguard the safety, honor, and interests of 
the motherland. State security organs must strictly abide by 
the law in their law-enforcement activity. They should protect 
the citizens or organizations that have offered support and 
assistance to state security work; commend and reward those who 
have made major contributions; investigate to determine the 
culpability of those who have refused to fulfill their duty or 
obstructed state security work; and crack down hard on criminal 
activity that harms the security and interests of the state so 
that they efficiently ensure that the building of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics progresses smoothly in our region.

<F P=106> ["Gyaincain Norbu's Speech at A Get-Together for 1994 Spring </F>
Festival and Tibetan New Year on 7 February 1994"] 
  [Text] Comrades and Friends: 
  Today, we gather together to greet the advent of the 1994 
Spring Festival and the Tibetan Year of the Dog. On behalf of 
the regional party committee, people's congress standing 
committee, people's government, and committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, I extend my 
heartfelt regards and holiday greetings to the peasants, 
herdsmen, workers, intellectuals, and comrades of all 
nationalities across Tibet; PLA commanders and fighters 
stationed in Tibet; officers and men as well as political and 
law officers of Tibet People's Armed Police Corps; patriots from 
of all nationalities and circles; and all of you here! 
Meanwhile, I would like to express my warm greetings to Tibetan 
people outside Tibet and my heartfelt gratitude and best wishes 
to people at home and abroad who have shown their concern, 
support, and offered assistance in Tibet's socialist 
modernization drive! 
  Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line in 1993, Tibet earnestly followed the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC Congress and the fourth enlarged plenary session of 
the fourth regional party committee and always made economic 
construction its central task to launch a profound 
antiseparatist struggle and the work for a stable situation. 
Tibet closely adhered to the goal of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure and seized the opportunity to deepen 
reform and open wider to the outside world. With a united 
struggle and the unremitting efforts of the party, government, 
army, police, people, all nationalities, and all walks of life 
in the region, Tibet has further developed the economy, 
stablized its social situation, unified all nationalities, and 
made new progress in various social undertakings. Tibet's 
economy has particularly displayed a momentum for sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development: Tibet achieved 3.65 billion 
yuan in total output value of goods and services, up 8.1 percent 
over the previous year in terms of comparable prices; this 
includes 1.77 billion yuan achieved by primary industry, up 4.9 
percent; 530 million yuan by secondary industry, up 16.6 
percent; and 1.35 billion yuan by tertiary industry, up 9.5 
percent. Tibet saw its sixth bumper harvest in agriculture and 
steady economic growth in agricultural and pastoral areas, with 
per capita net income of 515 yuan for peasants and herdsmen. 
Industrial and transport enterprises improved their efficiency 
and basically achieved simultaneous growth in production, sales, 
and economic returns. Tibet's foreign trade thrived and tourism 
maintained good momentun for development -- a substantial step 
forward in opening up. The construction of infrastructure, 
focusing on energy resources, transportation, and 
telecommunications, proceeded smoothly. Localities improved 
their economic strengthen and collected 149 million yuan in 
revenue. Urban and rural markets were brisk, commodity prices 
were basically stable, and people continued to improve their 
living standards. New progress was also made in science, 
technology, education, culture, public health, sports, and other 
social undertakings. All of these encourages us to march 
forward in the new year with full confidence. 
  The year 1994 is a crucial year for Tibet to continue the 
establishment of a socialist market economy as well as an 
important year to maintain good momentum for economic 
development. This year, Tibet should make reform, development, 
and stability its main theme in various kinds of work and 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the fifth enlarged 
plenary session of the 4th regional party committee, and the 
regional economic work conference. Tibet should firmly adhere 
to the central work of economic construction and strive to 
advance the establishment of a socialist market economy, the 
work of stabilizing the situation, and the construction of 
socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Reform is the driving force of economic development. In 
reforming Tibet's economic system, we should adhere to the 
criterion of whether it will develop productive forces, seize 
the opportune time, promote reform as a whole, stress the main 
points, and keep our reform framework and structure in line with 
those of the state. Taking Tibet's actual situation into 
consideration, we should be firm in action, flexible in 
policies, and stable in process. This year, Tibet's reform is 
arduous because it requires greater efforts, wider range, and 
better quality. Therefore, we must adhere to investigation and 
study, extensively solicit opinions, and seek perfection through 
scientific ways in making reform policies and make sure that we 
have well-conceived plans, meticulous organization, and earnest 
practice. Reform measures involving the immediate interests of 
the people must go through assessment, coordination, 
experimentation, and other effective ways. Reform will surely 
touch or break old systems, economic relations, and the 
structure of interests, and will produce new contradictions, 
problems, and difficulties. Party committees and people's 
governments at various levels should work diligently and 
initiate and implement various important reform measures in a 
down-to-earth manner on the one hand; people of all 
nationalities and circles should, one the other hand, attach 
importance to the overall situation, take overall and long-term 
interests into consideration, consciously support and engage in 
the cause of reform, and make sure that Tibet will make 
breakthrough progress in various reforms this year through the 
concerted efforts of all sectors and all walks of life across 
the region. 
  Development is the last word. It is the common aspiration of 
all nationalities as well as our central work for maintaining 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and developin 
Tibet's economy as soon as possible. Therefore, we should 
continue to broaden our minds for economic development, 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
make greater efforts to restructure the economy, and achieve the 
integration of rapid development and higher economic efficiency. 
This year's economic work should center on increasing the 
income of peasants and herdsmen and vigorously developing the 
economy in the agricultural and pastoral areas, while stepping 
up the pace of reform; increase enterprises' economic returns as 
a whole with the focus on further changing state enterprises' 
operating mechanisms; actively create new factors for economic 
growth under the guidance of industrial policies; and continue 
to implement the strategy of revitalizing Tibet with science and 
education with a view to improving labor quality and the level 
of productive forces. We should concentrate our efforts on 
economic development and make sure that Tibet's economy grows at 
a rate of 8 percent this year. 
  The maintenance of social stability is the prerequisite for 
smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic development. 
We must bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's dictum that 
"stability is of overriding importance;" correctly understand 
and handle the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability; and correctly understand and handle contradictions of 
the two different natures. Splittist activities are the major 
factor undermining Tibet's social and political situation; and 
they pose the gravest obstacle to the region's reform and 
development. Therefore, we must always adhere to the principle 
of grasping two links at the same time, resolutely cracking 
down, according to the law, on hostile elements who try to split 
the motherland and stir up trouble to the detriment of 
stability, while continuing to strike swiftly and severely in 
accordance with the law, at serious criminal offenders and 
economic criminals who disrupt and interfere with reform, 
development, and social stability. Meanwhile, under the 
circumstances of expediting reform and opening up and of 
changing to the new system from the old, and in the process of 
establishing a socialist market economy, there will certainly be 
changes cropping up in social contradictions and new features in 
the contradictions among the people. We must pay strict 
attention to contradictions among the people in the new era, and 
familiarize ourselves with the policy, strategy, and correct 
methods for handling contradictions among them. Leading cadres 
at all levels should set a good example in intensifying 
investigation and study, improving work style, putting the 
interests of the people above anything else, and overcoming 
bureaucratism, formalism, and other unhealthy practices. They 
should go down to the grass roots, mingle with the masses, and 
work on the frontline of production to solve problems on the 
spot. They should visit problem spots to understand public 
feelings, localities with newly emerging things and changes to 
sum up experiences, and backward areas to open up a new 
situation in work. In a nutshell, they should deliver the kind 
concern of the party and the government to every household. At 
present, particular attention must be paid to helping 
poverty-stricken peasants and herdsmen, workers of 
deficit-ridden enterprises, retirees, and various categories of 
recipients of government aid solve practical problems and do 
everything possible to provide arrangements for their production 
and everyday life. Only by so doing will the people support the 
policies of the party and the government even more, give us 
greater trust, and take the initiative to help and coordinate 
with us in handling various social contradictions and problems 
and will they join us in consolidating and developing the 
excellent situation characterized by stability and unity in 
Tibet. 
  Comrades, friends: Accelerating reform, promoting reform, 
and ensuring stability are the three major tasks of Tibet's work 
in 1994, whose accomplishment is dependent upon joint struggle 
by all party, government, army, and armed police organizations 
and the people of all nationalities and in all circles 
throughout the region. We must rally more closely around the 
party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleur, 
grasp the overall situation in the light of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, seize the historic opportunity, heighten our spirit, 
and advance courageously in unity to greet the 30th anniversary 
of the establishment of the autonomous region with outstanding 
achievements. 
  In conclusion, once again may all of you as well as the 
people of all nationalities and in all circles across Tibet have 
a happy new year!

  [Excerpts] The capital's army and government forum for the 
Spring Festival was held at the Great Hall of the People on the 
afternoon of 7 February. Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
municipal party committee, and Yu Yongbo, member of the Central 
Military Commission and director of the General Political 
Department, extended festive greetings to each other on behalf 
of the municipal party committee, people's congress standing 
committee, government, committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, and the people throughout 
Beijing and on behalf of the Central Military Commission, the 
three general departments, and the officers and men of the army 
units stationed in Beijing. Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing; Du 
Tiehuan, deputy director of the General Political Department; 
and Yang Yanyin, vice minister of civil affairs; spoke at the 
forum, which was permeated with a warm atmosphere characterized 
by the unity between the army and the government and between 
armymen and civilians. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong said in his speech that it was significant to 
have invited leaders from the army and the Ministry of Civil 
Affairs to the forum to hear reports on army-civilian 
cooperation in building civilized units and the double-support 
work. He said: Beijing's development cannot be separated from 
that of the Liberation Army. Either in smooth periods or in grim 
periods, from the liberation of Peking to economic construction, 
peace, and stability, we have maintained close unity and 
concerted efforts with the Liberation Army and the Armed Police 
Forces. Only with the Liberation Army can we develop reform and 
construction in a peaceful and stable environment. The People's 
Liberation Army has provided great support to all the work of 
Beijing, and it is Beijing which has benefited most from the 
double-support work and the army-civilian cooperation in 
building civilized units. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tianjin, March 1 (XINHUA) -- More than a dozen local 
laws and regulations concerning economic and other related 
issues were passed last year by the local legislative body in 
north China's Tianjin City, an industrial center and a major 
open port. 
  Statistics show that in the latter half of last year, five 
sets of local regulations governing the operation of the Tianjin 
Port Free Trade Zone were established and promulgated. 
  Officials said the new regulations are expected to give an 
impetus to the growth of overseas investment. 
  Other local laws and regulations include the Tianjin 
Commodity Market regulations, the Tianjin Technical Market 
regulations, the social security regulations and the management 
law governing religious sites in Tianjin City. 
  Legislative officials said it still remained a hard task for 
them to make laws and regulations urgently needed by a growing 
socialist market economy. 
  "They were so urgently needed that we cannot wait and must 
redouble our efforts to do our job well," said an official with 
the Standing Committee of the Tianjin Municipal People's 
Congress. 
  With support from the municipal government, they have 
investigated current conditions and consulted with many 
departments concerned. They also listened to opinions of 
different parties and experts before the laws and regulations 
were passed.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yongchen (3769 3057 2525): "Hebei </F>
Government Offices Stationed Outside Make Contributions to 
Building Strong Province"] 
  [Excerpt] The three-day conference on the work of the 
provincial government offices stationed outside the province 
concluded in Shijiazhuang on 2 February. 
  The provincial government offices stationed outside the 
province made indelible contributions in 1993 to Hebei's success 
in accelerating the opening to the localities at home and abroad 
and maintaining rapid development in economic construction. 
Focusing on the requirements put forward by provincial leaders, 
they made use of their special positions and advantages, 
actively conducted explorations, pioneered the way forward, and 
notably changed and improved the work to bring in investment 
from outside the province and establish ties with foreign 
countries, develop economic and technological cooperation, 
provide information, increase income, receive guests and provide 
service, exercise management, and strengthen basic construction. 
They created an income of 26.68 million yuan in the whole year 
and realized a profit of 10.66 million yuan, a net increase of 
48 percent from 1992. Meanwhile, the offices served as liaison 
offices for 360 projects of the province, signed 86 letters of 
intent, officially signed 185 contracts, planned to bring in 
$380 million from abroad, and provided information on 1,422 
occasions, thus making contributions to the endeavor of building 
an economically strong province. 
  During the conference, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, and Ye Liansong, provincial 
governor, attended to meet with all the delegates. Cheng Weigao 
commended several offices that had won notable achievements and 
clearly urged the participants to particularly do a good job in 
bringing in investment from abroad and establishing lateral ties 
at home, in management, and in service and to make still greater 
contributions to Hebei's economic development and opening to the 
outside world in the new year. [passage omitted]

reporter Li Sujia (2621 1859 0163): "Make Unremitting Efforts To 
Guard Against and Deal Blows to Illegal Transit Activities"] 
  [Text] The provincial work conference on dealing blows to 
illegal transit of textile products, which ended a few days ago, 
revealed that the activities of illegal transit of textile 
products has affected the trade relations between China and the 
countries importing textile products and harmed China's economic 
interests and reported that these activities must be strictly 
banned. Although Hebei Province has not discovered cases of 
illegal transit of textile products so far, we must not lower 
our guard. We must regard dealing blows to illegal transit 
activities as a regular task and grasp it with unremitting 
efforts. 
  The illegal transit of textile products means the act of 
indicating the third country or region as the producing place on 
the tags, brands, and packages of the export textile products. 
This is an act of violating the bilateral textile product 
trading agreement signed with other countries. The conference 
called on all levels and all kinds of foreign trade companies 
and enterprises enjoying the delegation of powers to pay great 
attention to this, strictly check on the signing of contracts 
with foreign countries, the arrangement for production, and the 
delivery of products to other countries in an effort not to give 
unlawful elements an opportunity. 
  The conference affirmed the achievements and experience of 
Hebei Province's economic and trade management departments, 
commodity inspection departments, and customhouse in 
strengthening cooperation, performing their own duties, and 
dealing blows to the illegal transit of textile products and 
worked out plans for this year's work.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Zhedong (1727 0772 2767) and </F>
correspondent Cao Haiqing (2580 3189 3237): "Seize the 
Opportunity, Deepen Reform, Promote Production, and Safeguard 
Unity"] 
  [Excerpt] The regional industrial economic work conference 
opened in Hohhot on 31 January. Regional leaders Wang Qun, Qian 
Fenyong, and Shen Shuji spoke at the conference. Liu Zuohui, 
Liu Zhen, Chen Youzun, and Xu Bonian attended the conference. 
Wang Qun stressed in his speech that the reform should be 
oriented to seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, promoting 
production, safeguarding unity, and effecting the large-scale 
reform, large- scale development, and large-scale advancement of 
the economy. 
  In his speech, Wang Qun fully affirmed the region's 
achievements in the 1993 economic work and stressed the 
necessity of pushing the 1994 economic work onto a new stage and 
a new level. Wang Qun said: This year is critical to 
establishing the socialist market economic structure. The major 
sign of embarking on a new stage and a new level is for the 
economic structure to keep pace with the process of shifting to 
the socialist market economy where efficiency is the central and 
fundamental issue, and the region can effect an obvious 
improvement in labor productivity and make even greater 
contributions to the financial revenues of the state. Only 
after embarking on this new level can we gain initiative. 
  He said: The central authorities have recently raised the 
guiding principle of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
promoting production, and safeguarding unity." By opportunity, 
we mean the current situation. When viewed as a whole, the 
current situation is favorable to our large-scale development, 
large-scale reform, and large-scale advancement. Currently, the 
world and domestic situation as well as the domestic and world 
markets are very conducive to us. In particular, the third 
plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the eighth 
(enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party committee 
have introduced one after another some policies and regulations 
that facilitate large-scale development, thus providing economic 
development with an excellent opportunity and favorable 
environment. In addition, the region's reform and opening up 
over the past 15 years have laid a relatively solid foundation 
for economic development. We should seize this golden 
opportunity to practice and work boldly. 
  He said: After getting a clear understanding of the 
situation, we should catch sight of many difficulties. Some of 
the problems we face, such as fund shortage, financial 
difficulties, and deficits incurred by some enterprises, small 
and medium-sized enterprises in particular, are the problems 
with regard to reform that will surely emerge in our way of 
advance. Therefore, we should not get confused by these 
problems, but should enhance our morale and deepen reform. Only 
by carrying out reform can we find the way out. Without 
advancement, we will lag behind. And, refusing to carry out 
reform, will only lead to to a road of ruin. 
  With regard to deepening reform, Wang Qun pointed out: In 
carrying out reform, we should not seek outside performance, nor 
should we engage in formalism. In reform, we should exert real 
efforts. To carry out reform, we should also conduct renovation 
and positively press forward technological progress. We should 
also resolve the problems regarding work bodies, product 
quality, and development. When shifting the structure, we 
should lay emphasis on key projects, large enterprises, and 
items producing good results. We should take the shareholding 
system as the major orientation in conducting enterprise reform, 
and adopt the methods of closing down, suspending operations, 
amalgamating with others, and transfer to other units in order 
to eliminate small, poverty-stricken, and money-losing 
enterprises. We should establish the enterprise operating 
mechanism that is suitable for the socialist market economy with 
a view to improving the economic efficiency of enterprises. We 
should attend to the following five aspects in line with the 
central authorities' principles of pressing forward overall 
reform, making breakthroughs in major aspects, using exemplary 
cases to guide the road, and accelerating the pace: 1. 
Establish and perfect the rural collectivized service system so 
that economic patterns where industry, agriculture, and animal 
husbandry serve foreign trade emerge; 2. Accelerate the 
transformation of mechanisms among industrial enterprises and 
make great efforts to basically complete the transformation of 
mechanisms among small and medium-sized enterprises by the end 
of this year; 3. Achieve success in commercial, grain, trade, 
and circulation reforms to promote economic development; 4. 
Achieve success in financial, taxation, pricing, and banking 
reforms and support the development of enterprises in line with 
the practical situation, state regulations, and the principles 
of "facilitating the development of socialist productive forces, 
the enhancement of comprehensive strength of the socialist 
countries, and the improvement of the people's living 
standards;" 5. Accelerate transformation of government 
functions and support reform of organizations and assign young 
and capable cadres to the first line of economic development and 
to industrial, commercial, tax affairs, and security and law 
departments in an effort to ensure the smooth progress of 
economic reform and development. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinyan (1728 3866 3601): "Further </F>
Increase Dynamics of Reform and Promote Rapid Economic 
Development in Inner Mongolia"] 
  [Text] The autonomous regional party committee held an 
enlarged standing committee meeting on the afternoon of 31 
January. Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee, who had just completed investigation and study tours 
in Hulun Buir, Hinggan, and Jirem Leagues, gave a report on his 
investigation and study activities to the responsible comrades 
of the autonomous regional party committee, people's congress, 
government, committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and pertinent departments, and 
gave opinions on the next step of efforts to deepen reform and 
accelerate development. In view of the reality in Inner 
Mongolia's reform and development, Comrade Wang Qun emphasized 
that all localities and departments should further emancipate 
the mind, seize the opportunity to increase dynamics of reform, 
and promote development through reform to realize a big leap in 
our economic construction in the new year. 
  Comrade Wang Qun summarized his impression gained after the 
investigation as an excellent situation, but heavy tasks on a 
long journey. He pointed out: This year will be a crucial year 
for Inner Mongolia's reform and development. Guided by Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, we should 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th national 
party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee, accelerate establishment of the socialist 
market economy system, and correctly handle the relationship 
between reform and development on the one hand and unity and 
stability on the other. He said: No work can be placed on a 
par with reform and development. Leaders at all levels should 
enhance the sense of reform and fully understand that only 
through reform can we have a way out. He pointed out: In Inner 
Mongolia's reform this year, new breakthroughs should be made 1) 
in deepening rural and pastoral reform, with the focus on 
establishing and improving rural and pastoral socialized overall 
service systems; 2) in the reform of industrial, commercial, 
grain, and foreign trade enterprises; 3) in the reform of 
financial and tax systems; 4) in the reform of banking, 
investment, and price systems; and 5) in institutional reform. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: The key for state-owned large- and 
medium-sized enterprises to transform the operating mechanism 
lies in strengthening leadership. Leaders at all levels should 
raise spirit, pioneer the way forward, refrain from 
procrastination and reliance on and waiting for the assistance 
of higher levels, and pursue development in the process of 
deepening reform. If leaders fail to update their concepts and 
if the operating mechanism and functions are not changed, 
enterprises' endeavor to get rid of difficulties will be merely 
idle theorizing. Comrade Wang Qun proposed that a leading group 
composed of leaders of the autonomous regional party committee 
and government be organized to strengthen the leadership over 
the reform of industrial and commercial enterprises and 
concentrate efforts on improving efficiency. The gap between 
Inner Mongolia and advanced areas should be narrowed as soon as 
possible through reform and development. 
  Speaking on Hinggan League's establishment of a green food 
production base ahead of others, Comrade Wang Qun urged: To 
conform to the market economy system, the rural economy should 
undergo the transition from the past small-scale peasant economy 
and small-scale production economy to large-scale agriculture 
and the market economy. Based on market demands, cadres at all 
levels should provide favorable conditions for peasants and 
herdsmen to march toward the market, use market information to 
lead peasants and herdsmen to the market, and take the road of 
developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient 
agriculture and commercializing production. We should exercise 
integrated management of foreign trade, industry, and 
agriculture; make planting, breeding, and processing a 
coordinated process; adopt the farming and livestock breeding 
structure that coordinates agriculture, industry, commerce, 
technology, and foreign trade, which encourages enterprises to 
operation on as large a scale as possible and which suits market 
demands; and make use of local resources to develop the economy 
to turn advantages in resources into economic advantage. 
Leagues and cities should accelerate establishment of rural and 
pastoral socialized overall service systems, with the focus on 
towns, townships, and sumu. Township enterprises should 
diversify their structure and develop whatever conducive to 
economic development. 
  After affirming the experiences in the reform of the three 
leagues in eastern Inner Mongolia, Comrade Wang Qun emphasized: 
Leaders at all levels should combine the endeavor of 
emancipating the mind with the scientific approach of seeking 
truth from facts and make an important step this year in the 
reform designed to establish the socialist market economy 
system. Enterprise reform should help invigorate state-owned 
enterprises, and agriculture and animal husbandry, foreign 
economic relations and trade, township enterprises, and 
nonpublic sectors of the economy should be promoted. We should 
select and send younger cadres of party and government organs 
who are competent and know management to the forefront of 
production and construction to help with the work or to assume 
posts in order to promote the economic development of all 
localities. Leagues and cities should coordinate improvement of 
grass-roots units with institutional reform, transfer and divert 
the personnel of administrative units and institutions to the 
fields of production and distribution in a well-organized 
manner, and raise office work efficiency. We should further 
strengthen party leadership and persistently attend to two tasks 
simultaneously and be competent in both to create a good and 
stable environment for reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. In accelerating banking, financial, and tax 
reform and stabilizing prices, we should follow the arrangements 
of the party Central Committee and the State Council, explore 
bravely, and adopt new ideas, new measures, and new methods. We 
should intensify research of policies to counter the new 
conditions and new issues in Inner Mongolia's reform and 
development, especially the issues closely related to people's 
life. We should implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and the eighth 
(enlarged) plenary session of the fifth autonomous regional 
party committee. 
  Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the autonomous region, gave a 
report on the investigation activities. 
  Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee and chairman of the regional government, and Qian 
Fenyong, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee and chairman of the regional CPPCC committee, also 
spoke.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Bumper harvests in 
agriculture and animal husbandry in north China's Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region in 1993 have helped raise the per capita 
income of farmers and herdsmen to a record 829 yuan, up 110 yuan 
over the previous year. 
  Speaking at a working meeting on the region's development of 
agriculture and animal husbandry, Vice Chairman of the Regional 
Government Zhang Tingwu said that his region owes the 
achievement to rational development policies and increasing 
inputs of both labor and investment. 
  According to him, the region has in the past few years 
updated the household responsibility system and the contract 
system, improved its agriculture and animal husbandry structure, 
attached more importance to the role of science and technology, 
developed rural and township enterprises, nurtured a sound 
agricultural and animal husbandry market system, established a 
social service system, and reduced the burdens on farmers and 
herdsmen. 
  The vice chairman said that in the past six years his region 
has invested a total of more than 2.4 billion yuan in the 
infrastructure of the agriculture and animal husbandry sectors. 
  He said that Inner Mongolia now has an irrigated area of 
more 
than 1.5 million ha [hectares], about 30 percent of the total 
arable land. He added that more than 100 items of technology 
have been applied to agriculture and animal husbandry, yielding 
some 330 million yuan in extra value. 
  The official said that his region has built 108 production 
bases of various kinds. 
  The average grain output in the first three years of the 
eighth five-year plan period (1991-1995) was 10.38 billion kg, a 
rise of 47.2 percent over the average for the Seventh Five-Year 
Plan period (1986-1990), the official said. 
  As a result, Inner Mongolia, which traditionally imported 
grain from other parts of the country, has become one of the 
areas of China that sell surplus grain. 
  The vice chairman said the region's animal husbandry has 
substantially reduced its dependence on nature's whims, and the 
number of livestock has been maintained at around 50 million. 
  As a result, the output value of the agriculture and animal 
husbandry products-based industries now accounts for 31.74 
percent of the total industrial output value of the region.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Farmers and herdsmen in 
the Ordos Plateau of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region are enjoying better environmental conditions owing to 
effective measures to protect the land from soil erosion. 
  More than 300,000 farmers and herdsmen have made contracts 
to 
fight against soil erosion on the plateau. They have made 1,360 
sq [square] km of wasteland, half of the land contracted, green 
in the past five years. So far more than 33,330 hectares of 
farmland have been reclaimed, and trees and grass now cover more 
than 670,000 hectares of plateau lands. 
  Located on the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, 
the plateau suffers from serious soil erosion. Most of the 
muddy silt which gives the Yellow River its name comes from the 
plateau. About 47,000 sq km of land still suffers from serious 
soil erosion. 
  But with effective measures taken to protect soil erosion in 
recent years, less soil is washed into the Yellow River. An 
annual amount of soil erodes into the river is now five times 
less than the amount in the 1950s. 
  Farmers and herdsmen on the plateau pay equal attention to 
both environmental improvement and economic efficiency while 
transforming the wasteland. They build up farmland, plant 
sallow thorns and apple trees in light of soil quality and are 
developing a farm and sideline products processing industry.

<F P=106> ["Budget speech" delivered by Hong Kong Financial Secretary </F>
Hamish Macleod to the Legislative Council in Hong Kong on 2 
March: "Budget Speech in Full"] 
  [Excerpts]Introduction 
  Mr President, 
  I move that the Appropriation Bill 1994 be read the second 
time. 
  2. [number as published] My Budget this year will once again 
reflect the solid performance of the economy and its robust 
prospects for the year ahead. 1993 was the 27th successive year 
in which the economy grew in real terms since the start of the 
GDP figures in 1966. A whole generation has grown up in our 
community which has never known anything other than unbroken 
economic expansion. It is a staggering fact that GDP per head 
has more than trebled in real terms since 1970. [passage 
omitted] 
<H3>  The Economy 
1993 Performance </H3>
  8. I turn now to our economic performance and prospects. In 
1993, Hong Kong's economy once again performed handsomely. We 
achieved a satisfactory growth rate of 5.5 percent in real 
terms. I say satisfactory because this is a good level of 
growth for an economy as mature as ours. We are not rising from 
a low economic base, as are many of our neighbours. We are now 
a service-based economy, and what we have to offer is our 
expertise, not low-wage factory labour. 
  Our role in the Asian economic miracle is to provide the 
expertise which countries in the region need in order to raise 
their own standards of living. I will have more to say about 
this later this afternoon, when I describe the remarkable 
transformation which has been achieved over the last fifteen 
years. 
  A transformation which has taken us to an advanced service 
economy based increasingly on our skills in management, design, 
marketing, finance and communications. 
  9. Let me start by giving you the basic facts of how well we 
did last year. 
  -- As I said, GDP grew by 5.5 percent in real terms, the 
fastest increase since 1988. 
  -- GDP per head in 1993 reached US$18,500. 
  -- Total exports grew by 13 percent in real terms, led by 
re- 
exports. 
  -- Exports of services grew by 8 percent in real terms. 
  -- Inflation retreated still further, to 8.5 percent for the 
year (compared with 9.4 percent in 1992). 
  -- Median household income grew in real terms by 3.8 
percent. 
  -- Unemployment remained at around 2 percent, a very low 
level by any international standard. 
  10. In producing this performance, I have no doubt that the 
business community has been looking beyond current political 
controversies to the long-term growth potential of both Hong 
Kong and China, and indeed to the promising economic outlook for 
the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. 
  This bullish attitude affects foreign investors too. For 
example, investment from around the world has continued to flow 
into our asset markets, and more foreign companies continue to 
establish their presence here in Hong Kong. 
1994 Prospects 
  11. 1993, in short, was a very good year, and we have no 
reason to be any less confident about our prospects for 1994. I 
say this because the factors which led to last year's success 
will persist, while recent developments in the world economy 
offer additional encouragement. 
  -- The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round has 
boosted 
trade potential and blunted protectionist pressure. 
  -- Prospects in our major overseas markets have improved. 
The U.S. and UK economies are set to grow by around 3 percent 
in the year ahead. 
  -- Even more important for Hong Kong, the Chinese economy 
should have little difficulty in continuing to achieve an annual 
growth of about 10 percent in real terms. 
  -- Our other neighbours in East Asia are likely to maintain 
their dynamic growth, with trade within the region expanding by 
around 15 percent in 1994. 
  12. We have entered 1994, then, in better shape than we 
might have expected. Inevitably, however, we also face some 
uncertainties. The annual battle for the renewal of China's MFN 
status in the United States will have to be fought yet again. 
Hong Kong must hope that politics is not allowed to damage this 
important trading relationship. For our part, we shall do all 
we can to emphasise to our friends in Washington the importance 
of trade between China and the United States. 
  We will go on arguing that politics should not be allowed to 
damage trade. 
  13. This is not only a matter of Hong Kong's self-interest, 
although this is clearly a key factor. And for good reason. We 
estimate that failure to renew MFN would slash Hong Kong's GDP 
growth by up to three percentage points, and employment by up to 
75,000 jobs. 
  But there are wider issues at stake too. It is trade which 
generates growth, the growth essential for economic and social 
progress. The avoidance of trade discrimination -- the 
encouragement of a level playing field and the virtues of free 
trade -- are aims which underlie the GATT. It is for this 
reason also that China's wish to rejoin the GATT is of such 
significance. 
  14. Another factor bearing on our prospects for 1994 will 
be the success of the Chinese Government in managing high rates 
of economic growth while avoiding serious overheating. The 
Chinese Government has recognised the dangers of inflation and 
has announced measures to deal with it. We must hope that these 
measures are successful. 
  15. In producing our forecasts for the coming year, while we 
have to bear in mind these downside risks, we must also give due 
weight to our underlying strengths. For 1994, I am forecasting: 
  -- GDP growth in real terms will again reach 5.5 percent, 
  -- GDP per head will reach some US$20,600, 
  -- Total trade will increase by around 17 percent in real 
terms, and 
  -- Inflation will keep to an average of around 8.5 percent. 
  16. The continuing development of the Chinese economy 
matters considerably to the whole international community. But 
to us in Hong Kong, it is increasingly the key to our future 
economic success. Through servicing and investing in China, we 
continue to find new markets for our expertise in manufacturing, 
marketing, banking, communications, tourism and professional 
services. 
  17. Already, we play a vital and increasing role in China's 
economic modernization. 
  -- China accounted for 35 percent of our total external 
trade 
in 1993. 
  -- Hong Kong accounted for around two-thirds of total 
external investment in China. In turn, China is probably the 
largest external investor in Hong Kong. 
  18. The relationship is not simply about the flows of goods 
and services. There is also an enormous flow of people. 
  -- Hong Kong residents made no less than 23 million visits 
to 
Chinese destinations in 1993. 
  -- In addition, nearly 2 million foreign visitors used Hong 
Kong as their gateway to China. 
  -- There were 7.4 million road crossings by cars and 
lorries. 
  -- Hong Kong handled 34,000 flights to and from China. 
  19. But this momentum is our trade and traffic with China 
cannot be taken for granted. It has to be nurtured. As I shall 
describe later, it is crucial that we continue to develop our 
road, rail, air and sea links with Guangdong province, and the 
rest of China. We must match the flows of people, trade and 
investment with the infrastructure to support them. [passage 
omitted] 
<H3>  Challenges Ahead 
Air and Sea Links </H3>
  48. It is vital that we forge ahead with our airport and 
port development, if Hong Kong's growth is to be sustained 
beyond 1997, and with it the growth of southern China. Latest 
indications are that both air and container traffic are 
increasing faster than previous forecasts had anticipated. 
  49. It is painfully clear that Kai Tak is an airport working 
beyond its capacity, despite the considerable improvements being 
made. Even if you never travel, but are one of the 300,000 or 
so people living nearby, Kai Tak is becoming a more and more 
noisy neighbour to live with. 
  50. The economic benefits of the new airport can best be 
described by looking at what Hong Kong would stand to lose if we 
did not have the new airport in 1997. Economic losses would be 
HK$3 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in the first year after 1997, 
another HK$6 billion in the following year and a massive HK$10 
billion the year after that. 
  51. We shall do all we reasonably can in dialogue with the 
Chinese Government to ensure that the expansion of the container 
port and the financing of the Airport Core Programme can proceed 
as swiftly as we would all wish. It is because of these 
economic benefits, and the good financial position we now find 
ourselves in, that we made our fourth financing proposal to 
address the Chinese Government's concerns. I shall refer again 
to this proposal in discussing the Medium Range Forecast. 
The Land Links 
  52. Every day, more than 20,000 goods vehicles pass through 
the border crossing points. The figure is growth by about 15 
percent a year. This traffic is the life blood of our economic 
growth. But the road arteries are becoming increasingly clogged 
by a volume of vehicles far beyond what they were designed to 
handle. 
  53. As I have explain in previous Budgets, we must invest 
heavily in improvements to the road and rail links which serve 
our trade, tourism and investment in China, as well as the 
everyday needs of our population. Much work is already in hand. 
  -- In September this year, the Yen Long Southern Bypass will 
be completed at a cost of HK$400 million. This will bring more 
relief to the Western New Territories. 
  -- In August, we shall be awarding the HK$3.7 billion 
construction contract for the Ting Kau Bridge. When it opens in 
mid-1997, traffic will be able to bypass the container port and 
its bottlenecks in Kwai Chung. 
  -- By the end of this year, we hope to award the franchise 
to 
construct and operate the Country Park Section of Route 3. When 
it comes into operation in late 1998, it will provide a fast new 
route linking the border, the container port and the urban areas. 
  -- We have reached agreement in principle with the Chinese 
authorities to open the Lok Ma Chau crossing point round the 
clock, for implementation, we hope, in the first half of this 
year. Meanwhile two additional channels have just been opened. 
  -- A major expansion of the Lowu Station will be completed 
early next year at a cost of HK$280 million. 
  54. Much of the cross-border freight is far more suited to 
be moved by rail than road. But existing rail capacity simply 
cannot cope with demand. Last year, the Railway Development 
Study was completed. This set out ambitious but costly 
proposals, including the construction of a new rail track to 
link up with the Chinese national rail system, which itself is 
being rapidly upgraded. 
  We are not yet in a position to make a firm decision on the 
best way forward. But I suspect a consensus will emerge that 
high on the list of our long-term transport priorities should be 
a new railway to the border through the Northwest New 
Territories. [passage omitted] 
  The Medium Range Forecast 
  147. As in previous years, I have published the Medium Range 
Forecast in Appendix A to the printed version of this Speech. 
Before I discuss the forecast, I should like to make four points. 
  148. First, in accordance with our normal practice, this 
forecast covers the current financial year, the estimates year, 
and three further years, Hence, my forecast will for the first 
time include the 1997-98 financial year, a period most of which 
follows the transfer of sovereignty. I should emphasise that 
this is a forecast only, presented today solely to provide the 
appropriate context for Hong Kong's planning. It is no way 
imposes any commitment on the future SAR government. 
  149. Secondly, in previous forecasts, we have allowed for 
the financial implications of the first airport financing 
proposal put to the Chinese Government. And specifically, in 
addition to public works expenditure, for equity injections of 
HK$20.3 billion from the reserves. Whilst the financing 
arrangements have yet to be agreed, it is clearly desirable to 
make our forecasts as realistic as possible. Without going into 
details of the fourth financing proposal at this stage, in our 
latest forecast we have allowed for a further equity injection 
of HK$20 billion from the reserves. 
  We have also estimated the likely additional revenue to be 
obtained from airport railway-related land, and how much of that 
sum would be used as a further equity injection. 
Notwithstanding the great increase in land values since 1992, 
no more than about HK$40 billion in gross premium from airport 
railway-related land is expected to be received in the limited 
period up to June 1997, half of which would of course go to the 
Land Fund. These estimates are reflected in the new forecast. 
[passage omitted] 
  153. Now for the Medium Range Forecast itself. Two 
different factors are at work. 
  -- First, revenues have been buoyant over the past three 
years. And revenue forecasts have been increased to reflect this. 
  -- Secondly, on the expenditure side, the forecast reflects 
a 
more realistic estimate of our capacity on public works. 
  154. On this basis, I forecast that we shall add HK$7.7 
billion to our fiscal reserves in 1994-95. Throughout the 
forecast period, we shall continue to see a healthy surplus on 
the operating account. However, in 1995-96 and 1996-97, we are 
forecast to draw on our reserves to take account of an 
increasing spending capacity on public works, as well as 
increased investment in our physical infrastructure, including 
most notably the Airport Core Programme. 
  155. I forecast that on 31 March 1997, our fiscal reserves 
will stand at an impressive HK$120 billion. This is a dramatic 
increase over the figure of HK$78 billion which I forecast in my 
Budget last year. This HK$120 billion is all the more 
remarkable an achievement when you remember that it takes into 
account both the spending proposals and the tax concessions I 
have announced today. And it also fully allows for the proposed 
additional equity injection into the Airport Core Programme, and 
explains my willingness to make such a large investment. 
  156. Moving to the last year of the forecast, namely 
1997-98, the Medium Term Forecast predicts an overall surplus 
for the year of HK$21 billion. This very satisfactory figure 
reflects the fact that, in accordance with the Joint 
Declaration, the SAR government will receive the full proceeds 
from land sales, and will collect rents for the extension of New 
Territories leases. The end result is that the forecast 
predicts that the fiscal reserves will total HK$141 billion at 
the end of 1997-98. 
  157. Nor is this the full picture, as these figures do not 
take into account the position of the SAR government Land Fund, 
which represents a significant asset for the future SAR 
government. Members will recall that a senior Chinese official 
has been reported recently as indicating that the fund was 
likely to exceed HK$100 billion in 1997. Our own estimate of 
HK$105 billion, before taking into account the disposal of sites 
along the airport railway, is broadly in line with this. 
  But when account is taken of the fund's share of the likely 
additional receipts from these sites the balance of the fund in 
1997 should reach HK$125 billion. 
  158. Thus, at the end of 1997-98, the SAR government is 
likely to have combined reserves, including interest, of about 
HK$269 billion, incorporating both the fiscal reserves and the 
Land Fund. Fortunately, therefore, we are able to continue to 
build up reserves greater than our annual expenditure. This is 
something we have been able to achieve in recent times. And 
something that few other communities have been able to do. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  159. To a considerable extent we are engaged in managing the 
prosperity we have achieved, and in ensuring that it continues. 
In practice this has involved me in striking the right balance 
between spending and savings: 
  -- Spending, both to improve the quality of life for the 
community as a whole and to create the infrastructure for our 
future growth, and 
  -- Savings, to meet future liabilities and unforeseen 
contingencies, because economic success cannot be taken for 
granted year after year. 
  There will always be a temptation to spend a little more and 
save a little less. It might sometimes seem tempting 
politically to bow to some of the inevitable pressures to do so. 
But it would not be responsible government. And it would risk 
increasing consumption and fuelling inflation. 
  160. I hope that this Council will agree that we have found 
the right balance this afternoon. My Budget proposals will: 
  -- Put HK$38 billion back into the taxpayer's pocket over 
the 
next five years, 
  -- Implement the ambitious expansion in social services set 
in motion by the Governor's first two Policy Addresses, and 
  -- Put an additional HK$8 billion into our fiscal reserves 
next year and put us on course for total fiscal reserves of 
HK$269 billion by the end of the forecast period. 
  161. It is not the Government which has made today's Budget 
possible. This has been achieved by the hard-working men and 
women of Hong Kong. It is, first and last, their success and 
their money on which we rely, and it is their way of life, their 
livelihood we are all trying to secure. 
  162. Mr President, I move that the debate on this motion be 
now adjourned.

<F P=106> [By business editor Ray Heath] </F>
  [Text] In one of the most generous budgets produced 
anywhere, [Financial Secretary] Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday 
bowed to the fact that the Hong Kong Government is collecting 
money faster than it could spend it. So he proposed giving at 
least $7 billion of it back. For the first time the Government 
revealed its forecast for the amount of cash that would be in 
the funds after handover in 1997, and the $269 billion available 
to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government by March 
1998 showed it could afford to be generous. 
  Tax bills are to be slashed by $3.2 billion and almost half 
a 
million people will join those who pay none at all, companies 
will be left with more of their profits, the cost of buying a 
home will be shaved and welfare spending will be raised. Sir 
Hamish said there were four major challenges facing Hong Kong 
which must be remedied: inflation, the improvement of rail, 
road and air links, traffic congestion and the provision of 
financial security for the greying population. 
  The overall theme was "Managing Prosperity" and was the sort 
of budget finance ministers around the world dream of. It was, 
said Sir Hamish after delivering his speech to the Legislative 
Council, a "pretty historic Budget" and almost certainly 
contained a record amount of concessions on salaries tax. 
  The number of individuals who will not be paying income tax 
will jump from an already high 43 percent to 58 percent, 
described by Sir Hamish as "a fantastic difference". The 
measures take 420,000 people out of the tax net altogether and a 
further 1.13 million will find themselves paying lower taxes 
from this year. Huge increases in family allowances, including 
the introduction of a new one for taxpayers caring for a 
grandparent, meant that the very important middle and upper 
income groups -- and almost every civil servant -- will benefit. 
  One of the big surprises of the Budget was cutting profits 
tax from 17.5 percent to 16.5 percent. This will leave Hong 
Kong companies with an extra $1.6 billion to invest in 1994/95, 
and will reduce their tax bills by more than $10 billion up to 
1997. At the same time, Sir Hamish is planning to raise the 
cost of welfare spending, with funds being allocated to the 
elderly, disabled, sick and disadvantaged, with more places for 
nurseries and creches for children. 
  Despite the growing fears about the rise in residential 
property prices -- which Sir Hamish shares -- the Government has 
decided that it can afford to reduce stamp duty on property 
transactions. Like many other proposals in the Budget, this is 
aimed particularly at the sandwich class and the reductions will 
apply only to properties priced at under $3 million. He said 
the Government believed that the cumulative effect of stamp duty 
on speculators who bought and sold flats several times before an 
end-user actually moved in would be a deterrent. 
  Even visitors will benefit from the proposed measures. After 
listening to the recommendations of the tourist industry, the 
Government is to reduce the much disliked airport departure tax 
from $150 to $50. 
  There was very little sour among the sweet -- even the usual 
step of raising taxes on the good things in life was resisted. 
There will be no rise in duty on tobacco, the incomprehensible 
system of charging duty on alcohol content will be simplified, 
to the benefit of the low end products in the market, and the 
tax on fuel will go up by only 8.5 percent, to reflect 
inflation. To placate the anti- smoking lobby, the Government 
is to donate an extra $7.5 million to the Council on Smoking and 
Health for anti-smoking campaigns, on top of the $4.1 million 
they already receive every year. 
  If it looked a little over-generous Sir Hamish believed that 
Hong Kong could afford it, safe in the knowledge that the 
projection of future revenues and surpluses in the government 
finances meant that it would be comfortably, even luxuriously, 
within its targets for handing over a properly financed 
territory to the SAR in 1997. 
  In his medium range forecast, Sir Hamish revealed that by 
March 1998, the outgoing government would have built up reserves 
of $268.9 billion. This compares with the $25 billion which the 
Government has committed to set aside for the SAR government, 
plus a further $7 billion in respect of civil service pensions. 
  After last year's 5.5 percent increase in gross domestic 
product the sum total of goods and services purchased in the 
territory -- Sir Hamish is predicting that the economy will grow 
by the same amount this year. But the flip side of the growth 
coin remains inflation, and on this, yesterday's news was not so 
good for another year of rising prices is forecast, with no cut 
from last year's rate of 8.5 percent. He is also planning major 
overhaul of the companies ordinance, in what one official 
described as "root and branch" tidying up of the piecemeal 
legislation which has come on the statue books over the years.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 3 (XINHUA) -- Chinese officials in 
Hong Kong had reservations about the forecast reserves to be 
inherited by the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) of 
Hong Kong after Financial Secretary Hamish MacLeod delivered the 
1994/95 budget. 
  According to MacLeod's budget presented Wednesday [2 March], 
the reserves for the future SAR Government are estimated to hit 
269 billion H.K. dollars (about 34.487 billion U.S. dollars) 
after transfer of power in 1997. 
  Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong branch, said he welcomed MacLeod's statement that there 
would be more than 100 billion H.K. dollars (about 12.82 billion 
U.S. dollars) left in the government's reserves after 1997. 
  "If they are able to write it down, then we welcome it and 
hope they do what they say," Zhang said. 
  Zheng Guoxiong, another deputy director of XINHUA branch, 
said the financial arrangements for 1994/95 should follow the 
principle of keeping the expenditures within the limits of 
income. 
  Meanwhile, Tam Yiu-chung from the Democratic Alliance for 
the 
Betterment of Hong Kong, criticized the budget for failing to 
take measures to bring down inflation and property prices. 
  Huang Chen-ya of the United Democrats also criticized the 
government for not doing enough to combat property speculation. 
  Fred Li of the meeting point welcomed cuts in salaries tax 
but said his party did not accept one-percent cut of profits tax. 
  Editorials of WEN WEI PO and HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY 
doubted the real motive of the government in the record-breaking 
tax giveaway.

<F P=106> [By Louis Ng] </F>
  [Text] Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday 
rejected China's request to give a written guarantee that $269 
billion would be handed over to the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) government by 1997. 
  A vice-director of the local XINHUA (the New China News 
Agency), Zhang Junsheng, challenged Sir Hamish's forecast in 
Wednesday's Budget that reserves of more than $141 billion and a 
Land Fund of $125 billion could be available to the SAR by March 
1998. 
  "If they are able to write it down, then we welcome it and 
hope they do what they say. The more reserves the better," Mr. 
Zhang said yesterday. "But I do not know whether this is only a 
blank cheque." 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang offered a 
more mild response when asked about the possibility of such huge 
reserves being left by the British. "China hopes that it (the 
Budget) will not leave a huge financial burden to Hong Kong 
people and the future SAR government," Mr. Shen said. 
  Xu Yongfu, senior economist at the Hong Kong branch of the 
Bank of China, said the surplus could have been bigger had there 
been no plans for overspending. "For example, the proportion of 
expenditure on social welfare is too big," he said. "What we are 
worried about is that Hong Kong, whose success lies very much on 
a spirit of diligence, will be turned into a welfare society." 
  Britain guaranteed under the Memorandum of Understanding 
with 
China on the vast airport projects that $25 billion would be 
passed on. Sir Hamish responded that his "forecast" of the 
reserves growing to $269 billion, with the SAR's Land Fund 
added, was already in "black and white". "It's there in black 
and white at the back of the Budget speech," he said on radio. 
However, he rejected the suggestion that any extra written 
undertaking should be made. 
  "I'm quite confident about those forecasts -- but they are 
forecasts -- they're based on assumptions," he said. "If things 
change radically then of course we change our policies 
accordingly, but they're secure, sensible and best-effect type 
forecasts." 
  He said he was confident that his present forecasts could 
cope with a normal down-side scenario of the economy. "I can 
say I am confident that the reserves are sufficient to cater for 
at least one or two years of what you might call normal downside 
scenario. We are not looking at horrendous downside scenarios 
because they are not likely," Sir Hamish said. "The reserves 
partly exist to let you ride out any temporary difficulty for a 
year or two, so you can avoid a stop-go policy on expenditure." 
  He also disagreed that his financial forecast was too 
optimistic. "I think it's probably better to say that we've been 
a little over-conservative in the past," he said. "We've 
revised the forecast upwards, it's true, in the light not just 
of last year but of the past three years. "I would say it's 
still a fairly conservative forecast. 
  "It certainly does not assume that land sales, land prices 
and stock market turn-over continue at the present very-high 
rate." 
  Sir Hamish said he was cautious in his forecasts for 
land-related income such as premiums and property stamp duty as 
the Treasury did not anticipate the same level of return in the 
1994/95 year as the revised estimates for the current year. 
  Secretary for the Treasury Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said that 
the property stamp duties to be collected in the current year 
would be $12 billion and the estimate for next year would be 
slightly more than $9 billion. Sir Hamish said that in 
forecasting land revenue, particularly on projections going 
beyond next year, the Government took a fairly cautious view. 
"We certainly don't project the existing level [of income] for 
we take a more cautious view than that."

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Hong Wen (1738 5113)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 2 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The 
Sino-British Airport Committee will hold an experts group 
meeting tomorrow. Prior to this meeting, Financial Secretary 
Macleod announced the financial budget for the new fiscal year. 
What is noteworthy is that the budget has verified that the 
Hong Kong Government had a surplus of 15 billion [Hong Kong] 
dollars last year. In other words, the Hong Kong Government has 
accumulated a surplus of more than 130 billion dollars this 
year. We believe that this figure is quite useful for airport 
experts to discuss capital injections and loans for the new 
airport at the upcoming airport experts meeting. Many 
personalities pointed out that since the Hong Kong Government 
possesses such a huge fund, it absolutely can increase its 
capital injection into the airport to reduce debts and enable 
China and Britain to reach an early agreement on the new airport 
financial arrangements. 
  Reports say that a new airport financial arrangement plan 
recently submitted to the Chinese side by the Hong Kong 
Government has suggested increasing the capital injection from 
45.3 billion dollars to 60.3 billion dollars, to reduce the loan 
from 43 billion dollars to 23 billion dollars. However, the 
amount of this debt is still more than four times the 
5-billion-dollar limit set by the Memorandum of Understanding on 
the new airport. 
  Ho Ching-on, member of the Airport Advisory Commission, said 
that at a time when the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 
constitutional structure have broken down, the Chinese side is 
still willing to reopen an experts group meeting; this indicates 
that the Chinese side still has sincerity. Therefore the 
British side should also show its sincerity and make further 
efforts to reduce the construction cost and increase its capital 
injection. 
  Legislative Councilor Chim Pui-chung, who represents people 
in financial circles, pointed out that if the British side still 
insists saying that the loan for the new airport railway does 
not fall into the category of "government debt," it will be 
difficult for the Chinese side to accept it. According to his 
analysis, on the question of loans--an issue on which China and 
Britain differ greatly--there is still room for flexible 
accommodation if the provisions of the Memorandum of 
Understanding are followed. Namely, if the loan exceeds 5 
billion dollars, China and Britain should consult to reach an 
agreement for implementation. But the amount of loan should not 
be too high and should correspond with the principle of cost 
benefit. 
  But in Mr. Chim's and Mr. Ho's opinion, now is not the time 
to thoroughly resolve the above problem, because there are still 
great differences between the sides and the British side is 
still playing number games, which has caused difficulties to the 
talks. Therefore it is still difficult to reach a satisfactory 
agreement in the near future. 
  In addition, Li Weiting, assistant to the director of the 
Hong Kong XINHUA Branch, pointed out that the 5-billion-dollar 
limit can still be discussed by the experts group and that there 
is also room for flexible handling of land approval. But with 
the huge surplus, the Hong Kong Government absolutely can inject 
more capital and follow the provisions of the Memorandum of 
Understanding. He added: The British side has destroyed the 
foundation for cooperation on the question of constitutional 
structure; regarding other aspects, it depends on future 
development. The Chinese side does not wish to see Hong Kong's 
economy and people's lives seriously affected, but many matters 
cannot be determined by one side only.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese and 
British experts on the airport committee, after a six-month 
break, restarted talks here this afternoon, focusing on the 
fourth financing proposal put forward by the British side 
earlier. 
  After today's meeting, Chinese representative Hu Houcheng 
said that China has always backed the idea of building a new 
airport in Hong Kong. 
  China puts emphasis on efficiency and cost for the project, 
which should cause no financial burden on the future special 
administrative region of Hong Kong, Hu said, adding that the 
Chinese side had made suggestions for the British latest 
proposal. 
  The British representative said that the common ground 
between the two sides is quite considerable, but they have to 
make a bit more efforts in order to resolve the remaining 
technical issues. 
  In answer to media questions on this afternoon's session, a 
government spokesman described the meeting as "friendly and 
positive". 
  "This afternoon the Chinese side asked various questions 
about our fourth financing proposal, and we will be providing 
them with answers as soon as possible," the spokesman added.

Affairs Office Director Lu Ping at ceremony reappointing Hong 
Kong affairs advisers for another term in Shenzhen on 2 March] 
  [Text] Advisers, ladies, and gentlemen: 
  Two years ago, we held a ceremony to present letters of 
appointment to the first group of Hong Kong affairs advisers in 
the solemn Great Hall of the People in Beijing. I am sure that 
all of you still recall the occasion as if it were yesterday. 
Two years have gone by quickly. As the term of office for the 
first group of Hong Kong affairs advisers is about to end, the 
State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA 
Hong Kong Branch have jointly decided to reappoint the first 
group of 43 advisers for another term. Today, as we hold this 
reappointment ceremony in the warm and blossoming city of 
Shenzhen, let me first offer my heartfelt congratulations to the 
reappointed advisers on behalf of the State Council Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch! 
  Acting as Hong Kong affairs advisers to you is not so much 
an 
honor as a responsibility to be shouldered. First, this 
reflects your sense of responsibility as masters who regard it 
as their responsibility to achieve "one country, two systems," 
Hong Kong's smooth transition in 1997, and to maintain Hong 
Kong's stability and prosperity. On the other hand, it also 
embodies the Chinese Government's determination to ensure the 
"rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people" and to achieve a high 
degree of autonomy for Hong Kong. Precisely based on this high 
sense of responsibility, over the past two years you all have, 
through a variety of means and channels, put forward large 
numbers of valuable opinions and suggestions on a series of 
questions regarding Hong Kong's handover of power and a smooth 
transition. We alone have received hundreds of letters from 
advisers. The State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch have held many discussion 
meetings with advisers to listen directly to their opinions. 
All advisers, whether the first group or the second, have made 
their greatest efforts and done their best and have rendered 
very great help and support to our work. They are our think 
tank and a force we rely on in handling Hong Kong affairs. I 
would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest 
gratitude to all Hong Kong affairs advisers. 
  A few days ago, the British Hong Kong Legislative Council 
passed the partial bill which was formulated in accordance with 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's "political reform proposals." 
The British Government even published a White Paper regarding 
the Sino-British talks on the political system. This series of 
unilateral measures, which have ruined cooperation, show that in 
the remaining three and a half years of the transition period, 
the British side will cling obstinately to its course and 
continue to pursue a policy that puts itself in confrontation 
with us. By doing so, they will only enable all kindhearted 
people to see clearly so that they no longer harbor any 
imagination about "cooperation" which the British side hangs on 
to verbally. Moreover, this will consolidate our determination 
to rely on our strength to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition 
and long-term stability together with vast numbers of Hong Kong 
compatriots who love the country and who love Hong Kong. Mr. 
Deng Xiaoping said as early as 10 years ago: "It is psychology 
left over by the old colonialists that people trust that the 
Chinese in Hong Kong can exercise good rule over Hong Kong but 
do not trust that the Chinese are able to exercise good rule 
over Hong Kong." Deng added: "Hong Kong's prosperity has come 
about by the work of Hong Kong people the majority of whom are 
Chinese." "Hong Kong people are able to exercise good rule over 
Hong Kong. We should have self- confidence in this." We 
believe that you advisers seated here and vast numbers of Hong 
Kong people have this self-confidence! At present, our country 
has social stability, its economy is developing continuously, 
and its international status is rising daily. More and more 
Hong Kong people are consciously standing on the side of 
safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and peaceful 
transition. We are going to appoint the third group of Hong 
Kong affairs advisers soon. They will come from all strata and 
all quarters of the Hong Kong community. We can say that the 
contingent of Hong Kong affairs advisers has grown large and 
they are much more representative. This contingent will surely 
play a more important role on the road to achieving Hong Kong's 
reversion. It will gather thousands of people to form a large 
army to write a new epoch-making chapter for Hong Kong. 
Although the British side's lack of cooperation and 
confrontational attitude will place obstacles on our road of 
resuming the exercise of sovereignty and will make various kinds 
of trouble, with the strong backing of the motherland and with 
the concerted efforts of vast numbers of Hong Kong compatriots, 
we will have no insurmountable difficulties and dangers or 
unremovable obstacles! 
  Advisers, under the present situation, the burden on your 
shoulders is heavier and your tasks will multiply. I hope that 
all of you will continue your efforts, continue to use your 
talents, wisdom, experience, and influence to make a new and 
greater contribution at the critical stage as Hong Kong is 
reverting to the motherland. 
  Thank you!

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Says the Three-Tier Councils </F>
Unilaterally Set Up by the British Hong Kong Authorities Will 
Terminate When the Special Administrative Region Is Set Up"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong 
Branch, pointed out yesterday: The Chinese side hoped to reach 
an agreement on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements with the 
British side through negotiations, but Patten tabled the 
political reform bill to the Legislative Council and thus 
disrupted the talks. What bill the British Hong Kong Government 
adopts now is their own business. He stressed that the 
three-tier councils set up by the British Hong Kong authorities 
unilaterally would totally cease to exist on 30 June 1997. By 
that time, the Chinese Government will reorganize the three-tier 
councils in Hong Kong together with Hong Kong citizens in 
accordance with the Basic Law and its relevant provisions. 
  While attending a Spring Festival reception hosted by 
XINHUA's Kowloon office, Zhang Junsheng expressed the above 
views when asked by a reporter about the Legislative Council 
debate on Patten's partial political reform bill. 
  Talking about the British side claiming to publicize the 
contents of the Sino-British talks, Zhang Junsheng reiterated 
that the Chinese side would certainly make an appropriate 
response if the British side unilaterally did so. 
  When a reporter asked him about the issue of continued 
service by civil servants at the directorate level after 1997, 
Zhang Junsheng said: The Basic Law has made definite 
stipulations on this issue. Except for secretaries and other 
senior officials who should be nominated by the chief executive 
of the special administrative region [SAR] and report to the 
central government for appointment, all other public servants 
may remain in employment. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: The 180,000 Hong Kong civil servants 
have served the Hong Kong people for a long time and have 
performed substantial work. They have also rendered 
considerable deeds toward the stability and prosperity of Hong 
Kong today. Zhang Junsheng hoped that they would remain in 
service and continue to serve the SAR government and the Hong 
Kong people sincerely after the establishment of the SAR 
government. As the government at that time will be the Chinese 
people's own government, they should serve it even more 
enthusiastically.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Social and Security 
Special Group under the Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] for 
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] held its third meeting in Beijing 
from 28 February to 1 March. 
  The meeting studied the issue of granting Hong Kong SAR 
permanent resident status to returned emigrants who have become 
foreign nationals. Members tended to favor the application of 
the stipulations of Clause 4 under Article 24 of the Hong Kong 
SAR Basic Law to settle this issue. Considering the close 
relations between returned emigrants and Hong Kong, members held 
that prior to obtaining a fresh permanent resident status, 
returned emigrants may enjoy the rights to enter and stay in 
Hong Kong without restrictive conditions. The meeting also 
discussed the retirement security issue in Hong Kong as well as 
reviewed the issue's development and current situation in Hong 
Kong's history. Members unanimously felt that great importance 
should be attached to retirement security, a major issue that 
concerns the people's lives and is closely linked to the overall 
Hong Kong society. Members pointed out that retirement security 
should be treated separately from social welfare. The system 
should be considered on the basis of Hong Kong's actual 
conditions, and the principle conducive to Hong Kong's social 
stability and economic prosperity should be upheld.

<F P=106> [By Fanny Wong] </F>
  [Text] The Government was last night under intense 
pressure to disclose more details of the 17 rounds of secret 
talks on Hong Kong's future political reforms, only hours after 
publishing what it admitted was a "distilled" version of the 
negotiations. 
  Government sources insisted there had been no attempt to 
hide 
anything by not printing a fuller account and suggested instead 
that the administration did not want to bombard legislators and 
the community with "a barrage of papers". 
  But liberal legislators from the United Democrats of Hong 
Kong and Meeting Point last night demanded the Government reveal 
more than what was contained in the 36-page White Paper on the 
talks. 
  They said the White Paper was insufficient for people to 
make 
a proper judgment of the handling of the negotiations, which had 
led to an almost total breakdown in Sino-British relations with 
serious ramifications for the territory in the run-up to 1997. 
  Confusion mounted last night after the Chinese side rejected 
the British accounts of the talks. 
  Chief Chinese negotiator Jiang Enzhu briefed a group of Hong 
Kong members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) with a 
different version of events. 
  There already had been a warning from Beijing that the 
British move might affect co-operation in other areas, including 
the crucial talks needed to get the new airport fully under way. 
  The Chinese side rejected the British suggestion that 
Beijing 
had changed its stance on issues such as the abolition of 
appointed seats to the district boards and municipal councils 
elections. 
  While announcing the publication of the White Paper 
yesterday 
and the gazetting today of the remaining parts of his 
controversial electoral package on the 1995 Legislative Council 
elections, the Governor, Chris Patten, stressed that the White 
Paper was "a thorough, factual account". 
  Noting that China had already disclosed some details of the 
talks in the People's Daily on January 7, Mr Patten said the 
British side had decided to publish its version to fulfil a 
promise to reveal details of the talks when pressing ahead with 
the remaining legislation without the Chinese Government's 
agreement. 
  Mr Patten said the White Paper set out the background to the 
present position and the approach which Britain took in the 
negotiations with China, as well as the modifications Britain 
was prepared to make to his 1992 proposals as part of an overall 
agreement including the through-train arrangement. 
  He said he regretted no agreement could be reached, but 
commended legislators for approving the first-stage bill early 
yesterday morning on the three simple issues. 
  The council approved the lowering of the voting age from 21 
to 18, the adoption of the single-seat, single-vote system for 
the three-tier elections and the abolition of appointed seats on 
the district boards and municipal councils. 
  "I think it was an extremely important day for Hong Kong. I 
think it was an extremely important mature moment in Hong Kong's 
history," he said. 
  "Nobody can wipe it out. Nobody can pretend it didn't 
happen. Nobody can turn back the clock on what happened," Mr 
Patten said. 
  Defending the decision to publish only an abridged account, 
government sources said if a blow-by-blow account of the talks 
was included, the document would be as big as a phone book. 
  "It's not sensible and it's not helpful to bombard the 
Legislative Council, the Parliament and the Hong Kong community 
with a great barrage of papers. It is sensible to summarise it 
in this way, there's nothing missing from here," said a 
government source. 
  "It is a distillation, but everything that is important, 
everything that happens in the talks that is important is there."

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Hu Angang and Kang </F>
Xiaoguang, researchers with the National Situation Study Group 
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: "Corruption Chokes Growth, 
Say Experts"] 
  [Text] Corruption still occurs in China despite periodic 
campaigns to eliminate it. 
  And it is not only restricted to government and Party 
officials-- shortcomings within the economic system have also 
encouraged others to resort to dishonesty. 
  In order to stamp out corruption, the country's economic and 
managerial systems should be restructured. This is more 
effective than launching moral crusades. 
  Government and military departments should be banned from 
running businesses. They should have their administrations 
streamlined and their staff should be paid higher wages. 
  And banks should not be made to impose loan quotas and 
discriminatory interest rates on private businesses. Instead, 
their criteria for lending should be based on the performance of 
the debtor. 
  And the government should see to it that all businesses, 
regardless of their ownership and organization, compete on an 
equal footing. They should have equal access to foreign 
exchange, foreign trade rights and other resources. 
  The dual pricing system which exists for certain raw 
materials, capital and labour at the moment invites abuse of the 
system. 
  The government's protection of some businesses, the monopoly 
status it grants to some industries, its excessive customs 
tariffs and import quotas and its preferential treatment of 
certain departments and regions, have all aided unfair 
competition and led to corruption. 
  The absence of a sound legal system and a lack of checks and 
balances within the government have also furthered corruption. 
  For a while malpractices were checked, only to raise their 
heads again once the pressure was off. 
  The most effective anticorruption drive would be a gradual 
reform of the unfair allocation system. 
  Capital is the most important element in any society. Until 
now, the government has secured a low interest rate for 
State-owned enterprises while adopting a much higher, 
market-dictated interest rate for the private sector. 
  In addition to this, the government has adopted a loan quota 
system to guarantee loans for state-run firms. As a result some 
banks demand bribes from private companies that are eager for a 
loan. 
  The government should unify interest rates and float them so 
that they are set by market demand. It needs to allow non-State 
and foreign banks to compete in the financial market and at the 
same time it should subsidize loans for such sectors as 
agriculture, communications and energy production. 
  To ensure fair competition, the government should also slash 
tariffs, cancel the monopoly status it has given to 
import-export firms, lift controls on foreign exchange and 
reduce the restrictions on foreign businesses involved in the 
service industry. 
  Except in the case of a few essential public services such 
as 
electricity, water and gas supplies, postal services and 
military production, there is little reason for retaining 
government monopolies. Moreover, the government should break 
down all regional trade barriers to ensure the free flow of 
resources and it should abolish preferential tax reductions. 
  The existing salary levels for government officials don't 
help. Civil servants with high political positions often only 
enjoy low economic status. The sense of not being paid for what 
they do leads many bureaucrats to run their own businesses or 
exchange favours for bribes. 
  If the size of the present administration is cut by 
one-third, the salary of bureaucrats should be raised to at 
least that of the average worker. Meanwhile, housing, medical 
and transport subsidies for officials should be abolished and 
their gross incomes should be made public. 
  The government is also not spending enough on defence. To 
make up the shortfall, the Chinese army is now engaging in 
business activities to make money. Some of which have led to 
corruption. 
  For the long-term stability of the country, the government 
should increase its military spending substantially to ensure 
that the income of soldiers and officers is higher than that of 
the national average.

  [Text] Bayannur League and Baotou city recently held 
rallies to publicly pronounce judgments of three cases on 
embezzlement and bribe-taking according to the law. Six corrupt 
elements were punished. 
  Wang Lixin was sentenced to death according to the law with 
political rights deprived for life on charge of embezzlement. 
He was executed recently in Bayannur League. Li Junping, 
guilty of embezzlement, who surrendered to the police with a 
tremendous amount of money, was leniently sentenced to death 
with a two-year reprieve; and Liu Xirong and Xie Hailong was 
sentenced to life imprisonment with political rights deprived 
for life and 13-year imprisonment, respectively. Rui Liuyuan 
and Jiang Liguo, who took bribes, were sentenced to life 
imprisonment with political rights deprived for life and a 
nine-year imprisonment, respectively. 
  Wang Lixin, former accountant of the savings bank of the 
Wuyuan County agricultural bank in Bayannur League, embezzled 
more than 210,000 yuan from the funds of the bank and the 
savings of the bank depositors from February 1991 to May 1992. 
He used the money for gambling and drugs and returned merely 
some 30,000 yuan after the case was discovered, incurring a loss 
of more than 170,000 yuan to the state. Li Junping, former 
accountant of the Delingshan office of the Urad Middle and Rear 
Joint Banner agricultural bank in Bayannur League, colluded with 
jobless Liu Xirong and Xie Hailong to embezzle more than 860,000 
yuan from the bank from December 1992 to April 1993 by means of 
"receipts of postal money transfer of the region" he owned. He 
surrendered himself to the police with 380,000 yuan of the 
embezzlement money in June 1993 and returned all the money later 
when the case was discovered. Rui Liuyuan, former deputy 
director of the transportation section of the Baotou city 
aluminum plant, took advantage of business ties with a certain 
unit in Jiangsu Province to abuse power to sell 140 tonnes of 
aluminum ingot with the approval of Jiang Liguo, deputy director 
of the plant. He took bribes totaling 200,000 yuan, of which 
155,000 yuan was taken by himself and 45,000 yuan given to 
Jiang. In addition, Jiang also owned $20,000, whose sources 
were not clear. 
  Wang Lixin, Xie Hailong, and Rui Liuyuan refused to accept 
the first rule and lodged an appeal. After the trial of the 
autonomous regional higher people's court, the appeal was 
rejected and the original rule was maintained.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "China Asks For Cut in Trade </F>
Restrictions"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (ANSA) -- Amidst hopes for continued 
trade expansion between European Union [EU] countries and China, 
fears have been expressed about possible effects on China's 
exports from restrictions imposed by The Twelve on Chinese 
products. 
  These fears were mentioned today by Zang Chunzheng, from the 
Chinese Foreign Trade Ministry, with reference to the thirteenth 
meeting between China and the European Union to begin Monday [28 
February] with the participation of Commissioner Leon Brittan. 
  Zang Chunzheng said he hoped the meeting would remove or 
weaken "the quotas and other limitations introduced by the 
Twelve". He described them as "discriminatory measures adopted 
to protect the European market against China". 
  China's re-admission into GATT, the international commerce 
agreement, will be one of the issues examined during Brittan's 
visit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU/China: Brittan Warns Hong Kong </F>
Dispute Could Have EU Trade Repercussions"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (ANSA) -- European Trade 
Commissioner Leon Brittan warned there could be a chilling of 
trade relations with Europe if China took reprisals against the 
UK for problems in working out the Hong Kong sovereignty 
transition. 
  Speaking at a joint press conference with Trade Minister Wu 
Yi in the Chinese capital during the 13th meeting of the EU 
[European Union]-China trade committee, Brittan warned China 
that "any discriminatory diplomatic action versus one of the 
member countries would be considered a serious question" for the 
community. 
  (Talks between China and Britain over the transfer of Hong 
Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty broke down in December, 
when Hong Kong governor Chris Patten presented electoral reforms 
to the legislature despite the opposition of the Chinese 
government. 
  China believes the government is trying to change the 
colony's political composition, strengthening pro-British, 
anti-China forces to "transform Hong Kong into an independent or 
semi-dependent political entity that will not be controllable by 
Beijing," the news agency New China said recently. 
  Hong Kong is scheduled to pass to China in 1997, and the 
mainland government has warned it will not tolerate reforms 
being made now by a "lame duck" government they say will make 
the country "ungovernable" when it comes time for them to take 
it over. 
  The Chinese were further angered when the British government 
published accounts of the 17 sessions in the talks between 
Beijing and London on Hong Kong's future.) 
  Brittan spoke today after Ms. Wu Yi, in response to a 
question, called Great Britain's approach to the Hong Kong 
question "not very friendly and not very cooperative," and added 
that their problems "could not help but affect bilateral trade 
and economic relations." 
  The sharp exchange came after initial declarations of mutual 
satisfaction with today's committee meeting, in an atmosphere 
described as "friendly and pragmatic" that led to "excellent" 
results. 
  Ms. Wu Yi said "consensus" had been reached on many 
outstanding questions between China and Europe, and that mutual 
efforts were being made to resolve others. 
  EU-China trade volume reached 26.1 billion dollars last 
year, 
a 50 percent increase over 1992, Wu Yi said. China's exports 
equaled 11.7 billion dollars and imports totaled 14.4 billion 
dollars, a 49 percent increase over 1992. "The European Union 
is China's major exporter after Japan," said Wu Yi. 
  According to EU statistics, which include indirect 
commercial 
exchange, the total trade volume amounted to 31 billion dollars, 
with an 8 billion deficit for the EU. 
  Brittan expressed admiration for China's "notable" progress 
in making economic reforms, underlining the fact that the EU 
supports China's claim to join the GATT roundtable "in the 
interest not only of China but of the entire world." The EU 
trade commissioner's visit to China ends Tuesday [1 March].

<F P=106> [By correspondent Noriyoshi Igarashi] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry 
announced on 17 February that China will make its "own effort" 
for nuclear inspections in the DPRK (North Korea). A Chinese 
Government source has said, "Although China has not made public 
specifically how it has conducted its diplomacy toward North 
Korea, China has been working for the solution of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development issue." The source is believed to 
have suggested the role China has played in North Korea's recent 
acceptance of nuclear checks by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 
  The persisting view in China is that "North Korea has no 
nuclear weapons, but it intends to use its nuclear card to 
normalize relations with the United States at a stroke and to 
use the normalization of relations a means to keep its system in 
place." In other words, North Korea has so far taken an 
ambivalent attitude toward the nuclear inspections based on the 
judgment that if it simply relents on the nuclear inspections, 
the United States may continue to press it, raising the issue of 
democratization. 
  Another Chinese Government source pointed out that the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea adopted late 
last year the realistic policy of placing importance on the 
development of agriculture, light industry, and trade. Secretary 
Hwang Chang-yop of North Korea visited China in January and 
during his stay in China, he got a first-hand look at China's 
economic reform by touring Guangzhou city and the Zhuhai Special 
Economic Zone which have a reputation for the economic 
development. The same Chinese Government source indicated that 
"changes are seen for reforms in North Korea," citing the visit 
by the North Korean official to the city and economic zone. 
  China feared that if North Korea takes unexpected actions 
after being driven into a corner, it send many North Koreans 
fleeing into China, bringing instability to China's northeastern 
region where many ethnic Koreans reside and affecting China 
greatly. Out of this fear, China persistently asserted that the 
issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development be resolved 
through dialogue. 
  If the UN Security Council decides on economic sanctions 
against North Korea and they are imposed, this would be 
undesirable for China because it would be sandwiched between 
North Korea and international opinion. China would have been 
placed in a difficult situation if negotiations between North 
Korea and the IAEA fail to hammer out an agreement. 
  China knows the United States is highly praising it's role 
in 
North Korea's acceptance of nuclear checks by the IAEA. China 
appears to be aware of the advantage it can gain from a U.S. 
awareness that the United States needs help from China to 
resolve major Asian issues.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Toshiaki Arai] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb -- China and North Korea are moving 
toward improving their relations. While China's understanding 
of North Korea and its aid to the latter are indispensable for 
North Korea that is now beset with the nuclear issue and food 
shortages, China's maintenance of its influence on North Korea 
is an important card for China to play in diplomatic 
negotiations with Western nations, especially the United States. 
China-North Korea relations, that were once chilled by the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South 
Korea, are now moving toward improvement because of the 
coincidence of their interests and their policies on the 
"nuclear" issue and the complex international situation. 
  At one time, North Korea went so far as to criticize China 
as 
a revisionist and betrayer, but their relations appear to have 
normalized completely. As South Korean Ambassador to China 
Whang Pyung-tae explicitly stated in Seoul on 2 February, 
China-North Korea relations have improved substantially. 
  A visit by Whang Chang-yop, secretary of the Workers' Party 
of Korea (chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Foreign 
Affairs Committee) to China from mid-January to late January 
illustrated their improved relations. Mr. Whang was the 
highest-ranking North Korean official to visit China since 
August 1993, when China and South Korea established diplomatic 
relations. According to an informed source, Mr. Whang visited 
China in response to President Kim Il-song's intention to 
rebuild friendly relations with China. 
  At a meeting with Mr. Whang and his entourage, General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed the "friendship forged with 
blood." This expression is a barometer to gauge the 
friendliness of relations between the two countries and the 
expression has not been used since China and South Korea 
established diplomatic relations. 
  There are two reasons North Korea has decided to improve 
relations with China. First, China has persistently opposed any 
pressure or sanctions on North Korea. North Korea has no reason 
to see the Chinese attitude as negative. 
  Second, North Korea, which has been beset with economic 
stagnation and sluggish growth in food production, is in a 
situation where it is badly in need of China's aid. South 
Korean Ambassador Whang made it clear that "China is not asking 
North Korea to pay its imports from China in foreign currency as 
it has done in the past" out of consideration to North Korea. 
  According to the same source, North Korea is expected to 
strongly ask China for food aid and it is highly possible that 
President Kim Il-song and his son Secretary Kim Chong-il will 
visit China this year. 
  As for the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development, China believes that North Korea has no capability 
to develop nuclear weapons even if it intends to do so. China 
also considers the issue a very important agenda item in 
dialogue with Japan, the United States, and South Korea. It is 
unclear how much influence China holds over North Korea, but it 
is true that China is giving a great deal of consideration to 
North Korea in an attempt to secure its influence over North 
Korea. As an example, General Secretary Jiang Zemin has 
decided to defer his planned visit to South Korea despite South 
Korea's strong wish for his early visit.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of speech by PRC Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to </F>
lecture gathering hosted by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Tokyo on 24 
February] 
  [Text] The Chinese economy has grown about 13 percent over 
the past two years. It has developed greatly not only in major 
cities and coastal regions, but in rural and inland regions. 
  Concern is being expressed about China's economy 
overheating. 
Frankly speaking, signs of overheating were certainly seen in 
some parts of China and in some sectors from late 1992 to early 
1993. At the time, the volume of investment was too big and it 
was made in an unreasonable way. In particular, the boom in 
real estate development and the boom in economic development 
zones adversely affected agricultural development. One result 
was that the prices of production materials jumped, the steel 
price, for example, more than doubled. 
  The inflation increased by about one digit by 1991 and this 
situation continued with inflation rising 4-6 percent a year. 
Last year inflation grew at 13.4 percent, though in some major 
cities it was as much as 18.6 percent. But wages rose by 25 
percent in cities, and the lives of city residents were not as 
difficult as reported abroad. If the present situation 
continues, however, it will have an adverse impact on the entire 
Chinese economy. 
  Last June, the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council (government) took steps to coordinate macro 
economic policy. The steps won support from across the nation 
and issues were resolved in less than two months. Coordination 
of macro economic policy this time was different from past 
administrative intervention. We have not issued any 
administrative orders at all. We have tightened the management 
of bank loans and increased savings by raising interest rates. 
We have kept the private sector from raising funds in a chaotic 
way and, to some extent, curbed the issue of currency. 
  I think foreign news media misunderstand China. China did 
not tighten its finance across the board last year. We 
coordinated the direction of investment and the way investment 
was made, but we did not adopt a tight fiscal policy. We simply 
prevented funds from flowing into real estate by taking measures 
to redirect the flow toward the construction of agricultural, 
traffic and transport infrastructure. 
  A series of financial measures curbed investment in plant 
and 
equipment, confusing some state-run corporations. Such 
corporations, though, will be unable to keep up with China's 
economic development if they fail to coordinate their production 
mechanisms. 
  It is said that China has relaxed its monetary policy since 
last August after bowing to pressure at home and abroad, but 
this assessment stems from a misunderstanding. Oriental 
civilization is based on taking the moderate path. 
  During the second half of 1993, our nation managed the 
economy while properly coordinating a tight fiscal policy with a 
relaxed fiscal policy. We held eight rounds of conferences and 
I toured 15 provinces, cities and autonomous regions across the 
nation. We decided on the extent to which we would tighten 
fiscal policy in response to circumstances in those places. 
  Looking back, our financial measures were successful. We 
succeeded in keeping China's economy growing at the level of 13 
percent without letting it suffer any major fluctuation. The 
economy might have grown by more than 15 percent if financial 
measures had not been taken. 
  The issue of currency in 1992 more than doubled over the 
year 
before. In 1993 it was originally projected to double, but was 
limited to an increase of 20 percent. In view of that, we can 
say the financial measures we took were successful. China's 
trade deficit last year exceeded more than $10 billion, but 
China's foreign currency reserve increased a little thanks to 
our proper foreign exchange policy. 
  Needless to say, coordination of macroeconomic policy has 
only treated China's surface diseases. If China is to treat its 
diseases fundamentally, it should push ahead with the shift to a 
socialist market economy. In January this year, China announced 
plans to reform the finance, the monetary, the external trade, 
and the business system. It goes without saying there are a lot 
of small problems, but there are no major problems. In China, 
the market and prices are stable and the people are at ease. 
Inspired by this, we are resolved to push ahead with reform. 
  A small number of foreign news media, especially those in 
Hong Kong and Taiwan, have reported that Chinese society is 
restless and that "Zhu Rongji's reforms" have failed. The 
reports are utterly groundless. The CPC and the State Council 
decided on the reforms after a long period of study. They have 
decided on the reforms, taking into full account the present 
state of the market economies in industrialized nations. I 
think that if reform progresses as planned this year, it will 
put China on the way to creating a market economy in two years. 
  What I want to particularly point out is that China's reform 
measures, including reform of the current tax system, give 
special consideration to foreign firms. China has introduced a 
value-added tax system as the centerpiece of a tax system for 
enterprises. According to results of a poll in major cities, 
taxes paid by foreign firms have not increased. Even if the tax 
burden on foreign companies increases, we will take financial 
steps to return the tax increase to them five years later. 
There will be no change in the preferential treatment given to 
foreign enterprises when it comes to income tax. 
  China's reforms aim to make the investment environment 
advantageous, not disadvantageous, to foreign companies. I hope 
that any of you apprehensive or unsatisfied on this point will 
come to Beijing to see me. If I am not in my office, you may 
phone me. If there is no one available to take your call, you 
may fax me. If you present your views to me, I will study them. 
  A television plant set up under the joint-venture 
arrangement 
between Fuzhou City (in Fujian Province) and Hitachi Ltd. has 
said: "Thanks to our high profits, we will not raise our prices 
even if our tax burden increases." This is a splendid attitude. 
  Trade between China and Japan in 1933 was worth $39 billion, 
an increase of 54 percent on a year earlier. Japan has become 
China's largest trade partner after pushing aside Hong Kong. 
Japan also has become China's largest technological cooperation 
partner. Japanese investment in China is high. But $39 billion 
in trade is not much compared with the size of the Chinese 
market and cooperative relations between the two countries. 
  Both China and Japan need to supplement each other and the 
development of trade between the two countries will serve to 
help the Japanese economy recover. It is important for Japan to 
boost the competitiveness of its manufactured goods in China 
while taking measures to stimulate the economy. The management 
of Japanese enterprises in China over the past two years has 
been good. The production of videotape recorders in China under 
the joint-venture arrangement between China and Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Company is a major project and the 
joint-venture arrangement is in the interests of China and the 
Japanese company's global business strategy.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar -- Officers in uniform from the 
Self-Defense Forces and the People's Liberation Army held the 
first "Japanese-Chinese Security Talks" at the National Defense 
Ministry [NDM] in Beijing on 1 March. During the talks, 
concerning China's moves to strengthen its military power 
through such measures as the resumption of nuclear testing, 
Japanese officers said: "There are arguments in Asia that 
China's moves might threaten the security of other Asian 
nations. We hope China will boost the transparency in defense 
matters." However, Chinese counterparts reiterated China's 
conventional stand, saying: "Nuclear weapons are solely for 
self-defense. Inflation is the major reason for an increase in 
defense expenditures." 
  At the end of last year, security talks were held between 
officials of the foreign ministries of the two nations. This 
time, uniformed officers held the security dialogue for the 
first time. They included Toshimasa Fujiwara (major general), 
chief of the Joint Staff Council's 5th staff officer section, 
from Japan and Zhan Maohai (major general), deputy director at 
the NDM's Foreign Affairs Bureau, from China. They exchanged 
opinions for about five hours.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Noriyoshi Igarashi: "Chinese Approaches </F>
to Japan -- a Strategy To Keep the U.S. in Check"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Chinese Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji, who 
is playing a key role in promoting China's reform and opening up 
policy, will visit Japan from 23 February. The Japanese 
Government is studying ways for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
to pay an early visit to China. The Japanese and Chinese 
Governments, which have agreed to further strengthen their 
relations, plan to promote a brisk exchange of visits by their 
leaders. The Chinese Government, which sees Japan-China 
relations as the centerpiece of China's foreign policy strategy, 
is placing increasing importance on Japan. 
  China wants to keep the United States in check and this is 
one of the major reasons why China has reaffirmed its policy of 
attaching importance to Japan. 
  China has used its big market as a trump card to promote the 
economic diplomacy. Major European nations, which imposed 
sanctions on China following the Tiananmen incident, have 
competed with each other in mending their fences with China. 
The United States, however, has kept its sanctions against 
China in place. Both China and the United States have begun to 
move toward improving relations following Sino-U.S. summit talks 
in November 1993, but there has been no change in the U.S. 
attitude toward China. The Chinese side believes that as long 
as forces that loathe the dictatorship of the Communist Party 
are active in the United States, U.S. policy toward China will 
continue to waver. 
  As an Asian and Pacific nation, China places the greatest 
importance on relations with Japan and the United States. It is 
quite natural for China to attach importance to Japan while its 
relations with the United States remain unstable. China is 
seeking more aggressive cooperation from Japan. A Chinese 
source said: "It is not good for China to stay in the same 
place indefinitely." 
  China hopes Japan will distance itself from the United 
States 
and adopt its own foreign policy. Both Japan and China have a 
common interest in the stability of Asia. China believes its 
best bet at the moment is to emphasize the importance of 
cooperation with Japan. 
  An example is North Korea's suspected nuclear development. 
China's position is that "North Korea's military strength poses 
no threat to Japan, the United States or South Korea, and China 
will seek to settle the issue through dialogue rather than risk 
the danger of war on the Korean peninsula by joining the United 
States in threatening North Korea." China asserts its position 
is in the interests of all Asian nations, including Japan. 
  China hopes for economic cooperation from Japan and this is 
a 
primary factor in its policy of promoting relations with Japan. 
Japan's aid and investment, including its transfer of high 
technology to China, are indispensable for the development of 
China's economy, energy and infrastructure, such as railroads 
and irrigation. China needs Japan's know-how to promote its 
market economy. China is seeking Japanese cooperation in 
gaining the membership of GATT. 
  China believes both China and Japan need to understand each 
other more deeply and this is another reason for China 
approaching Japan. In the past few years, awareness has grown in 
Japan of the threat from China. 
  With China's economy growing rapidly, China has been 
modernizing its military and paying attention to the sea, 
thereby heightening awareness among Asian nations of the threat 
of China. Japan has pointed out its concern over China's 
military buildup at every opportunity and linked its aid to 
China's military buildup. China has tried to allay concerns 
about China's military buildup, citing the low level of China's 
military spending. 
  There is also the issue of Taiwan. A high-ranking official 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry visited 
Taiwan last year. China reacted by expressing concern over the 
visit. 
  China is increasingly jittery about the issue of Taiwan. 
Taiwan is moving toward becoming an independent nation and the 
United States has continued to sell weapons to Taiwan. In 
addition, Taiwan and the ASEAN are making conspicuous 
rapprochement. If the United States and the ASEAN support 
Taiwan's position, it would become a major stumbling block to 
the reunification of China. As China sees it, it is necessary 
to drive a wedge between the United States and ASEAN. 
  China is concerned that if China and Japan do not deepen 
each other's understanding of the issue, it will destroy the 
foundation of Japan-China relations. China believes the two 
countries need to hold more discussions to that end. 
  While China thinks there are some outstanding issues with 
Japan, it feels friendly toward Japan. 
  One of the reasons for China feeling friendly toward Japan 
is 
Prime Minister Hosokawa's attitude toward Asian nations. During 
his visit to South Korea, the prime minister expressed the 
forthright remorse for Japan's war of aggression that China has 
long sought. 
  China sees the Chinese and Japanese as Orientals. The 
Chinese leadership appears to be a little weary of U.S. attacks 
on China's abuse of human rights. China firmly believes it is 
Japan that fully understands China's assertion that "China needs 
stability." 
  China has remained silent about the breakdown of the 
framework talks at the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. China 
appears to be appraising Japan's action in its heart. A Chinese 
official expressed sympathy to Japan, saying, "The United States 
is adopting a heavy-handed method in the economic field." China 
appears to be hastily analyzing how the breakdown of the 
framework talks will affect Japan-U.S. relations, Japan-China 
relations, and China-U.S. relations.

This meeting will follow on directly from a meeting of the 
homologous European (Community) (EC)-China Committee. On 
Wednesday, before the latter dispersed, the Belgian delegation 
contacted observers at the meeting (which was chaired by 
European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan -- BELGA editor's note) 
with a view to taking its bearings. Generally speaking, during 
the BLEU-China trade negotiations which will start this Thursday 
with an interview with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, 
Minister Urbain intends to align his position with that of the 
EC in all areas, including that concerning the normalization of 
human rights. 
  Cooperation between Europe and China is still governed by an 
economic and trade cooperation agreement revised in 1985, which 
aims at increasing reciprocal imports at the market price in 
priority sectors (mining, energy, transport, telecommunications, 
technology -- BELGA editor's note). European-Chinese 
cooperation was brutally interrupted in June 1989 (Tien An Men 
-- BELGA editor's note) and gradually built up again in 1991. 
Their full normalization remains subordinate to progress on the 
question of human rights, and two "sanctions" are theoretically 
still in application (meaning no visits by heads of state, a 
provision which has not in fact been respected, and the 
interruption of military cooperation and arms sales -- BELGA 
editor's note). [passage omitted] 
  The essential precondition imposed by Europe with a view to 
achieving full normalization and, above all, supporting China's 
request with a view to its full and complete reintegration into 
GATT as from 1996, concerns the accelerated emergence of a real 
market economy, especially through adaptation of the Chinese tax 
system (a single VAT [value added tax] of 17 percent has just 
been adopted, but many hindrances remain at the level of the 
cooperation from one day to the next with European companies, 
e.g., the virtual doubling of the price of services since the 
start of 1994 -- BELGA editor's note), abandoning all dumping 
practices, and endeavoring hard to integrate environmental, 
safety, and hygiene standards into economic trade in general, as 
well as increased respect for intellectual property rights.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "China/Italy: Spadolini Visits </F>
Shanghai"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (ANSA) -- Shanghai, symbol of 
China's remarkable recent economic and industrial growth, means 
to step up trading ties with Italy, Senate Speaker Giovanni 
Spadolini was told today by the chairman of the permanent 
committee of the local people's assembly, Ye Gongqi, and city 
mayor Huang Jin. 
  The two officials illustrated the recent successes of a city 
that now boasts some 12 million inhabitants and is considered 
the financial and industrial capital of China, lying at the 
centre of a region that has regularly notched up some of the 
world's highest economic growth rates in recent years. 
  For the future, they mapped out programmes for the special 
economic zone of Pudong, where Italy had already pledged cash 
and expertise for major infrastructure developments. 
  Senator Spadolini, who will tomorrow complete the Chinese 
tour he has undertaken at the invitation of the National 
People's Assembly, today also visited Shanghai's Academy of 
Social Sciences. 
  After his meeting with Mayor Huang Jin -- with whom he also 
examined ways of extending political and cultural co-operation 
between Italy and China -- Spadolini visited the diocesan 
seminary at Sheshan and met the bishop of Shanghai Aloisius Jin, 
with whom he had a wide-ranging discussion of the situation of 
Catholics in China and the possibility of normalisation. 
  In Beijing previously, the Senate Speaker had long talks 
with 
Bishop Michele Fu Tie Shan on the same issues.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Feb -- China's strongman Deng Xiaoping 
(aged 89) is apparently suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
Various sources of information available in Beijing on Deng's 
physical condition all essentially agree on this point. There 
are even reports circulating that say the Chinese leader, 
appreciating his deteriorating physical condition, has given up 
the idea of visiting Hong Kong, which will be returned to China 
in three-and-a-half years. 
  Parkinson's disease is a nervous disorder that is marked by 
such characteristics as sluggish movement and rigidity of the 
whole body, and for which there is reportedly no cure. The 
disease rarely leads to sudden death among sufferers but they 
are, however, very susceptible to complications. 
  Deng's physical condition, such as his trembling hands, were 
noted in a television broadcast which showed him meeting 
delegates to the CPC convention in October 1992. People in 
Beijing, however, were even more startled when they saw how far 
his condition had deteriorated during his appearance on a 
television newscast on 9 February, the eve of the Spring 
Festival (Chinese New Year). 
  It is said that Deng's dream is to visit Hong Kong in July 
1997 when it is returned to China. Deng himself, however, has 
reportedly acknowledged that this has become seemingly 
impossible. When Deng was 86, he said: "To live past 90 is 
victory." This coming August, Deng will celebrate his 90th 
birthday.

<F P=106> [By Takuro Noguchi of the Shanghai Bureau; first paragraph </F>
is an introduction] 
  [Text] It is said that Deng Xiaoping's 9 February TV 
appearance has been videotaped in advance. What is he going to 
say? Top government leaders seem to be in great fear now. And 
in case no appearance is made, stock prices in Hong Kong would 
fall drastically. 
  The night view from the rotating restaurant on the 41st 
floor 
of the New Jinjiang Hotel, a top-class hotel in central 
Shanghai, is certainly excellent. 
  WEN WEI PO, the Chinese-affiliated Hong Kong paper, 
published 
an exclusive report in its 10 January issue on a visit to this 
hotel by Deng Xiaoping, China's strongest man, on New Year's Day. 
  Chinese newspapers and TV have never reported such doings of 
Deng. In this connection, I promptly took action to confirm 
this report. While saying he was told to keep it secret, a 
hotel employee said excitedly: "Yes, I did see him. They was 
sitting near the window, enjoying both French cuisine and the 
night view." 
  It has become an established custom for Deng to greet the 
Spring Festival (the Lunar New Year which falls on 10 February 
this year) in Shanghai for the past seven years. 
<H5>  "For Further Emancipating the Mind" </H5>
  Deng's appearance at the New Year's party televised on 
Spring 
Festival eve has become the only chance to confirm the health of 
the key person who controls China, which has a population of 1.2 
billion. 
  Moreover, his remarks in Shanghai, known as the "Shanghai 
Talks," have become more influential than the Constitution. 
  Regarding his recent arrival in Shanghai, I have obtained 
information, from "a source," that "he had arrived in Shanghai 
10 December (last year)." In mid-December, there appeared in 
the city a large board, 4 meters wide by 3 meters long, which 
says: "Development Conforms Well to Reason -- Deng Xiaoping." 
  The board was put up on a major street about 500 meters from 
the Xijiao Hotel, where Deng Xiaoping regularly stays. This 
street leads to the Pudong Development Area, which is under 
development based on the national policy and where Deng Xiaoping 
has visited several times for inspections. 
  The Xijiao Hotel, located not far from the Shanghai Airport, 
is usually available for foreigners. You will see hotel 
buildings and restaurants here and there in a large area. When 
I tried to enter this area by car, I was stopped by a policeman, 
who said: "Under construction now. It is off limits until the 
end of the Spring Festival." 
  In replying to my question as to whether Mr. Deng is staying 
there, he smilingly said: "I cannot answer your question." 
There is no mistake about his staying there. 
  A company clerk, who is 42 years old and belongs to the Red 
Guards generation of the Great Cultural Revolution, said: 
"During the Great Cultural Revolution, schools were closed and 
the Chinese people tried to kill one another. We were fed up 
with it. Thanks to Deng Xiaoping, our livelihood has become 
better. I hope he will live long." As his remarks indicate, 
Deng Xiaoping enjoys high appraisal among Shanghai citizens. 
  So far, Shanghai has paid taxes to the central government. 
However, the city could do nothing about its basic investment in 
improving its infrastructure. And it was Deng Xiaoping who gave 
the go-ahead for the projects, which cost huge amounts of money 
and based on the national program. 
  For Deng Xiaoping, Shanghai is filled with personal 
memories. 
He spends Spring Festival in Shanghai because it is warmer than 
Beijing and also because he wants to pick out talented people 
who are qualified to work in the central government. 
  Both state President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji, 
who has been entrusted with the responsibility of managing 
economic affairs, have obtained their rather unusual promotions 
because of their administrative abilities while serving as 
Shanghai mayor. 
  JIEFANG RIBAO, the municipal Communist Party committee 
organ, 
frontpaged an article entitled "For Further Emancipating the 
Mind" in its 13 January issue. There is no mistake that this 
article states principles based on a good understanding of 
Deng's ideas. 
  The vice premier and others are making efforts to put the 
brakes on the over-heated enthusiasm in economic activities. 
What will become of their efforts after this year's "Shanghai 
Talks" have been delivered? 
  Attention is now concentrated on the Spring Festival party 
on 
the evening of 9 February. To tell the truth, I have obtained 
unconfirmed information that those scenes to be shown on TV 
"have already been videotaped." 
  As for this party's location, it is a secret that has never 
been announced in the past. 
  Reportedly, a visitor to a certain hotel in the city, but 
not 
the Xijiao Hotel, said he saw a lady who looks very much like 
Xiao Rong, Deng Xiaoping's third daughter. Xiao Rong has acted 
as sort of a "hearing aid" for her father, who has become hard 
of hearing. 
  Construction work is now under way at this hotel for 
remodeling the entrance and the construction is expected to be 
completed before the Spring Festival. There is a great 
possibility that the party will be held at this hotel.

<F P=106> [By Miwa Shimizu] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan -- According to a reliable source 
here, the National Propaganda Work Conference now in session in 
Beijing announced a policy of prohibiting the use of the 
expression "speeding up the reform and open-door policy" in 
slogans in the future and of restricting news media reporting on 
inflation and increasing debts of state-owned enterprises. From 
the fact that the conference insisted on a need to ensure social 
stability while pursuing reform and economic development, this 
is considered a measure to prevent media reports from causing 
social unrest. 
  However, the decision to ban the use of the slogan comes as 
a 
surprise to large sectors because it was a slogan announced by 
the supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, during his visit to south 
China in February, 1992. This visit is known to have become the 
starting point of the current high economic growth. 
  Besides the ban on use of the slogan, the source said the 
conference released the policy on banning media reports which 1) 
can incite public apprehensions about inflation; 2) play up 
increasing debts of state-owned enterprises; and 3) point out 
problems with economic development of coastal areas or criticize 
growing gaps in regional economy and personal income. 
  Since late last year, media have reported much about the 
possibility of large-scale economic reform being launched this 
year, thus causing public apprehensions about inflation, 
panicking people into hoarding foodstuffs and thus causing price 
hikes. The source said these measures are a product from this 
experience. 
  Premier Li Peng spoke on the current economic situation at 
the conference, and said: "While paying attention to both 
favorable and unfavorable conditions existing in our economy, we 
should promote economic reform at an appropriate pace but in an 
positive way." Furthermore, he indicated that the economic 
growth for this year will be set at around 9 percent as was 
decided at the State Council's Economic Work Conference held at 
the end of 1993. 
  Since the nation achieved an economic growth of 13 percent 
in 
the past two consecutive years, however, there are strong 
complaints among local CPC cadre members about this as in seen 
in a remark by a Beijing cadre member who charged setting the 
goal at 9 percent "is extremely conservative." Even Deng 
Xiaoping is said to be unhappy about it.

<F P=106> [By Kazuo Kojima; from MAINICHI SHIMBUN 8 February Morning </F>
Edition] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 7 Feb -- Dalai Lama XIV, Nobel Peace 
Prize awardee (for 1989) and supreme leader of Tibetan Buddhism, 
gave an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN deputy chief editor, 
Masato Kitamura, in New Delhi on 7 February. During the 
interview, the Dalai Lama -- stressing a realistic line -- said 
that complete independence for Tibet has become quite 
impossible, and the future of Tibet lies in the federation of a 
Tibetan autonomous government with the PRC Government. It will 
be interesting to see how the Chinese government will react to 
the Dalai Lama's proposal for an autonomous Tibetan government 
and federation. 
  The Dalai Lama stated, "The autonomous government delegates 
its powers in relation to foreign policy and defense to China." 
He disclosed that China has already been unofficially informed 
of this plan. He also indicated that officials of the Tibetan 
government in exile have been making behind-the-scenes contacts 
with the Chinese leadership, and certain developments can be 
expected in the near future. 
  However, regarding the frequent anti-China demonstrations in 
the Tibet Autonomous Region presently under PRC rule, the Dalai 
Lama said this is "a reflection of serious violations of human 
rights." He urged Western nations to continue to pay serious 
attention to the violations of human rights occurring in Tibet. 
  Furthermore, the Dalai Lama expressed serious concern about 
the environmental problem in Tibet, claiming that due to the 
Chinese government's program for rapid economic development in 
the Tibet Autonomous Region, there has been serious erosion of 
top soil, and large scale destruction of the natural 
environment. Linpoche [name as published], vice chairman of the 
Tibetan Parliament in exile, who was also present at the 
interview, criticized the PRC Government's deforestation. He 
said the total area of forest in Tibet, which was 220,000 square 
km in 1949, had diminished to 130,000 square km in 1985, and 
this continues to decrease. 
  The Dalai Lama also strongly protested China's "cultural 
genocide," claiming Tibetan culture, which has a history of its 
own centering on Buddhism, is deteriorating gradually owing to 
the PRC Government's uniform school education in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region.

as delegation chief) currently visiting China on 22 February. 
During the meeting, Hu commented on Tibetan spiritual leader 
Dalai Lama XIV's recent proposal for a federation between the 
Chinese Government and a Tibetan autonomous government. Hu 
indicated that "the Dalai Lama has only changed his approach on 
the issue. There is no change in his basic stand." Thus, he 
disclosed that there is no change in China's stand of rejecting 
dialogue with the Dalai Lama.

<F P=106> [By Katsuhiko Iino] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar -- Frequent changes among senior 
officers of the Chinese armed forces have become noteworthy. 
Since the Party Congress held in the fall of 1992, reshuffling 
has been conducted off and on. However, nearly 100 
general-class senior officers were reshuffled at a time at the 
end of last year, and the majority of top leaders at both the 
military headquarters and seven military regions have been 
relieved over the past year. Compared with past years, the 
age-limit system is now being implemented in a more strict way. 
At the same time, efforts are now being made to avoid abrupt 
promotions in leadership rejuvenation so that personnel affairs 
can be dealt with in a normal way. In view of the post-Deng 
Xiaoping age, efforts have been made to make a shift from the 
"rule of man" to the "rule of law" so as to strengthen the 
civilian leadership of Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary who is 
concurrently chairman of the Central Military Commission. 
  In the reshuffling in late 1993, three leaders of the major 
military regions retired. They are: Wang Chengbin, commander 
of the Beijing Military Region; Song Keda, political commissar 
of the Shenyang Military Region, and Liu Anyuan, political 
commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. As a result, 
commanders and political commissars born before 1928 were all 
eliminated. The People's Liberation Army [PLA] enacted a 
regulation setting the retirement age of cadres of the major 
military regions at 65 in principle. The recent personnel 
actions applied this principle strictly. 
  On the other hand, 58-year-old Li Xinliang, political 
commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, is the youngest among 
those recently promoted. Compared with General Liu Jingsong's 
promotion to commander of the Shenyang Military Region in 1985, 
when he was 52 years old, efforts at rejuvenation seem to have 
slowed down. The recent moves seem aimed at shortening the 
period cadres stay at one post, and "preventing specific cadres 
from gaining strong power in a specific locality or 
organization." (according to a military source) 
  However, there has been active promotion of younger men to 
the no. 2 positions, and below. According to the military 
source, a typical example is the case of He Pengfei, son of the 
late Marshal He Long, who assumed the post of deputy commander 
of the Navy in late 1992, when he was still 48 years old. 
  PLA observers regard the transfer of Major General Zhang 
Gong, who served as the spokesman of the martial law forces 
during the Tiananmen indicent in 1989, from the position of 
political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region to that of 
political commissar of the Academy of Military Sciences as most 
noteworthy. Zhang had just moved from the Beijing Military 
Region in late 1992. He has been "demoted" (according to the 
military source) twice during a period of more than one year. 
  Zhang has been known to be close to Yang Baibing, member of 
the CPC Political Bureau (formerly secretary general of the CPC 
Central Military Commission). Yang became very powerful after 
the Tiananmen incident, but fell from grace in the PLA in late 
1992. Zhang's transfer is regarded as a symbolic personnel 
action to do away with memories of the Tiananmen incident and 
Yang's influence. However, the prevailing view is: the fact 
that Zhang is still nominally kept in a senior position shows 
that overtly factional appointments are still being avoided. 
  Many also see these recent personnel changes as a major 
attempt to strengthen discipline in the military. A concerned 
source cites the following as the basis for this view: 1) 
Lieutenant General Wang Ruilin, a close confidant of paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping and incumbent secretary of the Commission 
for Discipline Inspection, also took up the position of deputy 
director of the General Political Department in early 1993; 2) 
the chief procurator of the Military Procuratorate was changed 
in late 1992; and 3) JIEFANGJUN BAO carries many articles 
warning against commercial activities of military personnel.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan -- China has decided to develop and 
build a new-model jet fighter by the end of this century. This 
was disclosed recently by Zhu Yuli, president of the China 
Aircraft Industry Corporation. According to a Chinese military 
source, the new-model jet fighter to be developed has been named 
"Super 7." China is said to plan to use in principle technology 
it has obtained from Soviet-built MiG fighters, but it intends 
to introduce Western state-of-the art technology to develop it. 
The new-model jet fighter will be developed under the "Takeoff 
Plan" the corporation has drawn up as a long-term strategy 
through the end of this century. The plan calls for the 
production of both military and civilian aircraft. According to 
ZHONGGUO HANGKKONG BAO [the China Aviation Newspaper], the plan 
calls for 1) developing China's capability to develop and 
manufacture turbo jet engines for use in military aircraft; 2) 
creating a research and development system to build helicopters 
domestically; 3) aggressively importing loading equipment, 
particularly electronics technology, and 4) developing China's 
capability to design and build a large-type airliner. 
  According to the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, China built a total of 
256 aircraft in 1993, an increase of 24 percent from a year 
earlier. The production of aircraft engines grew 27 percent 
while the production of missiles increased 53.9 percent. China's 
aircraft trade in the year amounted to approximately $1 billion 
with imports standing at $850 million. The "Takeoff Plan" 
envisions China's aircraft trade at $3 billion in the year 2000.

  [Text] Geneva, March 4 (XINHUA) -- The Commission on Human 
Rights of the United Nations today calls on the international 
community to condemn those countries using unilateral mandatory 
measures to put pressure on the developing countries. 
  A resolution, adopted by the commission at its 50th meeting, 
said that all countries should refrain from taking any 
unilateral mandatory measures that run counter to the 
international laws and the U.N. Charter. 
  Such measures not only impede trade among countries, but 
also 
hinder the full realization of the rights specified in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said the resolution 
proposed by Cuba, China, Ghana and the Sudan. 
  The commission condemns some countries for using their 
economic supremacy and continuing to take unilateral mandatory 
measures, such as trade sanction, blockade, embargo and asset 
freezing, to prevent the developing countries from exercising 
their rights to establish their political, economic and social 
systems and expand international trade. 
  The resolution, adopted by 23 votes in favor and 18 against, 
was supported mostly by the developing countries and opposed by 
the United States and other Western developed countries.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The European 
Community's aid project of dairy products to China had made 
"satisfactory progress" and constituted a successful model in 
E.C.-China cooperation, Pierre Duchateau, ambassador of the E.C. 
commission to China, said. 
  Duchateau made the comment at a meeting reviewing the 
progress of the three-year project, which began in 1988, and 
making arrangements to strive for a similar second-phase aid 
project. 
  The E.C.-sponsored dairy products operation is the largest 
aid project that China has ever accepted in the agricultural 
field. As a result, the supply of dairy products in 20 major 
Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and 
Guangzhou, has shown marked improvement. 
  Ambassador Duchateau described the project as having made 
the 
ties of E.C.-China cooperation closer and having laid a sound 
foundation for a second-phase aid project in the same field, 
which he believed will continue.

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- The 10th Asian 
Parliamentarians' Meeting on Population and Development (APPD) 
closed here today. 
  The meeting has further promoted mutual understanding and 
friendship among the participants from 15 countries including 
China after their discussions on issues of population and 
development and women's position and role. 
  Fukusaburo Maeda, chairman of the Asian population and 
development association, described the two-day meeting as 
significant. 
  He said that in September this year, the Third International 
Conference on Population and Development will be held in Cairo, 
at which a policy on population is expected to be approved. 
  He expressed the hope that this policy will become a program 
for actions of all countries in the next 20 years. 
  Hao Yichun, deputy head of the delegation of China's 
National 
People's Congress (NPC) and vice-chairman of the NPC Education, 
Science, Culture and Public Health Committee, said with the 
common efforts by the Asian parliamentarians, the meeting has 
achieved a complete success. 
  Noting that Asia is the most populous region in the world, 
Hao said the solution of the Asian population problem will be of 
great importance to peace, prosperity and development of Asia 
and the rest of the world. 
  She said many Asian countries have already adopted proper 
measures to reduce the birth rate and have achieved significant 
results. 
  However, Hao said the trend of rapid population growth has 
not yet been checked and the task of improving the quality of 
human resources is still arduous. 
  The solution of population problems requires the common 
efforts from Asian parliaments, governments, non-governmental 
organizations as well as the people from every Asian country, 
she added. 
  After the meeting Fukusaburo Maeda and leaders from the 
Asian 
forum and the UN Population Fund gave a press conference and 
answered questions on cooperation between China and the UN 
Population Fund.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- An international 
symposium on the Global Energy and Water Circulation Experiment 
(GEWEX) was held here today at Beijing University. 
  More than 100 experts and scholars from China, Japan, Russia 
and other countries and regions attended the meeting. 
  GEWEX is the largest global environmental science experiment 
as the turn of the century approaches, and the experiment in the 
Asian monsoon area (GAME) has become one of the five largest 
trans-continental experiments in the world. 
  Participants in the symposium will exchange scientific 
information about the progress of GEWEX, discuss relevant 
international cooperative projects and coordinate the activities 
of GEWEX and GAME in Asia. 
  China and Japan have cooperated successfully on the projects 
over the past few years, especially in the experiments in the 
northwestern Pacific Ocean, according to Zhao Bolin, an 
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a professor 
of Beijing University. 
  The two countries will continue their cooperation and 
conduct 
intensive observations in the Huaihe River in east China's Anhui 
Province, he added.

  [Text] Jakarta, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Siladjzic expressed the hope that Indonesia will provide 
full and ceaseless support to Bosnia as the chairman of the 
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). 
  The Bosnian prime minister, who arrived here today to start 
a 
two-day official visit to Indonesia, told the press that 
Indonesia in its capacity as the NAM chairman would exert more 
political influence on the United Nations (UN) in an effort to 
create peace and sovereignty in the war-torn Bosnia. 
  He noted that Bosnia was convinced that NAM could voice its 
supports and play its active roles in the UN. 
  He pointed out that the future developments in Bosnia would 
depend on the UN agreement. He also hoped that the countries 
which had so far supported Bosnia in the UN would maintain their 
supports. 
  During his stay, he will discuss with the Indonesian side 
the 
latest development about the Washington Accord, and the future 
steps to be taken by Bosnia. 
  The Bosnian prime minister said that the diplomatic ties 
between Bosnia and Indonesia will be established soon at the 
right time. 
  Siladjzic arrived from Washington and was met at the 
Sukarno-Hatta airport by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas 
and Chief Executive Assistant to the NAM Chairman Nana Sutresna. 
  He told the press about the recent peace talks between 
Bosnia 
and Croatia held in Washington. Both sides agreed to form a 
framework for the establishment of a federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Sarajevo, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb warplanes 
bombed the northern Muslim enclave of Maglaj Sunday [6 March], 
Sarajevo Radio reported. 
  The radio said the air raids occurred at 5:00 A.M. (0400 
GMT) 
and a second at 10:15 A.M.. 
  Earlier last week, NATO jet fighters shot down four Serb 
warplanes on a similar sortie. 
  However, the radio did not give details of casualties. 
  U.N. officials in Zagreb said they had "no information" on 
any Serb air attack, and there was no immediate response from 
NATO. 
  Maglaj has been besieged by the Serbs for eight months and 
its residents are said to be living in appalling conditions.

Rights"] 
  [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong Branch 
deputy director; aide to the director Chen Fengying; and 
National People's Congress Deputy Cheng Yiu-tong yesterday (6th) 
held that China's earlier handling of Wei Jingsheng and others 
was strictly in accordance with Chinese legal procedures. They 
were not worried that Most-Favored-Nation [MFN] status would 
thereby be affected and believed that the United States should 
not link these two issues. 
  Zheng Guoxiong was asked at a Shunde City Investment Project 
Fair to comment on the legal actions concerning Wei Jingsheng 
shortly before U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's visit to 
China. He said that the Chinese Ministry of Justice had handled 
the relevant problems according to state laws and that it was 
entirely China's internal affair. He held that China has always 
opposed Western countries imposing their views and human rights 
standards on China and that the actions of the Chinese Ministry 
of Justice should not affect China's MFN status. 
  When attending a Kun Tong District Basic Law Promotion 
Carnival, Chen Fengying said that the United States should not 
talk about the law-enforcement actions of the Ministry of 
Justice and China's MFN status in the same breath, because 
countries would do anything they thought they should according 
to law. MFN status is a problem of trade and mutual economic 
benefits between China and the United States and should not be 
linked to human rights problems. 
  She pointed out that the human rights problems contained in 
U.S. accusations were also seen in the United States, some being 
even more serious than in other countries. She did not believe 
that the United States set human rights conditions when dealing 
with trading or other types of relations with other countries. 
Therefore, she believed that it was inappropriate for the 
United States to set human rights conditions when discussing MFN 
status with China. 
  Cheng Yiu-tong, who was also present on the same occasion, 
argued that: China detained the persons concerned before the 
visit of the American officials merely in accordance with its 
own legal procedures. This fact reflects that China will not 
yield to the pressure exerted by the United States under the 
pretext of its human rights. In fact, China has also improved 
greatly on the human rights issue in the past few years. 
  Regarding the question that the United States will first 
have 
to ascertain China's human rights status before considering 
granting it MFN status, Cheng Yiu-tong said: This shows that 
the United States confuses economics and politics over this 
question. China's reaction clearly tells the United States that 
China will make no compromise on these questions of principle 
and that China will handle relevant questions in accordance with 
its own legal procedures.

  [Text] Washington, March 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's top White House legal counsel Bernard Nussbaum 
resigned here today. 
  Nussbaum, a 57-year old New Yorker, said in a letter to 
President Clinton that his resignation would take effect April 5 
to assist the President "in arranging for an orderly transition 
in the counsel's office," White House sources said. 
  In a letter of reply, Clinton said that he accepted 
Nussbaum's resignation "with deep regret" and praised his 
efforts, the sources said. 
  But reports showed that the President in recent days made no 
effort to defend his counsel against mounting criticism from 
U.S. Congress and federal officials investigating an Arkansas 
real estate project which has links with the Clintons. 
  The lawyer's resignation is viewed here as a casualty of 
turmoil over the Clinton administration's handling of questions 
related to the real estate project. 
  The White House lawyer told President Clinton about his 
decision to resign late Friday night as he and five other senior 
White House officials were subpoenaed by the special legal 
counsel, Robert Fiske, investigating the project. 
  President Clinton met with Nussbaum in the Oval Office late 
last night. 
  The project, the Whitewater Development Corporation, was 
half 
owned by the Clintons and was connected with the failed Madison 
Guaranty Savings and Loan. 
  The failed Madison cost the U.S. taxpayers 60 million U.S. 
dollars and federal officials are investigating whether Madison 
improperly diverted money to Whitewater or to Clinton's 1984 
re-election campaign when he was governor of Arkansas. 
  The Clintons have denied any wrongdoing over the matter, 
saying instead that they lost 69,000 dollars on the real estate 
project in the 1980s. 
  The subpoenas have brought the Madison case directly into 
the 
White House, a bitter blow to the President and his aides. 
  The five senior White House officials who received subpoenas 
were White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, Hillary 
Clinton's Chief of Staff Margaret Williams, White House 
Communications Director Mark Gearan, Senior Adviser Bruce 
Lindsey, and Hillary Clinton's Press Secretary Lisa Caputo. 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and three of his senior 
aides also received subpoenas. 
  In addition, a second subpoena calls for the White House to 
produce all documents or memoranda on any meetings, 
conversations or contacts on Madison between any White House 
staffers and officials of Treasury Department. 
  Treasury Department officials twice informed the White House 
last fall of the status of a federal investigation into the 
failed Madison. 
  All the subpoenaed officials were ordered to appear before a 
federal grant jury in Washington on March 10 when the documents 
must also be produced to the jury.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng said 
here today that China welcomes the Merrill Lynch Group, of the 
United States, continuing to participate in the pooling of 
foreign capital for its economic construction. 
  As a financial company with world-wide experience, Merrill 
Lynch should go on providing China with assistance and advice in 
the financial sector, said Chinese Premier Li Peng. 
  He was speaking at a meeting here this morning with Daniel 
Tully, the Merrill Lynch Group's chairman and chief executive. 
  Recalling his meeting with Tully's predecessor, Williams 
Schreyer, last spring, Li noted that Merrill Lynch had done a 
lot in helping to determine China's credit rating and in its 
bonds issues on overseas markets. 
  "Much has been achieved and we are satisfied with our 
cooperation with your group," Li told the U.S. visitors. 
  People in the United States are optimistic about China's 
economic prospects, Tully said. 
  After on-the-spot investigations, Merrill Lynch concluded 
that lots of projects in China have favorable conditions to 
attract overseas investment. Merrill Lynch is willing to serve 
and advise China in sectors such as electricity and iron and 
steel. 
  Chinese Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli took part in the 
meeting. 
  Founded in 1802, Merrill Lynch is the No. 1 securities 
company in the U.S. and has been ranked on top of the world's 
stocks and bonds institutions in recent years, sources said. 
  Last year, it set up a representative office in Shanghai and 
its Beijing office is to be officially established in the near 
future.

  [Text] Washington, March 4 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton announced here today the United States would give 700 
million dollars in assistance, a major increase, to Ukraine. 
  At a joint press conference with visiting Ukrainian 
President 
Leonid Kravchuk, Clinton said the new relationship between the 
two countries would make a better future for the people of both 
nations. 
  Kravchuk, who has signed a number of accords on economic and 
trade cooperation with the U.S., said today marked a "historic 
moment" in friendly relations between Washington and Kiev. 
  Clinton praised Kiev's endorsement of the 
U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian accord signed last January on getting rid 
of the 1,800 nuclear warheads on Ukrainian soil as well as the 
first strategic arms reduction treaty. 
  The U.S. President also expressed the hope that the 
Ukrainian 
parliament would eventually approve the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  He welcomed Ukraine's commitment to comprehensive market 
reforms as well as Kiev's agreement to join NATO's Partnership 
for Peace Program last month. 
  Kravchuk, whose country is now experiencing an economic 
crisis, brought an entourage of high-ranking officials including 
the ministers for foreign affairs, defense, economics on the 
current official visit. 
  At the core of the talks between the two leaders were 
economic matters, which apparently is the main purpose of 
Kravchuk's visit. 
  Clinton also promised today to press for economic aid from 
other Western countries and lending agencies to Ukraine. 
  Besides meeting with U.S. officials, Kravchuk will also be 
seeing officials from the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank on outside economic assistance. 
  Kravchuk leaves for New York Saturday for a meeting with 
U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and to attend the opening 
of Ukraine's general consulate.

  [Text] Moscow, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin today stressed the urgent need to maintain stability, 
order and unity in Russia. 
  Addressing an extended meeting of the Russian Government, 
the 
president said, "this is particularly necessary in the present 
situation over which the danger of confrontation is looming." 
  He was referring to the recent amnesty decision made by the 
State Duma, or Lower House of the Russian Parliament, under 
which former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former 
Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov were freed last Saturday 
[26 February] from Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. 
  He said he is "fully aware of the contradictory nature of 
the 
decision made by State Duma and the haste with which it was 
fulfilled." 
  The president stressed that he "believed and continue to 
believe that the constitution, the law and moral norms were 
violated." He warned the the amnesty could lead to 
confrontation again. 
  "Russia is different today," Yeltsin said, "it has a 
constitution and peaceful potential for resolving its problems." 
  The meeting, attended by government ministers, leaders of 
state executive bodies, Parliament chamber speakers and local 
leaders, is being held in the Kremlin to discuss the economic 
performances last year and the reform tasks for this year.

  [Text] Moscow, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin today urged the Russian Government to deepen the 
economic reform underway in the country in a way causing less 
costs. 
  Speaking at the extended meeting of the cabinet in the 
Kremlin, Yeltsin described as "wrong" the slogan of "reform the 
economy at any cost." The people may reject a huge-burden 
reform, the president pointed out. 
  The meeting is attended by government ministers, leaders of 
state committees and other federal executive bodies, as well as 
Parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local 
governments. 
  The meeting's focus is to discuss economic performances in 
1993 and reform tasks for this year. 
  "The government is facing most complicated tasks," said 
Yeltsin. 
  As to the strikes in the coal-mining regions, the president 
said, "it is inadmissible to delay the payment of wages for 
several months. I am closely watching the developments and the 
position of the labor unions." 
  "Of course, emergency decisions will be made, but let those 
who delay the payment for coal and the payment of wages be the 
first to shoulder the responsibility," he said. 
  The president also stressed the need to curb the growing 
inflation rate, and deepen reforms in the industrial, 
agricultural and financial spheres.

  [Text] Moscow, March 4 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin 
today underlined the main tasks facing the Russian Government, 
stressing the urgent need for energetic reform of the country's 
economic mechanism. 
  "The economic situation remains complicated this year, and 
the social and political conditions are quite tough," Yeltsin 
told an extended government meeting in the Kremlin. 
  He pointed out that the government already has the (reform) 
program that it adopted last August but it needs to be specified 
and implemented. 
  "We need a policy oriented towards the future and it is 
wrong 
to call for reforms that are too costly and burdensome for 
people to tolerate," Yeltsin said. 
  The president stressed that the main government action 
should 
be to forge an energetic transformation of the economic 
mechanism and it should shoulder the bulk of the problems as 
before. 
  He described the privatization program, which started last 
year, as the major item of the reform package and stressed that 
it must be completed "as scheduled and without hindrances". 
  "It is necessary, therefore, to create a legal framework and 
organizational mechanism to attract resources through 
investments by domestic and foreign businessmen for a 
technological renewal of production", he said. 
  The president also said that priorities should be given to 
curbing inflation, taxation, payment and banking system reforms 
as well as agricultural reforms which included ensuring the 
rights of private landowners. 
  He went on: "The government is prepared to usher in radical 
reforms this year into the system of management of state-owned 
enterprises, or, to be more exact, create it a new, from 
scratch." 
  The president's statement made clear that the 
demonopolization of the Russian economy will take time. 
  "This is why preventive measures are particularly important 
to block the formation of new monopoly structures," he 
explained. 
  Stressing the need for the effective mechanism of state 
supervision, Yeltsin said that a draft civil code for Russia and 
other priority draft bills will be submitted to the State Duma 
(lower house of parliament) in the near future. 
  "Their promulgation into law will lay a firm legal basis for 
the market economy and help Russian enterprises establish a firm 
footing," the president said. 
  Commenting on the coal-mine strikes, Yeltsin said: "It is 
inadmissible to delay the payment of wages for several months. 
I am closely watching the developments and the position of the 
labor unions."

  [Text] Moscow, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed today the need to continue a market 
economy reform in the country and follow through President 
Yeltsin's plans. 
  At an extended meeting of the cabinet in the Kremlin, the 
cabinet chief said that although a market economy already 
existed in Russia it needed to progress, taking into account the 
fundamental differences in the economic and political situation 
which have been created since the beginning of 1994. "We must 
pay attention to the lessons learned from the government's 
mistakes and earlier programs," he added. 
  President Boris Yeltsin told the meeting that Russia's 
economic situation will remain complicated this year and social 
and political conditions quite tough. "The government is 
facing very complicated challenges." he said. 
  The meeting, attended by cabinet members, leaders of the 
state executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers and local 
leaders, was called to discuss the economic situation in the 
country and plan this year's government reform tasks. 
  Chernomyrdin said he fully agreed with Yeltsin's objective 
of 
strengthening the Russian state as defined in his state of 
nation message to Parliament last Thursday [24 February]. 
  He described it as the basis for continuing reform which 
would put an end to the crisis by restructuring the economy and 
creating conditions for economic, political and social stability. 
  "We see no possible grounds for radical changes in the 
course 
we are pursuing. The government will take guidance from the 
program adopted last August and approved by the president, we 
shall stick to this program and implement it no matter how 
difficult it maybe, " Chernomyrdin stated.

to the development of relations with China and that a great 
potential exists for the development of trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries. In recent years, (Beg 
Berguinov) continued, the commodity turnover of both countries 
has increased rapidly. In 1992 it was $360 million and in 1993 
it had increased to $434 million. In forecasting the prospects 
for trade and economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and China, 
(Beg Berguinov) expressed the hope that major Chinese companies 
and industrial enterprises will invest in Kazakhstan's 
manufacturing and processing sectors.

  In 1992, China and Japan marked the 20th anniversary of the 
normalization of relations between the two countries. General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan and His Majesty the 
Japanese Emperor and Her Majesty the Japanese Empress' visit to 
China in the same year indicated that Sino-Japanese relations 
have entered a new stage. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's current 
visit to Japan is another major event in Sino-Japanese relations 
since 1992. His visit attracted world wide media attention, was 
completely successful, and will have a far-reaching effect on 
future Sino-Japanese good neighborly and friendly relations, 
especially on the development of economic and trade cooperation 
between the two countries. 
<H5>  Sino-Japanese Cooperation Is the Trend of the Times </H5>
  Wherever they went, Vice Premier Zhu and his party were 
warmly welcomed by personalities of the Japanese Government and 
people from all circles. His visit created a series of climaxes 
and many touching scenes. 
  During his visit, Vice Premier Zhu met with the Japanese 
Emperor and held important talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, 
Foreign Minister Hata, and other major members of the Japanese 
Cabinet. Their talks were conducted in a friendly and harmonious 
atmosphere and the two sides had identical views on many 
important issues. Vice Premier Zhu also had very wide contacts 
with people from various circles of Japan, especially people 
from Japan's economic circles. According to incomplete 
statistics, during his more than 30 meetings in various forms 
with people from Japan's economic circles, more than 260 
well-known Japanese entrepreneurs and bankers directly conversed 
with Vice Premier Zhu, and over 1,400 people from Japan's 
economic circles attended his speech sessions. The heads of all 
major economic organizations in Tokyo and the Kansai and Kyushyu 
areas, including the major leaders of Japan's six largest 
enterprise groups -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Sanwa, 
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Banking -- exchanged views and had 
discussions with Vice Premier Zhu on the exchanges, cooperation, 
and other issues between China and Japan. They expressed great 
enthusiasm in further developing the economic, trade, 
scientific, and technological cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  From Vice Premier Zhu's current visit to Japan we can see 
that the world, especially Japan, is trying to reunderstand 
China -- a "Chinese fever" of being willing to broaden the scope 
of cooperation with China has surfaced in Japan. The surfacing 
of this fever is not an accident but a product of the 
combination of the evolution of international relations after 
the Cold War, the change in Japan's domestic situation, and 
China's dynamic economic development. Following the end of the 
Cold War, international relations, especially relations between 
big countries, are undergoing an in-depth readjustment, and 
giving priority to the economy has become an important factor 
for guiding state to state relations. Since the world entered 
the 1990's, the economies of the West have been widely in 
recession and economic friction between the United States, 
Japan, and Europe has intensified. The United States and Europe 
have jointly applied pressure on Japan, demanding that Japan 
open up its market, increase its domestic demand and imports, 
and reduce its trade surplus. Over the decades after WWII, 
based on the principle of "founding the nation on trade," Japan 
has established an export-oriented economic structure. Its 
foreign trade surplus exceeded $140 billion last year. The 
situation facing Japan this year is: the increased external 
pressure; the domestic economic decline, which has lasted 35 
months; Japanese products have been less competitive in the 
international market due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen 
and therefore, readjusting its industrial structure has become a 
pressing task. An increasing number of people of insight from 
Japan's economic circles have realized that developing 
Sino-Japanese economic, trade, scientific, and technological 
cooperation, and undergoing industrial restructuring are one of 
the important ways to free Japan from its economic predicament. 
  Explain Away the Doubts and Misgivings to Enhance 
Confidence 
  While Japan's economic circles hold favorable views on 
China's economy, some people have common doubts and misgivings 
-- such as: what if China's inflation gets out of control, 
resulting in social turbulences; what if reform encroaches on 
foreign investors' interests in China; what if the system of 
separating local tax revenues from those of the central 
government intensiflies the contradictions between the central 
authorities and local authorities; and can China's economy 
continue to develop rapidly and in a sustained and healthy 
manner. In one word, will China's reform succeed? Vice Premier 
Zhu gave pointed and unequivocal answers to aforementioned 
questions on various occasions. 
  Vice Premier Zhu said: Our reform was initiated based on 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics; under the direct leadership of 
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng; and after in-depth 
deliberation and repeated discussions pooling the wisdom of the 
whole party and nation and making use of the experiences of 
developed countries, including Japan. China's major measures 
for market economic reform have been instituted since 1 January 
this year. It is unprecedented to institute comprehensive and 
mutually supplemental financial, taxation, foreign exchange, 
investment, and enterprise reforms in a country with a 
population of nearly 1.2 billion; you can imagine the complexity 
and arduousness of this work. In Japan, it took 10 years to 
institute the consumption tax system alone; three Cabinets 
changed hands during this period. However, in China, major 
reform measures have been carried out smoothly in the past 50 
days and more; there have not been any major problems -- the 
market has been stable, social stability has been maintained, 
and the public has been assured. The central government's 
financial revenues and the country's foreign exchange reserve 
have been on the increase. All these indicate the Chinese Party 
and Government's prestige, courage, resourcefulness, and 
ability. We are determined to carry through to the end the 
reform of building a socialist market economic system. China's 
reform will triumph! 
  While speaking on the current hot issue that has drawn 
international attention -- China's inflation problem -- Vice 
Premier Zhu said: Hong Kong's inflation is still at 9 percent. 
Mainland China's inflation is not as serious as people have 
thought. From 1990 to 1992, China's inflation had been 
maintained at one digit, and it was 13 percent last year, which 
was a little too high. The main reason was that the price 
reform lifted the control over the prices of some capital goods 
that were originally under planned economic control and whose 
prices were too low. Excessive increase in the scale of capital 
construction also contributed to the increase of capital goods 
prices. We have taken measures to control the scale of the 
capital construction and have appropriately controlled the 
monetary supply. However, because more price reform measures 
will be instituted this year, this year's inflation will still 
be at about 10 percent. But we have the confidence to gradually 
lower it to one digit next year. Chinese workers' income 
increased 25 percent last year; taking the inflation into 
account, people's living standards still continued to improve 
and Chinese society is stable. 
  Vice Premier Zhu continued: This year is crucial to China's 
economic reform. Major reform measures will be launched, 
investigations and studies will be conducted in the course of 
practice, and these measures will be adjusted and improved. 
Next year the country will further adapt to the new situation 
of reform, and the year after next, China's economy will begin 
to enter the normal market economic course. He predicted that 
China's economy will continue to develop rapidly and in a 
sustained and healthy manner over a fairly long period ahead and 
its annual economic growth will be maintained at 8-9 percent. 
  Vice Premier Zhu stressed on many occasions in Japan: 
Success 
in China's economic reform will create more favorable conditions 
for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and will contribute to 
both countries' economic rejuvenation and prosperity. In 
carrying out its economic reform, China has always paid 
attention to protecting the interests of foreign investors, 
including Japanese investors, in China. 
  Vice Premier Zhu's candid, realistic, and convincing remarks 
and answers have to a large extent removed Japan's economic 
circles' doubts and misgivings about China and have enhanced 
their confidence in China's economic reform. After meeting with 
Vice Premier Zhu or after hearing his speeches, many people from 
Japan's economic circles said they believed China's economic 
reform definitely will succeed, adding that Japan's economic 
circles can feel relieved and should not hesitate to develop 
economic, trade, and technological cooperation with China. 
Fumio Sakurauchi, former speaker of Japan's Lower House and 
chairman of the Japan Trade Promotion Council, said the news 
Vice Premier Zhu brought was encouraging and was being spread 
around Japan. 
  There Is Much To Be Achieved if We Seize the 
Opportunity 
  In conversations with people from the Japanese business 
community, Vice Premier Zhu pointed out that the Chinese and 
Japanese economies are mutually complementary and both sides can 
make up each other's deficiencies. The evolving situation is 
providing a historic opportunity for mutually beneficial 
cooperation between the two countries. The fast growing Chinese 
economy needs Japan's capital and technology while Japan, which 
is undergoing the most profound post-war industrial 
restructuring, needs China's market, low-cost, high-quality 
labor forces, and abundant resources. Seizing the opportunity is 
a major challenge of profound significance facing both China and 
Japan. 
  Many people are aware of the opportunity; many in the 
Japanese business community have one question or another on 
whether and how they can utilize this opportunity. Some people 
are worried that industrial readjustment and the shift of some 
manufacturing to China will result in the "hollowing out" of 
Japan, disrupting Japan's employment and stability. Vice 
Premier Zhu hit the nail right on the head when he pointed out: 
Japan is reaping a trade surplus of over $100 billion annually. 
This situation cannot be sustained for long. High labor costs 
have resulted in Japan's gradual loss of its competitiveness in 
traditional products. Japan will lag behind and find itself in 
trouble if it does not take timely action to readjust its 
industrial structure. Some mass media in the United States have 
criticized the "hollowing out" of Japan. As a matter of fact, 
many large U.S. corporations have already readjusted their 
production structure by shifting manufacturing to China and 
Southeast Asia. They provided training to the surplus work force 
and shifted them to industries that yield a higher added value. 
The end result of this is increased international 
competitiveness of U.S. products. This is also one of the 
reasons the U.S. economy is recovering faster than others. Many 
Japanese big corporations have adopted the same strategy with 
striking results. 
  Some people are worried that technology transfers will help 
make China a competitor to Japan. Vice Premier Zhu: It's not 
true. Japan's principal way of transferring technology to China 
is joint production under the joint-venture format. Under such 
arrangements, China and Japan will become, instead of 
competitors, partners of equal and mutually beneficial 
cooperation working jointly in developing the international 
market. Many farsighted Japanese businessmen have already 
started doing so. Cooperation in the production of videotape 
recorders between China and Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Company serves as a model. Imports of Japan's technology 
accounted for 28 percent of China's total technology imports in 
1993. Kazuhira Seki, president of the well-known Isuzu Motors, 
told Vice Premier Zhu that his company has seen an improvement 
in economic returns by transferring technology and undertaking 
joint production with China. 
  Certainly, in the process of deepening Sino-Japanese 
cooperation, China and Japan will inevitably encounter some 
problems. Vice Premier Zhu believed that there are problems on 
the way to development. As China's reform moves forward with 
success, and so long as the two sides will -- on an equal and 
mutually beneficial footing -- display mutual understanding and 
accommodation and consult each other in a friendly way, problems 
can be solved without too much difficulty. 
  During his visit, Vice Premier Zhu emphasized on more than 
one occasion: The respective characteristics of the Chinese and 
Japanese economies and the favorable temporal, geographical, 
human, political, economical, and other factors are closely 
binding our two countries together. Sino-Japanese cooperation 
is taking shape like an irresistible historical tide. There are 
very bright prospects for cooperation between the two countries. 
Trade between China and Japan in 1933 was worth $39 billion, a 
record high. Vice Premier Zhu said: This is not a small 
figure. However, when compared to the potential for 
Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the figure is quite small. 
A figure ten times that would be about right. The day that 
this will be attained should not be far away and the two 
countries should make common efforts. These comments by Vice 
Premier Zhu were warmly received and struck a strong sympathetic 
chord in Japan's business community. As many friends in the 
Japanese business community told Vice Premier Zhu and his 
entourage, the business communities of China and Japan should 
join hands to seize the historic opportunity, utilize their 
potential, and pool their efforts in pioneering undertakings to 
jointly usher in a new era of Sino-Japanese relations centered 
on economic cooperation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said today that Japan would cooperate with the 
United States to settle serious trade and economic issues in the 
spirit of mutual trust. 
  In a speech on policy to the Japanese Diet (parliament), 
Hosokawa also pledged to foster forward-looking relations with 
the international community in the coming years. 
  The statement comes after the failure to reach an accord on 
trade issues in last months summit talks with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. Japan rejected U.S. demands to set numerical 
targets on the country's imports of U.S. products. 
  However, Hosokawa told the Diet that he believed Japan must 
take effective measures to achieve a highly significant decrease 
in its current account surplus over the medium term, while 
firmly adhering to free-trade principles. 
  Commenting on Sino-Japanese ties, the premier noted that the 
two countries had made major strides forward over the last 20 
years and more. 
  "I intend to work to have the cooperative relationship 
between Japan and China contribute even more to the 
international community," said Hosokawa, who is scheduled to 
visit China later this month. 
  The prime minister stressed that Japan would work to achieve 
stable and open cooperative relations with the Asian-Pacific 
region where economic development is most encouraging.

  [Text] Xian, March 6 (XINHUA) -- A contract was signed this 
morning in this capital of Shaanxi Province for a joint project 
between the Chinese Mainland, Japan and Hong Kong to produce the 
newest kind of refrigeration compression motor. 
  Experts say the motor has the features of high efficiency, 
low noise, light vibration and low energy consumption. At 
present, only a few countries have grasped such production 
know-how. 
  The three sides will invest a total of 68 million yuan 
(about 
7.82 million U.S. dollars) in the project, with the Chinese side 
offering the technology and 40 percent of the investment. 
  The technology is a one of the state key scientific research 
achievements during China's "Eighth Five-Year Plan" (1991-1995). 
It passed the state appraisal in November 1992. 
  Every year 80,000 compression motors are expected to be 
produced after completion of the production line.

  [Text] Tehran, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese and Iranian 
foreign ministers said here today that the two countries will 
further enhance cooperative relations in various fields, 
including politics, economy and trade. 
  Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen held a formal talk today with Iranian Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati. 
  The two ministers expressed their satisfaction with smooth 
development of the bilateral relations and exchanged views on 
further development of economic relations and trade between 
China and Iran. 
  Velayati said that the past few years witnessed visits of 
top 
leaders of the two countries. The visits of officials at 
different levels have also increased. The exchange of visits 
have advanced the steady development of friendly and cooperative 
relations of the two countries. 
  His Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen echoed that both China 
and Iran enjoy traditional friendship. The Chinese Government 
pays great attention to developing friendly and cooperative 
relations with Iran. 
  The Chinese foreign minister said that the bilateral 
relations have developed in a sustained and stable way in the 
past few years. The two countries share same or similar views on 
many major international issues. 
  As a result, he added, the bilateral trade has grown very 
fast and economic cooperation has been strengthened. 
  Speaking about the Afghan issue, Qian said that China is 
deeply concerned about the Afghan situation and hopes that all 
factions should avoid bloodshed and disputes and make a 
permanent cease fire as soon as possible for the sake of state 
and national interest. 
  He suggested that all groups should eliminate differences 
through negotiations and coordinations in a bid to restore peace 
and stability, realize national conciliation and reconstruct the 
country. 
  Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati said that Iran is 
concerned 
very much about the civil war in Afghanistan. U.N. mediation 
efforts have failed. It seems that the neighboring countries of 
Afghanistan should display their roles if they want to solve the 
Afghan issue. 
  As to the international situation, Qian said that different 
countries vary in political systems, economic development, 
religions, cultures and traditions. "This is the objective 
reflection of diversification of the world," he added. 
  He noted that all countries should maitain mutual respect, 
peaceful coexistence, and should not impose their own social 
system and ideology upon other countries. 
  Velayati said that Iran maintains that countries in the 
region should strengthen cooperation, handle the regional 
affairs well and oppose any interference by hegemonism and power 
politics in regional affairs.

  [Text] Following their talks in Tehran on 5 March, Qian 
Qichen, PRC State Council vice premier and foreign minister, and 
Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati affirmed that the two 
countries will further expand their mutually beneficial 
cooperation in the political, economic, and commercial spheres. 
  In the course of their talks, the two foreign ministers also 
exchanged views on the situation in Afghanistan. Qian expressed 
the hope that the Afghan groups will be able to overcome their 
differences through negotiations and consultation. Velayati 
particularly stressed that Afghanistan's neighboring countries 
should play a role in solving Afghanistan's problems. 
  Referring to the international situation, Qian said that the 
fact that the world is made up of countries that have different 
political and social systems, pursue different ways of achieving 
economic progress, and have different religious and cultural 
traditions is tangible proof that the world is not homogeneous. 
Different countries should respect each other, live in 
tranquillity and peace, and refrain from imposing their social 
systems and ideology on others. 
  Velayati said that Iran wants the states of the region to 
enhance their cooperation, manage regional affairs by 
themselves, and oppose hegemonist intervention and the policy of 
coercion.

  [Text] Tehran, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen wound up his three-day official 
visit to Iran and left here this evening. 
  Speaking at a press conference at the end of his visit, Qian 
termed his visit to Iran as "successful and fruitful," hoping 
that the two countries will promote their bilateral relation in 
various fields. 
  "The Chinese and Iranian peoples shared historical and 
friendly relations and bilateral cooperation between the two 
countries has been well expanded in recent years," said the 
foreign minister, who arrived here Friday [4 March]. 
  Trade between the two countries hit the historical height 
last year, he said, but "both the two sides believe that there 
are more potentials for cooperation in various fields." 
  Iran, which is the bridge between Asia and Europe, has its 
strategic importance, said Qian, adding that Beijing-Tehran 
relation is based on mutual respect, mutual benefit and 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs. 
  He believed that the friendly relations between the two 
Asian 
countries will help maintain peace and stability in the region. 
  Referring to the result of his tour of five Asian countries, 
including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Iran, 
Qian said that Asian countries have many points in common 
despite their differences in religion, politics and culture. 
  All these countries are trying to improve their economic 
situation and are ready for regional cooperation, the Chinese 
vice-premier said, adding that these countries share same or 
similar views on many important issues. 
  He also announced China's readiness to expand friendly 
cooperation with these Asian countries. 
  Asked about China's view on the report that Washington set 
the improvement of human rights state in China as the 
precondition for extending most favored trade status to China, 
Qian opposed any linkage between politics and trade, saying that 
they are two separate issues and there are no direct links 
between the two issues. 
  On his part, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati 
said that bilateral ties as well as regional and international 
issues were the main topics for Qian's talks with Iranian 
leaders. 
  Iran and China have achieved a great deal of successes in 
their cooperation, particularly in economic cooperation, 
Velayati said. Trade between the two countries exceeded 700 
million U.S. dollars last year, the highest in the history of 
the two countries. 
  Iran and China share same or similar views on many regional 
and international issues, said Velayati, adding that relations 
between the two countries are based on independent foreign 
policy. 
  He hoped that the bilateral relations will be further 
expanded.

  [Text] Xian, March 6 (XINHUA) -- The European-based 
Airbus Industrie has reached an agreement for cooperative 
projects with China Aviation Supplies Corporation, involving 
tens of millions of U.S. dollars, a spokesperson for the air 
giant said at a news conference here. 
  Under the agreement, Airbus, one of the world's three 
largest 
aircraft manufacturers, will further commission China's Xian 
Aircraft Industry Corporation and Shenyang Aircraft Industry 
Corporation to produce parts for it. 
  Analysts said that the move is expected to expand 
cooperation 
between Airbus and China, as well as to increase Airbus' share 
in the potentially huge market of China. 
  Airbus started its cooperation with Chinese manufacturers in 
1985, when it delivered an A310 aircraft to the Shanghai-based 
China East Airlines. 
  Parts produced for Airbus by the two Chinese corporations in 
recent years include protection hatch doors for A300s and A310s, 
carbon fiber-made vertical tail ribs and wing ribs, and 
emergency exit hatchways for A320s, as well as supplementary 
parts for A300s and A310s. 
  To date, Airbus has sold 35 aircraft to China, 18 of which 
were delivered last year. 
  Market forecasters said China is expected to purchase 620 
airplanes between now and the year 2011, about 21 percent of the 
global demand during that period. 
  Official figures show China's air industry expanded by 30 
percent in 1993, despite a world-wide recession. 
  To get to grips with the Chinese market, which Airbus 
considers its most hopeful business opportunity, Airbus has 
opened a new office in China, called Airbus Industrie China, to 
handle increasing business activities in this most populous 
country of the world. 
  Airbus also plans to set up a training center in Beijing 
this 
spring in a bid to provide better services for its Chinese 
customers. 
  Sources said that the recently signed agreement did not 
spell 
out what particular parts the two Chinese partners will produce 
for Airbus. But they said the new parts will involve more 
sophisticated techniques and more advanced technological 
know-how. 
  Boeing Corporation of the United States also struck a big 
deal with Chinese manufacturers late last year.

  [Text] Taipei, March 5 (CNA) -- Reports that Beijing is 
planning to establish special investment areas along the coast 
of Mainland China exclusively for Taiwan investors have drawn 
mixed reactions here. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chang Shih-chien said 
Saturday 
[5 March] that the government hopes the project is a success, 
but he expressed his doubts that the project would be completed 
given the current economic capability of Mainland China. 
  Yang stressed that the Taipei Government's policy toward the 
mainland will not be affected by any moves Beijing will take, 
saying trade ties across the Taiwan Strait are currently 
regulated by the National Unification Guidelines and the 
statutes governing relations between peoples of the Taiwan area 
and the mainland area. 
  Under both laws, Taiwan investors are currently prohibited 
from making direct investments in Mainland China. Unofficial 
statistics, however, show that Taiwan investors have channeled 
more than US$10 billion into the mainland. 
  Richard Wu, president of the Council for Industrial and 
Commercial Development, hailed the Beijing proposal as a 
goodwill response to increasing mainland investments by Taiwan 
manufacturers. 
  The establishment of such investment areas should help win 
tax incentives for Taiwan investors, Wu noted. 
  Huang Nan-tu, president of the Wei Chuan Group, warned 
domestic manufacturers to beware of any hidden political 
intentions, but also admitted that the proposed investment zones 
would benefit Taiwan investors. 
  The planned special investment areas are expected to have 
better factory infrastructure than the mainland's existing 
plants, many of which lack peripheral facilities including power 
supplies and means of transportation, Huang said. 
  Domestic investors, however, should take into account their 
different needs and make cautious assessments before deciding to 
enter into the special investment areas, he pointed out. 
  Moreover, he stressed, Taiwan investors must pay attention 
to 
Beijing's political intentions in such an initiative. 
  The Hong Kong-based WEN WEI PO on Friday cited Beijing 
sources as reporting that the mainland will give the green light 
in the near future to the establishment of several Taiwan 
traders' investment areas on the mainland's coastal region in a 
new bid to attract more investments from Taiwan. 
  The sources said the plan is consistent with calls by 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to boost Cross-Strait trade 
exchanges and help curb calls for Taiwan independence, the 
newspaper reported.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 5 (CNA) -- As the US continues to 
push Taiwan for increased protection of intellectual property 
rights (IPR) and more open markets, Taiwan residents are growing 
more ambivalent about their longstanding ally and largest 
trading partner outside Asia. 
  The growing ambivalence was evident during a Saturday [5 
March] panel discussion on the past and future of US-Taiwan 
trade ties sponsored by the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY. 
  "The US has played a key role in the Republic of China 
[ROC]'s fast economic development over the past four decades," 
Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning 
and Development, said at the discussion. 
  "Without the American technology and capital badly needed by 
Taiwan, I don't think the development in the 1960's would have 
been so successful," Schive said. As a result of that help, 
Taiwan was the United States' sixth largest trade partner in 
1993. 
  However, mounting trade resulted in increased tensions, 
fueled by US calls to open certain protected sectors of Taiwan's 
market. 
  "No country in the world has the right to impose a reform 
timetable on other countries," legislator Hsu Tien-tsai of the 
Democratic Progressive Party said, explaining why Taiwan 
residents have reacted strongly against the US push for open 
markets and IPR protection. 
  Deborah Schwartz, director of the economic section of the 
American Institute in Taiwan, defended the US reform push, 
saying there is nothing negative about the high-profile position 
taken by the US during the recent trade and intellectual 
property rights talks. 
  The talks and threats of sanctions are not intended to serve 
as a weapon, but to help Taiwan open its market and develop a 
mature economy. 
  "Taiwan's economy developed largely as a result of open 
markets in the US," she explained. 
  "The goal of (sanctions) is to give US products the same 
access to Taiwan's market as Taiwan products have in the US," 
she added. 
  Schwartz added that market opening and intellectual property 
rights protection were "win-win" situations. She pointed out 
that at least six new computer software firms opened in Taiwan 
after the Copyright Protection Law was enacted. 
  All participants agreed that increasing Taiwan investment in 
Mainland China would not affect US-Taiwan trade, and Schwartz, 
Chi, and Hsu all predicted continued good bilateral trade 
relations. 
  The forum, chaired by Joseph Li, vice president of the 
Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research, was also attended by 
Sam S.M. Li, deputy secretary-general of the China External 
Trade Development Council.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 2 (XINHUA) -- The continuing 
development of the (Chinese) mainland economy is increasingly 
the key to Hong Kong's future economic success, Hong Kong 
Financial Secretary Hamish MacLeod said here today. 
  Delivering his 1994/95 budget in the Legislative Council, 
MacLeod said that through serving and investing in the mainland, 
Hong Kong continued to find new markets for its expertise in 
manufacturing, marketing, banking, communications, tourism and 
professional services. 
  He said the mainland accounted for 35 percent of Hong Kong's 
total external trade in 1993 while the territory constituted 
about two thirds of total external investment in the mainland, 
which is probably the largest external investor in Hong Kong. 
  MacLeod said Hong Kong residents made no less than 23 
million 
visits to the mainland last year while nearly two million 
foreign visitors used Hong Kong as their gateway to the mainland. 
  In addition to the 34,000 flights Hong Kong handled to and 
from the mainland, there were 7.4 million road crossings by cars 
and lorries. 
  MacLeod claimed that last year was the 27th successive year 
in which Hong Kong's [HK] economy grew in real terms since 1966 
and the GDP [gross domestic product] per head had more than 
trebled in real terms since 1970. 
  A surplus of 15.1 billion HK dollars (about 1.9 billion U.S. 
dollars) was expected for 1993/94 and reserves on March 31, 1994 
were expected to total 136.1 billion (about 17.45 billion U.S. 
dollars), he said. 
  "This is an improvement in our finances of 18.5 billion 
(about 2.37 billion U.S. dollars), an improvement due for the 
most part to a growth in revenue well above what had been 
forecast," he added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong achieved a 
GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of 5.5 percent in 1993 
and is expected to retain the same economic growth in 1994, the 
Financial Secretary Hamish MacLeod said here today. 
  Delivering the 1994-95 budget in the Legislative Council 
this 
afternoon, the financial secretary said inflation rate in 1994 
will also keep to an average of around 8.5 percent in 1994, the 
same as it was in 1993. 
  The financial secretary said GDP per head in Hong Kong in 
1993 reached 18,500 U.S. dollars in 1993 and is expected to 
reach 20,600 U.S. dollars in 1994. 
  Expressing confidence about the prospects for 1994, Sir 
Hamish said Hong Kong can look forward to better economic 
prospects in its major overseas markets, and to continued the 
high growth in the region. "Above all, we have a vital role to 
play in China's economic modernization," he said. 
  "Increasingly, the key to our future economic success will 
lie in our ability to sell our services to the world, to the 
region, and above all to the Chinese economy," he said. 
  The financial secretary said that the successful conclusion 
of the Uruguay Round and the improved prospects in major 
overseas markets will also help boost trade potentials. 
  Speaking of problems in Hong Kong's economic development, 
the 
financial secretary said, "inflation remains a difficult 
challenge." 
  "Property prices are rising to increasingly uncomfortable 
levels because of acute shortage of land combined with growing 
prosperity and the understandable ambition of families to own 
their own homes," he said. 
  The financial secretary proposed a number of income tax 
concessions which would enable about 420,000 taxpayers, or a 
quarter of the total, to drop out of the tax net entirely.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Ni, Nomura Research Institute economist] </F>
  [Text] Since 1985, Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty has 
stimulated intensified political and economic integration 
between the territory and China. Mainland economic entities, in 
particular, have increasingly participated in business 
activities and taken more economic stakes in various sectors, 
triggering an unprecedented change in Hong Kong's economic 
landscape China-owned firms have mushroomed in Hong Kong their 
numbers increasing from 200 in 1985 to 15,000 by last year. 
  They have provided jobs for more than 90,000 employees, 
almost four percent of the territory's labour force -- with 
10,000 of them mainlanders, five times the number in the early 
'80s. Although no accurate figure is available, a conservative 
estimate puts total capital assets and investment by mainland 
entities in Hong Kong at more than US$30 billion, 10 times that 
in 1985. China's economic stake in Hong Kong is conservatively 
estimated to account for nearly 15 percent of the territory's 
economy. 
  Mainland firms have not only grown quantitatively, but also 
have greatly improved business quality. Some have become 
dominant players in their business sectors, with the Bank of 
China group developing from a relatively small retail bank in 
the early '80s into the territory's number two bank. 
  Mainland economic entitles also have developed from their 
traditional business of banking and China-related trading in the 
early '80s into seven major economic sectors. In the financial 
sector growth is attributed to several major state-owned 
enterprises. Before 1984, mainland firms were generally 
discouraged by Beijing from participating in the financial 
sector, but their expansion began in late 1984, with the Bank of 
China Group, Conic Investment and CITIC (HK) invited by the Hong 
Kong Government to take part in the rescue of financially 
troubled banks in the mid-'80s. 
  In the past few years mainland firms have aggressively 
engaged in corporate activities and by last year, mainly through 
backdoor listings and H-share flotations, they controlled more 
than 50 territory-listed companies. In the banking sector, the 
Bank of China founded its Hong Kong headquarters in the '50s. 
Since those modest beginnings the mainland presence has soared, 
with CITIC and China Merchants acquiring local banks, Ka Wah and 
Union Bank in the late '80s. 
  Recently the number has in creased further with the People's 
Construction Bank and Everbright taking over territory banks. 
By the start of this year, mainland firms have taken direct and 
indirect control of more than 20 banks. As a result, China- 
controlled banks have topped both the Hong Kong and Shanghai 
Bank and Hang Seng Bank in business in the territory. By the 
end of 1993, deposits taken by the Bank of China group alone 
account for 24 percent of total bank deposits in the territory. 
  In the property market, mainland firms were traditionally 
more cautious, but since 1985 -- partly because the market 
started dramatically reactivating, and partly because China's 
"window firms" began mushrooming in Hong Kong mainland firms 
have been engaging boldly in the industry. By the end of 1993, 
it was estimated that mainland investment in property reached 
more than HK$30 billion. 
  In 1992 alone, Chinese investment reached about $6.5 
billion, 
accounting for 25 to 30 percent of all property deals of more 
than $100 million each, leaving the mainland the third biggest 
investor after Japanese and Taiwanese firms in that year. 
Although an austerity programme, launched to cope with China's 
overheating economy in late 1993 was thought to have slowed down 
mainland investment, no firms have been seen selling properties. 
In addition, there are clear signs that mainland firms' 
property investment is heating up following deals done by both 
China State Real Estate Development Corp and CITIC Pacific. 
  Moreover, several mainland construction firms, including 
China Overseas Land, are busily engaged in property investment. 
It is estimated that more than 50 percent of property 
transactions in 1993 involved mainland firms, suggesting that 
territory tycoons are investing in the mainland market, and 
mainlanders are jumping in to fill the gap in Hong Kong. 
  Thanks to China's reform policy, trade between China and 
Hong 
Kong has increased at double-digit rates since 1985 and mainland 
firms are benefitting due to the fact that almost all 
China-related firms are engaged in import-export business. 
Although no precise figures are available, it is estimated that 
mainland firms have taken at least 85 percent of the total 
volume of China trade, amounting to 20 per of Hong Kong trade, 
or up to $107.7 billion in 1993. 
  Mainland firms can be expected to continue to dominate the 
business because of economic integration which will intensify 
rapidly in the coming three years. In addition, mainland firms 
traditionally have taken a considerable stake in land and sea 
transport, and also of China-related warehousing business in 
Hong Kong. Mainland firms, including China Merchants, China 
Travel, Continental Mariner and provincial "window" firms, have 
drastically expanded business in the transportation sector. It 
is estimated that mainland firms have shared about 15 to 20 
percent of total business turnover in the sector since 1990. 
  CITIC, China Travel and China Merchants already have taken 
as 
much as 15 percent of air transport services and MTR services. 
Mainland firms are taking more stakes from British-backed 
utility firms in the public transportation sector, a trend 
likely to continue in the run-up to 1997. 
  Another area of rapid mainland-interest growth is the 
tourist 
industry. In the past eight years, mainland firms have jumped 
into Hong Kong's tourist industry. Only three main tourist 
firms were registered in the early '80s but, by 1992, 36 
agencies were owned by mainland firms, accounting for about 10 
per cent of turnover. They have a virtual monopoly of 
China-Hong Kong tours and now own 13 hotels and a number of 
unregistered small hostels, worth about $6 billion. 
  One sector where mainland participation has been relatively 
small has been manufacturing. According to Hong Kong Government 
figures, in 1985 only 15 Chinese firms were engaged in 
manufacturing, mainly related to toys, electronics and textiles. 
However, mainland firms have maintained constant investment in 
the manufacturing sector over the past few years and by last 
year more than 100 Chinese firms were directly engaged in the 
manufacturing industry in Hong Kong. 
  Direct investment by mainland firms accounted for up to 12 
per cent of total foreign investment in the territory's 
manufacturing sector between 1992 and 1993. In the past eight 
years, mainland firms have lifted their shares by 10 to 15 per 
cent in each of the seven key economic sectors and are playing 
an increasingly important role in Hong Kong's economy. 
  Yet this appears likely to be only the beginning of the 
Chinese economic presence in Hong Kong. Despite some negative 
impact which may seemingly be imposed by mainland business 
expansion, Hong Kong's business environment as a whole appears 
to have been enhanced rather than disadvantaged. No matter how 
aggressive mainland expansion is in Hong Kong, it is now 
welcomed by the territory's business community.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Get Tough Call Aims To Boost Civil Air </F>
Service"] 
  [Text] Rigid management and strict discipline are the keys 
to bringing about the healthy and smooth development of China's 
civil air service, a top government official said yesterday. 
  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua told the final day of the national 
civil aviation conference in Beijing that the sector's leading 
officials must be strict with themselves and their sub-ordinates. 
  He referred particularly to the air safety responsibility 
contract signed between directors of the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China [CAAC] and the CAAC's regional bureaus, 
carriers, airports and pilot-training schools. 
  The contract is designed to stop accidents and it has set 
safety targets for each unit, defining the penalties and rewards 
their leaders face depending on their performance. 
  Zou said civil aviation made progress last year, but he also 
criticized it for problems such as slack management, the risk of 
frequent accidents and poor service. 
  And he called on delegates to find new ways to ensure safety 
in a changing industry. 
  CAAC deputy head Bao Peide said the industry will spare no 
effort to resolve four major problems--the lack of flight 
facilities, the lack of ground facilities, the poor quality of 
some workers, the quality gap between new jet airliners and the 
country's sometimes obsolete airports.

  [Text] Beijing March 4 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua 
today called on the staff members of China's civil airlines to 
improve the quality of services and open a new era in their work. 
  At the closing session of a national working conference on 
the civil aviation service, Zou said that since the new 
leadership of China's civil aviation services analyzed the major 
problems and took some measures to deal with them at the end of 
last year, progress had been made in the work of the services. 
  But, he noted, the problems -- including some slackness in 
management and low service quality -- have not been totally 
solved and arduous tasks remain for the services. 
  He said that civil aviation services play a special role in 
China's opening to the outside world and it is an industry with 
modern scientific and technological knowledge. 
  He called for practising strict management and discipline, 
and improving various responsibility systems. 
  The primary task for the civil aviation services is safe 
flights, he said. 
  He said that he is against blindly setting up airlines 
without taking account of conditions. 
  He urged the China Administration of Civil Aviation to 
regulate the air navigation market and set up good order in 
navigation. 
  The vice-premier also stressed the need for readjustments in 
those local airlines which had had more accidents. 
  He said that punctual flights and improvement of service 
quality should be an obligation for all airlines. 
  He urged the airlines to study the psychology of passengers, 
understand their difficulties and make efforts to meet their 
needs.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] The Sichuan Governor, Xiao Yang, is still under 
consideration to replace the Executive Vice-Premier, Zhu Rongji, 
as head of the central bank, despite having refused the post 
when offered it before the lunar new year holiday. "It's not 
very likely now, but things are still developing," the assistant 
governor of Sichuan, Xu Zhongmin, said in a recent exclusive 
interview in Shenzhen. "He would like to remain as Sichuan 
Governor, but Beijing still has the right of consideration," he 
said. 
  Top officials in Sichuan remained worried Xiao would be 
persuaded by Zhu, who was a Qinghua University classmate, to 
take up the post in Beijing. "It would be a great loss for us. 
We should have him for longer," Xu said. 
  Since being promoted from party secretary of Chongqing last 
year, Xiao has taken personal charge of foreign investment and 
industry portfolios, areas that are usually handled by deputy 
governors, Xu said. "This is the time of great aspirations for 
Mr Xiao," he said. 
  Zhu reportedly offered Xiao the post during an inspection 
tour of Sichuan before the lunar new year, according to Taiwan's 
CHINA TIMES. Xiao, 65, threatened to resign from politics 
unless he was promoted to a Beijing position during last year's 
14th party congress, where he barely squeaked in as an alternate 
politburo member. 
  Zhu offered him a state councillor position as an additional 
sweetener if he would become head of the People's Bank of China 
(PBOC). But worries about the political pressure of being the 
first governor of a supposedly independent central bank led Xiao 
to refuse the offer despite his ambitions. Zhu's act was 
apparently likened to offering a strong cappuccino to a man 
dying of thirst. 
  But while politely refusing the post, Xiao expressed support 
for Zhu's tight control of China's financial system, which he 
said would prevent Sichuan bank savings from illegally flowing 
to coastal areas. "If you open the floodgates, it becomes more 
important to plug leaks. Following the recent easing of the 
money supply we must prevent even a single cent flowing east," 
Xiao reportedly said. 
  Zhu confirmed before his recent trip to Japan that he was 
having difficulty finding someone to take over the top position 
in the central bank. He is believed to be desperate to shed the 
governor's job because of the extra workload. "It seems not 
many people would like to take the post... so I have to 
continue," he told reporters at Beijing airport. 
  The current vice-governors of the PBOC have been most often 
mooted as Zhu's probable successor, but official sources in 
Beijing said there was concern that they would be too weak. 
"The central government wants someone for the post who can 
wield power without any restrictions," one official said. "That 
means someone who is a political heavy weight, not an 
experienced banker," the official added. 
  Fighting the threat of inflation has emerged in recent weeks 
as Beijing's main concern in 1994. This contrasts with the 
emphasis on quick growth and "deepening reforms" of last year. 
Maintaining a tight control on the money supply despite 
political pressures is considered crucial to keeping inflation 
in check.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
financial official said here today that China will strive to 
make its currency -- the renminbi [rmb] yuan -- convertible on 
current account within six years. 
  China unified its previous dual exchange rates on January 1 
this year. "We will also relax foreign exchange control over 
foreign trade, beginning this year," said Zhu Xiaohua, 
vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, the Central Bank, 
in an interview with XINHUA. 
  Zhu, who was made director of the State Administration of 
Foreign Exchange Control early this year, said the moves will 
put the Chinese yuan considerably closer to being a freely 
convertible currency. 
  He expressed satisfaction with the reaction both from the 
public and the market to the rmb exchange rate unification. 
  The country's foreign exchange reserve went up markedly 
during the past two months, he said. 
  Since China stopped issuing foreign exchange certificates 
(FEC) upon unification of the yuan's exchange rate, the Bank of 
China has withdrawn one third of the FEC special bank notes in 
circulation, Zhu noted. 
  The first quarter of 1994 is supposed to be a transitional 
period for China's foreign exchange control system to convert 
from the old to the new. 
  During this period, the Central Bank publishes the market 
exchange rates every morning, which are formed on the basis of 
the average prices on the foreign exchange swap markets across 
the country. 
  The banks, however, can only buy or sell hard currency 
according to the central bank's buying and selling prices. They 
are not allowed to float the price for the time being. 
  However, the rmb exchange rate will begin to float as of 
April 1 this year. The swap centers will then have given way to 
a fledgling inter-bank foreign exchange market. 
  Zhu said that the range of floatation will not be very big 
in 
the initial state of the new system's operation, to ensure that 
it does not have a too large effect on the national economy. 
  "The floatation has to be somewhat controlled, considering 
China's reality, especially when our fiscal and monetary 
policies cannot fully regulate the economy," said Zhu. 
  But he said that the central bank's intervention will be 
conducted mainly by buying or selling hard currency, instead of 
by setting price limits. 
  "We will also see the frequency of such interventions 
gradually reduced," Zhu said. 
  According to the vice-governor, the unified inter-bank 
foreign exchange market will have as members the 13 major 
domestic banks, 88 branches of foreign banks and Sino-foreign 
banks. 
  Many foreign banks have applied to join the system, said 
Zhu, 
adding that the central bank is considering taking in as brokers 
of the market some international trust and investment companies 
"to ensure the exchange rate really reflects the supply and 
demand." 
  As to whether China will have an adequate supply of foreign 
exchange according to the current foreign exchange rate, Zhu 
said that this is decided mainly by the monetary policy of the 
central bank. 
  He said that the outline of monetary policy to curb the 
scale 
of investment in fixed assets has taken shape and the current 
exchange rate is quite advantageous for exports. 
  As long as the current policy of attracting foreign 
investments remains unchanged and the investment environment is 
improved, more foreign investment will keep flowing into China, 
thus making up the foreign trade deficit. 
  As one of the principal operators of reform of China's 
foreign exchange system, Zhu expressed optimism about the goal 
of realizing a balance between supply and demand of hard 
currency while seeing an increase in China's foreign currency 
reserves.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (CNS)--The exchange rate of the 
renminbi made known by the People's Bank of China has stood firm 
at around one U.S. dollar against RMB 8.7 since the unification 
of the exchange rate of the renminbi started on January 1 this 
year. An authoritative source from the sector said that the 
phenomenon showed a steady transition of the exchange rate of 
the currency, seen as a solid foundation for a number of 
measures for the restructuring of the foreign exchange 
administration system to be adopted. 
  With the implementation of the unification of the exchange 
rate of the renminbi, the currency has a floating exchange rate 
decided by the market. The People's Bank of China makes public 
an exchange rate of the renminbi every day by making reference 
to the exchange rate involved in trade among banks on the 
previous day. The exchange rate of one U.S. dollar against RMB 
8.7 has been the price seen in the swap market since the 
beginning of last year, meaning little fluctuation in the swap 
market following the practice of unifying the exchange rate of 
the renminbi. The foreign exchange market has proceeded 
normally and the price of the curency remains stable. The 
exchange rate of 8.7 yuan is regarded as the bottom line for the 
renminbi with a fluctuation rate of not more than 0.1 yuan. 
  Before the establishment of a unified foreign exchange 
market 
among banks, swap markets for foreign exchange which are 
considered a transition move still play an important role across 
the country. Individual business entities undertaking the trade 
of foreign exchange, however, have withdrawn from the market 
while most foreign trade companies as well as import and export 
companies have employed a wait-and-see practice and therefore 
seldom take part in transactions in the market through means of 
brokers, resulting in a small traded volume in the foreign 
exchange market. 
  Conversion of foreign exchange certificates into renminbi 
has 
returned to normal following a brief market fluctuation in the 
wake of a decision halting the issuance of the certificates. 
  Stability in the market after the unification of the 
exchange 
rate of the renminbi is because such reform was line with the 
market economy system. There is need by the authorities for 
some problems arising from the new practice. Improvements 
should be made in order to offer sound conditions for the 
restructuring of the foreign exchange administration system.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Jun (0060 0193): "Experts Suggest Carrying </F>
Through the Plan for Free Exchange of Renminbi at an Early Date"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 22 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Financial 
experts here pointed out that it is necessary for China to 
create conditions to achieve free exchange of renminbi to 
restore its signatory state to GATT at an early date. Hence, 
the problem of foreign exchange system reform must be placed 
high on the government agenda. 
  Commenting on Shanghai's strategy for economic development, 
Shanghai CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference) members, who are now attending the second session of 
the eighth municipal CPPCC, believed that the reform of the 
foreign exchange system will have different impact on the 
economy of different areas. For Shanghai, which is set to 
develop itself into an international economic, trade, and 
financial center, the reform will mean more opportunities for 
development, they said. 
  Shanghai is presently the place where China's biggest stock 
exchange and biggest foreign currency swap center are situated. 
As China opens wider to the outside world, especially as it 
presses ahead with the foreign exchange system reform, spot 
foreign exchange markets, forward foreign exchange markets, and 
offshore financial markets will certainly be set up in turn. 
If Shanghai plans to become an international financial center, 
an important task is to energetically create conditions to 
establish itself as a center of all these financial markets. 
Shanghai CPPCC last year organized financial and trade experts 
into several panels to conduct investigations and studies. 
These panels presented their findings report at the current 
CPPCC session. 
  The report entitled "Free Exchange of Renminbi and 
Shanghai's 
Financial Status" proposed principles for free exchange of 
renminbi: Unifying exchange rates of renminbi and relaxing 
control over foreign exchange. Free exchange of renminbi can 
start with the current account of international payment and then 
apply to capital account. Non-resident convertibility should be 
allowed first and then resident convertibility. Along this 
line, renminbi will finally become international money. To this 
end, the key task is to expand exports at a greater pace, strike 
a balance of international payments, and manage to reserve more 
foreign exchange. In addition, efforts should be made to 
stabilize currency values at home to lay a solid foundation for 
free exchange of renminbi. 
  Shanghai should, in line with present conditions, relax 
control over foreign exchange and vigorously develop a national 
foreign exchange market to create the necessary conditions for 
achieving free exchange of renminbi. 
  To achieve this, the findings report tabled specific plans: 
With the support of the People's Bank of China, setting up a 
national foreign currency swap center in Shanghai and gradually 
changing it into a spot foreign exchange market; instituting a 
well-managed unitary floating exchange rate system; setting up a 
forward foreign exchange market in Shanghai as soon as possible; 
appropriately relaxing control over foreign exchange; making 
loans in renminbi to certain foreign-funded financial 
institutions; and exploring ways for opening a limited offshore 
financial market in Shanghai.

<F P=106> [By Wei Ling: "To Revive Market, Regulators Will Limit New </F>
Listings"] 
  [Text] The central government is to control the speed of 
listing new firms in a bid to perk up the country's lacklustre 
stock market. 
  China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's 
stock-market watchdog, has confirmed that the country will go 
ahead to issue 5.5 billion yuan ($632 million) worth of shares 
as planned. However, the issuing of part of the shares may be 
postponed until next year, if necessary. 
  Last month, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange suspended the 
listing of new shares to help revive the bearish market. 
  The long-awaited step was warmly welcomed by both investors 
and experts. They blame the continuing slip in the market on 
the listing of too many new shares in too short a time, which 
leads to a shortage of capital. 
  And they hoped the move would reverse the months-long 
bearish 
trend on the markets. 
  However, they have been disappointed that Shenzhen's move 
has 
failed to bring the anticipated results. 
  The brief revival disappeared quickly as the market remained 
dull last week and most investors continued to wait and see. 
  Some experts say the suspension of new stocks cannot solve 
the stock market's real problems. 
  High interest rates, increased risks in stocks investment 
and 
the disappointing performance of public companies are the major 
reasons for the market's dull performance, said an economist at 
Beijing University. 
  Enterprises must now pay more for bank loans and that, in 
turn, is reducing their profits. 
  More importantly, the high interest rates have also 
encouraged potential investors to protect their cash in banks 
rather than risk it on stocks . 
  In addition, China's expanding stock market and the 
increasing numbers of investors have made buying shares more 
risky. 
  The days when the demand for stocks outpaced supply and 
people could become rich overnight have long gone. 
  Now more and more public companies are choosing to grant 
bonus shares or rights issues as dividends to shareholders. So 
shareholders get no cash dividend and have to buy the new issues. 
  "It is hard to earn money in the stock market today--that's 
why I withdrew my money from the market," said Beijing investor 
Li Qin.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "No Trades of Special-Price Shares Soon"] </F>
  [Text] State and corporate-owned shares sold under 
preferential terms will continue to be kept out of the open 
trading market, declared the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission (CSRC) yesterday. 
  CSRC announced that it was suspending the implementation of 
a 
circular issued by the Shenzhen Securities Administration Office 
that said in half a year trading of these special-treatment 
shares would begin. 
  Analysts said the Shenzhen circular resulted in a heavy blow 
to the stock market, because it means a large amount of shares 
will be listed. 
  In the past two days, the Shanghai stock market dipped by 
15.5 points while the Shenzhen market went down 5 points. 
  The shares are known as right issues. Listed companies sell 
them to shareholders at lower prices and at a certain ratio. 
  Zhu Li the spokesman of the commission said that it is not 
proper for local securities administrations and exchanges to 
make some regulations on policy-related issues before the State 
can make unified rules on these policies. 
  He urged them to "take the interests of the whole into 
account" while making decisions. 
  The local securities administration office did not inform 
the 
CSRC before they published the circular. 
  CSRC officials said they knew the information only through a 
story published in yesterday's Shanghai Securities newspaper. 
  In China, shares are divided into State and corporate-owned 
and individual shares. 
  At present, only individual shares are traded on securities 
exchanges while a small number of companies have listed their 
corporate shares with the Securities Trading Automated 
Quotations System and National Electric Trading System. 
  State shares are kept completely out of the market. 
  The circulation of State and corporate-owned shares has been 
a hot topic for both securities administration and investors. 
  CSRC said that the country is working on regulations 
covering 
the listing of corporate-owned shares. 
  Before the regulations are issued, the listing of new 
corporate-owned shares will be suspended. 
  And it said the listing of State-owned shares could not be 
dealt with before the transaction of corporate shares. 
  In another development, Zhu denied that about 1O billion 
yuan 
($1.1 billions) of shares will be listed this year. 
  "At least, the commission has never heard of such a huge 
figure," he said. 
  He made the statement at yesterday's press conference in 
response to newspaper stories that gave such a prediction. 
  China last year issued 4 billion yuan ($459 million) of 
shares and is set to issue 5.5 billion yuan ($632 million) of 
shares to domestic investors this year. 
  Chinese securities investors have complained that too many 
companies have been listed on the market, which has made the 
market bearish.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 5 (XINHUA) -- A computer network, 
which links Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and Shenyang 
Securities Trading Center in northeast China, is to go into 
operation on Monday (March 7). 
  It is the second of its kind after a link was established 
between the sse and the securities trading center in east 
China's Fujian Province. 
  With it, all buying and selling orders can be transmitted on 
computers. Brokers at both places can trade securities listed 
on these two stock markets and can receive quotations and 
settled accounts issued by them, and investors' accounts are in 
common use in the two cities. 
  Since a successful trial of the network in January, over 
90,000 citizens in Shenyang have been encouraged to open new 
accounts within the past two months. 
  The network will offer more opportunities for members of the 
SSE from different parts of the region to enter the Shenyang 
market.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will try to 
edge into the construction market in Latin America, South 
Pacific regions and Europe starting from this year, announced 
Wan Jifei, deputy director of the Beijing Commission of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
  Currently Beijing's foreign construction market is confined 
mostly in southeast Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. 
  Last year, Beijing signed contracts for 530 million U.S. 
dollars-worth of construction projects. With a total of 3,200 
people abroad, the city completed a business volume of 160 
million U.S. dollars. 
  These include construction of a residence area in Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia, of a flyover in Sri Lanka and of a 180-km 
highway in India. 
  Wan said that he is hopeful to snatch a sizeable share in 
the 
construction market of those more advanced countries as Beijing 
has the country's best professionals in architecture and 
construction.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- The latest survey by 
the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy showed that 
China's property-rights exchange markets have gradually taken 
shape and bold steps have been taken in transferring property 
rights of enterprises. 
  By now multi-level property-right exchange markets of 
different sizes have been established in over 20 Chinese cities 
of 14 provinces and more are in preparation. 
  Central China's Henan Province has set up more than 20 
property-rights exchange markets and disposition markets for 
properties lying idle. 
  Northeast China's Jilin Province had auctioned 436 local 
state-owned enterprises through property-rights markets by the 
end of last year. 
  Mudanjiang City in northeast China's Heilongjian Province 
has 
got funds of about 57 million yuan by auctioning 10 enterprises 
to buyers from the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong. 
  Sixteen enterprises were sold out to and five were leased by 
domestic individual businessmen or those from Hong Kong and 
Taiwan on a property-rights exchange fair held last September in 
central China's Hunan Province. 
  Reform measures have also been taken to shift state-owned 
enterprises into collective enterprises through annexing or 
other ways, according to the survey. 
  Utilization of foreign capital has seen a new boom. Quanzhou 
City in east China's Fujian Province introduced foreign 
investment to all of its 41 state-owned enterprises in the first 
three months last year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (AFP)--Former Pakistan premier 
Moeen Qureshi announced here Monday the establishment of the 
first large-scale international investment fund exclusively 
targetting infrastructure projects in China and other developing 
countries. 
  The billion-dollar AIG (American International Group) Asian 
Infrastructure Fund, originally promoted and invested by AIG, is 
to provide equity financing for major Chinese infrastructure 
projects in the transport, telecommunications, and power 
sectors, said Qureshi, a former World Bank and IMF executive. 
Half the fund will be invested in China, while the other half 
will be concentrated on Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) countries, he added. 
  As well as AIG, the main investor in the 10-year fund is the 
Singapore government which has injected 250 million dollars 
through various subsidiaries. 
  The first closing of the Bermuda-based fund has just been 
completed in Singapore to the tune of 760 million dollars, 
Qureshi said, adding that the second closing in a few months 
time would bring the fund's resources to at least one billion 
dollars. 
  China's international investment arm, the China 
International 
Trust and Investment Corp. (CITIC) -- another major investor in 
the fund, will act as a local adviser together with the Bank of 
China. 
  The participation of U.S. pension funds, endowment plans, 
and 
insurance companies in the scheme signals a changing trend in 
capital flow with long-term investors beginning to target 
developing countries, Qureshi said. "This represents a sea 
change in the willingness of long-term investors to venture out 
into developing countries," he said, adding that China's rapid 
economic growth coupled with the problem of transport 
bottlenecks provided "important opportunities" for 
infrastructure investment here. 
  Following talks with Chinese officials, Qureshi said the 
fund 
was looking to invest in certain railway links and pilot 
projects aimed at opening up China's telecommunications sector. 
"We have also been specifically asked to consider the 
expressway that links Beijing with the capital of Hebei 
Province, Shijiazhuang, and four or five power projects." 
  Some 80 percent of the funds resources will be invested in 
the telecommunications, power and transport sectors alone, he 
added.

<F P=106> [Undated recorded report from the "News and Press Review" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Dear listeners. In recent months the China 
National Offshore Oil Corporation [CNOOC] once again made its 
mark domestically and internationally with the signing of a 
series of cooperation contracts with foreign partners to 
prospect for and exploit oil reserves in the East China Sea. So 
far they have signed 18 contracts and agreements with nine oil 
consortiums formed by 15 companies from seven countries. Its 
foreign partners would provide a total of $300 million in risk 
investment. According to authoritative persons, the bidding for 
contracts on the East China Sea's oil resources were conducted 
with even more success than those for previous oil contracts, 
with such major world-famous oil companies as Texaco, Chevron, 
Esso, Agip, Shell, and the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company 
Limited emerging as successful bidders. The CNOOC's 
well-established enterprise image within the international oil 
industry and its excellent reputation as a business partner--in 
addition to such major factors as China's political stability, 
rapid economic development, and the deepening of reform and 
opening up to the outside world--played a major role in bringing 
about such success. The following is a related report by our 
station reporter Xu Hualing: 
  [Begin recording] [Xu] With the spring festival drawing 
near, evening parties fill Beijing. The CNOOC's new year 
reception at the Chang Jiang Hotel takes on an entirely new 
look. Its foreign liaison manager, Zhu Dazhi, told me that 
today's guests include many representatives of foreign oil 
companies in Beijing as well as domestic business partners. The 
foreign companies have very good cooperative ties with the 
CNOOC. As all the guests are watching with great interest the 
performers passing amongst them and walking up to the stage, I 
began looking for interviewees from among the crowd. 
  Excuse me, you are Esso's representative in China, correct? 
  [Unidentified Esso representative] Yes, I am. 
  [Xu] Would you please tell me when Esso began its 
cooperation with the CNOOC? 
  [Esso representative] Esso is known as Exxon in the United 
States. We began to explore opportunities for cooperation with 
China back in 1978, and signed our first mineral prospecting 
contract with China in 1979. We established a representative 
office here as early as 1981. That was when I first came to 
China. 
  [Xu] We know the Exxon Corporation has many oil exploitation 
projects and sites around the world, and has established very 
good cooperative ties with many countries in oil exploitation. 
What are your comments on the CNOOC in comparison with other 
foreign companies? 
  [Esso representative] In short, we may say the CNOOC, like 
other oil companies around the world, has a work style in 
absolute conformity with international standards and caters to 
international cooperation. 
  [Xu] Hello, sir. You are the Chevron Corporation's chief 
representative in Beijing. Would you please give us your 
comments on the CNOOC? 
  [Unidentified Chevron representative] Of course I can. I 
feel that the CNOOC has, from the day of its founding, always 
operated under the criterion of foreign cooperation. Such a 
condition makes it easy for them to carry out harmonious 
cooperation with foreign counterparts, get their work on track, 
and be accepted by foreign companies. Moreover, because of 
their early intent to reform and open up to the outside world, 
they are also especially quick to accept foreign knowledge of 
advanced management as well as production and prospecting 
techniques, thus achieving particularly rapid development. 
  [Xu] Compared to Esso, Chevron, and other large companies in 
the world which have been around for decades or even a century, 
the CNOOC is a novice, with a history of only 11 years. 
Nevertheless, the rapidity of its development and growth has 
drawn worldwide attention. In his modest words, CNOOC General 
Manager Wang Yan reviews this history with a hint of his sense 
of accomplishment. 
  [Wang] Over the past decade, the CNOOC has gone through 
three stages. First, we carried out foreign cooperation 
immediately after the CNOOC's founding. As we had reached a 
higher level and accumulated some capital by 1987, we began to 
gradually increase the proportion of oil prospecting and 
exploitation carried out on our own. By now our independent 
work has already substantially outweighed foreign cooperation 
projects. We are now able to independently carry out not only 
prospecting, but also construction, exploitation, and some 
installation work at sea. We can handle all offshore operations 
by ourselves. With the standards of some of our techniques, we 
can operate not only in Chinese but also international waters. 
  [Xu] So far 10 oil and gas fields have been tapped and put 
into production, and 10 more are currently under construction in 
the vast expanse of Chinese waters which were absolutely empty a 
decade ago. By 1997, China will have 20 offshore oil and gas 
fields producing 12 million metric tons of crude oil and 4 
billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Joint Move Under Way To Exploit Offshore </F>
Oil"] 
  [Text] Sino-foreign joint exploration for petroleum in the 
East China Sea was kicked off last week, signalling a strategic 
move for East China's economy and the future of China's offshore 
oil operations. 
  The long-awaited exploration started with initial seismic 
work commissioned by a foreign oil consortium. At the same 
time, dozens of technical firms have arrived to help establish a 
service centre in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. 
  Oil and gas reserves in the region are expected to ease the 
decades of energy shortages in East China's five provinces and 
the economic giant of Shanghai. 
  Estimates say some 4.6 billion tons of crude oil and 2,480 
billion cubic metres of natural gas are contained in the sea. 
Combined, they are equivalent to 6.5 billion tons of crude oil. 
  The exploration, expected to span seven to eight years, will 
be carried out by oil firms such as the American-based Exxon, 
Texaco and Chevron; the Italian Agip; and the Netherlands' Royal 
Dutch Shell. 
  Reserves verified so far in China's offshore areas ensure 
that annual production of oil will increase from last year's 4.6 
million tons to 12 million tons within four years, and continue 
at 8 million tons thereafter. However, future development will 
depend on the size of future discoveries. 
  On Tuesday, an engineering vessel began seismic work in a 
block awarded to a consortium consisting of Texaco, Agip and the 
Danish firm Maersk. 
  It is the first prospecting move by a foreign oil group 
there. 
  As the first winning team in an international bidding 
conducted by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation 
(CNOOC), the three foreign firms were awarded three offshore 
blocks, 400 kilometres southeast of Shanghai. 
  Also on Saturday, some 20 Chinese and foreign technical 
firms 
moved into Wenzhou, a service centre for oil operations in the 
area. 
  The firms will provide technical services for the project. 
Engineering vessels also are to be hauled to nearby ports and 
heavy equipment will be installed at the bases for future use. 
  Other foreign oil firms that won bids are to kick off 
seismic 
work in the sea later this month or the next. A CNOOC official 
said seismic work is likely to begin in all contract blocks 
within the next two months. 
  The bidding for exploring the East China Sea, announced in 
l992, ended in January this year with 18 contracts and 
agreements signed with 17 firms from seven countries. 
  The bidding was for 72,800 square kilometres, divided into 
20 
blocks. All but two of the blocks--7,800 square 
kilometres--were snapped up. 
  Chen, CNOOC's vice-president, last week called the 
international bidding a success. "The results are better than 
expected," he said. 
  In the fourth quarter of this year, the Texaco-led group and 
another group consisting of Japan Petroleum Exploration Co 
(Japex) and Teikoku Oil Co are likely to drill test wells. The 
two Japanese firms were awarded two blocks. 
  According to contracts, foreign oil firms will conduct 
20,000 
kilometres of seismic lines and drill 50 test wells in the sea. 
They expect to use $300 million to finance the exploration. 
  He attributed the success partly to Chinese offshore oil 
firms' good reputations. 
  To date, CNOOC has signed 94 contracts and agreements with 
55 
firms from 15 countries. Some $3.4 billion in overseas funds 
have been used for oil operations in the South China Sea and the 
Bohai Sea. 
  Chen said China did not open the sea until 1993 because more 
work was needed to avoid disputes over the China-Japan ocean 
boundary, unsettled in some places. 
  Chen did not elaborate on that diplomatic matter, but said 
CNOOC had successfully handled related issues and could ensure 
implementation of the bidding. 
  The saying is untrue that China had been reluctant to open 
the sea to foreign oil firms because that site is the country's 
most petroleum-rich offshore area, Chen said. 
  China opened the South China Sea and the Bohai Sea in the 
early 1980s. 
  China, during explorations of the sea before the 
international bidding began, had conducted 120,000 kilometres of 
seismic lines and drilled 28 wells there.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Country's 1st Law on Trade Due In April"] </F>
  [Text] China is expected to announce its first foreign 
trade law in April to better integrate its trade structures with 
international practices. 
  A top Chinese Government official said the law would be 
ready 
after it is approved by the National People's Congress this 
month. 
  Foreign trade management will be one of the major topics of 
the Congress, which convenes in Beijing next week to take up a 
wide range of economic issues. 
  The impending trade law will be the first comprehensive one 
passed by China. 
  "The law will unify the national foreign trade policies and 
create a fair environment for competition among all domestic 
enterprises," said the official, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. 
  Disparities between central and local government policies 
regarding foreign trade and investment have turned away many 
potential investors from overseas. 
  In the past local governments have extended tax breaks to 
foreign investors that run counter to central regulations and 
resulted in considerable losses to the State. 
  "The foreign trade law will also set the stage for open and 
fair competition between domestic companies," the official said. 
  Many Chinese enterprises are prohibited from dealing in 
foreign trade, but the official said foreign trade rights would 
be granted to more companies and scientific institutions in the 
years to come. 
  But she did not say if the law would open the way to 
extending "national treatment" to foreign investors. 
  National treatment means applying the same policies to all 
enterprises operating in a country or region. Such treatment is 
required by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), 
which China is seeking to rejoin. 
  However, she maintained that foreign investors now enjoy 
nearly the same treatment as their Chinese counterparts, 
especially in taxation. 
  China has been drafting the foreign trade law for many 
years. 
At times policy makers have been split over difficult issues, 
like whether to allow individuals to conduct foreign trade . 
  The official declined to comment on that point. 
  But one thing is clear: More units will be able to have 
foreign trade rights under the macroeconomic control of the 
State. 
  China is ready to allow more scientific institutions to 
engage in foreign trade. Conservative statistics show that less 
than 10 percent of China's scientific findings have been applied 
to making products for export. 
  Approval of the law is timed to coincide with China's latest 
move to unify its two-tier foreign exchange rate system, which 
cancels discriminatory measures for different types of 
enterprises. 
  Chinese analysts believed the foreign trade law will hasten 
China's re-entry into Gatt. 
  China will sign the final package of the Uruguay Round of 
GATT talks in Morocco in April, paving the way for the country 
to rejoin GATT. 
  In another development, the official said China this year 
will revise its regulations guiding the use of foreign 
investment. 
  A national meeting on foreign investment is to end in 
Beijing 
on Monday. 
  Reliable sources said that the conference will signal some 
changes of policy in favour of foreign investors. 
  China has been planning to open its service sectors, like 
banking and transportation, wider to foreign investors. And it 
is ready to invite more foreign investment to develop its vast 
inland regions this year. 
  An unsettling factor is that the bulk of foreign investment 
still ends up in the coastal regions, leaving the hinterland 
farther and farther behind.

Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng Says China 
Will Take Strong Measures Against Illegal Textile Exports"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 5 Mar (TA KUNG PAO)--Shi Guangsheng, 
Chinese vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, 
noted here today that China is taking measures to curb the 
illegal transshipment of textiles. 
  Shi Guangsheng said: The Chinese Government has consistently 
been abiding by the accords that it has signed with some 
countries on textile exports. In recent years, however, we 
found that a small number of enterprises have been violating the 
relevant regulations in an attempt to disrupt market order 
through cheating, illegal transshipment, and other means, thus 
affecting the normal export of Chinese textiles. In this 
connection, the Chinese Government is conducting conscientious 
investigations and will take strong measures against such 
activities. 
  Shi Guangsheng said: There are three possibilities regarding 
illegal textile exports. First, some enterprises intentionally 
violate the law; second, Chinese exporters collaborate with 
foreign importers and intermediary agents; and third, some 
enterprises simply know very little about the relevant policies, 
laws, and ordinances. Shi stressed that comprehensive and 
coordinated efforts should be organized to curb offenses in the 
first two cases. 
  Shi Guangsheng revealed that the departments concerned had 
called a meeting before the Spring Guangzhou Export Commodities 
Fair this year to formulate measures in a campaign against 
illegal activities related to the textile trade.

<F P=106> [By reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 5 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Illegal 
transactions and seeking profits at the expense of faith are big 
taboos in the business world. The "pirated CD phenomenon" that 
has recently become rampant on the mainland is a case of such 
business. On this matter, the vice minister of China's Ministry 
of Radio, Film, and Television recently stated that China 
supports the crackdown on pirating records and audio tapes. 
People hope that the mainland authorities will vigorously and 
speedily clean up the pirated CD's and not let bad elements ruin 
China's national reputation. 
  The pirating of CD's on the mainland has indeed aroused much 
concern. According to an unofficial estimate, there are 25 
manufacturers of original CD's in various parts of the mainland. 
They have 30 production lines, with an annual production 
capacity of 60 million CD's. Some people think this is an 
overestimation and that the actual production capacity is under 
30 million. 
  Even by the minimum estimate, the mainland's CD output 
exceeds demand. According to statistics, the mainland public 
actually owns less than 7 million CD players. Given that three 
CD's are purchased for each CD player per year, the annual sales 
volume on the mainland market is about 21 million. In addition, 
the prices of the mainland's original CD's are on the high side, 
often going up to 200 or 300 yuan each. A large proportion of 
CD owners can only afford one or two CD's a year. Estimated 
this way, about 10 million CD's are sold annually, which is 
one-third of the annual production capacity. But pirated CD's, 
costing only 20 or 30 yuan each, can be sold in the tens of 
millions. 
  As a result of the excess supply of original CD's, either 
the 
manufacturer goes bankrupt, or is tempted into illegal pirating. 
It is said that some audio industry businessmen from Hong Kong 
and Taiwan have spotted the mainland's enormous potential for 
manufacturing CD's. They rope in people in charge of CD 
factories on the mainland, give bribes to local cadres, and ask 
factories to produce pirated audio tapes and CD's semi-overtly. 
The reason that some mainland factories knowingly violate the 
law is because they cannot resist the temptation of staggering 
profits: Each CD brings 10 yuan in processing fees, and if they 
produce 3 million a year, they can make 20 to 30 million yuan. 
This is a huge profit after the costs, outlays, equipment 
depreciation, and management expenses are deducted. Most of the 
pirated disks made by such Hong Kong or Taiwan businessmen in 
conjunction with mainland factories are for the domestic market. 
Some of them are smuggled to Hong Kong and Taiwan for sale or 
for reselling to other places. For example, Hangzhou's Huadie 
Guang Dian [5478 4308 0342 7193] Company imported Taiwanese 
equipment for producing audio tapes last year with a 110,000 
pound sterling investment from a Taiwan firm. It produced 1 
million pirated foreign music tapes in a year, most of which 
were smuggled abroad. Because a foreign firm lodged a complaint 
against this company not long ago, the city authorities of 
Hangzhou took action and ordered the company to suspend 
production and rectify itself. The Taiwan businessmen involved 
were also detained for interrogation. 
  In fact, most pirated audio tapes and disks are for the 
mainland market. While original CD's or even audio tapes are 
too expensive and slow-moving on the market, pirated ones sell 
very well among those in the lower class. With 20 to 50 yuan, 
one can buy the CD's of Hong Kong and Taiwan singers and famous 
foreign singers. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the record shelves 
are packed with audio tapes and CD's of stars from Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, and other countries, most of which are pirated copies. 
Each tape sells for 20 yuan and a CD only costs 30 to 50 yuan. 
  Because the International Federation of Producers of 
Phonograms and Videograms (Hong Kong) lodged a complaint, the 
mainland recently stepped up the crackdown on factories that 
produce pirated audio tapes and CD's. Shenzhen authorities have 
conducted five cleanups so far, confiscated large quantities of 
pirated products, and punished two pirating companies. The 
mainland has also cooperated with the Hong Kong side in tracking 
down smugglers of pirated goods. Any Hong Kong citizen 
discovered by customs to be carrying pirated cassette tapes or 
CD's into the territory is subject to a penalty.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "State To Get Tough on Ad Work"] </F>
  [Text] The central government is preparing to get tough on 
advertising profiteers. 
  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has 
launched a trial programme to ensure the business is handled 
only by designated advertising companies . 
  The programme began last Tuesday [1 March] in the Guangdong 
cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Foshan and 
Zhanjiang. 
  The administration said the rules and regulations now 
prohibited the cities' media units from seeking or meeting 
clients for their own advertising business. 
  Domestic and foreign enterprises in the six cities who want 
to put ads in magazines and newspapers or on radio and 
television must use government-approved advertising agencies to 
deal with the media. 
  Officials with the administration said the trial in 
Guangdong 
Province was likely to pave the way for a similar programme 
nationwide. 
  "It aims to give a fair chance of competition to the 
country's advertising companies," said one who declined to be 
named. 
  At present, media units are monopolizing their own 
advertising trade, which is often handled by so-called 
circulation or advertising promotion departments, instead of by 
government-backed agencies. 
  The official said overseas enterprises, including foreign 
advertising companies, must also consult domestic agencies about 
any work they require. 
  The reason is simple, the official said, as competition 
heats 
up companies are advertising more and more. 
  If things are left to develop uncontrolled, there will be 
chaos, he added. 
  Domestic companies are also keen to use celebrities as the 
heavy artillery in the battle for a slice of the market. 
  Many film, television and sports stars are lighting up 
commercial breaks across China. 
  Chinese companies spent 13.4 billion yuan ($1.56 billion) on 
advertising last year, an incredible 13.3 billion yuan ($1.54 
billion) more than 13 years ago. 
  The figures have rocketed as stronger competition forces 
enterprises to seek every means possible to make their brands 
stand out. 
  At the same time the government has come to realise the need 
to reinforce the management of the advertising market. 
  It is still in its infancy, and while the State sanctioned 
specific ad agencies, anyone could still set themselves up to 
sell space or air time around the country. 
  This potentially lucrative business has already attracted 
more than 310,000 people in terms of the employed workers around 
the country. 
  China has 31,000 advertising agencies--15,000 more than at 
the beginning of last year.

<F P=106> [By Fu Jian: "State Decries Dishonesty in Asset Appraisals"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese Government will not acknowledge or 
protect unauthorized assessments of intangible assets. 
  The State Administration of State Property said some 
appraisals given by Chinese organizations last year without 
approval from authorities were dishonest and must not be 
accepted by the government or the public. 
  Such appraisals may be deceiving said Wang Baoku, Deputy 
Director of the Assets Appraisal Administrative Centre under the 
administration. 
  In any event, he added, appraisals of intangible assets have 
limited value since they need not be demonstrated before trading 
the enterprises' property rights. 
  Intangible assets may include trademarks, patents, 
copyrights 
and credibility. Their value depends on investors' confidence 
in the specific enterprises, market demand for the property 
rights, and other economic factors at the time of the 
transaction. 
  Wang said the assessments taken last year will become 
invalid 
one year after the authorities' approval, according to the 
State's Regulations on State Property Appraisals, issued by the 
State Council in 1991. 
  While these appraisal results may help promote the 
enterprises, they also may mislead the public if the results do 
not correspond with the assets' real value. 
  For example, enterprises running in the red may use tricks 
to 
have their intangible assets appraised higher than their real 
value. 
  Such unauthorized activities must be prevented, or they may 
disturb the economic order and affect investors' benefits, Wang 
said.

Suggests Exemption of Value-Added Tax on Real Estate for 
First-Time Developments or Those Signed Before 1 January This 
Year"] 
  [Text] Yuan Zheng, director of the Guangdong Provincial 
Land Administration, has told LIEN HO PAO that Guangdong 
Province recently submitted a proposal to the State Council 
which proposes that when there are concrete rules on the 
imposition of the value-added land tax, consideration should be 
given to interest rates, inflation, risks, and industrial 
policy, and that first-time development projects and real estate 
development projects whose contracts were signed before 1 
January this year should be exempted from the tax. He believes 
that the central authorities will accept this proposal. 
  Yesterday, when interviewed by this reporter by 
long-distance 
telephone call, Yuan Zheng said that the Guangdong Provincial 
Land Administration recently submitted a proposal to the State 
Council, asking that when the central departments concerned 
formulate concrete rules for the imposition of value-added land 
taxes, consideration should be given to the following five 
factors: First, interest rates of credit funds, including those 
for investment, will continue to change; second, inflation will 
increase construction costs; third, there should be compensation 
for the risks that exist in long-term real estate investment; 
fourth, the state should encourage and support real estate 
development projects in some localities; and fifth, the recovery 
of taxes. Therefore, Guangdong is firmly opposed to the 
imposition of value-added land taxes on contracts being signed 
before 1 January 1994 if developments and investments specified 
by such contracts have not been started yet. Guangdong also 
hoped that taxes imposed on real estate contracts signed before 
the enforcement of the tax would be levied according to the 
provisions specified in the contracts. 
  He added: The imposition of value-added land taxes is aimed 
at restraining real estate speculation rather than harming the 
interests of real property developers. However, after the 
central authorities announced the imposition of value-added land 
taxes on 1 January, some overseas investors who had planned to 
start real estate investment projects in Guangdong gave up their 
investment plans. In order to protect the interests of the real 
developers, the relevant departments in Guangdong proposed to 
the central authorities that first-time development projects 
should be exempt from value-added land tax and that it should 
only be imposed on second-hand transactions. At present, 
Shenzhen City exempts first-time development projects from 
value-added taxes; on the other hand, it imposes a 40 to 100 
percent tax on profits earned on real estate transactions. 
Although Shenzhen's tax rates may be a bit too high, the 
practice is close to the taxation arrangements made by the 
central authorities. 
  Yuan Zheng said: At present, land administrative departments 
in many provinces are submitting proposals on the imposition of 
value-added land taxes to the State Council, and the contents of 
the proposals are basically similar to Guangdong's. The 
relevant department of the State Council is now studying various 
proposals from the provinces and foreign investors. It is 
believed that the central authorities will accept these 
proposals and will soon promulgate concrete rules on the 
implementation of the new tax regulations, because the 
imposition of value-added land taxes is not aimed at checking 
normal real estate development. However, Guangdong still hopes 
that greater decision-making powers will be given to the local 
government. 
  When talking about Guangdong's land development measures 
this 
year, Yuan Zheng said: This year, Guangdong Province will 
control the gross quantity of land development. The area of 
land approved for development will be reduced by 10 percent from 
last year's level, because too many development projects were 
approved in the last few years and it will take time for the 
market to digest the supply. In addition, the province will 
successively launch a lot of large-scale construction projects, 
which will need large areas of land in the future. Therefore, 
all cities in Guangdong will reduce the quantity of land 
approved for development this year. 
  This year, Guangdong will also exercise taxation management 
over real estate transactions and conduct property rights 
registration more effectively. The province is now revising its 
regulations on land transfers. At the same time, collective 
land management in rural areas will also be strengthened. 
Relevant measures in this regard are also being drafted, and 
the contents include the scope of management and compensation 
standards for land requisitions. It is expected that the 
regulations will be submitted to this year's provincial people's 
congress session for deliberation and adoption. 
  In addition, this year, Guangdong Province will also further 
strengthen land management in all localities. The provincial 
land administration will announce the invalidity of some 
land-use approvals made by local governments without 
authorization or in violation of established rules and will 
investigate and affix responsibility for such events. If it is 
found that any local government approved too much development of 
too much land, the provincial land administration will deduct 
their land-use quotas next year. 
  Yuan Zheng said that in the aspect of land development, 
Guangdong will stress the development of Zhuhai's western 
district, Yangjiang's Hailin Island, Huizhou's Daya Bay, and 
other new cities. In order to encourage foreign companies to 
invest, Guangdong will continue to provide favorable taxation 
terms and will not impose restrictions on property sales outside 
the mainland.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Government Drafting New Policies for </F>
Auto Industry"] 
  [Text] The long-awaited new policies that are to govern 
the automotive industry for the next seven years are likely to 
be announced this month, according to sources in various 
channels. 
  The sources said government departments involved in drawing 
up the new policies are still busy applying the finishing 
touches. 
  Auto makers and would-be investors at home and overseas are 
nursing high expectations in the belief that the policies would 
bring major changes not only to the industry but to the national 
economy as well. 
  Two years ago, the central government decided that the 
automotive industry should be developed into an economic pillar. 
  Since then the industry and government departments have been 
busy drafting specific measures for rapid growth over a 
seven-year period. 
  Industry officials say that the new policies will direct 
financing to large manufacturing plants while letting 
unproductive ones go bankrupt. 
  More than 120 independently operated plants now assemble 
motor vehicles in China. 
  The sources would not elaborate on the impending policies 
because they have not yet been completed. 
  Different government departments have brought different 
ideas 
to the table and discussions are continuing, said an official 
from the Ministry of Machinery Industry, which oversees car 
manufacturing. 
  The official, who did not want to be publicly identified, 
did 
not say if there is a deadline for finishing the new policies. 
  Many people had expected the policies to be announced by the 
end of last year. Observers said the delay may indicate major 
differences of opinion. 
  Senior government officials recently sketched out the 
outlines of the new policies when they reiterated the principles 
for developing the industry. Among the key points are that: 
  --The government will not authorize new manufacturing 
projects because too many plants now assemble small numbers of 
low-quality vehicles. 
  A senior official with the State Planning Commission has 
said 
that under the new policies, the government will let inefficient 
enterprises wither in the face of competition. 
  -- Government support is to be concentrated on large 
manufacturing plants such as the No 1 Automobile Works in 
Changchun, Jilin Province; a joint venture in Wuhan between the 
Dongfeng Group and the French car maker Peugeot SA; and Shanghai 
Volkswagen, a joint venture. 
  The three auto makers now make the German-designed Audi 100, 
Jetta and Santana models and the French-developed Citroen ZX 
sedan. 
  As for other auto plants run by the aerospace and weaponry 
industries and other sectors that previously had focused on 
defence work, their development should follow a step-by-step 
approach, the official noted. 
  -- The government will not approve new projects that 
assemble 
motor vehicles with imported CKD (complete knock down) 
components. 
  That means State support will go to existing auto makers 
that 
develop new cars by themselves or co-operatively with foreign 
designers. 
  --The State must have a dominant position in the highly 
lucrative automotive industry. 
  Last year, 1.3 million motor vehicles were produced, 
compared 
with 1.08 million in 1992. Sales in 1993 were 115 billion yuan 
($13.22 billion), a big rise from 1992. 
  -- Finally, auto makers should develop and manufacture small 
cars that ordinary Chinese can afford. 
  The average urban worker in China earns about 400 yuan ($46) 
a month while monthly income in rural areas stands at 77.5 yuan 
($9). 
  The country has 1.17 billion people but only 8.3 million 
motor vehicles. About 1 million of all the cars and trucks in 
use are sedans, of which only a small proportion are owned by 
ordinary people. But as the economy continues to grow and 
personal income continues to rise, more people will be able to 
afford a car. 
  In fact, surveys indicate that a growing number of ordinary 
people plan to buy a car in the near future. 
  In Beijing, the number of driving schools has increased to 
200. Just a few years ago there were only 10. 
  Surveys show that tens of thousands of people are being 
trained at the schools. Not surprisingly, though, as demand 
rises so have the fees charged by the schools.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 5 (XINHUA) -- The Santana sedan, 
German designed model, has 82.26 percent of its parts made in 
China, a conference held here yesterday was told. 
  Experts said that the Santana, built by the Shanghai 
Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd, has become the only 
Chinese-made car of a foreign-designed model, for the proportion 
of China-made parts now exceeds 80 percent. 
  The customs department has decreased tariffs by a big margin 
on the car's small amount of imported parts, in order to 
encourage its mass production. 
  To double the annual capacity from 100,000 sedans to 
200,000, 
Shanghai is to inject 2.4 billion yuan into the second-phase 
project which aims to improve its production facilities. 
  The city has also speeded up the development of the car's 
new 
models. A new-look Santana is expected to make its debut this 
autumn. 
  So far, nearly 200 factories and enterprises have produced 
parts for the cars.

<F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column by Wei Li (7279 3680): </F>
"Trade Fairs: From Being a Supplement To Being a Main Sector"] 
  [Text] Fifteen years ago, trade fairs, the "capitalist 
tail" barred from development for many years, emerged as the 
times required. 
  In 1978, trade fairs throughout the country rose from zero 
to 
33,000, and the annual turnover was 12.5 billion yuan, which 
amounted to 5.4 percent of total retail sales that year. They 
merely played a supplementary role in commodity circulation. 
  In the following 15 years, trade fairs in China made amazing 
progress. By the end of 1993, there were a total of 83,001 
trade fairs, which was an increase of 150 percent over 1978, and 
the annual turnover reached 534.3 billion yuan, which was an 
increase of 410 percent over 1978. The annual turnover 
accounted for 28.03 percent of the total volume of retail sales, 
which was an increase of 22.63 percent over 1978. Regarding the 
investment of market construction, it rose from zero in 1978 to 
21.7 billion yuan in 1993. 
  The development of trade fairs solved urban and town 
residents' "shopping basket" problem, which could not be 
overcome for many years. By the end of 1993, the volume of 
vegetable business in trade fairs amounted to 850 percent of 
that of state-run businesses, the volume of dried and fresh 
vegetable business amounted to 740 percent, and the volume of 
meat, poultry, and egg business amounted to 330 percent. Trade 
fairs have become a shopping place which we cannot do without, 
even for a moment. The development of trade fairs has even 
promoted the development of rural economy, settled a large 
number of surplus laborers, brought in more state revenue, and 
given an impetus to the building of cities and towns. Trade 
fairs have become an important channel for commodity circulation. 
  With the participation of state-owned enterprises and 
collective enterprises, trade fairs in China in the 1990's are 
no longer those of a traditional sense, but they are the "grand 
arena" of joint competition between state-owned, collective, 
private enterprises, and individual businessmen in cities and 
towns. Today, trade fairs in China are no longer confined to a 
supplementary role in supplying daily necessities for cities and 
towns, but they are a large market made up of multiple parts, 
including consumer goods, industrial products, means of 
production, and factors of production. According to statistics, 
there are now a total of 4,700 markets of means of production 
and over 1,700 markets of factors of production throughout the 
country.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Beijing Detains Eight Dissidents; </F>
Wang Dan Later Released, But Wei Jingsheng's Whereabouts Are 
Still Unknown"] 
  [Text] In the past few days the Chinese authorities have 
taken sudden action to deal with dissidents. The authorities 
detained and took away eight dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng 
and Wang Dan, over two days. 
  The National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese 
People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] will open in Beijing 
next week, while U.S. Secretary of State Christopher will also 
begin a four-day visit to China next week; the crack down by 
Beijing at this time has caused guessing on all sides. 
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry yesterday confirmed that 
dissidents Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang Jiaqi have 
already been detained, and that Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng have 
been taken away by public security personnel. Wang Dan was 
later released, but Wei Jingsheng is still missing. 
  The human rights organization Asiawatch revealed that two 
dissidents in Shanghai were also detained. Well-known 
pro-democracy movement figure Xu Minli, like Wang Dan, was also 
taken away for a "conversation." The authorities hope that he 
will leave Beijing next week, and Xu Minli was later released. 
  Wang Dan was a student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement. During a long-distance telephone interview yesterday 
with our reporters after his release, he said that on the 
previous evening he and three friends had wanted to go to 
Zhengzhou; when the train was about to leave the station, 
several plain-clothes public security personnel from the First 
Department of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau took 
him to a police substation by the train station. Wang Dan asked 
them: "Why do you want to detain me?" A public security 
personnel said: "You say less words!" 
  Wang Dan said that during the whole period of detention, the 
public security personnel did not say anything other than a few 
words to him. After 15 hours under detention, he found it 
unbearable, and started a fast, consequently, he was released 
early yesterday morning by the public security personnel after 
24 hours of detention. He cited the public security personnel 
as saying that "it was a misunderstanding, and it is not quite 
convenient to tell you why there was misunderstanding." 
  Wang Dan said that the public security personnel who 
detained 
him told him to leave Beijing during the period when American 
officials were visiting and during the NPC and CPPCC. Wang Dan 
refused. He said: "If the authorities do not force me to 
leave, I will not leave Beijing in March." 
  Wei Jingsheng, another well-known pro-democracy movement 
figure, who just met visiting U.S. Undersecretary of State John 
Shattuck on Sunday, was also taken away by public security 
personnel yesterday morning. 
  According to his secretary, at about 1000 [0200 GMT] 
yesterday morning, Wei Jingsheng was taken away by three public 
security personnel from his younger brother's home; he called in 
the afternoon and told her to cancel all his activities for the 
following one or two days, but he did not say why he had been 
arrested or when he would be released. 
  Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for 
his part in the 1978 Democracy Wall movement and who was 
released on parole last September, urged the United States to 
take a tough stance on China's human rights issue when he met 
Shattuck on Sunday. 
  Reporters from this newspaper made a long-distance call to 
Wei Jingsheng's family and asked them whether they knew about 
his arrest, and they replied that they "did not know." They 
also said that Wei stayed at his younger brother's home which 
does not have a telephone; as for this younger brother's 
address, they only said that "it is in Beijing" and "far away." 
They also said that Wei Jingsheng usually "avoids going home as 
much as possible," and that he stayed in the homes of friends or 
relatives in turn. Wei returned home on the afternoon of 2 
March to have lunch and called home on the evening of 3 March 
just to say hello and talk about family matters, without saying 
other things. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday confirmed that the 
public security department had arrested Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan 
Hongbing, and Wang Jiaqi, because they had "violated the 
criminal law." The spokesman said that China's law enforcement 
organs "base on facts, use the law as criterion, and handle 
cases independently." But the spokesman said he did not know 
that Wei Jingsheng had been taken away. Yuan Hongbing is a 
history lecturer at Beijing University; he is well-known for his 
courage in organizing activities opposing the authorities, and 
his book, "The Trends of History," which was published last 
year, caused controversy. Wang Jiaqi is a graduate law student 
at Beijing University, and Zhou Guoqiang is a signatory of the 
"peace charter," as well as the lawyer who represented Han 
Dongfang, a trade union movement leader who is currently 
stranded in Hong Kong. The authorities accused Zhou of 
producing prints on T-shirts to arouse discontent and arrested 
him for this reason. 
  Recently, the United States has kept exerting pressure on 
China on the human rights issue. A number of officials have 
visited China lately. Secretary of State Christopher is 
scheduled for a four-day visit to China beginning next Friday. 
One of his important duties during the trip is to assess 
whether improvements in the area of human rights in China is 
sufficient to enable him to suggest the extension of China's 
most-favored-nation trading status. 
  Undersecretary of State Shattuck, who has just concluded a 
five-day visit to China, yesterday dropped by Hong Kong on his 
way home. He talked about the new round of crack downs on 
dissidents in China and said he did not know whether such a move 
would affect Christopher's visit to China next week. 
  U.S. Undersecretary of State Shattuck said: "Learning about 
China's detention of dissidents, I am very disappointed. I once 
again urge Beijing to release those who have been arrested 
simply because they express their views peacefully." 
  Wang Dan, who was detained for 24 hours, analyzed that there 
might be two reasons why the authorities had detained the 
dissidents: First, Christopher will visit China next week, and 
the authorities fear that U.S. officials will meet these people; 
second, the NPC and the CPPCC will soon be held, and as overseas 
reporters will rush in, dissidents are also a focus of media 
attention. Wang Dan thought that the authorities' move to 
detain dissidents in the past few days was very unwise as it 
will only cause a tense atmosphere. 
  In November 1991, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Baker 
wanted to see Dai Qing, a reporter with GUANGMING RIBAO, but Dai 
Qing went missing before the meeting; afterwards, it was 
confirmed that she had been "invited" to Beidaihe [a beach 
resort in Hebei Province popular with the PRC leadership] to 
"take a rest."

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and agencies] </F>
  [Text] China yesterday detained its best-known dissident, 
Wei Jingsheng, less than six months after he was released from 
more than 14 years in jail. The detention came less than a week 
after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck delivered 
a letter from a group of U.S. Congressmen to President Jiang 
Zemin saying China would lose its Most Favoured Nations (MFN) 
trading status this June if more political prisoners were not 
released. 
  It also came a week before the U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren 
Christopher's visit to China Mr Christopher is to tell Chinese 
leaders that billions of dollars worth of exports to the U.S. 
are in jeopardy because of their human rights record. The 
detentions drew an immediate response from Mr Shattuck who left 
Shanghai yesterday saying he was "disturbed' to hear of the 
crackdown and again urged Beijing to free all political 
prisoners. Asia Watch, the human rights watchdog, last night 
issued a statement urging Mr Christopher to postpone the visit 
to China in view of the latest crackdown. 
  The detention of Wei followed the arrest of at least four 
other dissidents in Beijing on Thursday [3 March] and is being 
seen as part of a concerted effort to keep Beijing's dissident 
community quiet during the forthcoming session of the National 
People's Congress [NPC]. Wei was taken away from his office at 
10 am yesterday by three plain-clothes police officers. 
  Former student leader, Wang Dan, was detained for 24 hours 
along with two friends at Beijing Railway Station on Wednesday 
as they were about to board a train to the central Chinese city 
of Zhengzhou. Mr Wang said yesterday the police gave no 
explanation as to why he was being held. "It was very strange, 
they did not interrogate me, just kept me at the railway police 
station for a few hours," he said. 
  Mr Wang, a key figure in the 1989 student demonstrations, 
said he did not believe the authorities would be able to keep 
Wei locked up for too long. "They will probably detain him for 
a few days and try to persuade him to go out of town for the 
duration of the NPC," Mr Wang said, "but knowing Wei Jingsheng, 
he will not go voluntarily." 
  The Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the detention of 
Wang and Wei but confirmed the arrest on Thursday of three other 
dissidents, including Zhou Guoqiang, the Beijing-based lawyer of 
labour leader Han Dongfang. "Zhou Guoqiang and Wang Jiaqi 
violated criminal laws and were arrested and investigated by the 
(Beijing) judicial authorities," the ministry said yesterday. A 
third dissident, Yuan Hongbing, "took part in a criminal action 
and was arrested and investigated by the Guizhou judicial 
authorities (in southwest China)", it said. 
  In Shanghai at least four activists were detained for 24 
hours-- apparently to stop them from meeting Mr Shattuck. Yang 
Zhou, a veteran activist there, said he was freed yesterday 
afternoon after being locked up at a police station. According 
to Yang, he was scheduled to meet Mr Shattuck on Thursday, but 
was unable to attend because of "strong police surveillance". 
  "I had planned to tell Mr Shattuck that the US should give 
China MFN this year. After all there has been progress on human 
rights in the country over the years," Yang said. "But I am 
very angry over what they did. I have done nothing wrong and 
the detention is absolutely illegal," he added. Three others 
freed yesterday were medical teacher Bao Ge and activists Dai 
Xuezhong and Yang Qinheng.

friends, who received a phone call from him, said that he still 
has to handle some private matters and would return to Beijing 
later today. A Chinese Public Security Ministry spokesman

must abide by during his parole period, he was summoned by 
Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau for a 24-hour period, 
which has ended.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (AFP)--China's most prominent 
dissident Wei Jingsheng has been released after being detained 
for more than 24 hours by public security officials, a friend of 
Wei's said Saturday. 
  The friend said Wei had telephoned at 12:20 p.m (0800 GMT) 
[time as received] to say that his period of interrogation had 
finished and he would be returning to Beijing later Saturday 
evening. 
  Wei, who was picked up by police Friday morning, was taken 
to 
a state guesthouse in the northern outskirts of the city, the 
friend said by telephone. 
  Wei, who was released from prison on September 14 just six 
months short of a 15-year term, was taken into detention just 
four days after meeting in Beijing with U.S. assistant secretary 
for human rights John Shattuck. 
  During the meeting, Wei had urged Washington "to be as tough 
as the Chinese" over the question of human rights in China.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (AFP)--China's most prominent 
dissident -- Wei Jingsheng -- has been released after he was 
detained for more than 24 hours by public security officials, a 
friend of Wei's said Saturday. 
  The friend told AFP that Wei had telephoned at 12:20 p.m 
(0800 GMT) [time as received] to say his interrogation had 
finished and he would be returning to Beijing later Saturday 
evening. 
  Wei was picked up by police Friday morning and taken to a 
state guesthouse in the northern outskirts of the city, the 
friend said by telephone. Wei, who was released from prison on 
September 14, just six months short of a 15-year term, was taken 
into detention four days after meeting US Assistant Secretary of 
State for Human Rights John Shattuck in Beijing. During the 
meeting, Wei had urged Washington "to be as tough as the 
Chinese" over the question of human rights in China. 
  Wei had played a leading role in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall 
movement when he called for full democracy in China and 
denounced paramount leader Deng Xiaoping as a despot. His 
detention this week came amid a crackdown on political 
dissidents that saw at least seven activists picked up in a 
police sweep in Beijing and Shanghai. 
  Veteran Shanghai dissident Bao Ge, who was taken into police 
custody in the eastern city on Thursday evening, said he had 
been detained for 22 hours in an apparent attempt to prevent him 
meeting with Shattuck. 
  Bao, contacted by telephone, said that prior to his 
detention 
he had been approached through an intermediary about a possible 
meeting with Shattuck, who had a brief stopover in Shanghai 
Thursday after his Beijing visit. Although his interrogators 
had not mentioned Shattuck by name, the 30-year-old Bao said 
they had warned him against meeting foreign officials. He also 
received a strong warning to refrain from any protest activity 
during the visit to China of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa from March 19-21. 
  Bao was a leading spokesman for a grassroots pressure group 
that pushed the Chinese government to reopen the issue of 
Japanese war reparations. He had been detained by the 
authorities ahead of the state visit to China by Japanese 
Emperor Akihito in October 1992. 
  Friends of another prominent dissident, labour activist Zhou 
Guoqiang, who was picked up Thursday in Beijing for questioning 
about alleged anti-government activities, said they had had no 
news of his whereabouts or if he was still being detained.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, March 6 (AFP)--China's most prominent 
dissident Wei Jingsheng has returned home after being detained 
for more than 24 hours by public security officials on the 
outskirts of Beijing, a relative said Sunday [6 March]. Wei 
returned to the Chinese capital late Saturday and "went to sleep 
very late" at his brother's house, the relative said by 
telephone, but declined to give details of his ordeal. 
  The dissident, who had been released from prison on 
September 
14 just six months short of a 15-year term, was picked up by 
police early Friday and taken to a state guest house on the 
northeastern outskirts of the capital. He telephoned friends at 
12:20 p.m. (0800 GMT) Saturday to say his interrogation had 
finished and that he would return home later that day. [passage

<F P=106> [Report: "Chinese Dissidents Wei Jingsheng, Bao Ge, and </F>
Yang Zhou Have Been Released After Detention, at Least Other 
Four Are Still Under Detention"] 
  [Excerpts] Democracy activists Wei Jingsheng, Bao Ge, and 
Yang Zhou have been released after a short detention by the 
Chinese authorities. It is believed, however, that a few 
dissidents are still being detained. U.S. President Clinton has 
criticized the detention of Wei Jingsheng and has asserted that 
this incident will affect Sino-U.S. relations. U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren M. Christopher has denied that he would cancel 
his visit to China -- scheduled for this week -- because of this 
incident. [passage omitted] 
  When interviewed by a MING PAO reporter yesterday, Wei 
Jingsheng's family said that he had phoned them yesterday 
afternoon to send his regards to his father and tell them that 
he himself was quite all right. Wei Jingsheng did not mention 
that he had been taken away by the police, and his father 
refused to further confirm his whereabouts. 
  An assistant to Wei Jingsheng said that she received a phone 
call from Wei Jingsheng around 1200 yesterday. Wei was calling 
from somewhere in the suburbs of Beijing, asking her to convey 
the message that he had been released. Wei said that he would 
return to the downtown area in the evening after meeting with a 
friend at Changping in the northern suburbs of Beijing. 
  Wei Jingsheng was one of the key figures in the 1978 
Democracy Wall Movement. He was sentenced to 15 years of 
imprisonment by the authorities and was released on parole in 
last September. He was taken away by three policemen from his 
younger brother's home in the morning of the day before 
yesterday. Since that time, his whereabouts have been unknown. 
  During yesterday's phone call, Wei Jingsheng confirmed to 
his 
assistant that he had been officially "summoned, detained, and 
interrogated" by the public security sector. He was allowed to 
go home by the time he made the call, but he did not say whether 
his movements would be restricted, and he did not explain why he 
had been detained and interrogated. He just said that he had 
been treated well. Wei Jingsheng's family and his assistant 
believe that the purpose behind his detention and interrogation 
was to embarrass the United States, which has consistently been 
pressuring Beijing to release political prisoners. 
  Meanwhile, Bao Ge, another dissident who has been calling 
for 
war reparations by Japan, was also released yesterday afternoon 
after being detained by the Shanghai public security bureau for 
22 hours since Thursday [3 March] evening. 
  Bao Ge said he had earlier planned to arrange for a meeting 
with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck through 
a go- between, but he was detained before any arrangements were 
made. Although those who interrogated him did not mention 
Shattuck by name, they warned him not to meet with any foreign 
officials and strongly warned Bao Ge not to try to organize any 
demonstrations during the Japanese prime minister's visit to 
China. 
  On the other hand, Shanghai dissident Yang Zhou, who had 
arranged an appointment with Shattuck through the U.S. Embassy 
[as published] in Shanghai, found his home under surveillance by 
some plain-clothes men the day before yesterday, and he dared 
not go out for the appointment. He was later taken away by some 
uniformed policemen and detained for 24 hours until his release 
yesterday. 
  Yang Zhou said that, as far as he knows, at least five other 
dissidents were detained, specifically, Yang Jingheng, Dai 
Xuezhong, Bao Ge, Ma Wei, and Gong Xingnan. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Geoff Crothall in Beijing, Simon Beck in Washington, and </F>
agencies] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing police yesterday released China's most 
famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, after taking him in for 
questioning on Friday morning. But his detention provoked 
strong condemnation from the United States and further put at 
risk the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading 
status. Wei, 44, was held overnight at a Public Security Bureau 
guesthouse in the northern suburbs of Beijing before being freed 
yesterday afternoon. 
  It is understood Wei has been warned to keep a low profile 
or 
preferably leave the city altogether during the upcoming 
National People's Congress and the visit to Beijing of US 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Wei has been under 
constant surveillance since his release on parole from more than 
14 years in jail last September and has already received several 
warnings to keep away from other dissidents and foreign 
journalists. But these are warnings he has consistently 
ignored, and most analysts were not surprised when he was picked 
up. 
  Wei, commonly accepted as the founder of China's fledgling 
democracy movement, called an associate yesterday from the 
Beijing suburb of Changping to say he was now free and expected 
to be home later in the day. "He called to say he is free, his 
detainment is finished. He will have dinner and return to 
Beijing," the friend said. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to Wei, at least four other dissidents in 
Beijing 
were arrested or were missing from their homes. Half a dozen 
activists in Shanghai were also rounded up to keep them from 
talking to Mr Clinton's top human rights official, John 
Shattuck, who was in China last week to prepare for the 
Christopher visit, dissidents said. 
  Wei, who became a potent symbol of China's lack of freedom 
of 
expression during his time in prison, had bluntly told Mr 
Shattuck, assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Affairs, that the US had to be tough on China to 
get progress. Friends of the democracy wall activist say, 
however, it is very unlikely that Wei will agree to leave 
Beijing voluntarily or stay out of view during the NPC. "He is 
a very strong willed person and very committed to the cause of 
democracy," a friend said. "He will not bow to the demands of 
the authorities without a fight. 
  Despite the release of Wei, three other dissidents arrested 
last week were still behind bars. Zhou Guoqiang, the 
Beijing-based lawyer of former labour leader Han Dongfang, law 
professor and editor Yuan Hongbing, and one of his students Wang 
Jiaqi were detained in the early hours of Thursday [3 March] 
morning and face serious charges which could result in lengthy 
prison terms. Zhou, a member of the "Peace Charter" group, was 
accused of "colluding with hostile foreign forces" and 
"disturbing social order". Yuan and Wang were accused by the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry of unspecified "criminal" activities. 
  Shanghai's most prominent dissident Yang Zhou and at least 
five other local activists were rounded up by police during Mr 
Shattuck's stay in the city, Mr Yang revealed yesterday. Other 
activists fled the city before the US envoy arrived, he said. 
  Mr Yang, a veteran of China's pro-democracy movement and a 
founding member of the Shanghai-based Association for Human 
Rights, said his home was surrounded by plain-clothes Public 
Security officials on Thursday, when he was due to see Mr 
Shattuck in a meeting arranged by the US consulate in Shanghai. 
"I didn't dare to go out. I knew that if I did I wouldn't get 
anywhere," he said. Uniformed police later entered his home and 
took him into detention for 24 hours before freeing him on 
Friday. They warned him of harsher action unless he changed his 
ways. 
  Mr Yang said at least five other dissidents, who had been 
involved in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and an earlier 
round of pro-democracy ferment in 1978, were also detained. 
They were Yang Qingheng, Dai Xuezhong, Bao Ge, Ma Wei and Gong 
Xingnan. Bao Ge, who is leading a battle for compensation from 
Japan for its atrocities against the Chinese during World War 
II, said he was held for two days. 
  Meanwhile, five reporters from US-based news organisations 
taken on a government-arranged trip to a remote prison in 
China's northeast were not allowed to speak to a prisoner jailed 
there for being a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, 
they said yesterday. While prison officials denied Liu Gang, 
33, or any other prisoners were tortured, as alleged by human 
rights groups, the reporters could not verify that for 
themselves. 
  The journalists who went to the Lingyuan Number Two Labour 
Reform Detachment in Liaoning Province were shown videotapes of 
Liu, who was number three on the list of most wanted students 
after the army crushed the pro-democracy protests on June 4, 
1989. At one point, officials told them to go to a window where 
they could see Liu, sentenced to six years in jail in 1991, 
walking with guards. They were then shown Liu smoking a 
cigarette and talking to guards on a closed-circuit television 
link that had no sound.

  [Text] Beijing, March 6 (AFP)--Chinese police detained 
1989 pro-democracy movement student leader Zhai Weimin on Sunday 
[6 March], continuing a crackdown on dissidents ahead of the US 
secretary of state's visit this week. A friend of Zhai said by 
telephone that the dissident, who was sixth on the government's 
"most wanted list" following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, was 
picked up at 2:40 p.m. (0640 GMT) by four policemen driving a 
red Volkswagen Santana as he walked along a street in Beijing's 
university area. The dissident was released from jail on 
September 13, after serving a 3-1/2 year term for 
"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement." 
  Chinese police have detained at least eight political 
activists in recent days, including Wei Jingsheng, the country's 
most famous dissident. Wei was released Saturday after spending 
more than 24 hours being interrogated on the northern outskirts 
of Beijing. He returned home late Saturday. "This is all part 
of the same thing as Wei," said Zhai's friend, who saw the 
dissident being taken away by car. "It's still going on, it's 
not over. They release some, but they keep on detaining others."

<F P=106> [Report: "Two Former Leaders of Beijing Students Campaign </F>
Are Again Detained by Public Security Authorities"] 
  [Excerpts] John Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of 
state for human rights and humanitarian affairs, yesterday 
released a statement in Hong Kong, condemning China for 
detaining dissidents. Shattuck also warned that the action taken 
by the Chinese authorities over the past few days had cast a 
pall over Secretary of State Warren Christopher's forthcoming 
visit to China. It was on the same day that Shattuck released 
his statement that the Chinese authorities detained two more 
former Beijing student movement leaders, namely, Zhai Weimin and 
Ma Shaofang. 
  An informed source in Beijing revealed that Zhai Weimin, a 
student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was detained 
by the police yesterday afternoon and his whereabouts are 
unknown. Another student leader, Ma Shaofang, was stopped and 
detained by the police in Tianjin, enroute Beijing, and then 
sent back to Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province under escort. 
  A friend of Zhai Weimin said Zhai, who came to Beijing from 
his home province, Henan, was picked up by some policemen near 
the Qinghua University campus in Beijing's Haidian District 
around 1440 yesterday. His whereabouts are still not known. 
His friend estimates that there are two possibilities: Like 
the case of Wang Dan some days ago, Zhai Weimin may be released 
in a couple of days after being warned by the police; or he may 
be sent back to his home province of Henan under escort. 
  AFP quoted a friend of Zhai as saying that the incident took 
place when the 26-year-old Zhai was walking with a child along a 
street near Qinghua University. A red Volkswagen Santana 
suddenly arrived and four policemen got out of the car and 
picked him up. 
  Meanwhile, according to one of Ma Shaofang's friends, Ma 
originally planned to arrive in Beijing on 3 March from his home 
province of Jiangsu but he has not yet shown up in Beijing. A 
phone call from Ma's family yesterday said he had been stopped 
and detained by the Jiangsu provincial police a few days ago in 
Tianjin on his way to Beijing and he had been brought back to 
Nanjing by the police. What is going to happen to him is still 
unknown. 
  Zhai Weimin and Ma Shaofang are the 12th and 13th dissidents 
detained by the authorities in Beijing and Shanghai over the 
past four days. Some of the detained dissidents have been 
released, among whom are Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan. Wei 
Jingsheng met with Shattuck, a senior U.S. State Department 
official who was visiting China to make preparations for 
Christopher's China mission. But, while Shattuck was still in 
China, Wei Jingsheng was detained for 24 hours and then 
released. The official XINHUA News Agency yesterday released a 
statement saying that Wei Jingsheng was summoned by the police 
according to the law because of his violation of parole 
regulations. 
  An informed source from the Beijing Municipality Public 
Security Bureau said the few democratic activists' being 
summoned for interrogation over the past few days had little 
link with the convening of the National People's Congress 
session and the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference National Committee session but, rather, is related to 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to China 
later this week. The authorities concerned intend to warn 
democratic activists not to "speak carelessly" during 
Christopher's visit to Beijing. [passage omitted] 
  The dissidents who were taken away by the police over the 
past four days are Zhai Weimin, Ma Shaofang, Wei Jingsheng, Wang 
Dan, Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, Wang Jiaqi, Xu Wenli, Bao Ge, 
Yang Zhou, Yang Jingheng, Dai Xuezhong, Ma Wei, and Gong 
Xingnan. It has been confirmed that Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, Xu 
Wenli, Bao Ge, and Yang Zhou are among those who have already 
been released after detention.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Excerpt] China's best-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, 
"voluntarily" left Beijing yesterday for an undisclosed 
destination because of his "poor health", his secretary said 
last night. Mr Wei, who had been detained by police for 24 
hours two days ago, told his secretary Tong Yi that he would be 
leaving Beijing for a few days and could not say when he would 
be back. 
  Mr Wei had earlier in the day arranged to meet members of 
the 
foreign media to discuss his recent detention but at about 5 pm 
told Ms Tong that he would be leaving the city with a few 
friends for an undisclosed destination. Asked if she believed 
Mr Wei's assertion he was leaving Beijing of his own free will, 
Ms Tong said: "He is my boss. Of course, I believe him," 
adding that Mr Wei did appear to be "rather weary". 
  Most observers believe, however, that Mr Wei was persuaded 
to 
take an "all expenses paid vacation" by the police during his 
detention last week, so that he would not be around during 
United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to 
Beijing on Friday. 
  Mr Wei's office in the northeast of Beijing was yesterday 
surrounded by plainclothes police, who turned back journalists 
hoping to interview the Democracy Wall veteran. Ms Tong, who 
met Mr Wei after his release on Saturday, said that he did not 
discuss with her what had happened during his detention but 
stressed that he had not been formally arrested and had been 
well treated. 
  As Mr Wei was leaving Beijing, the authorities' clampdown on 
dissidents continued with the detention of another former 
student leaders Zhai Weimin. Zhai was reportedly picked up in 
Beijing's university district by four plainclothes police 
officers and taken away for questioning. The former Beijing 
Economics Institute student, who ranked sixth on the 
Government's 1989 most wanted list, was released from jail last 
September after serving a 3 1/2-year prison term for 
"counter-revolutionary incitement and propaganda". 
  Meanwhile, one of the four dissidents rounded up in the 
early 
hours of Thursday morning was released apparently without being 
charged yesterday morning. Qian Yumin, a member of Han 
Dongfang's Autonomous Workers' Federation, was freed after being 
warned to stay out of trouble during Mr Christopher's visit. 
The other three dissidents arrested on Thursday -- Zhou 
Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi are understood to be 
still in detention and face criminal charges. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Ministry of 
Public Security denied here today that some "dissidents" have 
been detained as reported by press units in Hong Kong and 
overseas. 
  In recent days, Hong Kong and foreign press units carried 
reports saying that China has "detained more dissidents", and 
prepared a list of about a dozen people. 
  Sources from the ministry said that only Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan 
Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi are being investigated according to law 
by public and state security organs as they are suspected of 
being involved in unlawful acts in inciting turmoil and 
disrupting social order or in criminal cases. 
  The rest of the people on the list, including Wei Jingsheng 
and Wang Dan, are not put under detention, the sources said. 
  It is learned that Wei Jingsheng yesterday submitted an 
application to the Public Security Department to go out of 
Beijing for some private matter and his application has been 
approved.

<F P=106> [By New York-based special correspondent Tseng Hui-yen (2582 </F>
1979 3601): "Fujian Religious Leader Pan Yiyuan Has Been 
Detained for Investigation"] 
  [Text] On 2 March, Pan Yiyuan [3382 0001 0337], the leader 
of the Protestant Family Church in Fujian's Zhangzhou City, was 
"detained for investigation" by the mainland authorities on the 
charge that he "carried out underground religious activities." 
He is currently detained at Zhangzhou City Public Security 
Bureau Custody House. His relatives and religious friends in 
the United States revealed the above-mentioned information to 
reporters from this newspaper. They hope that international 
human rights organizations can help, and they have urged the 
mainland to improve its human rights conditions. 
  According to information, 58-year-old Pan Yiyuan is a 
devoted 
Christian. After retiring from Zhangzhou Agricultural Bank, he 
devoted all his energy to carrying out Family Church activities 
with his mother, Xu Birui. On the morning of 2 March, seven 
policemen entered Pan Yiyuan's home and took some books on the 
Christian faith, tapes, "service books," "Pan Yiyuan's rebirth 
testimony," private letters, pictures, and a diary (this was 
proved by the "list of items in custody" issued by the public 
security bureau). After the search, they told Pan Yiyuan to 
report to the public security bureau on the same afternoon, but 
when he arrived there they told him that he was under arrest for 
carrying out underground religious activities. 
  Among the charges laid against him are: First, not joining 
the "three autonomy's" church but disseminating words 
confronting the "three autonomy's" church; second, reading and 
keeping Christian books printed overseas, as well as tapes 
preaching religion; third, maintaining links with Christians 
outside the country (in fact they are his relatives); fourth, 
maintaining links with Christians inside the country and 
disseminating words of grievance. Afterwards, Pan Yiyuan's wife 
received from Zhangzhou City Public Security Bureau a "notice to 
the family members of the person being detained and 
investigated," but she has not been allowed to see Pan Yiyuan up 
to now. 
  The house of Xu Birui, Pan Yiyuan's 83-year-old mother, was 
also searched on the same day. Although the authorities did not 
detain her, they ordered her to report her religious activities 
to the public security bureau between 1400 and 1700 every day.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- China's legislature 
today carried a law on protection of investments of Taiwan 
compatriots and a supplementary decision on severely punishing 
illegal emigration and border crossing. 
  The two laws were passed at the closing ceremony of the 
Sixth 
Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress (NPC), over which its chairman, Qiao Shi, presided. 
  The 15-clause investment law is intended to protect Taiwan 
investors' legal interests in the country's mainland, and 
promote economic exchanges across the Taiwan straits, according 
to officials from the NPC law committee. 
  The law stipulates that Taiwan investments will not be 
nationalized or requisitioned; under special circumstances or 
for the public good, the state may purchase them through legal 
procedures and the investors will be reimbursed. 
  The investments, possessions, property rights, profits and 
other legal incomes of Taiwan compatriots in the mainland are 
protected by the law and are allowed to be transferred or 
inherited, the law states. 
  Taiwan investors will receive decisions, positive or 
negative, from government bodies within 45 days of their 
applications being submitted, the law also said. 
  Profits and other rightful income of Taiwan investors can be 
remitted back to Taiwan other regions outside the mainland. 
  "This will guarantee that the interests of Taiwan investors 
will not be harmed by red tape," a senior lawmaker said. 
  The supplementary decision on punishing "snake heads," as 
mercenaries engaged in illegal emigrants trafficking have been 
dubbed, says that the worst criminals may face life imprisonment 
or the death penalty. 
  This tough supplement to the country's criminal law will 
effectively curb the crime of illegal emigration and border 
crossing, legislators said, and order on the country's borders 
will be better maintained. 
  The new law provides that the worst criminals, recidivists, 
or ones who cause severe wounding or death to illegal emigrants, 
may be given sentences of seven years to life imprisonment. 
  Those who murder, wound, rape or sell illegal emigrants whom 
they organized, or wound or murder border inspectors, may be 
sentenced to death, according to the law. 
  The NPC Standing Committee ratified nine new deputies' 
membership of the National People's Congress. Five NPC deputies 
died since last year, one resigned, and two were deprived of 
their seats because of corrupt practices. 
  The NPC Standing Committee approved the draft agenda for the 
13-day Second Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, beginning on 
March 10, and the draft list of the presidium and secretary 
general of the full session. These will be decided by its 
preparatory meeting. 
  The committee also approved the work report of the NPC 
Standing Committee for deliberation at the full session. 
  A draft decision to grant the Xiamen economic zone 
province-like legislative rights will be further deliberated in 
the coming national session, according to the meeting. 
  The committee also ratified China's entry to several 
international treaties and several appointments and replacements.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Gan Zhebin (3927 0772 2430): "Looking </F>
Ahead to the Forthcoming `Two Sessions': The Forthcoming `Two 
Sessions' Will Continue To Show Concern Over the Hong Kong 
Issue"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The second 
session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and the second session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], to be held on 8 
and 10 March respectively -- though they are but regular 
meetings of this term of the NPC and CPPCC -- have attracted 
much attention from within and outside China because they are 
facing a number of important matters. Of these matters, the 
Hong Kong issue is bound to become one of the hot topics for the 
NPC deputies and the CPPCC national committee members during the 
"two sessions," and the keynote on the Hong Kong issue set by 
the "two sessions" will definitely also attract attention from 
people in and outside China. 
  People must still remember that, at the first session of the 
Eighth NPC in March last year, the Chinese Government, for the 
first time since China and Britain solved the question of Hong 
Kong between them, leveled criticisms on the British Government 
in the "Government Work Report." One year has passed. The 
unfriendliness and lack of cooperation demonstrated by the 
British side on the Hong Kong issue have aggravated. So what 
comment will this year's "Government Work Report" make on the 
same issue? It is believed that this will be the focus of 
attention. 
  Over the past year, because the British side always held on 
to the position which violated the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, defied convergence with the Basic Law, and 
contravened the agreements and understandings reached between 
China and Britain, the Sino-British talks on the arrangements 
for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong broke down. On 24 
February, Chris Patten's partial constitutional reform bill 
characterized by the "three violations" was adopted by the 
British Hong Kong Legislative Council, after which the British 
side unilaterally disclosed the contents of the talks, 
misrepresenting and attacking the posture of the Chinese side. 
The Chinese side was compelled to publicize the relevant truths 
to ensure a correct understanding of the facts. It is 
foreseeable that the series of moves made by the British side -- 
which intended to confront the Chinese side and sabotage the 
smooth transition and transfer of sovereignty in Hong Kong -- 
will evoke strong criticisms from the NPC deputies and CPPCC 
members during the "two sessions." 
  Last year's first session of the Eighth NPC decided to set 
up 
a Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee 
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. After it was 
founded last July, the PWC quickly began its work and, after 
adopting the work programs of all its subgroups at its second 
plenary session last December, entered the stage of substantive 
work. As a working organ subordinate to the NPC standing 
committee, the PWC will be able to hand in an excellent progress 
report to the nation at the upcoming NPC session. There is not 
much time left before Hong Kong returns to China. A great deal 
of convergence-related work in political, economic, legal, and 
other fields, has to be done. Therefore, as Premier Li Peng put 
it, the burden on the PWC is even heavier, its responsibility 
greater, and its role bigger. After the forthcoming "two 
sessions," the PWC is bound to step up its work and speed up its 
progress. 
  The NPC and the CPPCC national committee are the embodiment 
of the will of the state as well as the people's will. The NPC 
deputies and the CPPCC members show of concern on the Hong Kong 
issue demonstrates the Chinese people's longing for national 
reunification and their wish that the great construct of "one 
country, two systems" will be smoothly realized first in Hong 
Kong. The smooth implementation of "one country, two systems" in 
Hong Kong will play an effective exemplary role in the process 
of solving the Taiwan issue and will help the reunification of 
the motherland come to pass at an early date. 
  It is now March, and spring has arrived early in Beijing. 
Hong Kong's NPC deputies and CPPCC members will attend the 
great events, participate in government and political affairs, 
and offer valuable advice. A separate constituency was set up 
for Hong Kong members at the first session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee last year. Now the CPPCC members from Hong 
Kong have served a full year in their office. They, faced with 
the wind and rain in Hong Kong of the past year, have given all 
their strength. They will definitely offer good ideas and good 
suggestions during the upcoming "two sessions" and will do their 
utmost to ensure the smooth return of Hong Kong to China. 
  "A thousand sails pass by the shipwreck; ten thousand 
saplings shoot up beyond the withered tree." Hong Kong's 
destiny is, after all, in the hands of the Chinese people, 
including the Hong Kong compatriots. The uncooperative attitude 
of the British side will not in the least hold back the forward 
momentum of the wheel of history. During the "two sessions," 
the NPC deputies and the CPPCC members will once again give 
voice to the aspirations of the Chinese people on the question 
of Hong Kong.

"Government Work Report, Which Consists of Seven Parts, To 
Implement 20-Character Principle"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Mar--According to an authoritative 
person here, the central top hierarchy will, in the next couple 
of days, discuss and revise for the last time the government 
work report which the State Council will submit to the National 
People's Congress [NPC] on 10 March for deliberation. The draft 
for the solicitation of opinions defines the work principle for 
1994 as "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
wider to the outside world, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability" [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda 
kaifang, cujin fazhan, baochi wending 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 
0553 2395 7245, 2368 1129 7030 2397, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 
2170 4489 1353] and sets economic growth for 1994 at 9 percent. 
  An authoritative person said: The draft government work 
report for the solicitation of opinions, which has been drafted 
under the leadership of Wang Wangkui, deputy director of the 
State Council Research Office, has been revised three times 
following the extensive solicitation of opinions from various 
quarters. The central top hierarchy will discuss and revise the 
draft for the fourth time in the next couple of days. The main 
theme of the draft government work report is to comprehensively 
and vigorously advance the modernization process in line with 
the socialist market economic framework formulated by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. However, the 
20 characters, "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open wider 
to the outside world, promote development, and maintain 
stability," which was put forward by General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin and endorsed by the CPC Central Committee, will be taken 
as the principle for overall work in 1994. 
  It was learned that the draft government work report for the 
solicitation of opinions is divided into seven parts. The 
contents include a review of work in 1993 and stress the need to 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 
2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660] growth in the national economy, 
vigorously advance reform of the economic structure, establish a 
new socialist market economic structure, strive to create and 
preserve a harmonious and stable environment for social life, 
and promote the reunification cause of the motherland and 
diplomatic work. 
  The authoritative person said: On striving to create and 
preserve a harmonious and stable environment for social life, 
the report especially maintains that, in strengthening public 
order, it is necessary to crack down hard on criminal offenders, 
continuously investigate and deal with major and important 
cases, resolutely wipe out pornography and eliminate the "six 
vices," and quickly strengthen the ranks of public security, the 
procuratorate, and the judiciary. This part also deals with 
such issues as nationality unity, the development of democracy 
and the legal system, and stepping up the modernization of 
national defense. The authoritative person said: In the draft 
government work report, promoting the cause of reunifying the 
motherland is treated as a special section, which touches on the 
issues of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. On the Hong Kong issue, 
it especially stresses that attention should be paid to doing a 
good job of work in the transition period and the transfer of 
power in 1997.

  [Text] Beijing, March 6 (AFP)--Criminals responsible for 
organising illegal emigration from China face severe punishment, 
including the death penalty, under a tough new law passed last 
week, the PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO] said Sunday [6 March]. 
The law, passed at a National People's Congress standing 
committee session Saturday [5 March], warns that "snake heads," 
or criminals who are behind illegal immigration rackets, will 
face jail terms of between seven years and life for their 
involvement in illegal emigration schemes, the report said. 
Those guilty of the murder, injury, rape or sale of illegal 
emigrants or of the murder or injury of border inspectors may be 
sentenced to death, the new law states. 
  Previously, the maximum penalty for organising illegal 
emigration was five years imprisonment, but a surge last year in 
the numbers of Chinese paying snake heads up to 30,000 dollars 
to be smuggled abroad on decrepit ships has forced the 
authorities to stiffen punishment. In the most spectacular 
case, six illegal immigrants died when almost 300 of them tried 
to swim and wade ashore after their ship, the Golden Venture, 
ran aground in New York City in June.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] The conservative wing of the Chinese Communist 
Party has made a bold bid for power by preparing plans to expose 
patriarch Deng Xiaoping's alleged responsibility for the 
Tiananmen Sguare massacre. In a campaign codenamed "The Two 
Opens", the Maoists plan to launch a blistering attack on how Mr 
Deng and his faction had "opened the door to capitalism and 
opened fire on the residents of Beijing" in the early hours of 
June 4, 1989. Chinese sources said yesterday that while the 
full blitz would not be launched until Mr Deng's death, the 
first salvoes had been fired in view of the rapidly declining 
health of the 89-year-old senior leader. 
  The sources said while the leftists had denigrated the 
student demonstrations of early 1989 as a sign of "bourgeois 
liberalisation" they had always disputed the need to use live 
ammunition against the students and citizens of the capital. 
They said the ideologues had collected "impressive black 
material" that would point to Mr Deng, then chairman of the 
policy-setting Central Military Commission, as the leader who 
gave the order for soldiers to shoot to kill. 
  "Seeing how they have been marginalised by the development 
of 
reforms, the conservatives hope they can win widespread support 
by spearheading the drive to overturn the verdict on June 4," a 
source said. "While the ideologues will never support the 
prodemocracy movement, they figure they can deal a body blow to 
Deng's reputation by laying bare his June 4-related `guilt'." 
  China analysts said Mr Deng had never admitted 
responsibility 
for ordering the troops to open fire. Sources close to the 
People's Liberation Army said after the massacre that detailed 
information and documents on the chain of events that led to the 
shoot-to-kill order had been obliterated or covered up. 
However, a party elder claimed in late 1992 that he had 
recordings and other material proving it was Mr Deng who made 
the fateful decision. The sources said it was likely the 
conservatives would publicise some of this evidence immediately 
upon Mr Deng's death. 
  At the same time, leftist commissars have in official 
journals under their control started an open campaign against Mr 
Deng's "re-introduction of capitalism". The attack has focused 
on attempts by the Deng faction to diminish the "leading 
position of the state sector" in the economy through 
quasi-privatisation. 
  In a recent issue of In Search of Truth [QIUSHI], a 
commentator on the leftist journal accused certain cadres of 
"failing to make a distinction between the socialist market 
economy and the capitalistic market economy". Other articles in 
the same journal attacked the conversion of state-owned 
enterprises into shareholding companies as evidence of 
"sidelining state planning" and "curtailing state ownership". 
Referring to Mr Deng's famous doctrine that "productivity is 
the only criterion" for assessing a policy, the ideologues 
criticised unnamed cadres who said the question of "ownership" 
should be dropped so long as economic development could be 
expedited.

<F P=106> [Speech by Jiang Zemin to the Third Plenary Session of the </F>
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on 28 February] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- This plenary session of 
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is very 
necessary to sum up the anticorruption drive in the previous 
period and make plans for the next stage in accordance with the 
Central Committee's suggestions. Comrade Wei Jianxing delivered 
a very good report to the session. I am in full agreement. We 
should redouble our efforts and make new progress on top of the 
achievements already made. 
  Here I would like to address the following three issues: 
<H3>  1. A Realistic Assessment of the Achievements of the 
Anticorruption Drive in the Previous Period </H3>
  Half a year has passed since the Central Committee announced 
last August specific plans for intensifying the anticorruption 
drive, improving party work style, and promoting clean 
government. In assessing the work in the previous stage, we 
should, I think, stress the following four points: 
  A) We have been fairly successful. Taken together, party 
committees, governments, discipline inspection, supervision, and 
judicial departments at all levels have worked actively and done 
a great deal of painstaking work in implementing the Central 
Committee's plans. We have, by and large, achieved the expected 
results. The broad ranks of cadres and people have responded 
positively and offered active support to the party and 
government in intensifying the anticorruption drive. Thanks to 
the common efforts of all quarters, we have achieved varying 
degrees of success in the three tasks set by the Central 
Committee for the near future. The momentum of spreading 
corrupt manifestations has been halted. The results are even 
more pronounced in localities and departments that have done a 
better job in implementing this work. Although the 
anticorruption drive involves considerable difficulties, we are 
able to cut, step by step, corrupt phenomena to a minimum so 
long as the leadership takes it seriously, enlists the 
participation of the masses, and works together with them with 
one heart and one mind. 
  B) The work has proceeded in a healthy manner. In setting 
the short-term plan for fighting corruption, the Central 
Committee pronounced a number of specific principles and 
policies which have fundamentally guaranteed that this work will 
be closely integrated with reform and construction. Practice 
has shown that this work has -- rather than standing in the way 
of reform and construction -- served as an important guarantee 
for reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  C) Judging from the problems that have been exposed, corrupt 
phenomena are serious. Corruption has penetrated into broad 
sections of our society; in particular, it is corroding our 
party and government organs and the ranks of cadres. Criminal 
offenses including abusing powers for personal gains, 
participating in corrupt practices in violation of the law, 
taking or demanding bribes are widespread to an alarming degree. 
The situation tells us that if we do not fight this hard battle 
with resolution, the party and state are in deed in danger of 
collapse. 
  D) The tasks are tremendous and we must not slacken our 
efforts. In view of the actual problems that are out there and 
the people's demands of us, the work we have done so far falls 
considerably short. Many problems have not been solved well and 
the masses remain dissatisfied. The work has been implemented 
unevenly from region to region and from department to 
department. Some localities and department relayed the plans 
and arrangements but did not pay enough attention to 
implementing them afterwards. Some even just went through the 
motions. Some localities and departments were guilty of gross 
protectionism and there has been obstruction and resistance to 
the investigations of major cases. Some leading cadres who 
still entertain all sorts of misconceptions about the 
anticorruption drive have not displayed adequate initiative. 
All in all, we must continue to pay close attention to the 
anticorruption drive. In short, we must affirm the 
achievements, take note of the problems, sum up experience, keep 
a clear head, and redouble our efforts to implement the 
anticorruption drive well. 
<H3>  2. Several Suggestions for the Anticorruption Drive in the 
Next Stage </H3>
  A) The Central Committee has set the basic principles and 
overall situation for the work of the whole party in 1994. The 
anticorruption drive must subordinate and serve these principles 
and overall situation and it must be implemented in a deepgoing, 
sustained, and more effective manner. This is the general 
requirement. 
  B) The anticorruption drive cannot be accomplished 
overnight. 
Hence, we should solve problems one by one, investigate cases 
one by one, and deepen the drive step by step. A slightest 
relaxation of guard may spoil all that has been achieved. We 
must be prepared to fight a protracted battle and push the drive 
forward phase by phase. We must never provide a "pliable 
environment" for corrupt behavior; and we must never allow the 
corrupt elements to act willfully and get off scot-free. 
  C) In addition to the three main tasks set by the Central 
Committee last August, the current session has put forward some 
new requirements. All localities and departments must combine 
these three tasks with the new requirements and earnestly 
investigate and solve outstanding problems in each locality or 
department. Those departments or localities that did not pay 
adequate attention to the drive in the previous stage must 
bestir themselves and catch up. 
  D) We gained an important experience from the anticorruption 
drive in the early period; namely, we must firmly believe and 
rely on the masses and must combine the arousing of the masses 
to report corruption cases to the authorities with the special 
organs' investigating them according to law. The merit of this 
experience is that it can help uncover problems and promote the 
conducting of the drive in an orderly manner. We must continue 
to adhere to this experience. We must pay attention to 
protecting people who report corruption; and must commend and 
award those whose reports contribute to the drive. 
  E) We must earnestly investigate and handle corruption 
problems exposed, especially major and important cases. We must 
never turn big problems into small problems and end up with 
nothing accomplished. We must never let bureaucrats shield each 
other and localities and departments practice protectionism. 
Those who harbor criminals must be punished according to party 
discipline and state law. 
  F) We must pay attention to policies and stress focal 
points. 
Those who violate criminal law and party discipline must be 
sternly dealt with according to law and party discipline. 
People engaged in unhealthy practices should, in general, be 
criticized and educated. Those who voluntarily examine and mend 
themselves are fine; and those who refuse to undergo education 
and to mend their ways should be punished by party or 
administrative disciplinary action as deemed necessary. This is 
for the purpose of education and enforcement of discipline. 
  G) We should bring into full play the role of the democratic 
parties and people without party affiliation. We should 
organize them to take part in implementing various tasks of the 
anticorruption drive, and should listen to their opinions and 
suggestions. 
  H) While launching the anticorruption drive, we must rectify 
mistakes and promote party building at the same time; we must 
address the issue by looking into both its root cause and 
symptoms. The problems exposed show the existence of many 
loopholes in our management system and of serious defects in 
leadership style, which provide the opportunities for criminals 
and corrupt elements. We must learn from mistakes and earnestly 
sum up experiences and lessons by stopping the loopholes, 
improving rules and regulations, strengthening management, and 
resolutely getting rid of bureaucracy. 
  I) The key lies in strengthening leadership. Party 
committees and governments at all levels must properly handle 
the relationship between reform, development, and stability. 
They must firmly grasp the central task of economic 
construction and persist in grasping two links at the same time, 
mapping out overall plans to effectively combine the 
anticorruption drive with the deepening of reform, opening up 
wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. 
Principal party and government leaders must personally attend to 
the drive and solve important problems. They must support the 
work of discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs 
and coordinate various departments concerned so as to join 
forces and promote in-depth development of the anticorruption 
drive. 
<H3>  3. Further Consolidate and Strengthen the Party's Flesh-and 
Blood Ties With the Masses </H3>
  In the final analysis, the anticorruption drive aims to 
consolidate and strengthen the party's ties with the masses and 
consolidate the position of the CPC as the ruling party under 
the new circumstances so that our party can more effectively 
carry out the historical responsibility of leading China's 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The ties 
between the party and the masses is a fundamental political 
issue that has a bearing on the success of the party's cause and 
on the survival of the party. This principle must be stressed 
repeatedly and for a long time to make sure that all comrades of 
the party attach great importance to it. 
  The CPC is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, and 
its 
sole objective is to serve the people wholeheartedly. Our party 
represents the people in exercising political power; all party 
activities are aimed at protecting and fulfilling the interests 
of the broad masses of the people. If we do not pay attention 
to strengthening the party's ties with the masses and 
eliminating phenomena of divorcing ourselves from the masses, 
and if we let corruption spread unchecked, the CPC as the ruling 
party will degenerate and lose popular support. If the economy 
fails, we will collapse [jing ji gao bu hao hui kua tai 4842 
3444 2269 0008 1170 2585 1006 0669]. Even if we do well in the 
economy, but corruption, embezzlement, and bribery spread 
unchecked and we seriously divorce ourselves from the masses, we 
will collapse, too. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said as early as 1980: 
"We must resolutely criticize and correct various mistakes of 
divorcing ourselves from the masses and showing no interest in 
the people's hardships. The masses are the source of our 
strength; the mass line and mass viewpoint are our cherished 
heritage. Party organizations, members, and cadres must 
identify themselves with the masses; and must never stand 
diametrically opposed to the masses. If a party organization 
divorces itself from the masses and cannot make up its mind to 
correct itself, it will forfeit the source of its strength, be 
doomed to fail, and be abandoned by the people. All comrades of 
the party and cadres at all levels, leading cadres in 
particular, must always bear this point in mind and use it as a 
criterion for examining their speeches and actions." We must 
always remember these incisive, pertinent words and resolutely 
implement them into concrete work. 
  The vast numbers of cadres and, in particular, leading 
cadres 
must study hard the Marxist mass viewpoint, adhere to the 
party's mass line, constantly immerse themselves among the 
masses, and improve their ideological and work style in a 
down-to-earth manner. This is a necessity not only for 
implementing the party's line, principles, and policies and 
successfully fulfilling various tasks, but also for continuously 
remolding world outlook, resisting corruption, and preventing 
[peaceful] evolution. At the present, the masses in some areas 
still live in poverty as they still do not have enough to eat 
and wear. Each and every party cadre should constantly remember 
their hardships. The stand, thinking, and feelings of party 
cadres is a fundamental issue. When party cadres divorce 
themselves from the masses, are indifferent to the masses' weal 
and woe, and become apathetic, their thinking will inevitably 
degenerate and it becomes hard for them to avoid corrupt 
behavior. 
  The current situation in the country as a whole is very 
good. 
However, we must be aware of some contradictions and problems 
confronting us in our march forward and of the existence of some 
destabilizing factors in society. These problems should merit 
our keen attention and should never be treated lightly. Leading 
cadres at all levels and, in particular, principal leading 
cadres must personally take a hand in successfully solving the 
conspicuous problems in their own local localities. Where 
problems are serious, leaders should visit the place to solve 
the problems. If leaders sit in the office and make empty talk, 
acting like bureaucrats and seriously divorcing themselves from 
the masses without solving practical problems, how can they 
fight corruption? The tasks we have undertaken are very heavy. 
We must steadfastly rely on party organizations at all levels 
and on cadres and the masses. The party and its cadres must 
work together with the masses with one mind to maintain 
political stability; to create a favorable social environment; 
to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; 
to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa 
zhan 0202 2170 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 
4099 1455]; and to promote smooth progress of the undertaking to 
build socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<F P=106> [Jiang Zemin's Speech Delivered at the National Working </F>
Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work on 24 January] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Mar (XINHUA) -- The current National 
Working Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work, following 
the National Working Conference on Economy, is another important 
meeting of overall significance convened by the CPC Central 
Committee in the crucial period in the building of China's 
socialist market economy and modernization construction. 
  The main tasks of this meeting are: to implement the 
guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as of the 
party's basic line; and to study and arrange the work on 
enhancing and improving propaganda and ideological work under 
the new situation in line with the principle of "adopting a 
two-handed approach and of putting equal emphasis on the 
two-handed approach." It is hoped that party's leaders at 
various levels and comrades working at the propaganda and 
ideological front will, through this meeting, further understand 
the overall situation; unify thinking; rise with force and 
spirit; work in a down-to-earth manner; create a new phase in 
the propaganda and ideological work; and better mobilize, unite, 
and encourage the broad mass of party members and the masses to 
constantly advance the cause of reform, opening up, and 
modernization construction. 
  Now, I want to discuss several issues. 
<H3>  1. The Importance of Enhancing Propaganda and Ideological 
Work in the New Period. </H3>
  Of the several fronts that our party leads, the propaganda 
and ideological frontline is a very important one. Among our 
party's various levels of leading organs, propaganda and 
ideological work departments are very important departments. 
Among our party's cadres contingents, the propaganda and 
ideological work contingent is a very important force. Both the 
first generation of the leadership collective of the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core and the second 
generation of the leadership collective of the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core attached great 
importance to leading the propaganda and ideological front and 
to giving play to the roles of propaganda and ideological work 
departments and propaganda and ideological work contingent. The 
history of past decades has shown that be it in revolutionary 
wars or in socialist construction, great victories are 
inseparable from propaganda and ideological work. This is a 
basic experience of our party. Attaching great importance to 
giving full play to the powerful role of propaganda and 
ideological work represents a major tradition and a major 
superior feature of our party. 
  It is the people's undertaking to build a rich, strong, 
democratic, and civilized socialist country. With the help of 
the party's leadership and through their own efforts, the people 
embark on their undertaking to realize their own interests. 
Propaganda and ideological work departments shoulder a vital 
mission in this cause. To sum this up, we may say that this 
mission is to correctly publicize the party's theory, line, 
principles, and policies; and to reflect vividly the great 
practice of the masses, to mobilize all positive factors, to 
turn all negative factors into positive factors, to unite all 
forces that can be united, and to fight to accomplish the 
magnificent goal of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Our propaganda and ideological work calls for 
arming our people with scientific theories, guiding them with 
the correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, 
and inspiring them with outstanding works so that new 
generations of socialist-minded people who are endowed with 
lofty ideals, moral integrity, a sound education, and a strong 
sense of discipline can be continuously trained and fostered to 
provide a powerful ideological guarantee and to play a 
supportive role in forming public opinion in the great cause of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the important remarks 
during his south China inspection in 1992 and since the holding 
of the 14th CPC National Congress, the situation concerning our 
country's modernization construction has been excellent, reform 
and opening up have made great strides, the economy has 
maintained sustained development, people of all nationalities 
have shown solidarity and lived in harmony, and the country has 
enjoyed social and political stability. At the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee the "Decision of the 
CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" was 
adopted and the action plan for reforming China's economic 
system in the 1990's was formulated. Reform of our country's 
economic system has reached a new stage where promoting overall 
reform of the economic system and seeking to achieve major 
reform breakthroughs are integrated. At present, the 
international situation's pattern is moving toward a multi-polar 
development. This helps expand our country's maneuvering room in 
handling international affairs. Economically-developed 
countries are now undergoing readjustment of the economic and 
industrial structures. Our country has improved relations with 
Western countries. Asia-Pacific regions continue to maintain 
relative political stability and an excellent situation for 
thriving economic development. Our country's friendly and 
cooperative relationship with neighboring countries and a vast 
number of countries in the Third World has been further 
strengthened. Of course, we are still faced with some 
difficulties and problems in the course of progress, requiring 
us to pay constant attention to studying and solving those 
problems. Generally speaking, both the international and 
domestic situations are relatively advantageous to our promotion 
of reform and construction, which are indeed a hard-to-come by 
good opportunity. In the current year, the basic policy of the 
work of the whole party is: under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively 
implement the guidelines set by the 14th CPC National Congress, 
as well as by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; to accelerate the building of the socialist market 
economic system; to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy; to safeguard political 
stability, and promote all-round social progress. The overall 
mission of the whole party in the current year is to seize the 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, 
and maintain stability. All party comrades must understand this 
overall mission, submit to and serve this overall mission, act 
under the awareness of this overall mission, and do a good job 
in all areas of work. 
  The new situation has made greater and greater demands on 
the propaganda and ideological front. The party's theory, line, 
principles, policies, and our goals of struggle need to be 
publicized more penetratingly and widely so they can be 
understood and grasped by the masses. The series of new 
measures taken by the party and the government to push forward 
reform and construction must be convincingly explained in simple 
terms to the masses. New experiences created by the masses must 
be summarized and popularized; outstanding figures and their 
lofty spirits emerging from all fronts must be eulogized and 
propagated. The masses' increasing demand for spiritual 
civilization must be satisfied through all efforts. The 
multitude of problems arising in practice must be seriously 
studied and solved; ideological and conceptual problems 
pertaining to the readjustment of interests which crop up in the 
course of reform must be redressed and resolved; and the 
negative tendencies prevailing in social life must be overcome. 
Our efforts to push forward reform and opening up to the 
outside world and the modernization drive requires China to 
better understand the rest of the world and the rest of the 
world to better understand China. All these facts point to the 
importance of propaganda and ideological work. We can accomplish 
great things as long as we pay great attention to various 
problems, and we must not overlook them in any way. We must 
intensify our efforts and must not slacken them one iota; we 
must keep on improving and upgrading, and we must never stand 
still. 
  In the 15 years since the implemenation of the policy of 
reform and opening up to the outside world, propaganda and 
ideological work have played important roles of emancipating the 
mind; renewing people's concepts; unifying the thinking and 
action of the whole party and the people; helping to maintain a 
stable and united social and political situation; mobilizing and 
giving play to the masses' enthusiasm, initiative, and 
creativeness; and of promoting the smooth progress of reform, 
opening up, and modernization construction. Since the Fourth 
Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the CPC 
Central Committee, following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, and affirming the results of propaganda and 
ideological work, has adopted a series of measures to rectify 
the phenomenon of "one hand being relatively tough while another 
one is relatively soft." Since the convening of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, comrades on the propaganda and ideological 
front have made great efforts, done a tremendous amount of work, 
and have achieved new progress in the areas of theory, 
journalism, publishing, cultural and arts, foreign propaganda 
work, and in helping to build the contingent of propaganda and 
ideological workers. On the basis of investigation and research 
and after summing up experiences and new practices, we have 
developed a basic idea about carrying out propaganda and 
ideological work in the new situation and have further defined 
the basic guidelines and principles, as well as the primary 
tasks and work arrangements. Now that the general policy 
guiding propaganda and ideological work has been set, the key 
lies in implementation, in doing our work in a down-to-earth 
manner, and in continuing to summarize our practical experience 
and to advance in a pioneering spirit. 
<H3>  2. The Fundamental Guidelines and Primary Tasks of 
Propaganda and Ideological Work </H3>
  Our party needs correct theoretical guidance and a unified 
ideological basis to lead and unite the people of all 
nationalities to carry out reform, opening up, and modernization 
construction. Our party is the vanguard of the working class 
with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding 
thought. Marxism is a branch of science whose root is deeply 
implanted in practice and which develops constantly in practice. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics deeply reflects the objective law of our 
country's socialist construction, realizes fully on the will and 
wishes of the party and the people, inherits and develops Mao 
Zedong Thought, and is the Marxism of contemporary China [dang 
dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yi 3981 0108 0022 0948 4104 7456 
0344 1835 0031 0034]. This theory is the spiritual weapon of 
the whole party and the people of all nationalities and our 
powerful ideological weapon to score reform, opening up, and 
modernization construction victories. In the past 15 years, it 
was exactly because of the guidance provided by this theory that 
our socialist undertaking has opened a new historical phase; 
that the economic construction, people's lives, overall national 
strength have all reached new heights; and that we have scored 
achievements that have attracted worldwide attention; it was 
precisely because of the guidance provided by this theory that 
the cause of the building of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics has stood rigorous tests and achieved thriving 
development under the changeable international situation. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is the fundamental principle guiding all 
party work. The propaganda and ideological front must firmly 
adhere to this basic guideline and use it as a guide in all of 
its work. Only by doing so can we ensure a correct orientation 
in propaganda and ideological work and the successful 
accomplishment of all our tasks. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has shown great concern and 
attention to working on the propaganda and ideological front. 
He has proposed a series of far-reaching and important ideas on 
the importance, policies, principles, and major tasks of 
propaganda and ideological work; the building of a force for 
this work; the party's leadership over the work; and more. 
These important ideas not only adhere to the CPC's consistent 
stand, but also include many new contents and demands for the 
situation and tasks in the new period. They are important 
component parts of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and are of extremely significant importance to 
guiding propaganda and ideological work and strengthening the 
construction of socialist spiritual civilization. All party 
members, particularly leading cadres at all levels and comrades 
engaged in propaganda and ideological work, must earnestly study 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, further enhance their consciousness and 
steadfastness of conducting prapaganda and ideological work 
well, and strive to carry out this theory in actual work. 
  The frontline of prapaganda and ideological work is long and 
the tasks are arduous. We should adhere to the ideological line 
of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, closely 
center around the central work of economic construction, 
conscientiously do a good job in all kinds of work, and 
vigorously promote the construction of socialist material and 
spiritual civilization. Currently and for the foreseeable 
future, we should emphasize four aspects of the work. 
  A) The most important task of the propaganda and ideological 
front is the persistence in arming the entire party with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  The 14th CPC National Congress proposed arming the entire 
party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. This is a strategic mission with 
far-reaching and fundamental significance. The fulfillment of 
this strategic mission will push the party's theoretical and 
ideological level as well as its leading and ruling ability to a 
new height. Over the past year or so, particularly since the 
publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping and the release of the central authorities' 
decision to study it, the study of this theory has been on the 
upsurge. Generally speaking, however, such a study is still 
preliminary. Party committees at all levels should further 
understand the extreme importance, urgency, and protracted 
nature of the work to arm the entire party with this theory and 
truly do a good job in organizing and guiding party members and 
cadres to study it. While continuing to run study courses for 
principal leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial 
levels, cadres with party membership at and above the county and 
regimental levels should receive training in stages and in 
groups within two to three years. In the course of studying, we 
should read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's original works seriously to 
comprehensively, systematically, and accurately master the gist 
and essence as well as grasp the basic standpoint of his works. 
Departments of propaganda and ideological work should 
coordinate well with departments concerned to carry on a 
thorough and sustained study among the entire party. Comrades 
in departments of propaganda and ideological work should play a 
leading role in studying theories, so the study can be conducted 
more thoroughly and the theory applied more satisfactorily. In 
the meantime, we should emphatically do a good job in 
publicizing and studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should make 
full use of the media, such as newspapers, radio, television, 
and publications, to publicize this theory in depth and educate 
our people and youth. We should sum up and spread the studying 
experiences of the broad masses of party members and people in a 
timely manner. The five bases for studying the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, established in 
the Central Party School, State Education Commission, Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences, PLA National Defense University, and 
the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, should play a backbone 
role in studying in depth significant theories and practice in 
the course of reform and construction, establishing questions 
for study, concentrating their efforts, and accomplishing a 
number of highly valuable research achievements. The 
educational sector should compile teaching materials concerning 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
which will serve as the main contents for political courses in 
schools. 
  B) We must persist in implementing the party's basic line 
and in properly guiding public opinion. 
  While performing various tasks, for a century we should 
unwaveringly abide by the party's basic line that regards 
economic construction as the central task, that upholds the four 
cardinal principles, and that persistently promotes reform and 
opening up. The propaganda and ideological front must strictly 
adhere to the party's basic line; must properly perform its own 
tasks; and must carry out effective propaganda and ideological 
tasks to mobilize people and further align the minds and actions 
of the entire party and people across China with the party's 
basic line. 
  To fully understand the actual situation and to properly 
guide public opinion under the guidance of the party's basic 
line are very important tasks performed by the party's 
propaganda and ideological front. Presently the number of 
China's newspapers and periodicals is enormous. Radio and 
television networks cover the entire country. By sending daily 
messages to the broad masses of people, the mass media are 
influencing their minds and behavior at all times regardless of 
where they are. When public opinion is guided correctly, people 
are united with high spirits; when public opinion is misguided, 
grave consequences follow. Positive and negative experiences 
have shown us that guiding public opinion is extremely 
important. Leading cadres of party committees at various 
levels, propaganda departments, and news publishing units must 
have a strong sense of responsibility in properly guiding public 
opinion. 
  To correctly guide public opinion, it is important for us to 
correctly understand the actual situation; to improve our 
concept on the overall situation; to persist in properly 
publicizing the party's line, principles, and policies; and to 
resolutely maintain political unity with the party Central 
Committee. We should carry out our work with the objective of 
constantly enhancing the central task of economic construction; 
we should lead the masses to utilize their enthusiasm and 
creativity in deepening reform, in opening up wider to the 
outside world, in developing the socialist market economy, and 
in accomplishing various modernization tasks. We should make 
major efforts to reveal the fact that socialist undertakings 
with Chinese characteristics have been developing and bringing 
about changes day after day, and should enthusiastically praise 
the masses of people for their lofty character and splendid 
accomplishments in changing the world and in creating a new 
life. We should pay attention to investigating and studying 
actual public opinion and the masses' actual thoughts and 
concepts; we should actively express the views and proposals of 
the broad masses of people in an effort to strengthen the 
supervision over public opinion. The supervision over public 
opinion should aim to help the party and government improve 
their work, to resolve actual problems, to foster unity among 
the people, and to safeguard social stability. When delivering 
propaganda reports, we should pay attention to properly handling 
the relations among reform, development, and stability as well 
as the relations between local and overall situation; should 
uphold materialist dialectics; and should avoid partiality and 
oversimplification. We should strictly abide by the discipline 
governing propaganda. Party newspapers and journals as well as 
state news agencies, radio, and television stations should 
actively publicize the party's views in an effort to play a key 
role in properly guiding public opinion. Our stress on properly 
guiding public opinion is in line with our emphasis that 
departments and units in charge of publicizing public opinion 
should be creative in their work. The prerequisite that they 
uphold the correct policies, newspapers, journals, and radio and 
television programs should be boldly creative and should strive 
to form their own styles and characteristics. 
  Persisting in properly guiding public opinion means creating 
a type of public opinion conducive to further reform and opening 
up, and to the establishment of a socialist market economy and 
the development of social productive forces. It means creating 
a kind of public opinion which helps strengthen the building of 
a socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal 
system; which encourages and inspires people to make arduous 
efforts and to blaze a new trail for the country's prosperity, 
people's well-being, and social progress; which helps people 
distinguish between right and wrong, uphold truth, good, and 
beauty, and resist falsehood, evil, and ugliness; which promotes 
national reunification and unity; and which helps to bring peace 
of mind to the people and social and political stability. 
  C) We must strengthen ideological work to raise a new 
generation of well-educated and self-disciplined people with 
lofty ideals and moral integrity in order to expedite the 
building of a socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Raising a new generation of well-educated and 
self-disciplined people with lofty ideals and moral integrity is 
the basic objective of building a socialist spiritual 
civilization. Centering around this objective, we must 
strengthen ideological and ethical education centering on 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism among the masses, 
especially young people; must carry out education in the spirit 
of plain living and hard struggle, and the principle of building 
the country through diligence and thrift; and must carry out 
education on professional and social ethics, on the basic 
national situation, and on basic legal knowledge. We should be 
good at doing ideological work among the masses. Heightening 
the masses' awareness and encouraging them to work hard to 
achieve their fundamental interests is our party's heirloom not 
to be discarded under any circumstances. While we have achieved 
some success in doing ideological work in recent years, some 
localities and departments have ignored and slackened their 
efforts in this regard, and we must attach great importance to 
this problem. Ideological work is work for the entire party. 
Not only should it be done by propaganda departments, but also 
by party committees at all levels and grass-roots party 
organizations of enterprises, rural areas, schools, and 
neighborhoods. Executive departments, trade unions, communist 
youth leagues, and women's federations at all levels also have 
the responsibility to carry out ideological work among the 
masses. Currently we must attach great importance to guiding 
the people, particularly young people, to foster correct ideals, 
convictions, world outlook, and concepts of life and values; to 
oppose money worship, nihilism, and ultra-individualism; and to 
resist the inroads of decadent capitalist and feudalistic ideas. 
To keep pace with the requirements of the new situation, we 
should, on the basis of inheriting the fine traditions, carry 
out ideological work by making full use of the mass media and 
cultural facilities and in ways which the masses readily accept 
and welcome. We must be good at guiding the masses to pay 
attention to democracy and to respect, understand, and care for 
each other. We should use ways which can attract many people to 
take part, to educate themselves, to discuss issues on an equal 
footing, and to make criticism and self-criticism. We should 
pay attention to differentiating levels, keep in mind the 
different characteristics, combine demands of the advanced 
levels with demands of the broad strata, and merge ideological 
education with cultivation of proper conduct. Propaganda and 
ideological departments should pay attention to summing up their 
experiences in carrying out ideological work among the masses, 
popularize the work of exemplary units, and make constant 
efforts to upgrade our ideological work in society. 
  D) We must adhere to the course of serving the people and 
socialism, uphold the principle of letting a hundred flowers 
blossom and a hundred schools of thought content, foster the 
main theme, and bring about a boom in socialist literature and 
art. 
  Upholding the principles of serving the people and socialism 
and of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools 
of thought contend are basic requirements for producing 
spiritual works and an important guarantee for the prosperity of 
propaganda and cultural undertakings. Fostering the main theme 
and advocating diversification reflects in a concrete manner the 
orientation of serving the people and socialism as well as the 
principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred 
schools of thought contend. 
  Fostering the main theme means, under the guidance of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of 
the party's basic line, vigorously advocating ideas and spirits 
conducive to fostering patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; 
conducive to reform, opening up, and socialist modernization; 
conducive to national unity, social progress, and the people's 
well-being; and conducive to seeking a happy life through honest 
labor. Fostering the main theme so that our spiritual works are 
in line with the people's interests can promote social progress 
and can satisfy the people's growing spiritual and cultural 
needs is the main idea of developing propaganda and cultural 
services and creating a boom in socialist literature and art. 
  Effective policies and measures should be adopted to 
vigorously support the production of intellectual products 
reflecting the main trend of the era. Each year a number of 
outstanding movies, dramas, and works in the fields of music, 
dance, art, and literature which attract the people's interest 
should be created. Intellectual works which reflect the main 
trend of the era should not only possess healthy ideological 
contents but possess varied, lively, and refined artistic 
expressions which are strongly attractive and influential and 
are highly competitive in the market for cultural products. 
Social life is rich and varied, and the people's intellectual 
and cultural needs are also varied and come from different 
strata. All intellectual products which serve to educate and 
enlighten the people and which give them recreational and 
aesthetical enjoyment should be welcomed and encouraged. 
Excellent nationality cultural products, refined artistic works, 
and highly valuable academic works should be supported and 
protected. Efforts should be made to develop such undertakings 
as the press, publishing, radio, films, television, literature 
and art, and the social sciences as well as to improve cultural 
work in communities, villages and towns, enterprises, and school 
campuses. We should increase investment in the field of 
propaganda and culture so as to improve the condition for 
developing propaganda and cultural undertakings. 
  The production of intellectual products is a complex working 
process. Therefore experts, scholars, and literary and art 
workers are required to give play to their personal creative 
spirit. We should respect and cherish their hard work, persist 
in emancipating our minds, seek truth from facts, adhere to the 
"double hundred" principle, and strive to create a good 
environment and atmosphere which encourages explorative and 
creative activities. In academic research we should encourage 
free discussions of different points of views and schools of 
thought; in artistic creation we should encourage free 
development of different styles and forms. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping said: "Literary and art workers who are responsible to 
the people must always gear their works to the needs of the 
masses. Artistically they should strive to further improve 
their works, avoid creating crude works, conscientiously bear in 
mind the effects on society created by their works, and do their 
best to provide the people with their best intellectual 
products." I hope comrades engaged in the production of 
intellectual products will make constant efforts to enhance 
their ideological and professional level and create more 
intellectual products which stimulate people's enthusiasm, 
enhance the masses' fighting will, tighten the national 
cohesiveness, and invigorate all sectors of society. In this 
way, our propaganda and cultural undertakings will be able to 
further prosper and flourish. 
  In the course of carrying out propaganda and cultural work 
and promoting socialist spiritual civilization, I want to 
reemphasize three issues. 
  First, it is necessary to give priority to social benefits 
[she hui xiao yi 4357 2585 2400 4135]. Economic and social 
benefits should be integrated on the basis of this basic 
prerequisite. The question of economic benefits has really 
cropped up as the socialist market economy continues to develop 
and as the production and circulation of intellectual products 
are closely linked with the general laws governing market 
operation. Good economic returns will help the development of 
propaganda and cultural undertakings. At the same time, it is 
necessary to realize that the value of intellectual products 
which have a special property different from that of material 
products is more importantly reflected in social benefit. The 
economic returns of some intellectual products may be small, but 
the products play a big role in promoting the development of 
productive forces and all-round social progress. In propaganda 
and cultural work we should always make social benefits our 
highest criterion. When economic benefits contradict social 
benefits, we should consciously subject economic benefit to 
social benefit. 
  Second, it is necessary to adopt a scientific approach in 
dealing with our traditional national culture and cultures from 
the outside. Having experienced many vicissitudes of life, our 
nation has created a brilliant Chinese civilization in the 
history of mankind and developed a traditional culture of great 
vitality. We should do a good job in inheriting this valuable 
cultural heritage, discarding the dross and selecting the 
essence. We should conscientiously study and draw on the 
achievements of civilization of various countries in the world 
and be good at assimilating what is good from the cultures of 
other countries and nations to develop our culture. In stressing 
the inheritance of cultural heritage and learning from other 
cultures, our purpose is through these two means to closely 
integrate our traditional national culture and the essence of 
foreign cultures with the fine traditions and revolutionary 
spirit which took shape in the long years of revolution and 
construction by the people under the leadership of our party, 
and to make constant innovations on the basis of new practice to 
build and develop a socialist culture with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Third, it is important that we build a spiritual 
civilization and strengthen its management. Building a 
spiritual civilization includes management, and management can 
in turn promote the building of a spiritual civilization. 
Strengthening and improving management will provide an 
effective guarantee for developing propaganda and cultural 
undertakings and prospering the cultural market. We should make 
great efforts to promote the prosperity of cultural undertakings 
and produce more spiritual products loved by the masses. 
Meanwhile, we must not be oblivious to erroneous and unlawful 
things. On the major issues of principle the propaganda, 
ideological, and cultural departments must adhere to principle 
and take a clear-cut stand on what should be advocated, what can 
be allowed, what should be limited, and what should be opposed. 
The masses are very resentful of those things which negate the 
party's leadership and the socialist system, disseminate corrupt 
thinking and decadent sentiments, spread feudalism and 
superstition, play up sex and violence, and endanger our cause 
and harm people's physical and mental health, especially the 
young people and children. We must not let those things spread 
unchecked. We should see that many problems in our management 
belong to contradictions among the people. In our work, we must 
adhere to the party's principles and policies, do things 
strictly in accordance with the law, and pay attention to 
management and work methods. Regarding propaganda and cultural 
undertakings -- including the law of the development of a 
socialist cultural market -- there are still many things to 
learn. We should seriously study and actively explore related 
matters, sum up our experiences, improve and strengthen 
management system, and raise our level of management. 
  To make propaganda and cultural undertakings prosperous and 
build a socialist spiritual civilization, we should formulate a 
plan for development. We have now established a three-step 
development goal for economic development, and have also had a 
basic framework for the reform of the economic structure and the 
establishment of a socialist market economy. The building of a 
socialist spiritual civilization touches various sides and is an 
engineering system. A resolution in this respect was adopted at 
the Sixth Plenary Session of the 12th CPC National Congress. On 
the basis of our achievements, we should now carry out 
deep-going investigations and studies, strive to formulate an 
overall plan, and establish progressive goals and specific 
measures for the building of a spiritual civilization within two 
to three years according to the new situation. 
<H3>  3. We should make efforts to strengthen and improve the 
party's leadership over propaganda and ideological work. </H3>
  Propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the overall 
situation in our undertaking to build socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Party committees at all levels must attach 
great importance to this task; they must strengthen their 
leadership and earnestly shoulder responsibility in this regard. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: "While building a 
high-degree material civilization, we should also raise the 
scientific and cultural level of the entire nation; develop an 
elevated, rich, and colorful cultural life; and build a high 
level of socialist spiritual civilization." He has also 
stressed: "In promoting the four modernizations, we must attach 
importance to both material and spiritual civilization and must 
not just pay attention to one side." We must do a good job in 
building both material and spiritual civilization, and only when 
there is both material progress and cultural and ideological 
progress can there be socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
We should solemnly place before the entire partythe question of 
giving equal emphasis to two fronts and doing well in both; we 
must place the question high on the agenda of party committees 
at all levels. We should make it clear that the responsibility 
for a region's or department's propaganda and ideological work 
and progress in promoting spiritual civilization lies primarily 
with its party committees. Party committees at all levels, and 
their principal officials in particular, must conduct in-depth 
research and investigation, sum up experiences, provide careful 
guidance, and make supervision and inspection to improve 
propaganda and ideological work. Some of the work requires 
coordination from various sides, and party committees must make 
unified arrangements and must study and coordinate their 
actions. Party committees and governments at all levels must 
constantly introduce the current situation, tasks, principles, 
and policies to propaganda, cultural, and educational 
departments as well as help those departments understand the 
progress of reform and construction so as to facilitate their 
respective work. 
  We should consider the propaganda of the reform of cultural 
undertakings as important work, make overall arrangements, and 
actively promote such work. The propaganda of the reform of 
cultural undertakings should suit the need of the work of the 
development of a socialist market economy and of the entire 
cause of socialist modernization. It should be in accord with 
the requirement of building socialist spiritual civilization and 
with the law of the development of propaganda work and cultural 
undertakings. Through reform of the management system, we should 
change government functions, straighten up relations, simplify 
administration, raise efficiency, and strengthen the vitality of 
propaganda work and cultural undertakings. We should attach 
importance to strengthening the institution [zhi du hua 0455 
1653 0553] and standardization of propaganda and cultural work, 
and increase the formulation of necessary laws, rules, and 
regulations. 
  Building a contingent of propaganda and ideological 
personnel who are politically sound, professionally competent, 
and upright in work style serves as an organizational guarantee 
for the successful execution of propaganda and ideological work. 
Party committees at all levels should demonstrate concern for 
this contingent in politics, ideology, work, and daily life and 
do a good job in building it. The key to strengthening the 
building of this contingent lies in successfully building its 
leading body. In accordance with the policy of making the ranks 
of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age, better 
educated, and professionally more competent and the principle of 
requiring both ability and political integrity, we should assign 
to important leading posts on the propaganda and ideological 
front cadres who uphold the party's basic line, well versed in 
Marxist tenets, and possess a strong sense of political 
responsibility and an awareness of the cause. There is a large 
collection of intellectuals on the propaganda and ideological 
front. We must conscientiously implement the policy of 
respecting knowledge and talent. We must strive to create a 
democratic, lively environment in which people can cooperate in 
unity and with an ease of mind. We must bring into full play 
the intelligence and wisdom of the vast number of intellectuals 
on this front so that they will find their way to distinction. 
We must particularly help young talented people to grow up 
faster and sounder, and we must gradually bring up in force 
experts in various field who will make an impact at home or even 
internationally. As for those making outstanding contributions, 
we must especially care for and treasure them. We should 
establish different kinds of award which reflect our nation's 
scientific and cultural achievements and are deemed as a high 
honor in society. The propaganda and ideological front shoulders 
a heavy and difficult burden. We must treat comrades on this 
front with understanding and vigorously support them. While 
setting stricter demands on them, we must not demand perfection. 
We must ardently help them sum up experience and raise their 
standards. Propaganda and ideological workers must strive to 
study theory; learn about socialist market economy, science and 
technology, and history of literature, music, and fine arts; and 
acquire a basic understanding of the development of Chinese and 
world cultures. They should go down to the grass-roots levels, 
to go deep among the masses, and to go into the realities of 
life so that they can draw nourishment from the creative and 
history-making activities of the masses to replenish and improve 
themselves. No good works can be accomplished nor successful 
propaganda and ideology work can be carried out if one removes 
oneself from reality and the masses. 
  There is a galaxy of talents on the propaganda and 
ideological front. The vast number of comrades on the 
propaganda and ideological front are loyal to the cause of the 
party and the people. Working diligently and conscientiously, 
and willingly bear the burden of office, they did a tremendous 
amount of work and made important contributions to publicizing 
the party's basic theory and line, to promoting reform, opening 
up, and modernization, and developing socialist spiritual 
civilization. Practice has proved that this contingent is very 
dedicated and possesses a strong fighting capability. The party 
Central Committee trusts it and the party and people have high 
expectations of it. In the new period, the contingent shoulders 
an important responsibility. It is hoped that everyone will, 
under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, work vigorously to make 
the country prosperous, keep forging ahead with all our energy, 
and make every effort to raise propaganda and ideological work 
to new heights. 
  Comrades, our modernization involves a historical process 
which centers on economic construction and during which the 
socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist 
spiritual civilization will develop simultaneously. By 
upholding the party's basic line and not wavering in it for 100 
years and through the efforts of several generations, we can 
definitely basically accomplish socialist modernization and win 
the great victory in building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics by the middle of next century. Let us unite as 
one and forge ahead steadfastly and courageously toward this 
goal!

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong estimated 
that it might lose up to 187 billion H.K. dollars (24 billion 
U.S. dollars) in overall trade, 26 billion H.K. dollars (3.3 
billion U.S. dollars) in income and 75,000 in jobs if China's 
most favored nation [MFN] trading status were withdrawn. 
  The local government's latest assessment of the impact on 
Hong Kong's economy if China were to lose its MFN trading status 
in the United States was announced at a press conference held by 
the Trade Department here this afternoon. 
  Christopher Jackson, deputy director of the Trade 
Department, 
said that the removal of China's MFN trading status by the 
United States would have direct adverse effect on Hong Kong's 
re-exports of the Chinese Mainland origin to the United States. 
  "A reduction of up to 77 billion H.K. dollars (one billion 
U.S. dollars) worth of re-exports is double the impact that we 
estimated in 1990," said Jackson, adding that this is largely a 
result of the rapid growth in Hong Kong's re-export of goods 
made in the mainland to the United States over the past few 
years. 
  The withdrawal would also have significant adverse effect on 
manufacturing investment ventures and other production 
arrangements by Hong Kong and foreign companies in the Chinese 
Mainland, said Jackson. 
  According to Jackson, the local government has stepped its 
lobbying activities in Washington as President Clinton is 
required by the U.S. law to indicate by June 3 whether he 
intends to renew China's MFN status for another year. 
  "We have reinforced our lobbying team and are working with 
American business allies to impress upon members of the 
administration and Congress the damage which MFN withdrawal 
would do to Hong Kong and to American interests in this region," 
he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist 
Party, said here this week that party committees and governments 
of all levels must attach importance to the issue of grain 
production. 
  At the closing session on Tuesday [1 March] of China's 
National Conference on Poverty Reduction, Jiang noted that grain 
is a special commodity which concerns people's life and the 
whole situation in the country. 
  He said that all places should stabilize crop growing areas, 
grain output and storage, and there should be a balance between 
places in total grain volume and grain production. 
  He said that last year, China's grain output was a record, 
which created favorable conditions for the development of 
China's national economy and social stability. 
  But, he noted, there are still new problems in grain 
production. 
  He said that since the beginning of the 1990s, the grain 
output in some provinces and areas in south China had declined 
due to decrease of the profits of grain production and the 
readjustment of crop cultivation. 
  He said that the provinces and areas have to purchase large 
portions of grain from other provinces. 
  He said that weather was one of the factors which affected 
grain output in south China, but the main factors were the 
decrease of crop growing area and decrease of investment in farm 
production. 
  Jiang pointed out that all party committees and governments 
should pay attention to these problems. 
  He said that effective measures should be taken to check the 
tendency of weakening grain production in some areas. 
  He said that if there was something wrong with "rice bags" 
and "vegetable baskets," the country's stability would be 
affected. 
  He stressed that the solution to China's grain problems must 
depend on self-reliance. 
  He called for policies of two basic balances -- a balance of 
total volume, China should achieve self-sufficiency, and a 
balance in grain imports and exports. 
  Talking about the balance between crop growing areas, he 
said 
that south China should be self-sufficient in rice. 
  He said that at present, the rural areas were seeing spring 
ploughing. He called for good management for the ploughing and 
for supplying the farm production materials. 
  Last month, State Councillor Chen Junsheng sent letters to 
the government leaders of seven provinces and regions, including 
Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and Zhejiang, 
urging them to do the spring ploughing well to ensure a good 
harvest.

<F P=106> [Article by unidentified XINHUA special correspondent: "The </F>
Number `10,000' Undergirds the Effort To Transform Operating 
Mechanisms and Establish a Modern Enterprise System"] 
  [Text] To implement the principle of combining package 
reform with breakthroughs in key areas as set forth in the 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, a national economic and trade work conference last 
year put forward the plan for "transforming the operating 
mechanisms of or establishing a modern enterprise system in 
10,000 large and medium state enterprises, 1,000 key 
enterprises, 100 different types of large and medium state 
enterprises, and enterprises in 10 cities or prefectures." The 
practice of transforming operating mechanisms or establishing a 
modern enterprise system encapsulates the second section of the 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee: We should advance enterprise-related work and 
enterprise reform on all fronts, and all state enterprises 
should effectively implement the "Regulations Governing the 
Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial 
Enterprises" and the soon-to-be-promulgated "Regulations on the 
Supervision and Management of Property in State-Owned 
Enterprises," focus on changing their operating mechanisms, and 
create conditions and lay the groundwork for establishing a 
modern enterprise system. The numbers "10,000, 1,000, 100, and 
10" give concrete expression to achieving breakthroughs in key 
areas in the current enterprise reform. This means achieving 
breakthroughs in key areas to promote overall reform through the 
pioneering role of some enterprises and through supplementary 
reform in some cities. The number "10,000" undergirds this 
effort. 
  The number "10,000" means fully granting approximately 
10,000 
state enterprises the 14 types of operational rights which 
enterprises are supposed to enjoy according to the "Regulations 
Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned 
Industrial Enterprises." It also means making great efforts to 
realize the transformation of operating mechanisms, effectively 
implementing the "two sets of rules," and completing the 
appraisal of fixed assets and working capital, so as to lay a 
solid foundation for establishing a modern enterprise system and 
for advancing toward the market. This is completely consistent 
with the goal set by the State Council of increasing the 
proportion of well-run large and medium state enterprises from 
one-third to two-thirds by the end of the "Eighth Five-Year 
Plan." 
  In implementing the "Regulations Governing the Change of 
Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," we 
should mainly carry out four tasks: 1) Promulgating and 
implementing supplementary rules and regulations; 2) continuing 
to intensify publicity efforts, investigating and dealing with 
cases in which the "Regulations Governing the Change of 
Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" are 
violated and retaliatory action is taken against enterprises, 
and exposing those cases in the news media or even investigating 
legal responsibilities; 3) continuing to promote the 
transformation of governmental functions, granting enterprises 
operational rights, and accelerating the reform of government 
bodies; and 4) encouraging enterprises to turn inward, combine 
their operational rights and responsibilities, and use the 
rights at their disposal to transform their operating 
mechanisms. To carry out these tasks, we should focus on 
granting enterprises the right to independently conduct export 
trade and to refuse to share financial charges, improve 
procedures for examining and approving applications for 
permission to independently conduct export and import trade 
through simplified formalities and greater efficiency. We 
should allow enterprises, which have been granted the right to 
independently conduct the export and import trade, to enjoy the 
same power as foreign trade enterprises in terms of export 
licenses and quotas. We should consider the effort to halt the 
practice of collecting unwarranted fees an important aspect of 
the anticorruption struggle. All localities and businesses 
should formulate specific measures in light of their actual 
conditions to halt the practice, publish those measures, and 
allow enterprises to oversee the implementation of those 
measures. We should make active efforts to create conditions, 
and guide and assist enterprises in instituting self-control 
mechanisms so they will operate in accordance with the law and 
assume responsibility for their own profits and losses and for 
preserving and increasing the value of state assets. This year, 
all localities and departments should uncover and nurture a 
number of exemplary enterprises which have successfully changed 
their operating mechanisms, and which are well-managed and 
efficient, and they should sum up and promote the advanced 
experiences of these enterprises. 
In implementing the "two sets of rules," we also should 
primarily carry out four tasks: 1) Further tracking, 
ascertaining, and correctly understanding the situation, and 
promoting the implementation of the "two sets of rules" and the 
Finance Ministry's "Circular on the Question of Harmonizing 
Policies on Implementing the New Enterprise Financial System"; 
2) Aligning the "two sets of rules" with the "Interim 
Regulations on Enterprise Income Tax" and other new tax codes, 
and promptly addressing the common problems of enterprises in 
implementing the new tax system; 3) Continuing to perfect the 
enterprise financial and accounting system in accordance with 
the demands of the "Company Law" and the new tax system; and 4) 
Actively searching for a management accounting system with 
Chinese characteristics that meets the demands of a modern 
enterprise system. 
  Enterprises should perfect their cost accounting system, 
enhance their capacity for continued development, and ensure 
that the value of state assets is preserved and increased. 
Backbone state enterprises which can cope with the situation 
may quicken the pace of depreciation after obtaining approval to 
do so. To the extent permitted by state policies, state 
enterprises may raise money through various channels to 
supplement their capital, and wholly state-owned enterprises, 
which have been around for a long time and which will be exempt 
from delivering their after-tax profits to the state in the near 
future, may increase their common reserve funds and public 
welfare funds with the surplus money in accordance with the "two 
sets of rules." 
  During this year's appraisal of fixed assets and working 
capital, we should bring 10,000 large and medium state 
enterprises within the scope of our appraisal, and these include 
pilot enterprises that will implement the system of appointed 
supervisory boards and the modern enterprise system, all state 
enterprises in the 10 cities designated for experimenting with 
the practice of "optimizing the capital structure and 
invigorating enterprises," and two-thirds of large and medium 
enterprises in all localities whose fixed assets and working 
capital have not been appraised. We should take care to 
coordinate efforts and solve problems in the course of 
implementation to ensure that the task of appraising fixed 
assets and working capital is completed with good qualitative 
and quantitative results. Along with the transformation of 
governmental functions, we should improve our work in appraising 
fixed assets and working capital and give full rein to the roles 
of certified public accountants, registered auditors, and other 
intermediary agencies in society. 
  The plan for "transforming the operating mechanisms of or 
establishing a modern enterprise system in 10,000 large and 
medium state enterprises, 1,000 key enterprises, 100 different 
types of large and medium state enterprises, and enterprises in 
10 cities or prefectures" is a new concept for improving large 
and medium state enterprises in the new situation. We should 
seriously study and publicize the "Decision" of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
"Company Law," and increase our understanding of the importance, 
urgency, and arduousness of changing the operating mechanisms of 
state enterprises and of establishing a modern enterprise 
system. The principal leaders of economic and trade commissions 
in all localities should concentrate on undertaking meticulous 
efforts, organizationally and in terms of leadership; they 
should devote painstaking and major efforts to tracking the way 
the "two sets of rules" are implemented in 10,000 large and 
medium state enterprises so as to make substantial progress this 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- On March 4, Wei 
Jingsheng was summoned in accordance with the law by the public 
security organ of Beijing for violating the relevant regulations 
during his probation period for parole. 
  Wei Jingsheng was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in 
October 1979 in accordance with the law by the Chinese court on 
account of violating the criminal law by engaging in activities 
which endangered the state security. 
  Last September, he was granted parole in accordance with the 
law by the Chinese judicial organ in the light of his behavior 
in prison.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" commentary by dissident Wei Jingsheng: </F>
"Investors Beware of Beijing's Changing Times"] 
  [Text] [Editor's note] This commentary was written for 
Eastern Express by Wei Jingsheng before he was detained by 
Chinese police in Beijing yesterday. [end editor's note] 
  As a general rule, people go into business using as a basis 
their own experiences and what they have learned from others. 
With certain assurances, they then risk their own money or 
someone else's. Very few run their business according to what 
teachers have told them. Even fewer seek advice from 
politicians. This is because what teachers and politicians can 
offer in the way of advice is already taken for granted -- it is 
a constant factor in economic activity. 
  Competent entrepreneurs are those who utilise their 
foresight 
and judgement in that domain of uncertainty, or who fall upon 
good luck (and achieve success). From a different point of 
view, the more fixed and guaranteed the economic and legal 
system, the smaller the domain of risk. Such an environment 
safeguards not only the income of employees but also the profits 
of entrepreneurs and traders. Since entrepreneurs can devote 
time and energy to a smaller area of changeability, their 
efficiency quota will be higher and their luck can improve, even 
though not everyone will strike it rich. 
  The history of developed countries is a good example. 
Crosscountry comparisons do not easily give simple, clear and 
explanatory analysis because they are confused by many factors 
including different cultural backgrounds, historical geography, 
resource circumstances and even the number of people. Some 
academics prefer the most complex approach and the most dubious 
answer because that helps increase attention paid to their works 
and puts off critics (readers confused by the superfluous and 
boring works will find it just as hard to understand what the 
critics are saying). But businessmen and politicians tend to 
state and solve problems only in the simplest and clearest way 
in order to avoid missing an opportunity. 
  I can sum up simply: By comparing people at different 
levels, the benefits of the people (businessmen included) will 
be secured and the competency of businessmen will be increased, 
since in any country, as the standard of the authority and the 
justice in the legal system of all countries is improved, the 
rights of the people will be better guaranteed, and their 
economic capabilities enhanced. 
  I do believe that businessmen have different degrees of 
talent and this may have no relation to educational attainment, 
because the one who gets the highest grades will not necessarily 
be the winner in the world of business. 
  Consider for a moment the developmental history of other 
countries, which makes it clear no country or society can 
dispense with legal protections or economic environment 
standards if it is to upgrade its economy. 
  This is an important issue for investors to consider. 
  Anyone who does not believe this, need only look back on 
their own country's development history or consult a veteran 
businessman who has experienced this history. Most of them 
would agree with my simple conclusion here. 
  But in no circumstances should you consult the professor who 
has written many volumes of academic writings. If you do, I 
doubt you will ever reach the correct conclusion. Most people, 
unlike the professor, would find it difficult to avoid fainting 
under the weight of tedious and cliched conjecture. 
  What I have been discussing here is directly relevant to the 
current investment environment in China. This explains why 
China -- a nation which has considerable business experience -- 
has not produced many successful businessmen or companies. The 
reason is that the economic environment in China lacks the 
constant factors that are so prevalent in the West, and it does 
not have an effective and fair legal environment. It has 
nothing to do with any supposed shortage of talent or lack of 
desire to get rich. 
  Some Western businessmen arrogantly claim "China does not 
protect the property of its own people from encroachment, but it 
does protect property owned by foreigners". There are also some 
smooth talkers in the Chinese government who are offering 
guarantees to everyone, saying: "Although China's economic 
environment is not perfect, the Chinese government provides 
preferential conditions to foreigners," and so on. 
  I think people who say things like this are tricksters, or 
at 
least they lack judgement and foresight. If you invest your own 
money or that of others on the basis of their poor judgement, it 
is certain the risks will be several times greater than for an 
investment in your own country: This is because most people 
make judgements conditioned by their experiences in their own 
countries. So it is certain that someone will be cheated. 
  Just as some people accustomed to the affluent lifestyles in 
the West cannot imagine how Chinese people survive on an income 
of less than US$100 a year, managers and businessmen who are 
used to legal protection find it difficult to estimate risks in 
a society like China where there is no legal protection. 
  In fact, if I were to make a list of the contingencies you 
would face, it would be as long as the writings of the 
professors. I can only tell you this: In a situation where you 
are protected, then it is easy for you to know what that 
protection is; but when you are not protected, you will find it 
very difficult to know what risks you may face. 
  Logic would suggest that any government that fails to 
provide 
an adequate economic environment for its citizens while, at the 
same time, offering preferential treatment to foreigners is 
treating its citizens unfairly. 
  The citizens of this country will not put up with such 
unfair 
treatment for long. They will use every means to change this 
situation. We know from history that at times of great social 
change, unfair phenomena can easily change to the opposite 
extreme. That is, while it is the Chinese citizens who are 
treated unfairly, in the future it may be the foreigner. 
  There are numerous instances over the past century which 
illustrate this. This is particularly so in situations where 
foreigners have participated in the exploitation and oppression 
of local citizens, and more so when this oppression and 
exploitation drives the majority of people to anger past reason. 
Even a great and powerful politician would have no choice but 
to give way to this kind of deep, popular emotion of revenge. 
  The Chinese people are a rational race, but other people 
must 
be rational as well. The Chinese, moreover, always look down on 
unscrupulous businessmen who are concerned only with profit. 
  The main problem with investing in China, therefore is that 
what is needed first of all is a political investment. This 
would not only be helpful to the Chinese people, but would allow 
foreign businessmen to create a favorable economic environment 
for themselves, and contribute to protecting the economic 
interests of all. 
  The potential of China's vast market is very seductive. But 
if investors fail to invest in helping the rational forces of 
democratic reform, and instead leave China's fate in the hands 
of reactionary autocrats or other unpredictable elements, then 
this is not merely harmful to the interests of the Chinese 
people. It is also harmful to the interests of the businessmen 
who have invested in the China market themselves. 
  Because it doesn't matter what passport you hold; when you 
are operating in China you have become a part of the Chinese 
economic system -- a passport has no validity in the market. 
  You may be thinking like many Chinese private entrepreneurs: 
"Take advantage of the situation while the communist party 
hasn't got on to me, make a bundle quick and then get out." If 
you do this you may be able to make a great deal of dirty money. 
But I warn you to make sure you get out at the right time. 
Don't get your feet so stuck in the mud that you can't pull 
them out.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 7 (AFP) -- Hong Kong may lose 
between 133 to 187 billion Hong Kong dollars (17 to 24 billion 
US) in trade if the United States withdraws China's 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status, the government warned 
Monday. Hong Kong, China's main gateway for international 
trade, would also lose between 19 to 26 billion Hong Kong 
dollars (2.4 to 3.3 billion US) in income, while 54,000 to 
75,000 people would lose their jobs, the trade department said 
in its latest assessment. "A reduction of up to 77 billion Hong 
Kong dollars (9.87 billion US) worth of re-export is double the 
impact that we estimated in 1990," Christopher Jackson, deputy 
director-general of trade, said. "This is largely the result of 
the very rapid growth in Hong Kong's re-export of China-made 
goods to the United States over the past few years," he said. 
  US President Bill Clinton has demanded improvements in 
China's record on human rights, trade and arms sales, before 
renewing its MFN status for another year. Renewal falls due in 
June. Since Friday, China has detained eight dissidents in 
defiance of US warnings that improvements in its human rights 
record are a precondition to MFN renewal. The issue is likely 
to top the agenda when US Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
visits Beijing on Friday. 
  The withdrawal of China's MFN status would also have a 
significant adverse effect on manufacturing investment ventures 
and other production projects by Hong Kong and foreign companies 
in China, Jackson said. "We have to step up our lobbying 
activities in Washington," said Jackson in order to impress upon 
members of the US administration and Congress the damage which 
MFN withdrawal would do to Hong Kong and to American interests 
in the region.

  [Text] Shenzhen, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong's current 
political and economic situation, its democracy, and many 
important post-transition affairs are issues under constant 
consideration by Hong Kong affairs advisers. They freely 
expressed their views at a forum held by the State Council's 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office [SCHKMAO] and the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY's Hong Kong Branch [XNAHKB] in the past couple of days, 
thereby demonstrating a great sense of responsibility befitting 
those who are the masters of their own affairs. 
  The forum for Hong Kong affairs advisers was held in 
Shenzhen 
from 2 to 3 March. SCHKMAO Director Lu Ping and XNAHKB Director 
Zhou Nan presided over the forum and listened to advisers' 
views. During the forum, the advisers pointed out: Britain's 
"White Paper" announced recently and its various unilateral 
sabotages of the talks revealed the deceptive nature of 
"cooperation with China" -- a phrase that it has kept on 
repeating. The negative example set by Britain which may serve 
as a lesson has made more and more Hong Kong people realize the 
truth and become disillusioned. We must specially watch out for 
various "actions" on the part of the Hong Kong British 
authorities, such as making trouble in the economic and banking 
sectors, before they pull out. Analyzing the series of moves 
taken by the Hong Kong British authorities in recent years, some 
advisers believed that Britain's sabotage of Sino-British talks 
and Hong Kong's smooth transition was planned beforehand for the 
purpose of leaving a "hot potato" for the special 
administrative regional government in the future. In this 
connection, China should make proper preparations to meet 
various emergencies. 
  The issues of government functionaries' and people's 
livelihood in Hong Kong also caught the attention of advisers. 
During the forum, they discussed how to solve the housing, 
transportation, and public security problems facing ordinary 
citizens and how to guarantee the support for the aged after 
they have retired; they made many constructive suggestions. 
  The advisers said: There are only a little more than three 
years left before China regains its sovereignty over Hong Kong 
in 1997. As China and Britain fail to reach an agreement, 
preparatory work for the special administrative regional 
government should be accelerated. In this regard, the tasks of 
the Preliminary Working Committee are particularly important. 
The arduous tasks should be jointly undertaken by all patriotic 
Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong with the attitude of those 
who are the masters of their own affairs. The Hong Kong affairs 
advisers will also make efforts, communicate with the broad 
masses of citizens, and make contributions to Hong Kong's smooth 
transition and to its long-term prosperity and stability. 
  In their speeches, relevant persons in charge of the SCHKMAO 
and XNAHKB who attended the meeting said: The rule of Hong Kong 
by Hong Kong people after "97" is possible only with the 
participation of the Hong Kong people before "97." The 
advisers' views and suggestions are a concrete embodiment of the 
active participation by the Hong Kong people; they play a role 
in promoting the post-transition work and, meanwhile, reflect 
the prospect of "the rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people" as 
well as the confidence that Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have 
in marching toward 1997. 
  SCHKMAO Deputy Director Chen Ziying and XNAHKB Deputy 
Director Qin Wenjun attended the forum.

  [Text] China would not meddle in the administration of 
Hong Kong after 1997 and would immediately put to a stop to any 
interference that was occurring now, the Chinese leader in 
charge of Hong Kong affairs promised yesterday. "Some district 
officials and even high-up central government officials have 
been sticking their hands into Hong Kong," Lu Ping, the Director 
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said in Shenzhen. 
"No department or district will be permitted to meddle in or 
interfere with Hong Kong's business or affairs," he told an 
approving audience of rotarians at a club luncheon. 
  "The prevention of this sort of thing happening starts now." 
He said Hong Kong people could expect to see officers of the 
People's Liberation Army in the territory but he pledged that 
Beijing would not station members of the People's Armed Police 
in the territory. 
  China would adhere to the principle of "one country, two 
systems" and the provisions of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and Basic Law to maintain the status quo after the 
change of sovereignty. He said Hong Kong should remain a 
business centre and should serve as a "golden bridge" between 
the two different economies. It should never be turned into a 
"political bridge" through which someone could penetrate and 
alter the mainland's socialist system. 
  "Anybody who wanted to transform the two systems into one 
was 
only daydreaming," he said. "Hong Kong people should prevent 
this golden bridge from breaking down. 
  "And the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office would bear the 
responsibility of promoting the Basic Law on the mainland so 
that all departments observe the Basic Law in dealing with 
matters relating to Hong Kong." 
  Mr Lu conceded during his 40-minute speech that some 
mainland 
officials had expressed views that were contrary to the Basic 
Law and this was a problem raised by some Hong Kong affairs 
advisers earlier in the week. But he reiterated the importance 
of the principle of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and said 
the formation of the Preliminary Working Committee had provided 
the starting point in this direction. More Hong Kong people 
could take part in preparatory work for the Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) government and it would lead to a 
solid foundation for the future administration, he said. 
  His remarks were made just hours before China launched 
another advisory body in Hong Kong, incorporating 274 community 
leaders from a wide political spectrum into a group to be called 
district affairs advisers. There were some small "l" liberals 
among the appointees, but there were still no members associated 
with the United Democrats [UDHK], a group labelled by mainland 
officials as "subversive". 
  The third tier of advisers, after the Hong Kong Affairs 
Advisers and the Preliminary Working Committee, taps the Hong 
Kong Government's existing system of advice and representation. 
There are 20 municipal councillors, one legislator and 108 
district board members -- 12 of them being board chairmen. 
Other are kaifong association representatives, academics and 
businessmen. 
  In an apparent bid to address criticism that China was 
unwilling to hear sharply dissenting views, the new list of 
advisers includes a few moderate democrats. Meeting Point has 
been given two seats, while the Association for Democracy and 
People's Livelihood (ADPL) got four. The pro-China Democratic 
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong will provide 43 
advisers. 
  Speaking at the launching ceremony at the China Resources 
Building in Wanchai, XINHUA (the New China News Agency) director 
Zhou Nan asked the advisers to make use of their "wisdom and 
their influence" in society to work for a smooth transition. 
Although there were people who tried to create obstacles to the 
return of Hong Kong to its motherland, the Chinese people would 
not bow to it, Mr Zhou said. "We will stand firm together with 
the patriots in the recovery of Hong Kong's sovereignty, 
following the (principles of) `one country two systems' and 
`Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong people' set out in the Basic 
Law," he said. 
  In a brief outline of the advisers' duties, Mr Zhou said 
they 
should be able to reflect the views of the Hong Kong people and 
promote the Basic Law, the mini-constitution for the SAR. Mr 
Zhou also called on the advisers to encourage the public to 
participate in all sorts of social affairs, but he did not go 
into detail. They should also offer their opinions and 
suggestions on important issues related to the sovereignty 
changeover, he said. 
  Mr Zhou did not say whether advisers would be consulted on 
district affairs, their area of expertise. Quoting the words of 
the paramount Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Mr Zhou said it was 
important for "those who love China and Hong Kong to participate 
actively in all sorts of social and political affairs of Hong 
Kong." 
  UDHK vice-chairman Yeung Sum yesterday criticised the new 
body as merely a "united front tactic" by the Chinese Government 
to isolate the party. Mr Yeung said he was not surprised nor 
disappointed to find all party members excluded from the new 
organisation. "We are not their target for a united front 
because some of our members supported the pro-democracy movement 
in 1989," he said. "But the Chinese side should think about 
whether they should isolate us in the long run if they really 
want to listen to the voice of people in Hong Kong." 
  But appointee ADPL vice-chairman Leung Kwong-cheong, 
defended 
the role of the advisers, saying that it was important to 
strengthen communication with China. Asked if this could split 
the territory's pro-democracy camp, Mr Leung said: "No one 
could split us but ourselves. It is important that other 
pro-democracy groups do not criticise us (for becoming advisers) 
all the time. 
  "If they noticed anything wrong with our performance, say we 
did not convey a certain kind of opinion, they are welcome to 
give us constructive advice," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Su Hung-ju (5685 7703 0320): "Lu </F>
Ping Says To Maintain Hong Kong's Prosperity, It Is Most 
Important To Preserve Its Economic Value"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 4 Mar (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of 
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, today 
made a speech at the 34th annual meeting of the Rotary Club of 
the Hong Kong and Macao regions; he said that, to maintain Hong 
Kong's prosperity and stability, the most important thing to do 
is to maintain Hong Kong's economic value, and this is the most 
basic point. The Preliminary Work Committee has now been 
established, and its purpose is to enable the Hong Kong people 
to participate in the preparatory work for the Special 
Administration Region [SAR] during the transition period, to lay 
a good foundation for the future SAR government and create 
conditions for a high degree of autonomy and for Hong Kong 
people to run Hong Kong. He pointed out that this duty is very 
difficult. 
  Lu Ping said in his speech that the economic development, 
reform, and opening up on the mainland has promoted Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability; conversely, Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stability have also supported the economic construction of the 
motherland. As 1997 draws closer, these kinds of ties will 
become closer; this trend is in accordance with the interests of 
both places as well as with the common wish of the people of the 
two places. 
  Lu Ping went on to say that these kinds of relations will be 
developed on the premise of "one country, two systems." 
Although the two places will be reunited as one family in the 
future, Hong Kong will continue to practice capitalism, while 
the mainland will keep practicing socialism. On 1 July 1997, 
the Hong Kong people will find that Hong Kong remains the same 
except that the red five-star flag and the bauhinia [flower that 
is the emblem of Hong Kong] flag will flutter outside their 
windows; as for civil servants, all of them will go to work as 
usual on that day, except for a few major officials who must be 
nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the central 
people's government. 
  Lu Ping pointed out that this is not a dream and expressed 
his firm belief that each element of this vision will come true 
on 1 July 1997. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's 
primary duty is to enable all of this to come true, and it is 
also the goal of everyone's struggle. 
  Lu Ping said that, in order to maintain Hong Kong's 
prosperity and stability, the most important thing to do is to 
maintain Hong Kong's economic value. Hong Kong brings benefits 
to the country with its economic value, not its political value. 
He pointed out that a series of policies and principles 
formulated by the central government has also proceeded from 
this point and added that one of the important factors 
contributing to Hong Kong's success is its status as an economic 
city -- not as a so-called political city, which it never was. 
  Lu Ping also said that 99 percent of the Hong Kong 
compatriots are patriotic and hope to get along well with the 
mainland and do not want to see confrontation. This is the 
reason why the Chinese side firmly believes that "one country, 
two systems" will surely succeed in Hong Kong, that the Basic 
Law will surely be implemented, and that Hong Kong can maintain 
its prosperity and stability in 1997. 
  Lu Ping explained that, in the past when Deng Xiaoping 
proposed "one country, two systems" to solve the Hong Kong 
question, he wanted to maintain Hong Kong's original appearance 
in every area, to enable it to become a bridge linking the 
economy of the East to the economy of the West. This is a 
superiority for Hong Kong which the other three small dragons do 
not have. The Chinese side has no intention of imposing the 
mainland's system on Hong Kong; nor does it seek to influence 
Hong Kong. That type of behavior would not be consistent with 
"one country, two systems." 
  Lu Ping pointed out that allowing Hong Kong's capitalist 
system to remain unchanged, allowing Hong Kong people to run 
Hong Kong, and allowing Hong Kong to have a high degree of 
autonomy was not an outcome of the Sino-British talks, for it 
had been decided long before the Sino-British talks started and 
had been written into the Joint Declaration and its annex as a 
statement by the Chinese Government. After 1997, the central 
government will only be responsible for Hong Kong's foreign 
affairs and defense, and other matters will be handled by the 
SAR itself. 
  Lu Ping pointed out that, by establishing the Preliminary 
Work Committee at this time, the Chinese side has primarily 
sought to embody participation by the Hong Kong people, to 
enable the Hong Kong people to take part in the preparatory work 
for the SAR, to lay a good foundation for the future SAR 
government together and give it a good starting point, and to 
create conditions for a high degree of autonomy and for Hong 
Kong people to run Hong Kong. By so doing, what the Hong Kong 
people will receive on 1 July 1997 will be an SAR which is 
economically prosperous, financially overflowing, socially 
stable, and all set and orderly in every aspect. 
  Lu Ping admitted that this is a difficult duty, but he and 
his colleagues will view it as a sacred mission entrusted to 
them by 1.1 billion people and will contribute their own efforts.

  [Text] China's top official in Hong Kong said last night 
the mainland's ultimate aim was a fully and directly elected 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government 16 years 
after 1997. He said the intention was to make the fourth 
legislature directly elected. Lu Ping, the director of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said the aim was part of China's 
drive to implement the principle of "Hong Kong people ruling 
Hong Kong". 
  Speaking in Shenzhen, Lu said: "It is also our ultimate aim 
that the chief executive of the SAR government will eventually 
be returned by 'one-person, one-vote'." China has already 
appointed 274 Hong Kong people to serve as its first group of 
advisers on the running of Hong Kong's nine district or 
municipal boards. Lu tried to calm fears that Beijing would not 
approve a directly elected legislature, saying that the 
universal franchise in Hong Kong would only need "registering" 
with China's National People's Congress. 
  Addressing Rotary International's 34th district conference, 
Lu gave reassurances that Hong Kong would have autonomy in its 
own affairs 16 years after 1997 -- with the exception of defence 
and foreign affairs, which would be the responsibilities of 
China's central government. Lu said the Chinese leadership had 
repeatedly pointed out that no department in the central 
government or any province would be allowed to interfere in Hong 
Kong's affairs. 
  He said issues like the construction of the new airport 
would 
become "domestic affairs." "All this is stated in the Basic 
Law," he said. Lu said it was his job at the Hong Kong and 
Macao Office to promote the Basic Law in and outside Hong Kong, 
making sure that all Chinese officials stick to Hong Kong's 
future mini-constitution. 
  Hong Kong was a "golden bridge" for China to establish links 
with the West, he said. "China needs a place which practises 
capitalism to act as a bridge to establish economic links with 
the west," he said. But he warned against trying to turn Hong 
Kong into a "political bridge" to change the socialist system in 
China.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Agenda" page by David Chu, Preliminary </F>
Working Committee member and PRC adviser: "Revised Laws 
Imminent But Not Draconian"] 
  [Text] Freedom of movement has played a vital role in Hong 
Kong's success. I believe it must be preserved and indeed 
enhanced in the future. To foster an open Hong Kong, the future 
regulations on permanent residency should be moderate and 
inclusive rather than harsh and exclusive. 
  The Basic Law was written in this spirit. As an 
illustration, it states quite clearly that anyone living in Hong 
Kong who has no right of abode elsewhere can become a permanent 
resident of the Special Administrative Region (SAR). In theory, 
if any Hong Kong resident -- regardless of race or former 
nationality -- wants to become a permanent resident, all he has 
to do is give up his right of abode elsewhere before 1997. He 
will not even need to pledge allegiance or go through a ceremony 
or any such rigmarole, which is customary in most, if not all, 
countries. 
  As a member of the panel on security and welfare of the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), I am working on various 
recommendations regarding the granting of permanent residency to 
returning former residents with new foreign passports, foreign 
nationals who are currently living and working in Hong Kong and 
future newcomers. Some of the tentative thinking of the panel 
is outlined below and more consultation is required before these 
recommendations are formalised and submitted to the 1996 
Preparatory Committee. 
  For returning former Hong Kong residents with foreign 
passports, their residency in the territory before acquiring 
their new passports can be used to fulfil the seven-year 
residency requirement in the Basic Law. 
  Foreign residents having completed the seven-year residency 
requirement need only fill in a form (no supporting material 
required) and meet some objective conditions to support their 
claim that they intend to stay in Hong Kong. These conditions 
relate to ownership of property, job or business investments, 
the presence of family in Hong Kong and time spent in the 
territory. No proof that these conditions have been met is 
required. This welcoming attitude is in stark contrast to the 
British 1981 Nationality Act, which stripped Hong Kong people of 
the right of abode in the United Kingdom. 
  The British Government is advising China that it is in 
China's interest to keep Hong Kong open to all. Although China 
is likely to go down this line, I would certainly question the 
sincerity of the British advice. There has been some grumbling 
that China's nationality criteria are racially based or biased. 
This is an emotive oversimplification. While China confers 
citizenship on its people -- who may be Han, Xi Yuan, Korean, 
Manchu, Tibetan Mongolian or other ethnic stock -- it is not 
acting in any way out of the ordinary. For example, the German 
constitution accords instant residency and citizenship to anyone 
of German descent, whether or not that individual speaks the 
language and even if his family has been living abroad for 
generations. A Turk born in Germany is not so privileged. 
  The United Kingdom has granted citizenship to white South 
Africans with tenuous blood links to Britain, but its attitude 
towards the Hong Kong Chinese, however, is quite different. 
Japan also welcomes home its prodigals, including those of its 
nationals born or left behind in China after World War 11, but 
it is rather meaner towards ethnic Koreans, some of whom have 
been harshly treated for generations. 
  I believe that Hong Kong should be open and truly 
international. Only then can we attract experts and investors -- 
be they American, Japanese, Singaporean, German, French or 
British -- to live, work and compete, and who will complement 
the ethnic Chinese on terms of equality not quite possible while 
Hong Kong is a colony of the United Kingdom. I am sure the 
British would welcome the new competition in the spirit 
of"openness" and "fairness". 
  Whatever wrongs have been inflicted on China by foreign 
powers, and even though Hong Kong is a reminder of its past 
humiliations, China has nevertheless accepted the special 
circumstances of this diverse city and the qualities that make 
it unique. The PWC is entrusted with giving thorough advice to 
the Chinese Government to preserve the extraordinary qualities 
of Hong Kong. 
  I personally invite people, whatever their nationality and 
race, to take heart and to take part in the SAR. That the Basic 
Law allows for 20 per cent of the future legislature to be open 
to foreign nationals is remarkably generous. I cannot think of 
a legislature anywhere -- not the British House of Commons and 
not the American Senate -- quite like it. 
  Experts predict that Hong Kong will be the financial mecca 
of 
the next century, surpassing Tokyo. If that comes to pass, some 
of the credit should go to the policy, which the PWC advocates, 
of opening Hong Kong to even more international trade, commerce 
and investment, partly through the welcoming of other nationals 
to reside here.

<F P=106> [By SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST political desk] </F>
  [Text] One out of four public office holders on Hong Kong 
district boards and municipal councils has been appointed by 
China in its first batch of district affairs advisers. On top 
of the 128 office bearers in Hong Kong's district councils, 
China extended its united front to another 146 prominent 
community leaders and one legislator. The group will advise 
Beijing on local district affairs up to 1997. 
  Notwithstanding the 274 community leaders offered the new 
title, China is prepared to enlarge the team of district affairs 
advisers in the near future. With the change in sovereignty 
3-1/2 years away, China's team of district affairs advisers is 
comparable to those serving the British Hong Kong 
administration. One hundred and eight out of 414 district board 
members were offered the title, including 20 out of 76 municipal 
councillors. More importantly, 12 of the 19 district board 
chairmen were appointed. 
  With the two municipal council chairmen and three district 
board chairmen already Hong Kong affairs advisers, only four 
district board leaders are left with no Chinese post. But the 
four remaining district board chairmen are likely to be among 
the third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers to be announced 
soon. Nearly all district board chairmen have strongly 
supported China in the Sino-British row over political reform. 
  Also named yesterday were 40 out of the 140 appointed 
district board members who are set to lose their seats after the 
board election in September, when appointed seats are to be 
abolished. Among the 274 appointees, 62 have party affiliations. 
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, which 
is pro- China topped the list with 43 members appointed. Second 
on the list is the biggest party in the Legislative Council, the 
Liberal Party, which had seven members named. 
  The party's former executive director Sylvester Tse Tak-kan 
was also appointed. It is followed by another conservative 
party, the Liberal Democratic Federation, with six members, 
including the party's only legislator, Alfred Tso Shiu-wai. Two 
liberal parties, the Association for Democracy and People's 
Livelihood and the Meeting Point, had four and two members 
appointed respectively. But liberal flagship United Democrats 
had no members named. 
  Those without party affiliation came from neighbourhood 
kaifong associations, pro-China trade unions and local district 
groups. Two expatriates were appointed -- Urban Councillor 
Brook Bernacchi and Eastern District Board member Joseph 
Salaroli. 
  Mr Bernacchi, who came from Britain in 1945, said he 
believed 
his experience in the Urban Council would be helpful to a smooth 
transition. "China is entitled to understand the organisation 
of Hong Kong at the district boards and the Urban Council," said 
the most senior Queen's Counsel and veteran leader of one of the 
oldest political parties in Hong Kong, the Reform Club. Mr 
Bernacchi, 72, admitted the advisory body was set up partly for 
the purpose of propaganda. But he said China knew little about 
the operation of the district boards and the municipal councils. 
  Another appointee, Mr Salaroli, an Italian, said he had 
accepted the appointment in view of the Sino-British row. Asked 
if he was happy about the appointment, Mr Salaroli from the 
Democratic Foundation said: "Why should I be happy... But 
after all, I was picked from so many people and I am quite 
proud. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  As for the appointment of liberals as district affairs 
advisers, Meeting Point legislator Fred Li Wah-ming said his 
party respected members' decision to accept the offer. He said 
he hoped the two advisers from his party would reflect their 
opinions about district affairs to the Chinese Government. He 
said China should appoint more people from the liberal camps to 
think tanks such as the Preliminary Working Committee and the 
future Preparatory Committee for the Special Administrative 
Region. "I think the Chinese side should at least let Hong Kong 
people feel that it can tolerate different views to enhance the 
credibility of their organisations and advisory bodies," he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China's recent 
foreign exchange reforms are expected to have a favorable impact 
on Hongkong's external trade, according to economic monthly 
released by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation here 
today. 
  China's reforms, begun on December 29, will help the country 
in its bid to rejoin GATT and remove some of the obstacles to 
the opening up of the country's banking system. In the longer 
term significant benefits are likely to derive from the improved 
efficiency of the Chinese economy, the monthly stated. 
  On the other hand, the monthly added, a number of 
uncertainties and problems may be created by the reforms. 
Inflationary pressure may be generated by the higher prices of 
some imports, some domestic enterprises will incur higher costs 
and domestic exporters will be exposed to greater foreign 
exchange risks. 
  On the impact of the foreign exchange reforms for Hongkong's 
economic growth, the monthly said, the reforms are primarily 
expected to affect cross-border trade and investment flows 
between Hong Kong and the mainland as well as the territory's 
monetary sector, provided the new measures are introduced 
smoothly. 
  Hong Kong manufacturers engaged in outward processing and 
joint venture activities in China will generally benefit from 
the unification of the exchange rates, since some of their 
renminbi outlays that were previously purchased at the official 
rate can now be obtained at swap rates, the monthly said 
  This will reduce operating costs and mean that prices can be 
more competitive in international markets. The change will help 
to support Hongkong-mainland trade related to outward 
processing, which currently accounts for over 70 percent of 
Hongkong's imports from China and around half the territory's 
exports to the mainland. 
  Hong Kong is also expected to benefit from an increase in 
re-exports of Chinese origin. The effective devaluation of the 
renminbi due to the exchange rate unification and the fact that 
state enterprises are no longer obliged to sell part of their 
foreign exchange earnings to the government at the official rate 
will help boost the exports of Chinese state enterprises. 
  In general, the monthly said, the reforms are likely to 
stimulate trade flows between the mainland and Hong Kong, 
although the impact may not be significant in the short term. 
The main benefit is expected to come from the long-term 
efficiency improvements in the Chinese economic system. 
  Hong Kong, as the largest foreign investor in China, 
contributed 76 billion U.S. dollars, or two-thirds of total 
contractual foreign investment in China between 1979 and 1992.

  [Text] Geneva, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The issue of so-called 
human rights violations in China has been fabricated for 
political motives and China resolutely opposes this kind of 
slander and libel on a sovereign state by others using the 
pretext of human rights as a justification. 
  This was emphasized here today by Wang Guangya, vice deputy 
of the Chinese delegation attending the fifth session of the UN 
Commission on Human Rights. 
  "In recent years, a few Western countries and some 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have attacked China for 
what they allege are human rights violations and have frequently 
tabled anti-China draft resolutions on this issue. They either 
purposefully ignored the truth or know little about the real 
situation in China," said Wang. 
  "China is the biggest developing country in the world, with 
a 
population approaching 1.2 billion, and is now dedicated to 
economic construction to achieve a modern state. The Chinese 
Government is profoundly conscious of the fact that there is an 
imperative need for a stable and harmonious social environment 
in order to reach this goal," he said. 
  He pointed out that a tumultuous China would not only mean 
disaster to the Chinese people, but would also have grave 
repercussions for Asia's stability, as well as the whole world. 
  "It is precisely because of this responsible attitude to the 
Chinese people, and the world, and based on the actual 
conditions within the country that the Chinese Government has 
formulated, and is in the process of implementing, a policy that 
has economic construction as its center-piece, stresses reform 
and opening to the outside world and aims at building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  "Facts have shown that this was the right choice and it is 
now bearing fruit," he added. 
  "China today is experiencing rapid economic development, 
political stability, harmony among nationalities, and social 
advances. We are in the process of perfecting our democratic 
and legal institutions, and the living standards of the people 
of all our nationalities are constantly on the rise. All these 
are facts which are as clear as daylight," he said. 
  However, he stressed, some countries and ngos turn a blind 
eye to these facts and have tried to kick up a rumpus about the 
so-called "human rights questions in China". This is simply to 
put political pressure on China with the hope that the Chinese 
people will be forced to deviate from the path of development 
that they have chosen for themselves based on their own national 
conditions. The Chinese people and the Chinese Government will 
never accept this kind of pressure. 
  Speaking about the issue of so-called "human rights in 
Tibet", the Chinese vice deputy emphasized that more than a 
million of the Tibetan people only rid themselves of the yoke of 
serfdom to become their own masters and enjoy democratic rights, 
including the freedom of religious belief, after 1959, when the 
Chinese Government abolished the serf system and carried out 
democratic reforms in tibet. 
  Since then the Tibetan economy has enjoyed rapid growth, its 
distinct culture given full respect and the opportunity to 
develop. There has also been a marked improvement in the 
livelihood of the people. 
  He said that the reason why some people with ulterior 
motives 
still ignore these facts and continue to repeat the lies that 
the Chinese Government is violating human rights in Tibet is 
because they are trying to use the human rights issue as the 
pretext to instigate and support a handful of tibetan 
separatists engaged in splitting Tibet from China. 
  Wang said the fact that some NGOs openly advocate an 
"independent Tibet" in their public statements demonstrates 
their political motive. 
  "That sort of activity, inciting national hatred and the 
dismembering of sovereign states, has already caused turmoil, 
conflict and wars in many parts of the world, constituting a 
threat to regional as well as global stability and also 
endangering the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
millions and millions of people. This runs totally counter to 
the purpose of this commission which is the promotion and 
protection of human rights." he went on. 
  "Safeguarding the territorial integrity and the unity of all 
the nationalities in China, and rejecting any acts to foment 
hatred and splits amongst them are principles embodied in the 
Chinese Constitution. 
  "They reflect the fundamental interests of the Chinese 
people 
of all nationalities, including Tibetans. No attempts to break 
Tibet away from the rest of China will succeed," he said.

  [Text] Washington, March 7 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton announced here today that the U.S. will provide 70 
million dollars in technical and humanitarian assistance to the 
former Soviet republic of Georgia. 
  During a joint press conference with visiting Georgian 
President Eduard Shevardnadze, Clinton said Washington was 
inclined to consider sending U.N. peacekeepers to Georgia. 
  He praised the contributions to the "peaceful end to the 
Cold 
War" made by Shevardnadze, who had been foreign minister of the 
now- defunct Soviet Union. 
  "I reaffirmed in very strong terms America's support for the 
independence, the sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of 
georgia," Clinton said. 
  He said the United States would be inclined to support a 
U.N. 
peacekeeping operation in Georgia's Abkhazia region if the 
government and the rebels there can achieve success in their 
talks and maintain an effective cease-fire. 
  A possible U.N. peacekeeping presence in Georgia would need 
U.S. funding but not U.S. military units. 
  Shevardnadze, arrived here Sunday night [6 March], will be 
meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Article by Zheng Yongping: "Clinton's Asia-Pacific Policy"] </F>
  [Text] The top priority of the Clinton administrations's 
foreign policy is the promotion of American economic security, 
and no region in the world today is more important to the 
economic health and well-being of the United States than the 
Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific region contains the 
world's fastest-growing and most dynamic economies. It is the 
world's largest consumer market and the biggest U.S. goods and 
services export market. Already over 40 percent of U.S. trade 
is with the Asia- Pacific region. In 1992, U.S. transpacific 
trade was U.S.$325 billion -- almost 50 percent more than its 
trade with Western Europe and three times that with South 
America. Over 2.3 million American jobs are related to the 
annual U.S.$120 billion export to Asia. Because of its huge 
growth potential, the Asia-Pacific region will be of increasing 
economic significance to the future of the United States. It 
will be a vast source of jobs, income, partnership, and growth 
for the United States in the coming years. 
  In this context, the United States' active engagement in the 
Asia-Pacific region is unavoidable. President Bill Clinton laid 
out the Administration's blueprint for the Asia-Pacific policy 
in two speeches during his first Asian tour. The basic goal is 
to seek to build a New Pacific community. 
  The Clinton's version of the New Pacific Community features 
three inseparable and intertwined pillars; prosperity based on 
open and free markets; regional security based on preventive 
diplomacy and the control of nuclear and other dangerous 
weapons; and democracy in free and humane societies addressing 
global issues. 
  In the economic area, President Clinton listed three 
essentials for the New Pacific Community; a new relationship 
between the United States and Japan; an open global and regional 
economy; and commitment to democratic values. 
  President Clinton declared that the administration's first 
international economic priority would be to create a new and 
stronger partnership between the United States and Japan and 
that the U.S. relationship with Japan would be the centerpiece 
of U.S. policy toward the New Pacific Community. Japan is 
America's most important ally and its second largest trading 
partner. Producers in each of the two countries are consumers 
for companies in the other. But the economic relationship 
between the United States and Japan is not in balance. Unlike 
its relations with all other wealthly developed nations, the 
United States has a huge and persistent trade deficit with 
Japan. It usually exceeds U.S.$40 billion, with a deficit in 
manufacturing products in excess of U.S.$60 billion. Since the 
two countries account for nearly 40 percent of the world's 
output, the state of their economic relationship is extremely 
important not only to themselves but also to the Asia-Pacific 
region and the free trading system of the world. The failure to 
reduce their chronic trade deficit has been threatening the 
vital U.S.- Japan relationship. The Clinton administration 
became aware of the fact that the previous trade agreements had 
not worked because they lacked a commitment to tangible results, 
and they provided no way to measure success. Therefore, the 
administration began to focus on not trade by numbers but by 
results coming from better rules of trade when it held trade 
negotiations with the Japanese Government. After serious 
negotiations, the United States and Japan finally reached an 
agreement on the establishment of the U.S.-Japan framework for a 
new economic partnership in July 1993. Under this framework, 
the United States and Japan will negotiate a series of 
agreements that will allow greater penetration into the Japanese 
marketplace in specific areas and will include specific 
timetables and objective criteria for measuring success. 
President Clinton acclaimed this agreement as an important step 
toward a more balanced trade relationship between the United 
States and Japan. 
  The Clinton administration views an open regional and 
global economy as the second building block of the New Pacific 
community. That means that the United States will resist the 
pressures to put up walls to protect specific markets; will work 
to reduce regional trade barriers; and will head off regional 
trade blocs. In this respect the U.S. Government has made 
considerable success. On the global level, the international 
trade talks were completed with the Uruguay Round in the end of 
1993. The U.S. Government achieved what it had hoped for. This 
breakthrough brought good news for the United States because it 
means more jobs and new growth. On the regional level the 
principle of openness of the regional and global economy is 
accepted by most APEC leaders. At the unprecedented meetings of 
APEC leaders in Seattle in late November, Clinton not only 
affirmed U.S. continuous, active engagement in the region but 
also revealed the U.S. belief that the benefits of trade 
liberalization underlies U.S. commitment to the New Pacific 
Community. 
  In the security area, the Clinton administration believes 
there are four priorities for the security of the New Pacific 
Community. First, a continued American military presents in this 
region; second, stronger efforts to combat the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction; third, new regional dialogues on 
the full range of the common security challenges; and last, 
support for democracy and open societies throughout this region. 
  President Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
other U.S. officials made it very clear that the bedrock of 
America's security role in the Asia-Pacific region must be a 
continued military presence. The Clinton administration affirms 
U.S. bilateral security treaties with five Asia-Pacific 
countries: Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and 
Thailand. These treaties serve the interests of the United 
States. They enable U.S. armed force to maintain a substantial 
presence. While the defense budget has been cut in European and 
American domestic bases, the Clinton administration maintains 
the U.S. force level in Asia. After the closure of the 
Philippine bases, the United States has obtained increased 
access for its forces throughout Southeast Asia to facilitate 
the military presence there. All of these are signs that the 
United States is going to stay on in the region. 
  To prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the 
nuclear weapons in particular, and their means of delivery is 
the second priority of the Clinton administration for the New 
Pacific Community. In this respect, the United States has 
serious concerns about the suspected development of nuclear 
weapons on the Korean peninsula. It urges North Korea to 
fulfill its full-scope obligations to the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, including IAEA inspections of undeclared nuclear 
sites and to reaffirm its commitment to the Nonproliferation 
Treaty. The United States also pays close attention to the 
transshipment of missiles and sophisticated technologies. 
  Perhaps no development is more noticeable than the new 
emphasis in the Clinton administration on the regional security 
dialogues. From the Clinton's administration's point of view, 
the post-Cold War has produced a radical shift in the old 
balance of power. The New Pacific Community must forge a new 
regional balance that promotes stability. Unlike the Cold War 
era and unlike Europe, it is not a group of blocs set against 
each other or some common enemy. It will help to convey 
intentions to each other, to erase misperceptions, and to start 
building confidence. In this regard, the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference is 
regarded as a most promising forum. Clinton announced that the 
United States will participate as a full partner in regional 
security dialogues with the ASEAN and its associated members. 
He also made it clear that the ASEAN post ministerial 
conference is not the only framework in the Asia-Pacific region 
and it is by no means a supplanter of America's alliances or 
forward military presence in the region. 
  In conclusion, the Clinton administration's Asia-Pacific 
policy is one important component of the American foreign policy 
which is undergoing an adjustment. It aims to more actively 
participate in the Asia-Pacific region where the United State 
hopes to continue to play a dominant role while paying close 
attention to the manner which it does so.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "G-7 Jobs Summit To Share </F>
Diagnosis, Not Common Approach"] 
  [Text] Washington, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Corporate 
downsizing, global competition, structural changes and...layoffs 
in droves. The world's industrial nations are finding it hard 
to get people back to work. 
  Employment, described by the International Labor 
Organization 
(ILO) in a recent report as in a "global crisis" far more 
serious than the economic problem in the 1980s, has become a 
persistent headache in the West. 
  "Unemployment, not inflation is the main threat." This is 
the message of the 23 union representatives which gathered at 
the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial 
Organizations] headquarters last week, urging for a "global new 
deal" to help the jobless. 
  Any diagnosis to share? That's what the Clinton 
administration is talking about in preparing the much-taunted 
jobs summit of the group of seven nations, to be held a week 
from today in Detroit, Michigan. 
  "These countries are different. We are aiming not so much 
for a communique or an agreed-upon set of actions," said Labor 
Secretary Robert Reich last week. "We wish to share different 
kind of solutions." 
  "What's important to the United States is to get the rest of 
the industrialized world growing," said Alan Blinder, a member 
of the White House Council of Economic Advisers today, 
predicting the summit "a huge success." 
  The G-7 jobs summit, proposed by President Clinton in July 
and originally scheduled for last autumn, gathers the labor, 
finance, social service ministers from the U.S., Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, Italy and Canada, the latter five all posting 
double digit jobless rates. 
  With America's jobless rate dipping from 7.7 percent a year 
ago to 6.5 percent in February, the White House is busy claiming 
credit for the two million jobs added to the nation's payroll in 
the last 13 months. 
  U.S. officials, however, may find the American experience in 
job creation, coming along in the wake of stable economic 
recovery, good but irrelevant for the depressed labor market in 
Western Europe. 
  "I would doubt that the Europeans are very enthusiastic 
about 
the jobs summit," said Peter Richards, a Geneva-based ILO 
economist, in an interview. "They see the problem very much on 
their own." 
  Practically half of the 35 million unemployed in Western 
Europe have been off payrolls for a year or more, due to 
technological changes, widening economic competition and normal 
movement of economic cycle. 
  Observers noted that in Western Europe, only the United 
Kingdom now appears a bit optimistic in the overall employment 
picture, while unemployment is regarded as the most difficult to 
solve in Germany and France. 
  In the U.S., 8.5 million people are registered as out of 
work. 4.5 million work part-time and say they would like to have 
full-time jobs. Another half million Americans are too 
discouraged to look for work. 
  "When it comes to jobs, we want to create two million more 
in 
1994," President Clinton said over the weekend, pledging to 
boost the country's exports, one billion U.S. dollars of which 
will create 20,000 jobs. 
  This week, the administration is scheduled to introduce the 
reemployment act of 1994, in order to bring the U.S. job 
training programs into the 21st Century and replace the entire 
existing unemployment system. 
  The proposed one-stop shopping centers, officials said, will 
link job search with training. People can get job search help, 
data on the next possible jobs as well as the trainings to get 
the job in a single place. 
  The U.S. and Europe, observers said, face two completely 
different problems in employment. Europe, with high jobless 
rate, witnesses steady rise in the income of its workers, while 
the U.S., despite its dropping jobless rate, suffers from 
declining wages. 
  In Europe, it is the unions not the corporate mangers that 
have the final say in keeping a worker or not, and there is 
almost no or very little flexibility in the labor market there, 
especially in Germany. 
  Americans are another case. Workers are increasingly worried 
since their bosses do not make layoff announcement until the 
last minute, making them ill prepared for the change or 
disappearance of jobs. 
  "The responsibility of the G-7 must be to initiate a 
profound 
change in direction of international economic policy, to get rid 
of the free market approach and become pragmatic," said John 
Evans, general secretary of OECD's Trade Union Advisory 
Committee.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 8 (XINHUA) -- India would get 
Russian help in modernizing its T-72 tanks and other 
Soviet-designed weapons, according to a report reaching here 
today. 
  This was announced by Commander-in-Chief of the Russian land 
Forces Col-Gen Vladimir Semyonov after his final round of talks 
with Indian Army Chief General B.C. Joshi who is paying one-week 
official visit to the country. 
  The Russian general also did not rule out leasing some types 
of weapons for two or three years to India, but he did not 
elaborate. However, observers noted here that India had taken a 
nuclear powered submarine from Russia on lease in the 80s. 
  Report said during his visit to Russia, the Indian army 
chief 
expressed India's willingness to continue military-technical 
cooperation with Russia and said 70 percent of arms with Indian 
Army were Soviet-designed. 
  He also showed interest in purchasing the latest T-72 C 
tanks, self-propelled artillery guns and military aircraft. 
  Joshi was the first Indian Army chief and chairman of the 
Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff to visit Russia in the last 
four years, according to local sources.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The first group of the 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) soldiers backed by tanks today 
took control of Tuzla military airport which is expected to be 
opened soon. 
  Some 100 Norwegian soldiers riding in 17 armored personnel 
carriers and six Danish tanks, entered the base to replace 
Bosnia's Muslim troops, who are to officially hand over control 
of the airport at noon Tuesday. 
  Located 15 kilometers from Tuzla city, the airport has been 
the biggest military one in former Yugoslavia with two runways, 
one of which is 2,400 meters long. The airport is capable of 
receiving all types of aircraft. 
  The airport has been closed for more than 10 months. Under 
an accord reached by Bosnian Serb and Russian leaders, the Serbs 
agreed to reopen it on condition of using it only for 
humanitarian purposes. 
  About 300 Swedish soldiers will be deployed there to protect 
the runways.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman insisted today that the Muslim-Croat Federation- 
Confederation Agreement was not a result of instigation by the 
United States and its offer of 500 million U.S. dollars in aid. 
  Tudjman said that Croatia's policy was consistent and that 
its constitution demands a referendum amongst the people to 
finally accept the confederation plan of the accord which was 
signed by Croatia, Bosnia's Croats and Muslims in Washington on 
March 1. 
  Tudjman told a news conference in Zagreb that he and Bosnian 
Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic had reached agreements, both 
open and secret, on the confederation plan. Izetbegovic had 
repeatedly voiced his support for the Croatian-Muslim alliance, 
he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (AFP) -- China slammed Tuesday 
U.S. condemnation of its ongoing crackdown of dissidents, 
accusing Washington of interference in its internal affairs. 
"No foreign country, organisation or individual has the right 
to make irresponsible remarks or interfere," a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. The spokesman did not mention the United States 
by name, but his remarks clearly referred to comments by senior 
U.S. officials on a recent sweep by Chinese police that has 
netted at least eight political activists, including the 
country's most famous dissident Wei Jingsheng. 
  "China is a sovereign state," the spokesman said. "To summon 
and interrogate according the law those who violated criminal 
law and other laws fall entirely within the scope of China's 
sovereignty." He said the police action was not related to this 
week's visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
"This issue which is purely an internal affair of China has 
nothing to do with the forthcoming visit to China by the U.S. 
secretary of state," he said. Christopher's visit is seen as 
crucial to determine whether Beijing has made the "significant 
overall progress" in improving human rights set as a 
pre-condition for June's annual renewal of China's 
most-favoured-nation status.

  [Text] China has rebuked President Clinton for urging 
Beijing to free recently detained dissidents, lashing out at 
what it called irresponsible interference in Chinese affairs. 
  The spokesmen for the Foreign Affairs Ministry said no 
foreign country, organization, or individual has the right to 
make irresponsible remarks or interfere. The spokesman said 
China's questioning of more than a dozen dissidents in Beijing 
and Shanghai was within its rights as a sovereign nation, and 
had nothing to do with the visit this week by the U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Most-Favored-Nation Treatment Must Not Be </F>
Linked With Human Rights"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
yesterday that the human rights issue was the most important 
topic of discussion in his visit to China next week. 
  The Chinese Government welcomes discussions on the human 
rights issue. In fact, China's human rights situation is 
continuously improving, and its human rights situation is better 
than that of the United States in many areas. China's human 
rights are of a broad, fair, and authentic nature. China places 
itself in the lowest position in the world in criminal rate 
terms. China goes ahead of the United States in approving and 
carrying out the human rights treaties. Beginning in 1980, the 
Chinese Government signed, approved, and participated in seven 
international human rights treaties and has strictly and 
conscientiously carried out its own obligations. The United 
States participated in just one treaty, however, and refused to 
accept the others because they were not "in conformity with" 
U.S. interests. If the U.S. Secretary of State discusses "human 
rights" so as to jointly safeguard and improve human rights and 
the development of bilateral relations, naturally, this would be 
worth welcoming. If he wants to link MFN treatment with human 
rights and achieve political objectives by using "human rights" 
as a weapon, he is bound to run into a stone wall. 
  A few days ago, Christopher said: Since September of last 
year, U.S.-Chinese relations have entered a new stage. The 
talks in Seattle between President Bill Clinton and President 
Jiang Zemin were the most important proof of the new relations. 
Following the meeting of Qian Qichen, vice premier of the 
Chinese State Council and concurrently minister of foreign 
Affairs and the U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, there were 
a series of talks between senior officials of the two countries. 
The governments of the two countries must have had broad 
discussions and actively developed bilateral relations -- 
particularly economic and trade relations -- under such as a 
good atmosphere and foundation. This is the wish of the peoples 
of the two countries and is in their interest. 
  Over the past two years, major advances have been made in 
economic and trade relations between China and the United 
States. Large numbers of big U.S. enterprises have vied with one 
another in investing in China. Hence, U.S. investment in China 
has exceeded Japanese investment. More and more American people 
have come to realize that "human rights" should not be a 
condition and man-made barriers should not be erected in the 
development of economic and trade with China, because the MFN 
treatment that China and the United States grant one another is 
a reciprocal preferential arrangement rather than a favor given 
to one side by the other. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji was being 
forthright when he said: MFN treatment is the foundation of 
normal trade between China and the United States. If the 
foundation is shaken, both sides will suffer. In fact, the 
United States will be hurt more, not China. According to an 
estimate, if China's MFN treatment is abolished, the American 
consumers will have to spend an additional $14 billion a year; 
the United States will lose 160,000 jobs; and the country's 
aircraft industry will possibly lose $10 to 15 billion in 
business over the next 10 years. Restricting economic and trade 
relations between China and the United States by using "human 
rights" criteria will make some Americans jobless and will 
infringe upon their right to subsistence, which is the human 
right of principal importance. This way of doing things, which 
is formerly aimed at harming others, will end in 
self-destruction. 
  The linkage of MFN treatment with human rights is a 
violation 
of the principle of respecting other countries' sovereignty that 
is stipulated in the "United Nations Charter." Clause 7 of 
Article 2 stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter 
shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which 
are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." 
Although the human rights issue has an international component, 
it is a matter which is essentially within the domestic 
jurisdiction of a state. The attempt of any country to impose 
sanctions against other countries, to make indiscreet remarks or 
criticism of the domestic matters which other countries handle 
independently and state-to-state affairs, or to compel other 
countries to relinquish their sovereignty to accept its values, 
ideology, political standards, and development pattern by making 
use of human rights is an act which violates human rights. 
  We strongly endorse the following view: Human rights first 
of all represent the right to subsistence, and, in order to 
secure the right to subsistence, a country must first of all 
fight for the right of independence. This rule has been proven 
time and again by the history of many countries. If a country 
is deprived of its sovereignty, its people's personal rights 
cannot possibly be safeguarded. 
  It seems difficult to understand why the United States, 
while 
posing as a "fighter for human rights," refuses to sign some 
international conventions on human rights and has joined a 
relatively small number of such conventions, claiming that in so 
doing it wants "to vigorously defend the sovereignty of the 
United States of America." On the other hand, however, the 
United States is demanding that those conventions it has signed 
be subordinate to the U.S. Constitution and laws. It also seems 
difficult to understand why this country, while reproaching 
other countries for their "poor human rights conditions," has 
done its utmost to support some cases of massive and outrageous 
infringements upon human rights. In fact, this only indicates 
that the United States, in pursuing "human rights diplomacy," 
definitely does not mean to fight for human rights for other 
countries or for some people, but to make use of the "human 
rights" issue to interfere in others' internal affairs and sell 
its own values, ideology, political standards, and development 
mode. These deeds have of course been boycotted and condemned 
by many countries. 
  What must be pointed out is that a small number of Chinese 
who have been preaching human rights are groveling at the feet 
of the westerners and begging foreign governments to impose 
sanctions on their own country and deprive their own country of 
sovereignty. Some people speaking at forums in the United States 
have called for imposing conditions related to "human rights" on 
the offer of MFN status to China. Some people speaking before 
U.S. officials have urged the United States "not to extend 
China's MFN status before substantial improvements are made in 
mainland China's human rights record." Still others who have 
been vigorously defending colonial rule and opposing China's 
resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong are 
criticizing the human rights condition in China by citing some 
cases of judiciary actions that China has carried out in 
accordance with the law. These people have abandoned even the 
minimum standard for being considered Chinese, and they are 
absolutely not qualified to talk of human rights! In preaching 
"human rights" they are putting up a false front, concealing 
their real motives. We should never lower our guard against 
these people.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that China attaches great importance to 
its ties with Azerbaijan and intends through common effort to 
further develop such friendly cooperation in every field. 
  Jiang made these remarks during talks with visiting 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev here this afternoon. 
  He said China and Azerbaijan are both in Asia, and their 
peoples' friendly contacts can be traced back to the "Silk Road" 
of more than 2,000 years ago. 
  The Chinese people have always harbored friendly sentiments 
toward the hardworking and wise people of Azerbaijan, which has 
a long history of culture, he said. 
  Jiang said Azerbaijan's independence and the establishment 
of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries have laid good 
conditions for the growth of bilateral ties. 
  Noting that the two countries have established contacts and 
cooperation in every aspect, Jiang said bilateral relations are 
now advancing in a healthy and steady way. 
  Jiang said the two countries also can strengthen and 
coordinate cooperation in international affairs and the United 
Nations. 
  He expressed the belief that the president's current visit 
to 
China will surely help raise bilateral relations and cooperation 
to a new level, as the two sides will sign a 
Sino-Azerbaijan joint statement and other documents on bilateral 
cooperation. 
  On the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Jiang said China is deeply 
concerned about the escalation of the conflict, the large number 
of people who have been wounded or killed, and the great loss of 
property during the conflict. 
  He said both sides of the conflict have paid a great price. 
It will bring no benefit to the two sides to delay the 
settlement of the conflict. 
  "We sincerely hope that Azerbaijan and Armenia will properly 
settle the conflict through peaceful negotiations as early as 
possible," Jiang said. 
  President Aliyev said that Azerbaijan places great 
importance 
on China's role and influence as a big nation in the 
international political and economic arena. 
  He said that his country is looking attentively and with 
great interest at the smooth execution of China's reform 
movement. 
  China has made tremendous achievements in its reforms, the 
visiting president said, adding that the Azerbaijani Government 
and people are willing to learn from China's experiences. 
  He expressed the belief that his current China visit will 
push Azerbaijani-Chinese ties to a new stage. 
  The two leaders shared the view during the talks that the 
five principles of peaceful co-existence should be the norms for 
handling state-to-state relations. 
  The leaders also briefed each other on their respective 
countries' domestic situations and foreign policies. 
  Among those attending the talks on the Chinese side were Qi 
Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State 
Council, Yin Dakui, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception 
Committee and vice-minister of public health, and Dai Bingguo, 
vice-minister of foreign affairs. 
  Viktor Kuliyev, first deputy prime minister of Azerbaijan 
[name and position as received], Gasan Gasanov, minister of 
foreign affairs, Ali Insanov, minister of public health, and 
Sabir Rustamkhanly, press minister [name and position as 
received], also took part in the talks. 
  Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony 
in the central hall of the Great Hall of the People for his 
Azerbaijani counterpart. Tomur Dawamad, vice-chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China 
(NPC), attended the ceremony. 
  In the evening, Jiang held a banquet for the Azerbaijani 
president and his party. 
  Aliyev arrived here on an official visit to China this 
morning by special plane, at the invitation of President Jiang. 
  He is the first Azerbaijani president to visit China since 
Azerbaijan gained its independence.

  [Text] Moscow, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin today appealed to the nation to unite to make Russia 
strong, and called for increased harmony, trust and cooperation. 
  His plea, the second in three days, was made during a 
televised speech marking international working women's day when 
he declared that he will devote himself to these issues. 
  Shortly after his disagreement with the State Duma over its 
amnesty for political rebels, Yeltsin proposed at a cabinet 
meeting held last Friday [4 March] to adopt a memorandum on 
domestic harmony. 
  He said that this was particularly necessary in the present 
situation where the danger of confrontation is looming, 
referring to the release of former Vice-President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy and former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  Observers here noted that a mood of reconciliation and 
cooperation, not seen over the past two years, has been gaining 
ground amongst powerful political forces of the vast Russian 
Federation. 
  In a report to the government, Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin echoed the president's comments made in his state 
of the nation address on February 24. 
  Sergey Glaziyev, chairman of the committee of the economic 
policy of the State Duma, said that the theme of the president's 
address on the state of the nation is consistent with the 
economic policies of the State Duma, or the lower house of 
parliament.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Huanli (1728 3562 0448)] </F>
  [Text] Fukuoka, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- At an interview with NHK 
reporter Tayatoshi Inoue here today, visiting Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji pointed out that Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation 
have enjoyed immense popular support. 
  When answering NHK reporter's question on his impressions 
and 
achievements of the trip, Zhu Rongji reiterated his gratitude 
for the Japanese Government's extremely kind invitation and 
considerate arrangements and the warm welcome extended by the 
Japanese people from various sectors. He said: "During my 
visit, I have met with His Majesty, the Emperor. I have held 
very cordial talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Deputy Prime 
Minister Hata, and people from the government and 
nongovernmental sectors. I would like to point out particularly 
that I have made extensive contacts and in-depth exchanges with 
people from the Japanese economic sector. I have held talks 
with 260 key leaders of Japan's large enterprise groups, large 
companies, and major banks. More than 1,400 entrepreneurs and 
industrialists have personally attended my talks and speeches." 
  Zhu Rongji stressed: After conducting the above activities, 
I have formed two distinct impressions: First, Sino-Japanese 
friendship and cooperation have enjoyed immense popular support 
and have become a trend sweeping across Japan. I firmly believe 
that this kind of thinking will not change, no matter how the 
Japanese political situation develops and what happens in the 
rest of the world. Second, Japanese entrepreneurs and 
industrialists are very keen to strengthen Sino-Japanese 
economic cooperation. Through my visit, the Japanese economic 
sectors have improved their understanding of China's rapid 
economic progress; have clarified some of their doubts on 
China's economic reform; and have confirmed their confidence to 
expand Sino-Japanese economic, trade, and technical cooperation. 
  Commenting on the prospects of Sino-Japanese economic 
cooperation, Zhu Rongji said: China and Japan can be very 
complementary economically. Both sides can make up each other's 
deficiencies. Various elements, including favorable 
opportunities, close geographical locations, support of the 
people, and other political, economic, and cultural factors, are 
conducive for Sino- Japanese economic cooperation to develop 
further. In 1993, China and Japan created three "firsts" in 
their bilateral economic and trade relations. First, 
Sino-Japanese trading value reached a record high of $39 
billion. Japan has become China's largest trading partner, 
whereas China has become, for the first time, Japan's second 
largest trading partner. Second, imports of Japan's technology 
has become the largest item, or 28 percent, of China's total 
technology imports. Third, Japanese entrepreneurs were on the 
top of the list of foreign investors who fulfilled their 
investment-funds commitments in China. We are satisfied that 
Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations have been developing 
rapidly. Such progress is not only beneficial to China, but 
also to Japan's economic recovery. The figure of $39 billion is 
not big. When we consider the potential of Sino-Japanese 
bilateral cooperation, it is a very small figure. Our prospects 
are encouraging. Japan's principal way of transferring 
technology to China is by forming joint ventures that produce 
goods under jointly funded and operated formats. Such 
arrangement will only increase Japanese products' 
competitiveness in foreign markets. By cooperating to develop 
world markets, China and Japan are cooperating and mutually 
benefiting partners on an equal footing. They are not competing 
adversaries. 
  When asked to comment on Japan's economic recession, Zhu 
Rongji said: Economic recession is not merely a problem in 
Japan, but also in the West as a whole. To combat its current 
economic problems, the most important steps the Japanese 
Government should take are, in addition to such traditional ways 
as taking interventionist measures and stimulating demands, to 
restructure its industry to make its product more competitive 
and to explore overseas markets. The most effective way is to 
strengthen its cooperation with Asia -- China especially -- a 
region in which economic development is the most vital and 
fastest in the world today. The past two years have proven that 
the development of such economic cooperation has been very 
favorable for Japan's economic recovery. 
  Speaking on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's forthcoming 
visit to China, Zhu Rongji said: The Chinese Government and 
people attach great importance to Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
visit. This will be an important event in the development of 
Sino-Japanese relations this year. President Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Li Peng are looking forward to having fruitful talks 
with Prime Minister Hosokawa. His visit certainly will push the 
two countries' good neighborly, reciprocal, and cooperative 
relations to a new level. 
  In response to a question about the issue of the MFN status 
between China and the United States and the prospects for 
Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, Zhu Rongji said: This 
is an issue which is heatedly debated every year. The MFN 
status is the foundation of normal Sino-U.S. trade. Both 
countries will suffer if this foundation is shaken. In fact, it 
is the United States, not China, that will suffer the most. We 
hope this issue can be resolved once and for all. There are two 
different views toward this issue in the United States. Some 
people think that the MFN status should be linked to the "human 
rights" issue, but others think that these are two totally 
different issues that should not be linked together. More and 
more Americans now support the latter view. I hope reason will 
prevail. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out: The development of Sino-U.S. 
economic and trade relations over the last two years has been 
fast and many large American enterprises have invested in China. 
In fact, U.S. investment in China has now exceeded that of 
Japan. The prospects for Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations 
are bright. 
  Commenting on inflation in China, Zhu Rongji said: Some 
inflation is unavoidable in development countries. The index of 
China's commodity price increase was always kept under 6 percent 
during the 1990-92 period. Last year's 13-percent increase was 
a bit too high. The causes of the price increase are price 
reform and the decontrolling of prices for grain and certain 
capital goods, as well as excessive investments. However, price 
reform is essential for building a market economy. But I 
believe that this year's price increase rate will be kept under 
10 percent, and it will be kept to about 6 percent next year, 
when the price reform will be basically accomplished. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out: We have taken several steps to bring 
inflation under control. First, we have taken strict measures 
to control investments and capital construction projects from 
becoming too excessive. Good things need not be accomplished in 
one day. To this end, the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council have decided to strictly control the money supply by 
adopting a stringent monetary policy. Second, we have strictly 
controlled expenditures by adopting a stringent financial 
policy. We have changed our previous practice of making up 
deficits by issuing more paper money with the practice of 
floating treasury bonds. The quantity of treasury bonds we will 
float this year will account for approximately the same 
proportion in our budget as the quantity of national debts Japan 
will issue this year. I believe we can balance our financial 
receipts and payments this year. Third, we have attached great 
importance to supporting agricultural development and the "food 
basket project." The Chinese consumer goods market has more 
supply than demand today, and agriculture is what we must attend 
to today. As long as we are able to ensure the success of grain 
output and the "food basket project," commodity prices will not 
be a big problem. 
  Answering a question about China's regional differences and 
differences in people's incomes, Zhu Rongji said: In China's 
rapidly developing economy, the economic development in coastal 
areas is faster than that in interior China, the increase of 
incomes of people in cities is faster than that of people in 
rural areas, and the increase of incomes of people of certain 
strata is faster than that of government functionaries. We are 
attending to these problems, which have also occurred in many 
developing countries. 
  Zhu Rongji stressed: While coastal area development 
certainly is faster because of its good conditions, the economic 
development in interior China has also been significant in 
recent years. To reduce the differences between coastal and 
interior areas, the most important requirement is to develop 
communications and transportation. The economic development in 
interior China, which has rich natural resources, will be 
significantly expedited as long as transportation problems have 
been resolved. This being the case, the Chinese Government has 
been giving central and western parts preferential treatment in 
terms of investments needed for the development of their 
communications, energy resources, and raw and semifinished 
materials. Of all those projects we have presented to the 
Japanese Government to consider for granting the fourth yen 
loan, projects to be carried out in central and western China 
account for 70 percent. 
  Zhu Rongji said: As for the difference in individual 
incomes, this is because of our policies which link individual 
incomes with economic returns, which give more to those who work 
more, which allow some people to become affluent first, and 
which oppose egalitarianism. The fundamental way to deal with 
unfair distribution in society is to expedite economic 
development so that the country will have a greater capacity for 
improving the living standards of its people. We will also 
regulate distribution by reforming the tax system, and will 
gradually improve the social security system to ensure social 
stability.

  [Text] Bangkok, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The ASEAN special 
senior officials meeting (SOM) continue its closed-door meeting 
today in preparation for the first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), 
the grouping's new mechanism for security dialog. 
  A Thai official said to local media Monday [7 March] that 
the 
foreign ministers' conference would be held on July 23-24, which 
would be followed by the first session of the ASEAN Regional 
Forum (ARF) on July 25. 
  The annual post-ministerial conference with seven dialog 
partners -- The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, 
South Korea, Japan and the European Union -- is set on July 
26-27. 
  The six-ASEAN member states are also inviting five other 
countries -- China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea 
-- to attend the ARF. 
  Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Gunakasame 
was 
quoted by the local media as saying that Monday's meeting 
endorsed a related idea -- the proposed establishment of a 
regional peace-keeping center. 
  But it remains to be decided whether the center should 
function as a nucleus for training regional peacekeepers or one 
for exchanging information. 
  Monday's gathering also discussed outstanding problems in 
the 
South China Sea, on the Korean peninsula, and prospects of 
setting up a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality (ZOPFAN). 
  The meeting which began on Monday will end Wednesday.

regarding future electricity supplies because of their vast 
areas and huge populations. This was stated by Mines and Energy 
Minister I.G. Sujana during his meeting in Beijing with Shi 
Dazhen, China's electric power industry minister. 
  According to Minister Sujana, the two countries have the 
identical problem of limited funds to meet the demand for 
electricity by the people and the industrial sector. As such, 
Minister Sujana stressed the need to seek cheap alternative 
sources of electricity -- such as the establishment of hydro, 
air, and solar electricity plants -- that could be carried out 
with limited funds. 
  The objective of Mines and Energy Minister Sujana's four-day 
visit to Beijing, scheduled to conclude on 10 March, is to study 
China's achievements in the field of electrical energy.

<F P=106> [By reporters Chen Ming (7115 6900) and Rong Song (2837 </F>
2646)] 
  [Text] Tehran, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said here today that both Iran and China are 
countries with a long history and a long-term task of developing 
their economies and improving the people's living standards, and 
that the two countries should strengthen cooperation to raise 
their bilateral relations to a new height. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani made the above remarks during a meeting 
with the visiting Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign 
minister, in the presidential office. The two exchanged views 
on bilateral relations and the regional situation during their 
cordial and friendly meeting. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: Iran attaches great importance to 
developing its relations with China. The bilateral relations 
between the two countries have grown smoothly in recent years 
and have maintained a momentum for development, but Iran is not 
yet content with them. 
  Qian Qichen said: The relations between China and Iran are 
growing smoothly, their economic relations and trade are 
expanding constantly, and good cooperation and coordination 
exist between them in international affairs. 
  He said: Iran is a big country in the Gulf region. China 
attaches importance to developing friendly and cooperative 
relations with it and is willing to take a further step to 
strengthen the bilateral cooperative relations. This not only 
conforms to the interests of the people of both China and Iran 
but is also conducive to peace and stability in the Middle East. 
  Qian Qichen added: Under the new international situation, 
developing countries, for the sake of their own interests, hope 
that a situation of peace, stability, and development will exist 
in all regions of the world. For this reason, they should 
strengthen unity and cooperation among themselves. 
  During the meeting, Qian Qichen conveyed greetings from 
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng to Hashemi-Rafsanjani, 
while Hashemi-Rafsanjani asked Qian Qichen to convey his regards 
and good wishes to Jiang Zemin and Li Peng.

  [Text] Tehran, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Iranian Majlis is 
awaiting Chairman Qiao Shi's visit to Iran. Iran hopes to 
strengthen cooperation with China in developing its national 
economy and with regard to international issues. 
  The above remarks were made this afternoon respectively by 
Iranian Majlis speaker Nateq-Nuri and Iranian First Vice 
President Habibi when they met with Qian Qichen, visiting 
Chinese vice premier and concurrently minister of foreign 
affairs. 
  The two sides expressed satisfaction over the smooth 
development of relations between the two countries, including 
relations between the Chinese National People's Congress and the 
Iranian Majlis. Nateq-Nuri said the friendly contacts between 
the parliaments of the two countries have shown the desire of 
the two countries to develop bilateral relations. 
  Nateq-Nuri said: The ancient Silk Road connected the two 
countries. Today, friendly contacts between the two countries 
in various fields, economic and trade cooperation in particular, 
have added new contents to the friendship between the people of 
the two countries. 
  In 1993 bilateral trade increased by 63.2 percent compared 
with that of the previous year, reaching $712 million. Economic 
and technological cooperation between the two countries now 
includes the fields of water conservancy, mechanical industry, 
and nonferrous industry. 
  Qian Qichen said: Iran serves as a bridge between Asia and 
the Middle East and is a major country in the region. China 
hopes to further develop cooperative relations with Iran on the 
basis of mutual benefit. 
  Vice President Habibi briefed Qian Qichen on the situation 
of 
reconstruction in Iran. He said: Iran needs assistance from 
friendly countries and cooperation of the international 
community in her reconstruction. 
  He is convinced there is great potential for further 
strengthening cooperation although relatively big progress has 
been made in developing relations between the two countries. He 
said the two countries should strengthen cooperation and jointly 
raise bilateral relations to a new high level.

  [Text] London, March 7 (XINHUA) -- British Prime Minister 
John Major said in an angry tone today that he neither had 
intention of quitting as prime minister, nor was expected to be 
challenged as conservative party leader. 
  In an interview with BBC Radio, Major strongly rejected 
charges that he was a weak leader and indicated that he refused 
to accept much of the criticism. 
  "I was elected to remain prime minister of this country at 
least until the next election, and beyond it if I win the next 
election. I have never run away from a challenge in my life and 
I'm surely not doing so now," he claimed. 
  He recalled that last year, when his Tory Party was in 
turmoil over the Maastricht Treaty, he heard week after week 
that he was too weak and that his leadership was about to be 
challenged. 
  But "it didn't materialise. It's an extremely good story for 
a small number of journalists and a small number of people to 
pursue week after week, but it isn't real," he said. 
  Major had this interview following a week of media 
speculation that Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine, 
who was defeated by Major in 1990 contest to replace Margaret 
Thatcher, would seek the leadership again if the "indecisive" 
John Major stumbles. 
  On March 4, a Mori poll for THE TIMES newspaper showed that 
Major's public rating remains at the lowest level since the 
image of party leaders was last examined in July last year. 
  And his personal rating was even lower than his predecessor 
Margaret Thatcher in the darkest days before she was forced to 
resign in 1990. 
  However, Michael Heseltine hurried to distance himself 
yesterday from the media speculation that he was poised to 
launch a bid for Tory leadership. 
  According to press reports here today, the trade and 
industry 
secretary pledged loyalty to Major because Major "has steered us 
through a very difficult period." 
  He was quoted as saying that he believed that Major would 
lead the conservatives to win the next election and as a loyal 
member of the current cabinet, he would help major to win the 
next election. 
  Meanwhile, British Home Secretary Michael Howard also openly 
dismissed the above-said media speculation. 
  Howard insisted that John Major would not hand over to "an 
older man," the DAILY MAIL said today. 
  The home secretary hinted strongly that the Tories were 
likely to skip a generation when the time came to pick Major's 
successor and could choose from lots of young rising stars, such 
as Treasury Chief Secretary Michael Portillo, who is 40 now.

<F P=106> [By Li Wen: "Italian Ceramics Office Opens"] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou--Italy's SITI, one of the world's two 
giants in the ceramics industry, opened an office in Guangzhou 
over the weekend--its first in China. 
  The company specializes in setting up research and 
production 
centres for ceramics manufacturing. 
  The new office is expected to position the firm for further 
expansion or a joint venture in the country, where it already 
has established a strong market presence. 
  SITI production lines already account for 30 per cent of the 
equipment used by ceramics plants in the affluent Pearl River 
Delta region of South China's Guangdong Province, where the 
building materials industry is flourishing. 
  "Setting up our Guangzhou office represents another 
significant milestone for SITI in China " said Klaus G. Fugmann, 
commercial director of SITI China Ltd. 
  Last year, about half of SITI's business turnover was 
generated from China's huge market. Its sales volume in China 
reached about $100 million in 1993. 
  "The new office will cope with the ever-growing business 
volume coming from Mainland China," said Fugmann. 
  The international company provides manufacturing and 
research 
support in all fields of the ceramics industry, including wall 
and floor tiles, sanitary wares, pottery and mosaics. 
  "Our equipment still does not meet the demand of the Chinese 
market. As the quality of housing and buildings in China is 
increasing, the industry has a promising future in the country," 
said Fugmann. 
  Although the sales of the company's production lines to 
China 
decreased since last June when the central government tightened 
its grip on credit, he said, he is confident about a good future 
in the country.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (AFP) -- Dutch Foreign Minister 
Peter Kooijmans began a round of discussions here on Monday 
looking at China's record on human rights after a wave of 
dissident arrests, Dutch sources said. Kooijmans, a professor 
of international law, is a former UN investigator on human 
rights in China. His first official contacts were with public 
prosecutor Zhang Siqing and Zhu Muzhi, chairman of the China 
Human Rights Society, the Dutch embassy said. Kooijmans is due 
to lunch with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Tuesday, and will 
meet Justice Minister Xiao Yang and External Trade Minister Wu 
Yi. 
  His visit came after several dissidents were arrested by 
police as part of a massive operation apparently aimed at 
intimidating opposition groups. According to informed Dutch 
sources, Kooijmans has expressed a wish to visit Wei Jingsheng 
-- China's most famous dissident -- during his stay. Wei was 
interrogated by police for about 30 hours last week and decided 
Sunday to leave Beijing to "rest for a few days", his press 
secretary said. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
arrives in Beijing on Friday for talks with Chinese leaders. 
  Kooijmans' visit will also discuss the planned opening of 
air 
links between Beijing and Amsterdam. Since 1983 the Dutch 
airline KLM has been the only European carrier to fly to Taipei 
daily under its own colours. As a result, China, which regards 
Taiwan as a renegade province, has refused to grant KLM landing 
rights. Other European airlines, like Air France, British 
Airways and Lufthansa, opened routes to Taipei last year, but 
use subsidiary airlines for these operations.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today expressed his 
satisfaction with the good growth momentum in the ties between 
China and the Netherlands. 
  During talks with visiting Dutch Foreign Minister P.H. 
Kooijmans here this morning, Qian said China and the Netherlands 
differ in their national conditions but they share many common 
points. 
  Over the past year or more, he said, there had appeared a 
good momentum of growth in bilateral ties, adding: "We are happy 
to see that political contacts between the two countries have 
increased and results of cooperation in economy and trade are 
remarkable." 
  On bilateral economic relations and trade, Qian noted that 
the volume of bilateral trade last year amounted to 2.32 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  However, he said: "We are not content with the results 
already achieved. There still exists a big potential in this 
regard." 
  Qian said that China's economy is developing rapidly in a 
healthy and sustained way, and more Dutch entrepreneurs are 
welcome to invest in China. "It is our hope that the Dutch 
Government will give active support to extending loans," he 
added. 
  Meanwhile, he said, it will be useful that the Netherlands 
will raise the competitiveness of its products. 
  On the ties between China and the European Union, Qian said 
China and the European Union are playing important roles in 
international affairs, adding that in the fields of economy and 
trade, they are important partners of cooperation. 
  He stressed the great importance of developing the relations 
between China and the European Union, saying that such ties are 
not only beneficial to both, but also to peace, stability and 
development in the world as a whole. 
  Qian expressed the hope that the Netherlands will make 
further efforts to this end. 
  Kooijmans said the Netherlands is also satisfied with the 
rapid development of bilateral relations, economic ties and 
trade in particular. 
  He told Qian that his current visit to China is aimed at 
strengthening contacts and cooperation between the two countries. 
  He said the Netherlands was pleased to note the improvement 
of the relationship between the European Union and China. 
  Kooijmans said the Netherlands, as a member of the European 
Union, is ready to promote the growth of such ties. 
  At the visitor's request, Qian briefed Kooijmans on his 
recent visit to South Asian countries. 
  The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on other 
issues concerning bilateral ties and international issues of 
common concern, in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. 
  After the talks, Qian gave a luncheon for Kooijmans and his 
party.

  [Text] Taipei, March 8 (CNA) -- Four Mainland Chinese 
dissidents left Taiwan for Sweden late Monday [7 March] after 
receiving political asylum from the Swedish Government, the 
Chinese Association for Human Rights said Tuesday. 
  Guo Chengdong, Zhang Guozhong, Wang Jingsan and Yin Jin left 
Taiwan more than one year after thy escaped persecution on the 
mainland and sneaked into Taiwan in 1992. "They are the first 
group of mainland dissidents who have been granted political 
asylum by a Western Government after escaping to Taiwan," the 
association said. 
  The four, all in their early 30's, have been wanted by 
mainland authorities for their roles in the student-led 
Tiananmen demonstrations which ended after a bloody crackdown on 
June 4, 1989. 
  They sneaked into Taiwan in September 1992 and were first 
detained at a special reception center in Hsinchu, Northern 
Taiwan along with other illegal mainland immigrants. After 
repeated petitions, they finally convinced the Republic of China 
[ROC] government that they were political dissidents and should 
not be repatriated to the mainland. 
  With the assistance of human rights organizations in Taiwan 
and New York, the four applied for "political refugee" status 
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The 
Swedish Government recently agreed to accept the four as 
"political refugees." 
  The ROC Government gave each of them US$1,000 pocket money 
and other gifts before their departure. The government will 
also provide them with one-year grants for Swedish language 
study and other living expenses. 
  Taiwan is reluctant to let them stay in consideration of 
relations with the mainland, some observers said.

  [Text] Washington, March 2 (CNA) -- Ding Mou-shih, 
representative of the Republic of China [ROC] in the United 
States, said Wednesday [2 March] night that there is sill ample 
room for improving U.S.-Taiwan relations. 
  Speaking at a reception commemorating the 15th anniversary 
of 
the Taiwan relations act in an office building of the U.S. House 
of Representatives, Ding told U.S. well-wishers, "as a 
democratic and prosperous people whose values match yours, our 
substantive relations with the United States can and should be 
further enhanced." 
  Ding pointed out that the people in Taiwan hope for greater 
international involvement. He also thanked Taiwan's friends in 
the U.S. congress for supporting the rights of Taiwan's 20 
million people to participate in world organizations. 
  The ROC representative noted that Taiwan and the United 
States have cooperated closely for mutual benefits during the 
past 15 years despite the lack of official ties. 
  "We want to see the Taiwan relations act remain strong and 
continue to serve as a solid foundation for enhancing the 
cooperation and friendship between out peoples," he said. 
  Also speaking at the occasion, Wang Jin-ping, vice president 
of the ROC Legislative Yuan, said the people in Taiwan have made 
significant political and economic strides in the past 15 years, 
thanks to the far-sightedness of the U.S. lawmakers in enacting 
the Taiwan Relations Act. 
  Wang said he and his two colleagues were in Washington, 
D.C., 
not only to attend a meeting of Global Legislators Organization 
for a Balanced Environment (GLOBE), but also to express 
appreciation on behalf of the ROC people to their U.S. friends 
for their persistent support.

  [Text] Taipei, March 8 (CNA) -- While Taiwan's investments 
in Mainland China have been on the rise, profit margins are 
getting smaller, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Tuesday 
[8 March]. 
  According to official Beijing statistics, Taiwan investors 
had channeled US$6 billion into the mainland up to the end of 
1993, making Taiwan the second largest investor on the mainland. 
Hong Kong led the pack with US$13 billion. 
  Unofficial figures, however, put Taiwan's investments at 
more 
than US$10 billion. 
  Despite the investment "fever" on the mainland, BOFT 
officials warned, a business crisis is looming. 
  The officials cited runaway inflation, foreign trade 
friction, and the depreciation of the renminbi (RMB) as the 
three largest difficulties facing the mainland's Taiwan 
investors. 
  Rapid economic growth has caused inflationary pressures on 
the mainland, whose gross domestic product jumped a 15-year high 
of 13 percent last year. January's inflation rate reached as 
high as 23.3 percent in 35 big cities, they elaborated. 
  Exorbitant prices will certainly push up production costs 
for 
Taiwan manufacturers, they noted. 
  In addition, they pointed out, the mainland's trade disputes 
with the United States are increasing, fueled by Beijing's 
continued human rights abuses and US$23.4 billion trade surplus. 
Taiwan investors will be inevitably affected by any trade 
friction between the two sides, they stressed. 
  Another factor adversely affecting Taiwan investors' 
interests is the long-term devaluation of the RMB, expected to 
eat away at business profits, they said. The RMB's value has 
dropped about 80 percent during the past year, and the trend is 
expected to continue, they added. 
  Taiwan manufacturers should pay attention to any changes in 
the mainland's investment climate, they warned. 
  Meanwhile, BOFT tallies show that indirect trade across the 
Taiwan Strait via Hong Kong totaled US$8.69 billion last year, 
up 17.31 percent from 1992. Of the total, Taiwan's exports to 
the mainland grew 20.63 percent to US$7.59 billion, while 
imports fell 1.38 percent to US$1.1 billion. 
  The 1993 Cross-Strait trade growth rate was much lower than 
the more than 30 percent registered in the two previous years. 
This was blamed on worldwide economic sluggishness, the 
officials said. 
  They also pointed out that the actual Cross-Strait trade 
figure might exceed US$15 billion in 1993 as a growing number of 
Taiwan's shipments to the mainland are not being registered with 
Hong Kong customs authorities.

  [Text] Taipei, March 7 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou declared a national war against drugs Sunday [6 
March], noting that the number of drug abusers in Taiwan has 
more than doubled since last year. 
  "We cannot stand to be defeated in a second opium war," Ma 
said, urging the government and people to help him fight the 
spread of drugs in Taiwan. 
  In a meeting with 600 parolees at the Ministry of Justice, 
Ma 
warned that drug-related problems have become a serious menace 
to society in terms of economy and social order. 
  Ma said in 1993 alone, 1,110 kilograms of heroin and 5,330 
kilograms of amphetamine were seized by police. The record 
number of drug seizures has pushed the amount of heroin in 
government storehouses to more than 1,500 kilograms, he said. 
  Among 150,000 criminals arrested last year, Ma said, nearly 
50,000 were convicted of drug-related crimes. 
  And there are now an estimated 100,000 drug users in Taiwan, 
up 70 percent over 1992 tallies, he noted. 
  Of that number, he explained, the number of heroin addicts 
grew 130 percent over 1992 estimates, while the number of 
amphetamine addicts increased 54 percent. 
  Ma criticized the government's lack of facilities for drug 
addicts, noting that there are only 150 beds for drug addicts in 
Taiwan hospitals. He also said the policy of imprisoning drug 
addicts is wrong, explaining that drug addicts should be treated 
as patients rather than criminals. 
  The first opium war was sparked after a Ching dynasty 
(1644-1911) official destroyed more than 600 chests of Bengal 
opium imported into China by British merchants. The Ching lost 
the resulting three year war with Britian and was ordered to 
open five ports to foreign traders, pay 21 million yuan in 
indemnities to the British Government and allow the free import 
of opium. 
  At the turn of the century, opium use was so widespread in 
China that seven of every 10 users of opium in the world were 
Chinese, Ma said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 8 (CNA) -- The Israel Economic and 
Trade Office formally opened Monday [7 March] in Taipei. 
  Israeli representative Jacob Fass, 46, told reporters he was 
honored to be here. Fass, a career diplomat, explained that his 
office would work to promote trade, investment and tourism 
relations between Israel and Taiwan. 
  The office will also handle visa applications, most of which 
can be processed in two days, Fass said. 
  Trade between Israel and Taiwan totaled US$500 million in 
1993, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$100 million. 
  Taiwan's major export items to Israel include personal 
computers, textiles and motorcycles, totaling US$300 million, 
while Israel exported US$200 million worth of goods to Taiwan 
last year, mainly hi-tech products, such as telecommunications, 
medical, aerospace and computer items. 
  In June, a large delegation representing some of the biggest 
companies and banks in Israel will visit Taiwan to explore 
possible business opportunities here, Fass said. 
  A Taipei Economic and Trade Office opened in Israel last 
May.

  [Text] Taipei, March 8 (CNA) -- The Government 
Information Office (GIO) has decided to lift restrictions on the 
import of Japanese films to help Taiwan's bid to enter the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  GIO officials made the decision during a Monday [7 March] 
meeting presided over by GIO Deputy Director-General Charles C. 
L. Wu. 
  The GIO prohibited the import of Japanese films in 1973, one 
year after diplomatic ties between the Republic of China [ROC] 
and Japan were severed. 
  But since 1984, the GIO has allowed limited imports under a 
quota system. The current quota system will expire on September 
30 at which time all import restrictions are expected to be 
lifted. 
  The elimination of restrictions on imported Japanese films 
will have a favorable impact on Taiwan's bid for full GATT 
membership, the GIO noted. 
  Participants at the Monday meeting included representatives 
from the Foreign Ministry, Education Ministry, Board of Foreign 
Trade, and movie industry.

  [Text] Taipei, March 5 (CNA) -- The ceiling on total 
foreign investment in the Taiwan Stock Market will be raised to 
US$10 billion starting next Monday [5 March], the Central Bank 
of China (CBC) announced Saturday. 
  "The move signifies our commitment to promote financial 
liberalization and internationalization," CBC Deputy Governor Yu 
Cheng told a news conference. 
  Yu explained that the ceiling on investment by foreign 
financial institutions will be raised from the current US$5 
billion to US$7.5 billion. In addition, Yu said, four local 
securities investment trust companies will be allowed to issue 
mutual funds abroad to raise a maximum of US$2.5 billion for 
investment in the local bourse. 
  China Securities Investment Trust Corp., International 
Investment Trust Co., Kwang Hua Securities Investment and Trust 
Co. and National Investment Trust Co. have been authorized to 
issue mutual funds abroad. 
  The central bank has approved US$4.7 billion in foreign 
investment in the local stock market, and some US$3.4 billion of 
the amount has actually been remitted here. 
  Asked whether the central bank will further raise the 
foreign 
investment ceiling, Yu said it will depend on the domestic 
financial situation and the speed of foreign remittances. 
  An influx of foreign capital in the local stock market 
during 
the final quarter of last year helped push Taiwan's balance of 
payments into the black. Taiwan registered a surplus of US$1.45 
billion in its 1993 balance of payments, compared with a deficit 
of US$600 million in 1992. 
  Nevertheless, the central bank has been very cautious in 
raising the capital inflow ceiling for fear of fueling inflation 
and appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar. 
  CBC Governor Samuel Shieh said last week that the Central 
Bank will ease restrictions on capital inflow in a "gradual 
manner" with a view to maintaining domestic financial stability.

  [Text] Taipei, March 5 (CNA) -- Cross-strait trade in 1993 
reached U.S.$13.831 billion, according to statistics released by 
the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Saturday. 
  Exports to Mainland China totaled U.S.$12.728 billion while 
imports from the mainland totaled U.S.$1.103 billion, the 
statistics showed. 
  Hong Kong customs tallies, however, showed cross-strait 
trade 
last year totaled only U.S.$8.689 billion, up 17.31 percent from 
a year earlier. They showed Taiwan exports to the mainland 
growing 20.63 percent to U.S.$7.585 billion, and its imports 
from the mainland growing 1.38 percent to U.S.$1.104 billion. 
  Whichever statistics are used, they indicate that the 
mainland fever of a few years ago has slowed, a BOFT official 
said, noting that the annual growth rate of exports to the 
mainland a few years ago was above 40 percent. 
  The BOFT and Hong Kong customs figures are different, the 
official said, because Hong Kong only counts Taiwan exports that 
pass through customs checks, and not the ones that are simply in 
transit to the mainland.

  [Text] Taipei, March 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan's trade deficit 
with Japan, fueled by the depreciating Japanese yen, will reach 
US$15.8 billion in 1994, according to a Chung-Hua Institute for 
Economic Research report released Monday [7 March]. 
  The recently-completed report on Taiwan's foreign trade 
outlook for 1994 said the performance of the Japanese yen will 
be the major factor affecting Taiwan's exports to Japan. 
  The report estimated that the value of Japanese yen against 
the greenback this year will drop to 119:1, benefiting Japanese 
exporters. 
  The large-scale appreciation of the Japanese yen last year 
boosted Taiwan exports by encouraging Japanese traders in Taiwan 
to re-export their Taiwan-made products to Japan. The 
appreciation also resulted in more OEM (Original Equipment 
Manufacturing) orders here. 
  The report said its predictions for a depreciation of the 
Japanese yen were based on improvements in the US economy and 
large- scale public expenditures by the Japanese Government. 
  In addition, the report noted that there is no more room for 
further appreciation of the yen after the mass relocation of 
Japanese industries last year. 
  Any depreciation in the yen will not be good for Taiwan 
exports, but expected depreciations will be countered by an 
estimated 1.6 percent real-term economic growth rate and 
recovery in the Japanese economy by the middle of the year, the 
report said. 
  The report concluded that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan 
is expected to increase 11.43 percent to US$15.846 billion in 
1994, up from US$14.22 billion in 1993.

  [Text] Taipei, March 3 (CNA) -- Approved Taiwan 
investment in Mainland China reached US$3.59 billion during the 
1991-1993 period, according to statistics released by the 
Investment Commission Wednesday [2 March]. 
  About 9,830 investment projects were approved during the 
period, with 9,329 of those investments made in 1993, the 
commission said. Investment value in 1993 alone also hit 
US$3.168 billion, the statistics showed. 
  In 1990 and 1991, the government approved a total of 237 and 
264 investment projects, worth US$174 million and US$247 million 
respectively. 
  Most of the approved investments went to Guangdong, Jiangsu, 
Hebei, Zhejiang, and Shandong Provinces in that order, the 
commission said. 
  Approved Taiwan investors focused their attention on 
manufacturing industries in the mainland, including the 
production of electronic and electric, precision machinery, 
plastic, food and beverage, basic metal, and chemical products. 
  Meanwhile, unofficial tallies put Taiwan's total investment 
in the mainland at more than US$11 billion during the three-year 
period, with large amounts invested in Fujian Province. 
  The great difference reveals the large amount of unofficial 
Cross-Taiwan Strait investment and indicates that the majority 
of Taiwan investors in the mainland fail to register their 
investments with government authorities.

<F P=106> [By Yuan Mu (5913 2606), director of State Council Research </F>
Office: "Run Commercial Banks Actively, Prudently, and Well"] 
  [Text] The "Decision" passed by the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee has systematically specified 
the targets and principles of the socialist market economic 
structure laid down by the 14th Party Congress and delineated 
the basic framework of China's new economic structure. As the 
banking structural reform occupies an important position in the 
overall economic restructuring, a plan for conducting the reform 
has also been worked out. While continuously running the 
existing commercial banks well, we should quicken the pace of 
reforming specialized banks so that our banking system can adapt 
itself more satisfactorily to the needs of socialist market 
economic development and promote the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang] development of the national 
economy. 
<H3>  I. Running Commercial Banks Well Is an Important Component 
Part of Deepening the Banking Structural Reform </H3>
  Since the reform and opening up, with the accelerated 
development of China's socialist market economy, the position of 
the financial industry centering on the banks in the national 
economy as a whole is increasingly important. At present, the 
savings deposits of urban and rural residents, well over 1,400 
billion yuan in total, and the deposits of enterprises, 
amounting to over 600 billion yuan, are concentrated in the 
banks. Thus, the banks have become the most important suppliers 
of funds for social production and construction. Between 1980 
and 1993, the banks granted about 2,000 billion yuan in new 
credits to all sectors of the national economy. Bank credit 
relations have penetrated all spheres and departments of social 
and economic life and have become an important hub of national 
economic operations. As the focus of state macroeconomic 
management is shifting from direct to indirect regulation and 
control; banking, as a principal means of regulating and 
controlling the economy, is playing an increasingly important 
role in the national economy. 
  China's specialized banks occupy a dominant position in the 
banking industry as a whole. The four major specialized banks 
have amassed 90 percent of credit funds in the entire banking 
system and undertaken over 75 percent of society's 
deposit-taking and credit-granting business. Their branches and 
offices cover almost every corner of town and country. 
Moreover, they are incomparably superior to other banks and 
financial institutions in terms of social prestige and staff 
size. 
  Over the past few years, specialized banks have worked hard 
to change their internal operation mechanisms and scored certain 
achievements. Taken as a whole, however, they still preserve 
many vestiges of the planned economic structure and, therefore, 
cannot suit the needs of socialist market economic development. 
Their principal problems are as follows: First, specialized 
banks still undertake a lot of administrative and management 
work. Not only do they manage the circulating funds of 
state-owned enterprises and the cash of account holders and 
supervise their wage funds, which come under the state 
administrative planned management, but they also undertake some 
macroeconomic regulation and control tasks which belong to the 
functions of the central bank. Second, specialized banks 
practice a horizontal system of "three-level management and 
one-level operation" among themselves. This has resulted in the 
practice of "everybody eating from the same big pot" in fund 
distribution, making it difficult to call loans in the same 
trade or arrange indirect financing in different localities. 
Third, as their institutions are set up according to 
administrative division, specialized banks have a thousand and 
one links with local authorities in terms of personnel 
management and many other issues. For this reason, it is 
difficult to eradicate local interference and their financial 
conduct is tinted with local and administrative color. 
  These problems have seriously affected the rational flow of 
funds and the optimum allocation of social resources, making it 
hard for finance to give full play to its role in exercising 
macroeconomic regulation and control over the national economy. 
Therefore, an important task in the current financial 
restructuring is to: Implement the principle of separating 
policy-related finance from commercial finance; take positive 
and prudent steps to quicken the pace of reforming specialized 
banks; establish a set of organizational structures, operational 
mechanisms, and internal management systems compatible with the 
modern market economy; gradually turn specialized banks into 
commercial banks; and to give better play to their pivotal and 
regulatory role in the national economy. 
  We should also note that restoring our status as a signatory 
to the GATT offers both opportunity and challenge to our banking 
industry. On the one hand, we shall conditionally and 
selectively allow more foreign banks and financial institutions 
into our market and accord them national treatment. This will 
inevitably cause our specialized banks to face many strong 
competitors. To go on developing amid equal competition, 
specialized banks must step up reform to increase vitality and 
raise competitiveness. On the other hand, our banking industry 
should also seize this historic opportunity to advance with big 
strides toward the international financial market, expand our 
position in the international market where there are strong 
competitors, and create conditions for our industrial and 
commercial enterprises to participate in international 
competition. To attain this, specialized banks must change 
their mechanisms and speedily bring themselves into line with 
international practice and rules. 
<H3>  II. International Practice and Experience in Running 
Commercial Banks </H3>
  Commercial banks have been in existence for over 400 years 
in 
the West since the first one in the world came into being in 
Venice in 1580. The experience of developed countries and 
regions in running modern commercial banks can be summed up as 
follows: Focus on raising the banks' competitiveness, implement 
the policy of simultaneously relaxing controls and tightening 
supervision and, by constantly changing and adjusting methods, 
strive to resolve the contradiction between the two, keep a 
balance between competition and safety in the banking industry, 
and ensure the stable operations of the banking system. Their 
specific practices are chiefly as follows: 
  First, all governments exercise tighter supervision over 
banks to ensure the stability of the banking industry. As 
deposit-taking is the principal source of their funds, the banks 
have extensive interest relationships with all sectors of the 
national economy and the public at large. Once something goes 
wrong with bank credits, this will not only directly harm public 
interests but will also seriously affect the normal national 
economic operations and even touch off economic crises and 
social unrest. Many countries have profound lessons in this 
respect. Therefore, while creating conditions for bank 
development and offering them services, all governments focus on 
safe bank operations in their supervision. 
  Second, keep on amplifying and perfecting banking laws and 
regulations, strengthen law-enforcement institutions, and manage 
commercial banks according to the laws. For example, after 
putting forward in the early 1970's the objective of turning 
Hong Kong into an international financial center, the Hong Kong 
region amended and perfected banking laws and regulations almost 
annually and overhauled them in 1986 to make them better 
organized and scientific. They are compatible not only with 
international practice and standards but also with Hong Kong's 
reality. The main contents are clearly defined quantitatively. 
A banking commissioner and a banking commissioner's office have 
also been set up in Hong Kong especially to look after the 
implementation of the banking regulations and strictly supervise 
local and overseas commercial banks. Those violating the 
regulations will be dealt with. Moreover, a self-disciplinary 
organization, the Hong Kong Association of Banks, has also been 
set up to assist in supervision. 
  Third, all central banks step up cooperation and the 
international supervisory work has gradually caught up with the 
situation. In light of the many problems coming to light in 
financial liberalization of the international banking industry 
in the 1980's, the Bank for International Settlements convened a 
meeting of the central bank governors from 12 Western countries 
in 1987, where they signed the "Basel Agreement," i.e. the 
"Proposals on Unifying Capital Measurement and Criteria for 
International Banks." According to this agreement, the ratio 
between capital and risk assets of the commercial banks in all 
member countries must not be less than 12.5:1 in 1992. In terms 
of quality and quantity, this tightens international supervision 
over the banking business, reduces the risks and crises of the 
banking industry in international competition, and jointly 
promotes the competitiveness and safety of the international 
banking system. 
  Fourth, as the international market matures, Western 
countries have gradually relaxed controls over the banking 
industry. Since the 1970's, due to their failure to fully adapt 
themselves to the demands of economic diversification and 
internationalization, commercial banks have been placed in an 
unfavorable position in competing with other rapidly developing 
nonbanking financial institutions. For this reason, some 
countries have gradually expanded the scope of bank operations 
and relaxed controls over the interest rates and exchange rates 
to increase the service functions of commercial banks and raise 
their competitiveness. 
  Bank credit crises and even bankruptcies are also frequent 
in 
some countries and regions. The lesson to be drawn here is that 
these countries and regions do not have standardized management 
over commercial banks. They often fail to separate the 
functions of the government from those of enterprises, have a 
strong monopoly character, reject competition, and have poor 
economic returns. Moreover, the lack of perfected financial 
rules and regulations and the failure to exercise supervision 
according to the law also lead to the poor quality of bank 
assets, the high risk of capital operations, and the strong 
speculative flavor. 
  Therefore, in the course of running commercial banks well we 
should, in light of the practical conditions in our country, 
take as reference the useful experience of other countries and 
draw lessons from their failure to avoid detours and reduce 
errors. 
<H3>  III. Enlightenments From the Development of the Existing 
Commercial Banks </H3>
  The existing commercial banks in China are the outcome of 
reform. Since the reestablishment of the Bank of Communications 
in the mid-1980's, there have been nine commercial banks across 
the country. From a long-term point of view, and the 
requirements of the socialist market economic development, such 
commercial banks will probably develop considerably in the 
future. By dint of their vigor and vitality, the existing 
commercial banks have been active in the economic field. To 
date, with total assets of 200 billion yuan, the nine commercial 
banks are gradually becoming an important force in our banking 
system. Through development and practice they have made a 
useful attempt to run the socialist commercial banks well and 
have provided experiences and enlightenment. 
  First, commercial banks should have well-defined property 
rights and separate the functions of the government from those 
of enterprises. Commercial banks can be turned into state 
fully-owned banks or joint-stock banks in which the state holds 
a controlling share and other economic sectors are shareholders. 
Viewed from the present conditions, the adoption of a 
standardized joint-stock system will enable commercial banks to 
pool resources through numerous channels and raise the level of 
bank socialization; enable the banks to establish an economic 
benefit relationship, sharing both risks and benefits with local 
governments and enterprises and strengthen the society's 
supervision over the banks; and enable the separation of 
ownership from right of operation. 
  Second, establish an operation principle based on 
efficiency. 
As commercial banks do not have the "big pot" from which they 
can eat state funds, they must try to raise the use efficiency 
of funds. They should take risks and efficiency into account 
when granting credits, consider costs when setting up additional 
institutions, and try by every possible means to reap steadily 
growing profits by increasing income and reducing expenses. 
Generally speaking, because the existing commercial banks have 
initially established a system for managing assets, liabilities, 
and risks, the turnover of credits and funds is faster and the 
rate of recovering due debts is higher. 
  Third, introduce a competition mechanism to improve the 
overall quality of the banking industry. In order to survive 
and develop, commercial banks should rely on "first-rate service 
quality, first-rate work efficiency, and first-rate bank 
reputation." Only in this way can they hold their ground in the 
fiercely competitive market. However, this also puts pressure on 
commercial banks, urging them to improve their operational style 
and work efficiency and provide good-quality services to 
customers. Although commercial banks still account for a very 
small proportion of the overall banking industry, they have 
played a distinct role in improving the overall quality of the 
banking industry and boosting financial reform. 
  Fourth, establish a scientific organizational structure and 
management system for enterprises. In the course of 
development, commercial banks should fully utilize their 
decisionmaking power in operations, boldly reform the personnel, 
labor, and distribution systems, and establish relatively 
complete reward and incentive mechanisms to arouse the 
enthusiasm of workers and staff members. 
  Naturally, it should be pointed out that as commercial banks 
have been developing for only a short time in China, some 
problems still exist. Chief among them is the lack of perfected 
rules and regulations to standardize the conduct of commercial 
banks. In managing commercial banks, the departments concerned 
have been too rigid in some respects but too lax in others and 
the internal management system is neither standardized nor well 
organized. Due to various factors, such as the over-expansion 
of institutions and business and the poor quality of workers and 
staff members, there are also problems with some banks. The 
awareness of commercial banks to discipline themselves is not 
high enough and neither is the supervision within the same trade 
strict enough. These problems should be seriously studied and 
gradually solved. Otherwise, they will hamper commercial banks 
from further healthy development. 
<H3>  IV. Some Problems To Be Resolved in Turning Specialized 
Banks Into State-Owned Commercial Banks </H3>
  The establishment of state-owned commercial banks is a 
gigantic systems engineering project under which a slight move 
in one part can affect the situation as a whole. Not only 
should specialized banks change their internal operation 
mechanisms but they should also straighten out their 
relationships with the central bank, governments at all levels, 
and enterprises. For this reason, the reform cannot be 
accomplished in one go. We should gradually advance it in a 
planned and systematic way in light of the actual conditions and 
eventually establish a socialist state-owned commercial bank 
system compatible with international practice and possessing 
Chinese characteristics. In the new term, positive and prudent 
methods or steps should be taken to focus the reform on the 
following aspects: 
  1. First, change the internal operation mechanisms of 
specialized banks in line with the operation principle of modern 
commercial banks. Taking the best combination of capital 
safety, fluidity, and profitability as the general principle of 
operation, modern commercial banks pursue maximum profits while 
ensuring safety and fluidity (Naturally, commercial banks in our 
country should never put profit-making first. They should also 
vigorously assume their due responsibility in stabilizing 
finance and society and in developing the economy). To this 
end, our specialized banks must first change their operation 
idea and principle, solidly foster the idea of focusing on 
efficiency, and heighten their awareness of the market, 
competition, and risk. Second, raise the ratio of capital and 
risk assets in accordance with the "Basel Agreement." Our 
specialized banks have very little funds at their disposal. At 
the end of 1991, the funds under their control amounted to 144.6 
billion yuan. After allowing for 117.5 billion yuan in financial 
advances and overdrafts, this came to only 29 billion yuan but 
the scale of credits was over 2,000 billion yuan. The low 
capital abundance rate has not only affected the banks' 
financing capability but also endangered the safety of the banks 
and hampered the healthy development of the national economy. 
For this reason, it is necessary to replenish the funds under 
the banks' disposal, adjust the credit structure according to 
risk coefficient, and improve the assets quality. Third, 
discard the traditional division of labor among the various 
specialized banks, allow for appropriate overlapping of 
business, and compete on an equal basis. Fourth, reform the 
present labor, personnel, and distribution systems, discard the 
"iron armchair" [guaranteed rank] and "iron ricebowl," and 
closely link the benefits of workers and staff members with 
enterprise performance to fully arouse the enthusiasm, 
initiative, and creativity of workers and staff members. 
  2. Change the functions of specialized banks according to 
the principle of separating the functions of government from 
those of enterprises. It is necessary to speedily establish 
policy-related banks and gradually separate specialized banks' 
policy-related business from operations. Active preparations 
are being made to establish several policy-related banks. The 
administrative functions of specialized banks should be 
transferred to relevant government departments and some can be 
entrusted by the relevant departments to the banks, which 
provide paid services. 
  3. Change the central bank's macroeconomic regulation and 
control methods. First, it is necessary to change the method of 
controlling credit scale, gradually manage state-owned 
commercial banks according to the ratio between asset risk and 
liabilities, and solve the dislocation between capital and 
credit scale. The central bank can achieve the target of 
macroeconomic regulation and control through internationally 
applicable money policies or tools, such as reserve requirements 
on deposit, central bank credit, rediscount rates, and open 
market operation. Second, it is necessary to bring into full 
play the role of interest rates as a lever, promote the 
marketization of interest rates, adjust the supply and demand of 
social funds, concentrate on straightening out the structure of 
bank interest rates and bond rates, as well as the interest 
rates and yield rates of securities, establish a flexible 
mechanism based on the central base rates, and give state-owned 
commercial banks the necessary and appropriate right to float 
interest rates within the upper and lower ceilings. Third, the 
People's Bank of China should gradually delegate the right to 
examine and approve the setting up of organizations, allow 
state-owned commercial banks to set up organizations according 
to the economic development and business volume in the different 
regions, change the previous pattern of setting up organizations 
in strict accordance with administrative divisions, and rectify 
the situation whereby funds are restricted to designated areas. 
Some branch offices can also implement, or conduct experiments, 
in the joint-stock system to promote the rational and free flow 
of funds and achieve the optimum allocation of funds at the 
macrolevel. 
  4. Straighten out the relations between local governments, 
state-owned enterprises, and state-owned commercial banks. For 
a long time past, in an effort to speedily develop the economy, 
some local government adopted various methods to obtain bank 
credits. More often than not, huge amounts of credit became bad 
debts due to unsuitable choices of projects. The problem of 
state-owned enterprises engaging in capital construction and 
renovation with circulating funds and credits has yet to be 
solved. Some inefficient enterprises are in arrears, owing 
large sums of money. This, plus the problems in bank operations, 
has resulted in an increasing amount of bad debts and back 
debts. If this situation does not change speedily, it will be 
extremely difficult to establish and develop state-owned 
commercial banks. For this reason, state-owned commercial banks 
should be given ample decisionmaking power in operation and 
local governments should not interfere with state-owned 
commercial banks at will. Enterprises and banks should 
establish a normal relationship of creditor's rights and debts 
and speedily resolve the outstanding default credits, thus 
creating good external conditions for turning specialized banks 
into state-owned commercial ones. 
  5. Improve the financial laws, statutes, and systems and 
establish a sound organ of supervision and management. At 
present, we should pay close attention to formulating the 
"Commercial Banks Law," the "Law of Negotiable Instruments," and 
other relevant rules and regulations and pass them as quickly as 
possible, defining the rights and duties of state-owned 
commercial banks. In this way, the commercial banks can have 
rules and regulations to follow in their operations. Moreover, 
we should step up the auditing and supervisory power of the 
People's Bank and correspondingly establish self-disciplinary 
supervisory organizations among banks to develop a set of 
omnidirectional supervisory and management systems, thus 
ensuring the normal, safe, and orderly operations of state-owned 
commercial banks.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Yaozhong (1776 5069 0022)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- Honorary President of 
the China Industrial Economy Society Bo Yibo, attended and spoke 
at its national congress today. He stressed that we should 
regard raising economic efficiency as our central task to 
enhance progress. He said: To accelerate progress, we must 
uphold the principle of seeking truth from facts and proceed to 
perform all our tasks in a down-to-earth manner. We definitely 
cannot blindly compete for rates of progress. After integrating 
speed, efficiency, quality, and the market in accordance with 
the actual conditions of various trades and localities, we 
should strive to raise efficiency in an effort to accomplish 
rapid progress within our reach. 
  China's Industrial Economy Society is a national mass 
organization voluntarily formed by representatives from large 
and medium state industrial enterprises and industrial 
enterprises under other ownerships; scientific research and 
designing units; industrial economic research groups; relevant 
state departments; and renowned figures from industrial and 
economic circles. In the five years since its establishment, it 
has achieved enormous accomplishments in providing two-way 
services for the government and grass-roots units. The purpose 
of the national congress and the second national executive 
meeting is to summarize past work and study concepts for future 
tasks. 
  In his speech at the meeting, Bo Yibo stressed two issues: 
1. The necessity of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control; and 2. correctly handling the relationship between 
speed and efficiency. 
  Addressing the first issue, Bo Yibo said: Under the guidance 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress in 1993, China reported rapid economic 
progress, reform was carried out in an all-around manner, and 
the overall economy progressed favorably. In an effort to 
resolve acute contradictions and problems since the beginning of 
last summer, the party Central Committee and State Council 
promptly deepened reform and have taken mainly economic measures 
to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. We have 
attained positive results. While fully affirming the results, 
we should also soberly notice: We have yet to thoroughly 
resolve many deep-seated problems in economic work, and many 
macroeconomic regulatory and control measures are merely 
temporary solutions that do not effect a permanent cure. 
Our ultimate goal is to reform the economic structure thoroughly 
and to establish a socialist market economic structure. What 
merits our attention today is the continued pressure of 
inflation and strains on the macroeconomy as a result of the 
overextended or evergrowing investment scale of fixed assets and 
high price hikes in the markets. Such a phenomenon is 
unavoidable in the process of establishing a socialist market 
economy in China. Experience shows that the pace of 
marketization must be commensurate with the ability of 
macroeconomic regulation and control. A greater ability in 
macroeconomic regulation and control can reduce problems and 
make their solution easier. At the present, macroeconomic 
regulation and control should be focused on strictly controlling 
the investment scale of fixed assets. We should leave some 
margin in our construction scale, which must be compatible with 
our national strength. We should not rely on excessive issuance 
of money to "keep up" with the evergrowing construction scale. 
We must implement to the letter and in all economic sectors and 
all fields of work the series of macroeconomic regulatory and 
control policy measures which have been meticulously drawn up by 
the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the 
core, for thoroughly reforming the economic structure. It is 
absolutely not allowed to continue the practice of "getting 
around the central authorities' policies with countermeasures," 
and to ignore the order and do things one's own way. We must 
consider the overall interests and safeguard the party central 
committee's authority. 
  Discussing the question of how to correctly handle the 
relationship between speed and efficiency, Bo Yibo pointed out: 
Growth rate and economic efficiency must be organically combined 
because development is the essential criterion. Since we have 
stressed efficiency and quality, we must strive to develop the 
export-oriented economy at a faster pace. This is Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's consistent thought. To accurately and 
comprehensively understand this thought to ensure the organic 
combination of growth rate and economic efficiency is crucial 
for maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of 
the national economy. In view of the already high national 
economic growth rate and of the rising enthusiasm in all 
sectors, it is necessary to emphasize the need to focus 
attention on raising economic efficiency. Compared with the 
developed countries, we do not see much change in our low 
industrial economic efficiency as reflected in such problems as 
seeking unduly high output value to the negligence of quality; 
blindly turning out what one can produce without considering 
market sales and demands; focusing attention only on expanding 
production scale while failing to optimizing economic structure; 
and competing with others for funds to launch construction 
projects without giving a thought to our national strength and 
financial and material resources. These problems, which 
actually reflect the maladies of the production-oriented economy 
and traditional planned economic structure over the years, have 
almost become chronic and stubborn diseases in some enterprises 
and localities, and have brought about serious consequences for 
the progress of our undertakings. With the development of a 
socialist market economy, we should say now is the time to wake 
up to reality. We must correctly and unmistakably understand 
the central committee's emphasis on seizing the opportunity and 
accelerating development, and should not one-sidedly understand 
it as a go-ahead signal to ignore the law on economic 
development and to seek an unduly high growth rate. The central 
committee's 8-9 percent targeted growth rate for the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan is both positive and prudent. We must see to it 
that the focus of economic work is truly shifted to the orbit 
centering on improved economic efficiency. If we develop the 
economy in this manner, even a 10 percent growth rate will still 
be solid and sound. An overextended scale of capital 
construction beyond the limit of our national strength will 
inevitably lead to readjustment of the growth rate, and will 
ultimately deprive us of the opportunity of development and 
delay the progress of our socialist modernization drive. 
  Bo Yibo pointed out: To ensure the organic combination of 
speed and efficiency, it is imperative to implement the state's 
industrial policy by improving industrial structure, product 
mix, and organizational setup of enterprises. As far as 
industrial development is concerned, we should energetically 
solve problems such as basic industries -- energy and 
transportation in particular -- lagging behind the processing 
industry, overdeveloped and underdeveloped sectors in the 
processing industry, and low standards of specialization and 
socialization of enterprises, so as to bring about a marked 
improvement in the economic structure and to continually raise 
efficiency through optimizing structure. 
  To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency, 
it 
is essential to promote scientific and technological progress 
and improve the quality of the work force. It is crucial that 
we rely on science and technology to educate and train a new 
generation of people who have ideals, general knowledge, and a 
sense of morality and discipline. We must be innovative in 
applying science and technology, and must gradually develop our 
own technology instead of relying mainly on imports so as to 
reduce our gap in science and technology with the developed 
countries. 
  To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency, 
it 
is necessary to strengthen the management and operation of 
enterprises and strive to lower production costs. Commodities 
have no national boundaries, and the key to opening up export 
markets lies in improved quality. To this end, it is imperative 
to set up a modern enterprise management system and practice 
strict scientific management. It is also necessary to set eyes 
on the internal management of enterprises, economize, and raise 
labor productivity. In a sense, effective management can lead to 
improved efficiency. 
  Bo Yibo emphasized: The road of development centering around 
improved economic efficiency is an arduous and complicated 
systems engineering project which requires our persistent 
efforts, continuous exploration in the course of practice, and 
summation of experiences in good time. 
  Lu Dong, chairman of the China Industrial Economy Society, 
made a speech, entitled "Work Hard To Open Up a New Situation in 
Society's Work." 
  Dong Shaohua, executive vice chairman of the society, 
delivered a work report on behalf of the society's Council. 
  Today's meeting was attended by Duan Junyi, as well as 
officials from relevant departments under the State Planning 
Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission. Ye 
Qing, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, 
chaired today's meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with economist Fan Hengshan (5400 1854 1472) by </F>
Zhou Yuanhong (0719 5913 4747); date and place not given: "Major 
Measures in Accelerating and Pushing Forward the Work of 
Building the New Structure"] 
  [Text] The year 1994 is the first year for implementing 
the "Decision" and is also a crucial year for realizing overall 
progress and key breakthroughs in economic structural reform. 
How are our reforms to develop? Will there be risks? Where 
lie the hopes? In order to more accurately understand and grasp 
the trend of development of economic reform, this reporter 
visited the economist Fan Hengshan, who has been engaged in the 
work of overall planning and policy research for economic 
structural reform for many years, and put to him some questions 
which are of wide concern to the people. 
  [Zhou] Since the beginning of 1994, there has been overall 
implementation of the total reform strategy with very powerful 
measures. Why have so many reform measures been implemented at 
once and what is the innate relationship between them? 
  [Fan] I believe that, apart from manifesting the demands of 
reform as it enters the crucial period, the pushing forward of 
these reform measures is, generally speaking, consistent with 
the strategy of "overall progress and breakthroughs in key 
points." It is also in accord with the requirement to "have the 
new structure replace the old as quickly as possible." First, 
these reform measures manifest the demand for coordinated 
reform. The setting down of the target of a market economy 
structure has meant that our reforms are not just tinkering with 
or patching up the original structure but for achieving 
essential change. Thus, the goal of our reform is an entirety, 
a system. The reform measures must also be overall and not just 
in some areas. In the reforms up till now, the relatively 
independent measures have been implemented quite well. However, 
the possibility and effectiveness of their further development 
will not be determined mainly by these measures themselves but, 
more importantly, by how other measures are coordinated with 
them. Thus, the concurrent pushing forward of many reforms is 
inevitable if there is to be coordination. Only in this way 
will the various individual reforms see development and will the 
reform measures themselves not restrict each other but will, 
instead, form a joint force. As an example, if we do not put 
property rights into order and do not establish a modern system 
which can manifest property rights restraints and interests 
restraints, enterprises will be unable to truly realize 
autonomous operations and responsibility for their own profits 
and losses. It will also be impossible to establish a system 
whereby they take responsibility for maintaining and increasing 
the value of state assets, to guard against the large-scale 
erosion of state assets. It will also be impossible to truly 
transform government functions or to form a competitive market 
system in which market signals are accurate and economic 
relationships are rational. Also, the reforms in the revenue, 
financial, planning, investment and foreign exchange spheres, 
such as implementing a revenue-sharing financial system, 
restructuring the financial system in accordance with market 
economy requirements, strengthening the macroeconomic nature, 
strategic nature, policy nature, and medium- and long-term 
nature of planning; establishing the status of enterprises as 
investment entities; and realizing the merger of the different 
types of exchange rates, are significant, not only in creating 
an indirect macroeconomic management system, but also in the 
fact that, at the same time, they are creating conditions 
whereby enterprises can shed their fetters and move toward the 
market. For example, changing the specialized banks into true 
commercial banks which have profits as their basic goal, will 
mean that the relationship between the commercial banks and the 
enterprises will be completely equalized and marketized. 
Decisions regarding to whom credit will be given and how much 
credit is to be provided, what interest rates will be charged 
and how long the repayment period will be, and whether repayment 
will be required on the set date or whether the credit can be 
extended, will be decided between the banks and the enterprises 
in accordance with their earnings and risks. The banks will no 
longer be dependent on the administrative organs and the 
enterprises will no longer be dependent on the banks. Further, 
this coordination must not only be manifested in the three major 
aspects of economic structural reform, that is, among 
macroeconomic management, enterprises, and the market, but also 
manifested in the various links in all major aspects. For 
example, the various macroeconomic reform measures now being 
promoted have all been coordinated in terms of switching central 
government functions from where the central government managed 
everything to where it only controls the overall major matters. 
At the same time, the forms by which these functions are 
implemented will be made more scientific and more subject to the 
market. No matter whether it is dividing central and local 
jurisdictions, establishing the position of the People's Bank of 
China as the central bank, bringing the mechanism of market 
competition into the investment sphere, or freeing foreign 
exchange operations and realizing exchange rate merger, the aims 
all lie in this. Further, this coordination is also manifested 
within the various links. For example, in the reform of the 
financial structure, the central bank will change from where it 
implements target management and quota control to where it 
regulates standard interest rates and regulates the activities 
of specialized banks through reserve fund and discounting 
interest rates and by engaging in open market business and other 
economic measures. In this way, the specialized banks will 
truly become commercial banks which decide on their own 
operations, take sole responsibility for their own profits and 
losses, and which operate in coordination with the policy-nature 
banks which solely engage in government-type financial business. 
Both types are essential. 
At the same time, these reforms also manifest the focal points 
and they are very important links in the new structural 
framework. For diverse reasons, they also have high 
coordination requirements, wide-ranging effects, and touch quite 
deeply the relationship between power and interests. They are 
also being carried out at links which have fallen behind in the 
reforms. For example, through over 10 years of reform of the 
macroeconomic structure, the strength of administrative 
management has been greatly reduced and the role of the market 
mechanism in deploying resources and regulating the economy has 
clearly expanded. There has been a shift from the direct 
management mode with major reliance on mandatory planning and 
the fixing of quotas, the approving of projects, the 
distribution of investment, and the allocation of goods and 
materials, to where there is greater reliance on economic and 
legal measures in regulating economic activities. The 
traditional macroeconomic management structure has thus seen 
basic transformation. However, as compared with the demands of 
economic activities, and relative to the reforms in other 
economic spheres, the progress has not been great, the results 
have not been good, and the responsibilities of the regulatory 
and control entities have not been made clear. This has 
prevented forces from being combined and has actually resulted 
in mutual impeding. The administrative nature of regulatory and 
control measures is still very strong and their transitional 
nature is not in accord with the demands of a market economy. 
This restricts the progress of reform in other aspects and has 
given rise to many deep contradictions and problems. This 
situation has now reached a stage where there cannot be reforms 
without great efforts being made. In respect to the reform of 
the enterprise system, over the last few years, we have also 
continued to place the focus of reform on enlivening 
enterprises, especially on enlivening medium and large 
state-owned enterprises, and adopted many measures in this 
regard. However, for various reasons, including 
misunderstandings on the question of how to interpret the 
public-ownership system, it has been impossible to place the 
focus of reform on putting property rights in order, so as to 
establish a modern enterprise system which is in accord with the 
requirements of a market economy. In this way, not only has it 
been impossible to form a mechanism for raising efficiency, and 
for guaranteeing and increasing the value of state-owned assets, 
but it has resulted in some people making improper use of 
opportunities. At the same time as enterprise performances have 
been poor and vigor insufficient, many of the state-owned assets 
have been transformed from public to private ownership and they 
have been appropriated by a small number of individuals. Thus, 
at the same time as upholding coordination, and grasping these 
key points to achieve breakthroughs, so that they can play a 
guiding role, we must grasp the opportunity to establish the 
framework of a new structure as quickly as possible. 
  [Zhou] Putting forward these reform measures will 
undoubtedly play an important role in the building of a new 
structure. However, reform is a revolution which affects deep 
relations and power structures and entails certain risks. What 
are your views on the opportunities and risks for reform this 
year and in future? 
  [Fan] This can be considered from the two angles of results 
and process. Speaking in terms of the results of reform, it 
will inevitably provide opportunities for people and for 
society. These opportunities must be manifested at different 
levels and in different areas. Speaking from quite a high 
level, as soon as a good structure is established, it will be 
possible to promote the sustained, healthy, and rapid 
development of the economy; to advance the productive forces to 
the greatest possible degree; and to provide people with 
convenience in many respects. This includes spiritual, 
material, production, and livelihood aspects. Speaking from a 
quite concrete level, each complete system or structural link 
can bring people advantages in one or many respects. For 
example, if we establish a competitive and open labor employment 
system, the space and opportunities for laborers to choose their 
employment will be greatly expanded and mental and physical 
abilities will be given full play in the most appropriate post 
(production conditions). However, as far as the process of 
reform is concerned, this will not only provide opportunities 
but also involve risks. This is because the process of reform 
is itself a readjustment of the powers and interests of some 
entities. Even if interests are enhanced, as the reforms are 
still in process and the focuses of the reforms are not exactly 
the same, it is impossible to give everyone interests and 
benefits at the same level and at the same time. That is to 
say, opportunities will not exist at the same time and to the 
same degree for everyone. Meanwhile, during the reform process, 
risks might arise at any time and the results of these may 
affect everyone. An example of this is price fluctuations. 
However, risks and opportunities can be transformed. If the 
relationships between all sides are properly handled, and if the 
good opportunities and modes are grasped, it will be possible to 
reduce risk to the lowest possible degree and thereby provide 
people with the greatest degree of opportunities over the 
greatest range. In speaking of the risks in the process of 
reform, I believe that the greatest risk is the one whereby the 
distortions of the reform measures, caused by various factors, 
result in a situation where there is nominal pursuit of a market 
economy but what is produced is actually a marriage of the 
powers manifested by the planned economy with the interests 
manifested by the market economy and that, in the end, will cost 
society dearly. If foul water is tossed on the head of the 
market economy and this leads to its end, it will be difficult 
to seek further opportunities for market economy operation. 
  [Zhou] I have noticed that in recent years, you have stated 
that we must be vigilant against distortions in the building of 
the market economy, and some of your views have attracted strong 
responses from society. Why have you laid special stress on 
this issue? Could you speak a little more about the causes of 
the distortions? 
  [Fan] It needs to be especially pointed out that with our 
special ideological atmosphere and structural basis, it is 
particularly easy for distortions to occur in economic 
construction. Speaking in respect of the first, our theoretical 
guidance has long been the ideological concepts of the planned 
economy and, having always lived in a planned economy 
environment, we are used to ideas and language related to 
planning. For example, we feel very strange with language like 
capital, shares, credit cards, and open market business, which 
is the language of the market economy. However, we are quite 
familiar with terms like targets, quotas, allocations and 
examination and approval. Thus, consciously or unconsciously, 
we use these ways of thinking and concepts in appraising and 
selecting new reform actions and measures. This results in the 
building of the market economy structure moving toward a fork in 
the road. Speaking in terms of the latter aspect, we have long 
implemented a system which is essentially opposite to the market 
economy. We are now switching from a planned economic system in 
which mandatory planning plays the main part, toward a market 
system. The former is a tight system formed over many years and 
its structural base and "inertia" produce a counteracting effect 
on reform measures. This can result in the reform measures not 
going into effect or being distorted. The most typical result 
however, in building the new structure, is that the reform 
measures end up being "semi-finished products" or having a 
"dual-track" nature. Thus, in the process of building the new 
structure, I believe that guarding against the distortion of 
reform measures is more important than anything else. Relatively 
speaking, a quicker pace is better than a slower pace. However, 
speed must be realized on the basis of healthy and solid 
progress. The achievements in the 10 years of reform have 
startled the world. However, we can also see that quite a 
number of the reform measures have been successively alienated, 
distorted, and warped. In this respect, we also see the problem 
of reform plans being incomplete and having to be revised in 
practice but this is not the cause in the majority of cases. If 
we are able to avoid or reduce such distortions, our 
achievements can well be greater. Actually, when thinking about 
the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the central authorities proposed 
that we would lay down the base for the new structure during the 
1980's. Clearly understanding the possibility and seriousness 
of distortion in building a market economy structure, and 
putting great efforts into preventing or overcoming such 
distortions, should be the primary task of the builders of the 
market economy. If we do well in this respect, it will be the 
same as grasping the greatest opportunity. 
  [Zhou] In your view, in order to healthily promote the 
building of the market economy structure, and guard against 
distortions, which major aspects have to be grasped? 
  [Fen] I believe that we need to grasp the following major 
aspects: 1. We have to deeply understand the complexity of 
transforming a planned economy into a market economy. We have 
to transform thought, we need to raise understanding, and we 
need to tightly grasp the study of knowledge about a modern 
market economy and accurately grasp the basic characteristics of 
a socialist market economy. We also have to practice using the 
language of market economy operations. These are the most basic 
and most important links in solidly pushing forward reform. 2. 
Scientifically grasping the dialectical relationship between 
the contents of reform, the modes of reform, and the reform 
environment, to guarantee the smooth implementation of reform. 
We need to put relationships in order and readjust the 
structure of powers and interests. Under the precondition of 
ensuring that the ultimate effects do not harm the essence of 
the reforms we can, while doing everything possible to take into 
consideration the various existing interests, adjust actions to 
the local situations and push forward some essential measures 
for readjusting powers and interests relationships. At the same 
time, we must grasp the beneficial opportunities for reform. 3. 
We need to correctly and properly handle the relationship 
between conscious fostering by the government and spontaneous 
development by the market. That is, we must swiftly and 
properly push forward the building of the new structure and use 
necessary administrative measures to overcome the blindness, 
lack of order, and slowness inherent in the spontaneous 
development by the market. 4. We must bring the construction 
of the new system onto the track of standardization through laws 
and guard against the distortion of reform measures. In a 
certain sense, the process of establishing a new structure is a 
process of moving from the authority of the administration to 
the authority of the market and of laws. The market economy is 
essentially an economy based on the legal system. We need to 
stress, from a high plane, the combining of economic reform and 
legislation and bring the building of the new structure onto the 
track of standardization through legislation.

<F P=106> ["Random Talk on Hot Points of Reform" column by Zheng Qi </F>
(6774 3823): "An Opinion on Deepening Reform in the Tax 
Collection and Management System"] 
  [Text] At present, the issue of the loss of taxes has 
attracted extensive attention from various circles in society 
and has become one of the hot spots of discussion among the 
people. "Strengthening the collection and management of taxes" 
and earnestly preventing the loss of taxes have become a 
consensus among the people. This author holds that there are 
many causes of the serious loss of taxes, but the existing 
excessively backward mode of collecting and managing taxes can 
only be said to be one of the important causes. Therefore, the 
way out is to reform, according to the demands of the socialist 
market economy, the existing outdated mode of tax collection and 
management and to modernize, socialize, and legalize tax 
collection and management. 
  For more than 40 years, China has been implementing the 
system of special tax administrators administering enterprises, 
that is, one special administrator administers a certain number 
of enterprises and the administrator completes all by himself 
the work of giving instructions on paying taxes, tax payment 
assessment, tax declaration, handing over taxes to the treasury, 
and tax payment inspection. This mode of management once played 
a positive role, but it has increasingly greater difficulty in 
meeting the needs of the development of economic life at 
present. To explore a rational mode of tax collection and 
management, various localities across the country have, since 
the middle of the 1980's, carried out one after another the 
reform of tax collection and management which mainly separates 
tax collection and management from inspection. However, this 
reform is mainly a readjustment of the internal work 
relationship of taxation organs and cannot solve problems in the 
relationship between taxpayers and tax collectors. Also, 
because taxpayers continue to pay taxes at taxation departments 
as before, the workload of taxation departments increases day by 
day and the problem of the loss of taxes remain serious. 
Therefore, making efforts to explore how to deepen the reform 
of the tax collection and management structure in the socialist 
market economy has become a very pressing task. The Haikou City 
Taxation Bureau used international common practices for 
reference and in 1992 started the reform of the existing tax 
collection and management structure: It has abolished the 
special tax administrators system and has universally asked 
taxpayers to make tax declarations on their own; it has changed 
manual management, which is characteristic of voluntariness, and 
has universally used computers, which "pay no attention to human 
feelings," for management; it has changed its management 
function of doing all the work by itself and has asked social 
intermediate organs to act as tax agencies; and it has 
strengthened tax inspection and taxation judicial work. 
Practice has proved that this reform is a useful attempt to 
deepen the entire tax collection and management structure. 
  1. Taxpayers make tax declarations on their own. 
Taxpayers submitting tax declarations to the taxation bureau on 
their own within a certain time limit is a common and feasible 
international practice. The Americans, for example, are nervous 
on 15 April each year because that is the deadline for 
individuals to report to the federal government how much income 
tax they have to pay. On that day, people mail their 
declarations before the clock strikes midnight so as not to pay 
a fine for delay. At present, before the seventh of each month 
[as published], the people in Haikou go to various taxation 
offices to make tax declarations on their own. The former 
practice of special tax administrators going from door to door 
to provide "service" has gone forever. The crux of this reform 
is not just a change in the method of collecting taxes, but a 
demand that the taxpayers must be responsible for making their 
own tax declarations. With the exception of special cases in 
which the declared amounts have to be examined and verified, 
taxation organs usually collect taxes in accordance with the 
declarations of the taxpayers. In case false declarations are 
found during inspection later, investigation will be carried out 
and legal responsibility will be affixed. 
  2. Taxation management work is divided according to 
different types of work. The Haikou City Taxation Bureau 
has used the tax collection and management practices in Hong 
Kong for reference and former special tax administrators are 
grouped under three major categories--collection of taxes at 
counters, tax assessment, and tax inspection. The tax 
collection group is responsible for establishing files on 
taxpayers, handling tax declarations, handling tax collection 
formalities, sending out letters to taxpayers whose tax 
declarations are overdue notifying them of deadlines for tax 
declarations and tax payments, checking and ratifying tax 
amounts, punishment for violations of tax regulations, and 
preparing taxation forms, statistics, and reports for the higher 
level. The assessment group is responsible for collecting and 
filing taxation data, picking out and handling taxpayers who 
have ignored letters notifying them of deadlines for tax 
declarations and tax payments, and carrying out investigation 
and assessment of taxes on enterprises whose tax declarations 
are not true and whose accounts are not sound. The inspection 
group is mainly responsible for the investigation and handling 
of various cases of violation of tax laws and rules and 
referring such cases to judicial organs for trial. 
  3. Tax collection is carried out with computers. 
Computers are characterized by high storage capacity, a high 
degree of automation, and a fast, simple, and accurate manner of 
handling data. Therefore, taxation departments of all developed 
countries and regions of the world have attached great 
importance to the development, management, and utilization of 
computers and have used computers to replace manual operations 
in a bid to lower costs, improve efficiency, and reduce 
voluntariness in taxation work. At present, the Haikou Taxation 
Bureau has preliminarily set up a computer network for 
management and its network is connected with a network of 
various tax collection points (taxation offices), subbureaus, 
and the city bureau. Information can be speedily passed along 
across the city. At present, computers are used for taxation 
registration, tax collection, taxation statistics, tax 
declarations, notification of overdue tax payments, and other 
work. The computer network is also linked with those of banks. 
Tax declarations and handing over taxes to the treasury can be 
carried out at the same time, and taxation service is integrated 
with bank service. 
  4. The taxation agency system is instituted. The 
practice of professionals such as tax consultants, registered 
accountants, and auditors handling tax payment and other 
taxation affairs for others is quite common around the world and 
taxation agencies have been praised as "economic policemen who 
are not paid by the government." Such a practice has been tried 
in Haikou. At present, several hundred enterprises have 
entrusted taxation agencies with making tax declarations on more 
than 3,000 occasions, and these agencies have corrected nearly 
1,000 mistakes in tax declarations of enterprises. The taxation 
agents have also visited enterprises to provide services and 
have succeeded in urging more than 50 enterprises whose tax 
payments are overdue or whose tax declarations are incomplete to 
pay overdue taxes amounting to over 1.8 million yuan. This 
reform has added a middleman between the tax collector and the 
taxpayer, giving rise to a system in which the three cooperate 
with and condition one another. 
  5. Taxation inspection and taxation judicial work are 
strengthened. Viewed from taxation management abroad, all 
countries and regions in which taxpayers make tax declarations 
on their own have paid great attention to taxation inspection 
and taxation judicial work. On the one hand, efforts are 
concentrated on strengthening inspection. On the other hand, 
special judicial organs are established to try cases involving 
taxation. In the course of the reform of tax collection and 
management, Haikou City has changed the past situation of paying 
attention to management while belittling inspection, reorganized 
taxation personnel to provide more people for inspection, 
strengthened the means and law- enforcement authority for tax 
inspection, and established taxation courts. Legal means are 
used to strengthen administration in taxation and to try in good 
time taxation administrative lawsuits, tax evasion cases, and 
cases of taxation organs' applications for enforcement. 
  In the reform of the tax collection and management 
structure, 
Haikou City has achieved remarkable results in the following 
three aspects: The first is that the citizens' sense of paying 
taxes has been greatly strengthened and 95 percent of them have 
made tax declarations in time of their own accord. The second 
is that tax evasion has been effectively curbed and the amount 
of taxes collected has increased by a big margin. The third is 
that honesty in taxation departments has been strengthened and 
opportunities for abusing power to seek personal gain have been 
reduced as a result of structural improvement. We can believe 
that the deepening and perfection of this reform will bring 
about thorough changes in the entire taxation work, including 
ideological concepts, tax collection and management procedures, 
the building of organizations, and changes in functions, 
gradually bring taxation work into the orbit of modernization, 
socialization, and legalization, bring taxation work in line 
with international practice, and effectively promote the 
management of taxation according to law.

<F P=106> [Article by Ren Xingzhou (0117 5281 3166): "How To View This </F>
Year's Commodity Price Trends"] 
  [Text] Prices are the barometers of supply-demand 
relationships in the market. Whether or not market prices are 
stable affects the basic livelihood and immediate interests of 
the masses and also affects the stability of the economy and 
society. 
  Having now entered 1994, our country's economic development 
is to be maintained at quite a high speed. We are also entering 
a stage when the reforms will be engaged in some major assaults 
and will be meeting some obstacles, thus their strengths must 
also be appropriately increased. Facing the new situation of 
reform and development, what changes will the price situation 
see? What effects will the newly-instituted reform measures 
have on prices? This is one of the major hot topics to which 
people in all circles of society are paying close attention. 
Thus there is a need to carry out an objective and rational 
analysis. 
<H3>  1993: A Quite Large Increase in Prices But the Growth in 
People's Income Was Greater </H3>
  In all fairness, it must be stated that over the last 15 
years of reform, deep changes have occurred in the level of 
people's material lives and there has been quite a large 
increase in people's average incomes. However, at the same 
time, they have indeed witnessed an upward movement in prices. 
If people saw the price raises from the angle of hoping for 
high income and low prices, the results would have been mentally 
unsettling. 
  If we take 1993, the year just passed, as an example, 
beginning from the first quarter the price index was maintained 
at a quite high level and subsequently there were monthly 
increases. After March, the growth was double digit. In the 
month with the highest growth (August), prices were 15.1 percent 
up on the same period in the previous year, while in September, 
there was a fall-back in the growth figure as compared with 
August. Over the period January to September, the price index 
rose 12.1 percent as compared to the same period in 1992. This 
was particularly so with market prices and the prices of 
foodstuffs, clothing, and other industrial consumer goods and 
services also saw an overall rise. Over the period January to 
September, these saw increases of 18.1, 13.6, and 39.3 percent 
respectively. As these three types of commodities are essential 
in the people's lives, consumption elasticity is quite small and 
thus the effects of the price raises on people's lives was quite 
large. The feelings of the people regarding these price rises 
were also very intense. Because of these price raises, the 
household cost of living price index for the period January to 
September was 14.5 percent up. Although this increase did not 
exceed the people's capacity to bear increases, some of the new 
income they obtained was eaten up by price increases. It is 
understandable that the people were mentally unsettled by this. 
  Why were there such large increases in the price index last 
year? According to analyses by experts and authoritative 
departments, they were, overall, the result of the following 
factors: 
  First, there was an overly high rate of growth in the scale 
of investment in fixed assets throughout the society and this 
promoted price increases. On the one hand, seen from the law of 
supply and demand, demand exceeding supply will inevitably 
result in price rises. At present, while our country's capacity 
to supply the means of production has been increased through 
many years of reform, overall, it is still limited. Thus, the 
dramatic increase in the scale of fixed asset investment last 
year spurred increases in the prices of the means of production. 
The increases in the prices of the means of production meant 
that the costs of the enterprises providing the means of 
consumption rose and this inevitably produced increases in the 
prices of the means of consumption. In another respect, of the 
investment in fixed assets, a proportion (about 30 to 40 
percent) is, as wages, changed into people's income. The 
greater the scale of investment in fixed assets, the greater 
this amount of income and this will give rise to price raises 
from the consumer demand angle. 
  Second, last year, many price reform measures were put into 
effect and these also spurred a rise in the overall level of 
prices. For example, in the first half of last year, the 
government controlled sales prices for grain and oil were freed 
and the prices of basic raw materials such as steel, coal, and 
crude oil were either freed or greatly readjusted. The prices 
of housing, gas, water, electricity, and other services were 
raised, service charges were readjusted, and so on. These price 
reform measures also pushed the overall level of prices upwards. 
However, basically, the reform of prices is intended to more 
effectively reform the price system and price formation 
mechanisms and, seen from the long term viewpoint, it is 
extremely necessary. 
  Third, the delayed effects of the price reforms in 1992 also 
had an effect on prices in 1993 and, by habit, these are 
referred to as "protruding tail" [qiao wei 5062 1442] effects. 
For example, if the price adjustments started in April last 
year, the effects on the price index would continue until April 
this year. According to estimates, the influence of the 
"protruding tail" effect on the price index was about 4 
percentage points. In addition, the fall in exchange rates and 
other factors also affected prices. 
  In the many factors which pushed prices upward, there were 
also psychological factors on both the producer and consumer 
sides. For example, beginning in the last part of October last 
year, an increase in grain prices swept from the south to the 
north. To a great degree, this was the result of psychological 
factors. It was mainly due to the fact that some producers 
anticipated that the grain price would increase this year and 
were unwilling to sell grain. Some grain operational 
departments and some consumers were also afraid that the grain 
prices would increase this year and, as a result, they made 
panic purchases of grain. These factors obviously induced a 
rise in the price of grain. Some people also thought that 
home-use electrical appliances and other commodities would also 
rise in price and in some areas the phenomenon of panic 
purchasing of electrical home appliances appeared. According to 
general expectations, in years with bumper grain harvests, the 
market supply-demand contradiction will be alleviated and grain 
prices should not increase. However, last year, the situation 
was the reverse. This shows that the psychological immaturity 
of the consumers can give rise to an increase in prices. 
  Summing up the above, there was indeed a great increase in 
prices last year. This is a fact. However, in examining the 
issue of prices, we must look from an overall viewpoint. That 
is to say, we should not only look at the degree to which the 
price index has risen but also look at how much people's incomes 
have risen. In economics, there is the term "demand-driven" 
inflation. That is to say, when people's income grows too 
swiftly, it can form real demand for the means of consumption 
(or, purchasing power). When this demand is greater than 
supply, it will push up prices. Seen from the situation last 
year, the growth in people's income was quite swift. From 
January to September, the average monthly income was 29.4 
percent up. Excluding price rise factors, the actual increase 
was 12.7 percent. This quite rapid increase in income induced a 
rise in the prices of consumer products, especially foodstuffs 
and industrial consumer products and services. Of course, this 
is not to say that some people's actual standard of living did 
not decline as a result of the rise in their income being less 
than the increase in the level of prices. This problem should 
be dealt with through social security and other avenues. 
<H3>  1994: The Pressure of Inflation Will Still Exist But the 
Price Situation Does Not Look Too Pessimistic </H3>
  According to the analyses by relevant departments, we should 
not show unguarded optimism in respect of the price situation in 
1994 but neither need we be too pessimistic. Seen from the 
angle of consumers, it would be best to view price raises with a 
normal attitude. 
  Seen in terms of the inflationary pressure: 1. The 
investment expansion impulse will continue to exist. Beginning 
from the second half of last year, although the macroeconomic 
regulatory and control measures had begun to see some effect, 
the scale of budgeted social fixed-asset investment for the year 
still grew over 46 percent. In accordance with this year's 
policy of accelerated development and the spirit of the central 
economic work conference, the scale of fixed asset investment 
will be maintained at a quite high level. In addition, the 
scale of local extra-budgetary investment will be quite large 
and it will be difficult to control this. Such factors will put 
great pressure on market prices this year. 2. It is necessary 
to consider that the wage reforms in state organs and 
institutional units and the rise in enterprise wages which this 
will induce, will provide a great increase in the level of 
people's income. If this newly-increased income is put into the 
market, it will result in a rise in the prices of consumer 
goods. 3. The price reform measures which were put into effect 
last year will continue to have a "protruding tail" effect on 
prices this year. In addition, some new price readjustment 
measures will be introduced this year. These will also have an 
effect on market prices. 4. The prices of over 85 percent of 
the means of production and over 95 percent of the means of 
consumption have already been freed. The difficulty of 
supervising these prices has grown and, when supply and demand 
contradictions suddenly appear, it is easy for price raises to 
result. 5. Seen from the consumer mentality angle, the 
expectation of price raises is quite strong. When supply-demand 
contradictions appear, the powerful fluctuations in consumer 
psychology will exacerbate the price raises. These various 
factors show that in respect of the price situation, we cannot 
be too optimistic. It was also this which led the central 
economic work conference to put forward the requirement that 
this year, the rise in the price index should be kept to 10 
percent. 
  However, on this basis we cannot have a pessimistic view of 
the price situation this year because, on the basis of the 
initial results achieved last year in macroeconomic regulation 
and control, this year the state will implement appropriate 
regulatory and control measures in respect of fixed assets 
investment. Under the precondition of maintaining a certain 
scale, it is necessary to avoid the occurrence of super-normal 
growth and to engage in appropriate regulation and control of 
the investment structure. This is one aspect which will be 
beneficial in dealing with inflation. In another respect, 
through the more than 10 years of reform, there has been a great 
increase in the supply of commodities, goods, and materials in 
the market. For example, in respect of grain and nonstaple 
foodstuffs which are very important for people's livelihood, 
supply can basically be guaranteed and the people's needs can be 
satisfied. Seen in terms of home-use electrical appliances and 
daily-use consumer goods, generally speaking, the supply of 
goods is sufficient. For some commodities, supply exceeds 
demand and it is a buyers market. In addition, production is 
still developing and, in such a situation, the prices of these 
commodities will not see great increases. Further, seen in 
terms of income, this year the wages of public servants are 
being reformed and enterprise wages are being increased on the 
basis of improved performance. These aspects will all increase 
people's real capacity to deal with the price raises. In 
respect of prices subsequent to freeing, the state will 
implement corresponding supervisory and management measures to 
avoid loss of control. Following the setting up of price 
regulation funds for grain and other major commodities, and the 
establishment of specialized reserve systems, the state's 
capacity to regulate supply and demand, keep prices down, and 
stabilize the market will be further strengthened. 
<H3>  Implementation of the Many Reform Measures Will Result in 
Some Changes in Prices But Will Not Affect People's Daily Lives </H3>
  Another hot topic of concern to people at present is the 
worry that the various reform measures which have already been 
initiated this year will promote a rise in prices. For example, 
the implementation of the consumption tax and value added tax 
[VAT] has led to some misunderstandings and some people believe 
that as soon as these two taxes are levied, prices will 
certainly rise. Actually, the Ministry of Finance and the State 
Bureau of Taxation have already explained these issues through 
various media. Generally speaking, the implementation of these 
measures will not induce overall price raises. This is 
particularly so of VAT because, following the reform of the tax 
system, tax types and tax rates will also see changes and for 
the majority of enterprises the overall tax burden will decline. 
Seen from the angle of consumption products, while the present 
levying is a supra-price tax, it is not just a tax levied on top 
of the original price. Rather, it involves a change in the 
formation of the original price. Seen in terms of the final 
price of consumer products, there should be no change as a 
result of the reform of the tax system. The levying of a 
consumption tax on a small number of commodities is very 
necessary. This manifests the state's guidance of production and 
is also positive guidance for consumers. Further, these 
products are not things which people need for their livelihood. 
Thus, even if prices change, this will not affect people's 
daily lives. In other countries, it is very common for special 
consumption taxes to be levied on some commodities. Such taxes 
give effect to the role of the state's regulatory and control 
measures. 
  The merger of exchange rates carried out at the beginning of 
the year also gave rise to various concerns and there were fears 
that the resulting devaluation of the renminbi would lead to 
price increases. Of course, the merger of exchange rates will 
have some effects on prices. For example, the cost of imported 
products will rise and the price of imported color televisions, 
refrigerators, and so on will, after conversion to renminbi, 
also see an increase. However, at the same time, tax rates will 
come down and tariffs and imported commodity and raw materials 
taxes will fall. Thus, prices will not increase by too much or 
too wildly. Therefore, people can adopt a cool and normal 
attitude to the reform measures which have been implemented. In 
fact, prior to the implementation of various reform measures, 
the state has already considered the effects of the reforms on 
prices raises and adopted corresponding measures. It is 
believed that during the reforms and opening up, the consumer 
psychology of the broad masses of people will gradually move 
towards maturity.

<F P=106> [Roundup by reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900): "Trade </F>
of Property Rights Is Growing in China"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (XINHUA) -- A new market for 
trading property rights is on the increase in China. According 
to data provided by relevant departments, the number of markets 
for trading property rights has increased to 25 across the 
country so far, and regional trading centers for property rights 
have taken shape in Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, Chengdu, 
Shenzhen, and Zhejiang. Thirty banking institutions and large 
enterprise conglomerates-- including the China Economic 
Development Trust and Investment Corporation; Hangzhou Waitan 
Construction Co., Ltd.; China Everbright International Trust and 
Investment Corporation; and Shenzhen Baoan (Group) 
Corporation--recently decided to jointly establish the China 
International Property Rights Trade Center in Beijing, a market 
for the trade of property rights nationwide. 
  The trade of property rights refers to the transfer of 
property rights between owners, whether it be in kind, in whole 
or in part. The best advantages to be gained from trading 
property rights are: Assets in stock can be turned to good 
account and guide the redisposition of resources, allowing 
assets whose supply exceeds demand or which are lying idle and 
produce no economic returns to now flow to departments which 
badly need them; highly competitive enterprises which produce 
good economic returns can merge with uncompetitive enterprises 
which produce poor economic returns; and all enterprises which 
produce good economic returns can make the best use of their 
assets and convert them into cash at all times, thereby 
improving the economic returns of assets in society and ensuring 
and increasing their value. However, under the restrictions of 
a planned economy over a long period of time, relationships of 
property rights are vaguely defined among enterprises in China; 
large amounts of funds are lying idle because, unlike production 
and management factors, property rights cannot circulate and 
cannot be redisposed. As a result, the production structure of 
the country and the scale and structure of enterprises are 
extremely irrational; large amounts of state-owned assets are 
lost; and enterprises produce low economic returns. According 
to statistics by relevant departments, presently about one third 
of state-owned assets throughout the country are lying idle, 
produce low economic returns, or are being wasted at a high rate. 
  To promote the rational flow and restructuring of 
enterprises' property rights in order to bring about the best 
combination of resources and operating scale, we should put 
assets in stock back into the productive cycle, improve the 
operating structure of assets, eradicate the gap in securing 
construction funds, and ensure appreciation while guarding 
against depreciation of state-owned assets. Markets handling 
property rights transactions began emerging in China in the 
early 1980's. After a few years of development, the trading of 
property rights has brought remarkable benefits to our national 
economy, and is gradually becoming an important formula for 
optimizing the disposal of state- owned assets under the 
socialist market economic conditions. Statistics show that a 
total of 6,900 or so Chinese enterprises were merged with other 
enterprises throughout the 1980's, resulting in the transfer of 
stock property worth over 8 billion yuan, a reduction of 4,095 
loss-making enterprises, and a 522 million yuan reduction in the 
amount of losses. The trading of property rights developed 
further in the 1990's, bringing the accumulative total number of 
annexed enterprises in the country to over 10,000. During the 
past year, property rights trading markets in 16 cities -- 
including Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen -- 
witnessed the annexation or sale of a total of over 2,900 
enterprises, the transfer of assets in stock worth over 6 
billion yuan, and the relocation of more than 400,000 workers 
and staff members. Since 1987, more than 1,000 loss-making 
enterprises in Sichuan have been put back into business through 
the trading of property rights after relocating more than 90,000 
workers and staff members, transferring over 3 billion yuan 
worth of assets in stock, and putting 2.3 billion yuan worth of 
stagnant assets back into productive use. Shanghai carried out 
property rights transfers on 151 industrial enterprises in 1990, 
injecting 113,200 workers and staff members into key industries 
for priority development, and gradually improving the operating 
efficiency of fixed assets worth 2.8 billion yuan. In the first 
half of 1993, 30 or so Beijing industrial enterprises without 
any hope of getting out of the red were given new life after 
being merged with other enterprises. 
  Following the emergence and gradual expansion of the trade 
in 
property rights, the establishment and perfection of a series of 
relevant laws and regulations also began. So far, laws and 
regulations--such as the "Bankruptcy Law," the "Company Law," 
the "Provisional Procedures for Enterprise Mergers," the 
"Provisional Procedures for Selling Off Small State-Owned 
Enterprises' Property Rights," the "Procedures for Administering 
the Evaluation of State- Owned Property," and the "Regulations 
for Transforming the Operating Mechanism of Industrial 
Enterprises Owned by the Entire People"--have been promulgated 
and implemented in the country, while other relevant laws and 
regulations--such as the "Securities Law," the "Banking Law," 
and the "Provisions for Unemployment Insurance for Workers and 
Staff Members in State-Owned Enterprises"--are currently being 
drafted. 
  Economic circles believe that although the present trade in 
property rights is still shaded with administrative intervention 
and lacking standardization and fairness, it has played a 
positive role in remolding and optimizing the combination of the 
elements of production and in developing the productive forces.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 8 (AFP) -- Hong Kong is to send a 
top official to the United States next month to lobby for 
Washington's renewal of China's most favoured nation (MFN) 
trading status, a government spokesman said Tuesday. Chief 
Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's deputy, 
will meet senior members of the U.S. administration, 
congressional leaders in Washington and business and trade 
groups in New York in late April to lobby for the unconditional 
renewal of MFN for China in June. Chan, who is expected to be 
in the United States for five days, said "the United States and 
China are Hong Kong's two largest trading partners and a good 
relationship between them will be a vital factor in Hong Kong's 
long-term success." 
  It is estimated that failure to renew MFN would cut Hong 
Kong's growth in gross domestic product (GDP) by up to three 
percentage points -- a loss of between 19 billion-to-26 billion 
Hong Kong dollars (2.4 billion-to-3.3 billion U.S.) in income, 
and cost up to 75,000 jobs. "I shall be setting out in no 
uncertain terms Hong Kong's commitment to free trade as a 
general principle and the importance of the unconditional 
renewal of China's MFN status to Hong Kong," she said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has demanded improvements in 
China's record on human rights, trade and arms sales, before 
renewing its MFN status for another year. Renewal falls due in 
June. Since Friday, China has detained some dissidents in 
defiance of U.S. warnings that improvements in its human rights 
record are a precondition to MFN renewal. The issue is likely 
to top the agenda when U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher visits Beijing on Friday. 
  However, Chan said: "Hong Kong, more than any country, is 
concerned about human rights, but we don't think, in principle, 
it is right to use trade as a tool to achieve other objective." 
"I also believe China's continued growth in economy will also 
become more liberalize over the passage of time in its political 
outlook," she said. [sentence as received]

  [Text] The Jardine group of companies, one of the oldest 
and most powerful in the territory, has been firmly told that it 
will not receive special treatment from Hong Kong's regulatory 
authorities. As a result the company's main board will this 
week discuss plans to delist its six companies from the Hong 
Kong stock exchange, a move that would deprive the market of 
nearly 7 per cent of its capitalisation. 
  Despite intensive lobbying at Government House, Jardine has 
failed in its attempt to persuade the watchdog Securities and 
Futures Commission to allow it to be exempt from Hong Kong's 
takeovers code. The company has waged a five-year battle to 
free itself from the conditions that regulate the behaviour of 
other public companies. 
  Having led the exodus of public companies to a Bermudian 
domicile in 1984, Jardine dropped another bombshell in 1992 by 
shifting the group's primary listings to the London Stock 
Exchange. Since then it has been arguing for the right to be 
governed by Bermuda's takeover code. Sources close to the 
company say that the directors are fearful of China's intentions 
for Jardine, and worry that the Keswick family's less than 10 
per cent shareholding, which has hitherto secured control over 
the group, will prove inadequate for the historic owners to 
retain their hold. 
  Last night Neil MacNamara, a Jardine Matheson spokesman, 
declined to comment. Robert Nottle, chairman of the Securities 
and Futures Exchange, said he could not disclose discussions 
with listed firms. 
  Jardine has mobilised its biggest guns in the fight to 
maintain overseas control over its affairs. The Governor, Chris 
Patten, has been drawn into the controversy following intensive 
lobbying by Sir Charles Powell, a special adviser to the former 
British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Powell now serves as 
a trouble-shooter for Jardine. 
  From the start of the controversy Jardine has threatened to 
walk away from the Hong Kong stock exchange it helped to create. 
  It is still possible that the company might be bluffing, as 
regulators believe it has more to lose than gain. As a result 
Jardine has been firmly told that it has reached the end of the 
road as far as concessions from the Securities and Futures 
Commission are concerned. It is also reliably understood that 
the stock exchange has taken a similarly robust attitude towards 
the group. 
  The authorities have already made a number of concessions to 
the powerful hong in the past few years. Jardine escaped 
penalty despite being found guilty of breaching listing rules in 
1991, when it bought back 3.4 per cent of its own shares through 
an affiliate. 
  The exchange excused the group on the grounds that the ban 
on 
share repurchasing was about to be removed. 
  The exchange also set a precedent when it granted Jardine 
companies secondary listings despite the fact that 80 per cent 
of the group's shares traded in Hong Kong rather than London. 
  The Jardine stable of public firms consists of Jardine 
Matheson, Jardine Strategic, Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm, Mandarin 
Oriental and Jardine International Motors, all of which are 
chaired by either Simon or Henry Keswick. When the group moved 
its primary listings to London after local authorities refused 
to grant it a special trade-only listing status in Hong Kong, 
the group accounted for around 10 per cent of the market's total 
capitalisation. This has shrunk to about 6.7 per cent. 
  With a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the group is 
regulated 
by the territory's listing and takeover rules although when 
there is a conflict between local and London rules, the latter 
prevail. If it wants to delist from Hong Kong, it has to give a 
90-day notice to the exchange. 
  One of the group's key concerns has been maintaining control 
and fortifying itself against hostile takeover bids. In 1985, 
the group sold its controlling stake in Hong Kong Electric to Li 
Ka-shing after Hongkong Land ran up a mountain of debts. 
  In May 1988, Li and three other tycoons made a hostile bid 
for Hongkong Land, forcing the company to later buy back the 8 
per cent stake the tycoons acquired, on condition that Li's 
group agreed not to take major stakes in any Jardine firm for 
seven years. This agreement expires in 13 months, fuelling 
speculation that Jardine has plans to raise its 33 per cent 
stake in Hong Kong Land. But under local takeover rules, 
Jardine will have to make a general offer once its holding 
reaches 35 per cent.
