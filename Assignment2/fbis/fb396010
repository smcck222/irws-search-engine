<F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, March 8 (AFP) -- Jardine Matheson Ltd., 
Hong Kong's oldest and greatest trading house, refused Tuesday 
to rule out a retreat from Hong Kong's stock exchange if it is 
denied its request to exclusively be subject to Bermuda's 
takeover code. Jardines company secretary Neil McNamara told AFP 
that talks with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission 
(SFC) for an exemption from the British colony's takeover code 
were still underway. But he would neither confirm nor deny 
whether a delisting of any or all of the six Jardines-controlled 
companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange might result if the 
exemption fails to come through. "I think it it's premature to 
speculate on any outcome of discussions," McNamara said. "When 
one discusses something with the SFC, it's preferable that it be 
kept confidential while the discussions are ongoing. 
  The takeover-code issue stems from Jardines' bombshell 
announcement in 1984 that it would register in another British 
colony, Bermuda, before Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997. 
It now wants to be subject exclusively to Bermuda's takeover 
code when it takes effect in July this year -- thus avoiding the 
legal uncertainties of a post-1997 Hong Kong. In particular, 
the Bermuda code would allow Jardines to resist a hostile 
takeover attempt in the Bermuda courts and, in the case of a 
final appeal, to the Privy Council in London. "It's a 
preference to be regulated under the British corporate system," 
McNamara said. "That's been said before." 
  Hong Kong's EASTERN EXPRESS newspaper, without quoting 
sources, said Tuesday that Jardines' board would discuss this 
week whether to delist in Hong Kong -- a move that could wipe 
off 6.7 percent of the market's capitalization. The report had 
little effect on the price of Jardines' flagship stock, Jardine 
Matheson (Holdings) Ltd., which in afternoon trading was up 50 
cents at 66 Hong Kong dollars (8.51 US). The Jardines stable is 
to announce 1993 results over a one- week period that begins 
March 17 with Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd. 
  The SFC declined to comment in detail on its talks with 
Jardines, besides stating that the Hong Kong takeover code still 
applies to the group. "Our over-riding principle is to seek to 
protect the interest of investors and to maintain the 
credibility of Hong Kong as an international financial center," 
an SFC spokesman added. There was also no comment from stock 
exchange's listings division, which requires 90 days' notice of 
any delisting. 
  Founded by two Scots in 1832 to sell Indian opium to China, 
Jardines remains Hong Kong's most pervasive conglomerate, 
involved in almost every sector from real estate and 
stockbroking to supermarkets and parking lots. 
  China has made no secret of its distaste for Jardines. 
Besides occasionally harping on its opium-trading origins, it 
has lashed out at its biggest shareholder, the Keswick family, 
for supporting Governor Chris Patten's efforts to introduce more 
democracy in Hong Kong before 1997. 
  The last time Jardines faced a hostile takeover was in May 
1988, when four tycoons led by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. 
chairman Li Ka- shing -- who enjoys privileged access to 
Beijing's communist leaders -- moved in on Hongkong Land. They 
succeeded in acquring eight percent before Li agreed not to 
pounce on any Jardines company for seven years -- a period that 
expires in April 1995. 
  Besides Jardine Matheson (Holdings) and Dairy Farm, other 
listed Jardine companies are Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., 
Jardine International Motor Holdings Ltd., Mandarin Oriental 
International Ltd. and Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.

  [Text] Hong Kong stands to lose up to $187 billion, or 
nine percent of its yearly trade, if China's Most Favoured 
Nation (MFN) status is withdrawn this year. The territory's 
re-exports from China to the United States, which account for 60 
percent of total exports to the country, would suffer a loss of 
up to $77 billion, or 46 percent, according to the latest 
assessment from the Trade Department. 
  "A reduction of up to $77 billion worth of re-exports is 
double the impact we estimated in 1990," the department's deputy 
director-general, Christopher Jackson, said. "This is largely 
the result of the very rapid growth in Hong Kong's re-export of 
China-made goods to the United States over the past few years," 
he said. The loss of MFN would see tariff rates in China 
increase by two to 10 times, according to the department's 
principal economist Cheung Hok-ying. 
  Mr Jackson said the figures did not take into account China 
retaliating against the U.S. by restricting the number of 
American products coming into China. "However, in this area, 
Hong Kong is less vulnerable. Only 30 percent of U.S. exports 
to China travel through Hong Kong," he said. 
  While outlining the potential loss to Hong Kong's economy, 
Mr 
Jackson said: "No community is more concerned about human 
rights then Hong Kong but the issue, in this context, is a 
matter between the U.S. and China. 
  "For Hong Kong, our message remains focused on the impact, 
or 
economic damage, that the MFN withdrawal will have on Hong 
Kong." This is the same message the Government will present in 
Washington as part of its lobbying efforts to have China retain 
MFN status. 
  Hong Kong's role as a gateway to China was also likely to be 
undermined, thus affecting longer-term growth potential and 
business confidence. Manufacturing investment ventures and 
other production arrangements by Hong Kong and foreign companies 
in China, including American firms, were likely to suffer 
significantly. 
  Mr Jackson said related trade flows, such as the import of 
raw material to Hong Kong and into China and other countries, 
could hurt Hong Kong's trade by as much as nine percent. Other 
areas which would take a blow were transport storage, banking, 
finance, insurance and many other areas of the service sector 
which supported Hong Kong's role as an entrepot. 
  The chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, Gerry 
Murdock, said MFN status had become the most important issue in 
Sino-U.S. relations. "And this should not be the case," he 
said. U.S.-China relations should move beyond this point.

<F P=106> [By reporters Gan Zhebin (3927 0772 2430) and Zhang Lei </F>
(1728 7191)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Upon his 
arrival in Beijing from Hong Kong today to attend the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], Zhou 
Nan, NPC deputy and director of the Hong Kong Branch of the 
XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, told reporters during a special interview 
that, although the British side is not cooperating on the Hong 
Kong issue, the Chinese side, along with the Hong Kong 
compatriots, can absolutely ensure Hong Kong's steady transition 
and prolonged prosperity and stability. This is beyond 
question, and no force can stop us from achieving this objective. 
  Zhou Nan said: We are now in an important period for the 
country to carry out reform and opening up and establish the 
socialist market economy. Some major reform measures will be 
introduced. We hope to solicit opinions through these "two 
sessions" and correctly handle the relations between 
development, stability, and reform. In addition, we will 
further carry out the policy of "doing two types of work 
simultaneously," namely, we will pay attention to material and 
spiritual civilizations and to the formation of the democratic 
and legal systems to enable the country's economic modernization 
to embark on a healthy track. 
  One of the two reporters asked if the Hong Kong issue would 
become a hot topic at the "two sessions." Zhou Nan said he 
believed that Premier Li Peng's government work report would 
refer to the Hong Kong issue, that the Hong Kong NPC deputies 
and members as well as the mainland NPC deputies and members 
will make some comments on the Hong Kong situation, and that, to 
express state and popular intentions, the NPC and the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference will, of course, respond to this issue.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 4 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The 
director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, Zhou Nan, said here today: 
"Without the British side's cooperation, we can certainly 
achieve a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong and administer 
it better. We will stand firm together with the large number of 
Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong in the recovery of 
Hong Kong's sovereignty, following the principles of `one 
country, two systems,' and `Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' 
set out in the Basic Law." 
  At a ceremony to issue letters of appointment to advisers to 
Hong Kong regional affairs held today, Zhou Nan said: "Since 
Hong Kong entered the transitional period, Deng Xiaoping has 
repeatedly stressed it is important for those Hong Kong people 
who love China and Hong Kong to actively participate in all 
sorts of social and political affairs. In the previous period, 
according to suggestions made by Hong Kong people, the Chinese 
Government has set up the Preliminary Work Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region and has appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong 
affairs. Facts have proved that these moves are conducive to 
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and are also an effective 
way to encourage Hong Kong people to get involved in social and 
political affairs in the transition period and to prepare them 
for `administering Hong Kong'." 
  Zhou Nan pointed out: "The historic moment when Hong Kong 
will return to the embrace of the motherland is drawing near. 
Although there are people who have tried in every possible way 
to create obstacles to the return of Hong Kong to its 
motherland, their wishful attempts are doomed to failure. The 
Chinese people, who have risen to their feet, will never allow 
themselves to be ordered about and trampled upon any more." 
  Zhou Nan quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying: "Every son and 
daughter of the Chinese people takes pride in their nation, no 
matter what clothes they are dressed in and what position they 
hold. Hong Kong people also have a sense of pride in their 
nation. Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well. They 
should have such confidence in themselves. Hong Kong's 
prosperity has been brought about by Hong Kong people with 
Chinese as the main body." 
  Zhou Nan stressed: "We must create such confidence: Without 
British cooperation, we can still achieve a smooth transition 
and administer Hong Kong well." He hoped the appointed advisers 
on regional affairs would, together with the Hong Kong people, 
make concerted efforts to remove all obstacles and work for a 
smooth transition and a happier and more prosperous Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [By reporter You Xiayin (3266 1115 5419): "Beijing Scholars </F>
Expose the Essence of the `Direct Democratic Elections' 
Introduced by the British in Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--After the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry released the document on the facts of 
the Sino- British talks on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements 
for Hong Kong, some Beijing scholars have commented on the 
British side's attempts to undermine the talks. They have 
pointed out that the introduction of a British-type "democratic" 
election system is disadvantageous to Hong Kong. 
  Qiu Liben, an associate research fellow at the World History 
Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 
said: Whenever Britain was about to withdraw from a colony, it 
tried to change the system in which the executive branch 
dominates the legislative branch, under the camouflage of 
democracy. The British typically would foster and manipulate 
forces within the legislative council, vigorously introduce 
"democratic" elections, and thus sow the seeds of turmoil. If 
the outcome of the elections did not conform with British 
interests, they would wipe it out. This type of hypocritical 
democratic "direct elections" must be exposed immediately. 
  Professor Liu Wenzong of the International Law Research 
Center of the Institute of Diplomacy, pointed out even more 
bluntly: By introducing overall direct elections in Hong Kong, 
the British side actually intends to launch a series of 
"reforms" to confront the Basic Law and thus create chaos. 
Chris Patten once revealed: "The executive branch must be made 
accountable to the legislative organ around 1997." In a "report 
by missions to Hong Kong" written in 1991, the British side said 
that it is necessary to have the chief executive directly 
elected by the public, and suggested that the chief executive be 
accountable to the legislative organ of the special 
administrative region rather than to the Chinese Government. 
These remarks and views have all exposed the British side's 
intention of disrupting the stable transition process in Hong 
Kong. 
  Zhang Shunhong of the World History Research Institute of 
the 
Academy of Social Sciences maintained that Britain's ultimate 
purpose in "bestowing" its "democratic system" on its colonies 
is to facilitate its infiltration and safeguard its economic 
privileges and interests.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporter Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 </F>
0171 1229): "Britain Can Never Realize Its Attempt To Make 
Chinese Sovereignty in Hong Kong Exist in Name Only"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- Owing to the British 
side's recent moves, the Hong Kong issue has again attracted 
worldwide attention. First of all, following an intense 
publicity campaign, Chris Patten instigated the British 
Legislative Council [Legco] in Hong Kong to adopt his partial 
constitutional package. Then, the British side published the 
White Paper in which it unilaterally publicized the so-called 
contents of the Sino-British talks about elections in Hong Kong. 
For the sake of clarification, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs publicized on 28 February the facts of the several 
issues discussed in the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 
1994/95 elections, thus exposing to the world the way the 
British violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong 
Kong Basic Law, and the accords and understandings that China 
and Britain had reached, as well as the British side's 
deliberate attempts to undermine Sino-British cooperation and 
the Sino-British talks. 
  The recent Sino-British disputes show that, in an attempt to 
extend its colonial interests, Britain may disregard 
international faith, play tricky games, and do whatever it 
wants. They did that during the negotiations, and their recent 
move to unilaterally publicize the so-called contents of the 
Sino-British talks was also no exception. When the talks 
started, the two sides, to create a good atmosphere for the 
talks, reached an agreement that the contents of the talks 
should be kept confidential. China, of course, was not against 
the publication of the contents of the talks at the right time. 
China, being open and aboveboard during the talks, has nothing 
to hide from the world. But since an agreement had been 
reached, the contents of the talks should not have been 
publicized until the two sides consulted one another through 
diplomatic chennels. This is a basic international faith that 
should be abided by. However, the British side, without any 
consultations with China, acted unilaterally to publicize the 
so-called contents of the Sino-British negotiations in an 
unexpected manner on the same day Chris Patten instigated the 
Hong Kong Legco to adopt his partial constitutional package. He 
wanted to use one- sided and distorted facts to shirk to China 
the responsibility for the breakdown of the Sino-British talks, 
taking advantage of the psychology that "first impressions are 
the strongest." People can see how ignominous the British 
side's move was! 
  When the contents of Sino-British talks publicized by the 
Chinese and the British side are analyzed and compared, the 
flaws which the British side tried to hide come to light. For 
example, before the Sino-British talks started, Chinese Vice 
Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu presented a diplomatic note to 
British Ambassador to China Robin McLaren, presenting to the 
British side the five-point conditions for the reopening of the 
negotiations. The fifth point states: "If the British side 
submits the constitutional package to the Legislative Council 
for discussion, it shows a total lack of sincerity on the part 
of the British side, and it means that China shall not be held 
responsible if the talks break down." But this important note 
is not mentioned at all in the white paper. Moreover, the 
Chinese side again reminded the British side about this point 
during the 17th round of talks, but the white paper also totally 
ignores this reminder. This being the case, how could the 
British side state that the white paper has publicized "all the 
facts"? The world can see that, to hide its total lack of 
sincerity in the talks and to cover up its responsibility for 
the termination of the talk, the British side is ready to 
hoodwink the public! 
  Let us now take a look at the negotiation process. The 
British side states in the white paper that it withdrew from the 
negotiations because it could not achieve a common understanding 
with the Chinese side on two issues. The first one is about 
Legco's single-seat, single-vote voting method; and the second 
one is the elimination of appointed seats on district boards and 
the two municipal councils. The facts publicized by the Chinese 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs show that this is again an ignoble 
move by the British side. First of all, the two sides had yet 
to discuss Legco's voting method, and the Chinese side only 
hoped that more complex issues concerning arrangements for 
Legco's election in 1995 will not be discussed until an accord 
has been reached on issues that can be easier to deal with -- 
issues about arrangements for the 1994/95 elections of district 
boards and the two municipal councils -- because that would help 
the two sides reach an accord. Second, on the issue of 
maintaining the appointed seats, the Chinese side, considering 
the fact that Hong Kong's district boards and the two municipal 
councils were commonly opposed to the elimination of the 
appointment system and considering the system's actual 
operations, proposed that the existing number of appointed seats 
be maintained. The British side, however, disagreed. To reach 
an agreement at an early date, the Chinese side conceded three 
times and came up with a plan which took into consideration the 
two sides' positions and which sidestepped differences so that 
the British side would not have to set up appointed seats before 
30 June 1997 and then the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [HKSAR] Government can set up a proportionally 
appropriate number of appointed seats according to the relevant 
provisions of the Basic Law. This totally positive and 
constructive proposal fully explained the Chinese side's 
sincerity and flexibility in solving problems. However, in the 
White Paper it has published, the British side not only fails to 
elaborate the specific process, but also distorts it, alleging 
that the Chinese side has violated the HKSAR's autonomy 
prescribed in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Is this 
not another pretext to undermine Sino-British negotiations? 
  In the concluding part of the white paper, the British side 
ascribes the breakdown of the Sino-British negotiations to the 
"basic differences" between "China's far more restrictive 
electoral arrangements with far fewer voters" and the British 
side's "proposal which truly represents the interests of Hong 
Kong and the Hong Kong people." The fact publicized by the 
Chinese side is that, when the two sides almost reached a 
concensus in their talks on the elections of Hong Kong's 
district boards and the two municipal councils, the British side 
suddenly complicated the issue and insisted on incorporating 
Legco's single-seat, single-vote voting method with the 
memorandum of understanding about electoral arrangements for 
regional organizations; then, before the issue was discussed 
further, it brazenly declared that it was instructed to 
terminate the talks. Making such an important announcement 
during the course of the talks fully proves that British side 
had premediated it a long time ago. Later, the British side 
again violated the agreement and submitted Chris Patten's 
partial consitutional package to the British Legco in Hong Kong 
for discussion, thus terminatng the 17-rounds of Sino-British 
talks. The British side must be held responsible for the 
disruption of the Sino-British talks and it can never escape the 
responsibility no matter how it indulges in sophistry with sweet 
words and no matter how the white paper has painstakingly 
glossed over the facts. 
  In the White Paper, the British side tries its utmost to 
defend the longstanding lack of democracy in Hong Kong, but none 
of the explanations are tenable; rather, they fully expose its 
fear of the re-exercising of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
People can see that why Britain never mentioned that it would 
promote democracy in Hong Kong prior to the signing of the 
Sino-British joint declaration in 1984 is because the time in 
those days was not favorable to Britain, but now it talks about 
"democracy" in a big way when there are only a few more years 
left before China re-exercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
This is because it can use this beautiful word to create chaos 
in Hong Kong during its stable transition, to cultivate its own 
influence, and impose a pro-British, anti-China group on China 
so as to turn Hong Kong into a political entity having the 
audacity to demand independence or semi- independence from the 
central government so that Britain's political power and 
influence can continue beyond 1997 and China's sovereignty and 
administrative power will exist in name only. 
  One point stands out clearly from the facts which China and 
Britain have publicized, the scheme of the British side. For 
example, as soon as the negotiations started, the British side 
held firmly to the issue of the Legco members' request to ride 
the so-called "through train" all the way into the HKSAR 
legislative organ, and demanded that the Chinese side come up 
with "objective standards" which are "acceptable to the British 
side." Whether there is a "through train" in 1997 rests 
primarily with whether the arrangements for the 1994/95 
elections are in line with the relevant provisions in the Basic 
Law and whether Hong Kong's political system before 1997 can 
converge with the Basic Law. As for who can ride the "through 
train," they should be acknowledged by the HKSAR Preparatory 
Committee to be formed in 1996. But as soon as the negotiations 
started, the British side brazenly put forth the aforementioned 
demand which violates the Basic Law and China's sovereignty in 
order to keep the anti-China forces it has nurtured. Here is 
another example: During the negotiations, the British side time 
and again wanted to discuss three demands with the Chinese side: 
1) The Hong Kong members of the HKSAR Preparatory Committee 
should be produced through Sino-British consultations; 2) If the 
HKSAR agrees, the Chinese Government should support the 
Legislative Council's general election in 2007; and 3) The 
electoral committee in 1995 should henceforth become the model 
for producing the committee for nominating the first HKSAR Chief 
Executive as well as the committee for electing all the 
subsequent chief executives. These issues are irrelevant to the 
agenda of the negotiations. The first demand has been 
prescribed in the Basic Law, and the second and third demands 
should be issues to be dealt with after 1997, and that will be 
China's internal affairs after China resumes the exercise of its 
sovereignty in Hong Kong. That fact that the British side 
should come up with these demands nakedly bares its intention to 
cultivate its agents for Hong Kong's political stage after 1997 
to extend its administrative power there. 
  The foundation for Sino-British cooperation to achieve a 
stable transition in Hong Kong has now been destroyed. Under 
such circumstances, the Chinese side can only intensify all 
preparations so that, after Britain's three-tiered political 
framework in Hong Kong ends on 30 June 1997, it can be 
reorganized according to the decision made by the National 
People's Congress as well as the provisions in the Basic Law. 
What is gratifying is that the Preliminary Working Committee 
for the HKSAR Preparatory Committee has already started doing 
what is essential, and more and more Hong Kong people have 
become interested in or have taken part in Hong Kong's 
transitional affairs. We believe that any interference from the 
British side can only be compared to an ant trying to topple a 
giant tree, and that Hong Kong's future will be even brighter.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Chinese authorities are trying to stop a petition 
on workers' rights and clean government from reaching the 
national legislature and a top consultative body. Sources in 
Beijing said group of liberal intellectual had drafted a 
petition which they hoped would be discussed at the upcoming 
National People's Congres (NPC) and the Chines People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The drafters 
intended to implement a signature campaign to go with the 
petition but they were stopped by police and state security 
agents last week. 
  The five-point petition asked the legislature to consider 
constitutional and legal revisions allowing freedom of speech 
and assembly. It said workers should be assured "freedom from 
exploitation" and have the right to strike and organise 
non-official trade unions. It also demanded a better deal for 
the 800 million peasants and assurances that they get a fair 
price for produce as well as the removal of excessive taxes. A 
major focus was to ask the legislature and the CPPCC to put more 
pressure on the Government to get tough on corruption. It 
suggested that the NPC pass a law obliging senior officials and 
their offspring to declare their assets. 
  Chinese sources said the petition was started by three 
dissidents who were arrested by the Government last week--trade 
unionist Zhou Guoqiang and legal scholars Yuan Hongbing and Wang 
Jiaqi. The sources said, however, that while the three 
initiators of the petition had been detained, this did not mean 
an end to the movement. They said copies of the petition had 
been circulated among the intellectual community in the capital 
and had reached more-outspoken NPC and CPPCC members, including 
those from Hong Kong. The sources said there was a possibility 
other dissident intellectuals might proceed with the signature 
campaign. The petition would then be presented to NPC and CPPCC 
deputies on an individual base and be publicised in the overseas 
and Hong Kong press. 
  Hong Kong businessman and publisher Xu Simin, who is a 
member 
of the standing committee of the CPPCC, has expressed support 
for some form of an anti-corruption law obliging senior 
officials and their offspring to declare their assets and 
incomes. Mr Xu said the principle of the declaration of wealth 
had been accepted by the leadership, even though there was 
opposition to the ruling applying to the children of officials. 
  Legal analysts in Beijing said, however, that the 
authorities 
would not allow NPC or CPPCC deputies to discuss more 
controversial aspects of the petition, particularly freedom of 
speech, and the rights of workers to strike and to organize 
trade unions. The analysts said the authorities had also 
decided other controversial legal issues should be avoided at 
the twin sessions. These included the suggestion that the law 
on "counter-revolutionary crime" be abolished. Discussion on 
the draft law on publication and the media would also be 
discouraged, if not stopped, because of Beijing's fear that 
liberal deputies might use this to clamour for a more free flow 
of information. 
  While there is no clear evidence linking the unsigned 
statement to the detentions, the points underlined in the 
document are among those included in a "Peace Charter" signed by 
some of those detained in the current crackdown.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The Second Plenary 
Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's leading 
organization for united front work, opened in the Great Hall of 
the People here this afternoon. 
  Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and central 
government Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Liu 
Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren attended today's meeting to 
extend their greetings. 
  The meeting was presided over by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
CPPCC National Committee, and attended by 1,860 CPPCC National 
Committee members from all over China. 
  The meeting first examined and adopted an agenda for the 
current session of the CPPCC National Committee. According to 
the agenda, members of the national committee will: examine a 
work report by the CPPCC National Committee; attend the second 
plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) 
as nonvoting delegates; deliberate draft amendments to the CPPCC 
Constitution; discuss a report by the proposal sub-committee of 
the CPPCC National Committee; examine various resolutions; and 
elect new vice-chairmen, standing committee members and 
secretary-general of the CPPCC National Committee. 
  Entrusted by the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National 
Committee, CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairman Ye Xuanping 
delivered a report on the work of the Standing Committee. 
  Ye said that since its first plenary session held a year 
ago, 
guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the CPPCC National Committee has been 
exploring new ways to engage in political consultations and 
exercise supervision over government work. 
  "The CPPCC National Committee is now playing a significant 
role in China's political, economic and cultural life," he told 
the meeting. 
  Ye described 1994 as a "year of vital importance" for 
China's 
reforms, opening up and modernization drive. 
  He called on all CPPCC organizations and members to hold 
high 
the banner of patriotism and socialism, work hard to help 
implement the central task of the CPC and the government, and 
better perform their duties of participating in political 
consultations and exercising democratic supervision over 
government work. 
  The CPPCC leader also called on these organizations and 
members to improve their work efficiency and make greater 
contributions to continued reforms, open policy implementation, 
economic growth and social stability. 
  Attendants listened to an explanation on draft amendments to 
the CPPCC constitution, which has played an important role in 
creating a new situation in CPPCC work since its adoption in 
1982. 
  However, given a changed situation brought about by reforms, 
implementation of the open policy and the modernization drive, 
and in view of new developments of CPPCC's own work, a number of 
stipulations of the constitution stand in need of revision, 
according to the explanation. 
  The draft amendments to the CPPCC constitution have been 
adopted by the fifth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 
CPPCC National Committee and are being submitted to the general 
session for examination and adoption.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The current session of 
China's top political consultative body is in the process of 
revising its constitution. 
  A constitutional amendment panel under the Eighth National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) has submitted a revised CPPCC constitution 
(draft) to the CPPCC plenary session that opened here this 
afternoon. 
  The panel says in its explanation to the session that the 
revision aims to make the CPPCC constitution conform better to 
the latest amendments to the constitution of the People's 
Republic of China and to the tenets of the 14th National 
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC). 
  The panel notes that the revised constitution will highlight 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
CPC's basic line of taking economic development as the central 
task and the multi-party cooperation system under CPC 
leadership. The constitutional revision is designed to improve 
CPPCC's status and role in the political life of China, it says. 
  According to the panel, since the major principles and basic 
framework of the 1982 constitution have remained correct, it has 
recommended only a necessary and partial revision. It suggests 
that issues which have a bearing on the work of the CPPCC but 
are beyond the limits of the CPPCC constitution be handled 
through state legislation and other channels. 
  According to the panel headed by CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan, 
the revised CPPCC constitution (draft) has been approved by the 
Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and is 
being submitted to the general session for examination and 
adoption.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has played an 
important role in China's political, economic and cultural 
affairs, Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the Eighth National 
Committee of CPPCC, said here today. 
  Ye said that the CPPCC Eighth National Committee, based on 
the work experience of the previous national committees, has 
probed new ways to engage in political consultations and 
exercise democratic supervision. It has tried to make CPPCC, a 
unique form of democratic politics in China, meet the 
requirements of the country's socialist modernization since its 
first session last March, he said. 
  Ye made the remarks when delivering the work report of the 
Standing Committee of the CPPCC Eighth National Committee at the 
opening of its second session. 
  In the past year, Ye said, the National Committee held five 
standing committee meetings and discussed a wide range of issues 
including the national economic situation, measures to solve 
economic problems, the international situation, establishment of 
a socialist market economy in China, measures to ensure a clean 
government and the fight against corruption. 
  Zhu Rongji and other leaders of the Communist Party of China 
(CPC) delivered reports to the Standing Committee. 
  The Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee put 
forward many good opinions and suggestions on the issues, 
according to Ye. For instance, the economic sub-committee of 
the National Committee raised suggestions on strengthening 
macro-economic controls and keeping inflation at bay, which were 
adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the central government. 
The sub-committee has therefore contributed to strengthened 
macroeconomic controls and a continuous, fast and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
  Last year, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee, successfully visited Nepal, India and Pakistan. It 
was the first visit to foreign countries by a chairman of the 
CPPCC National Committee and has important significance in 
CPPCC's international exchanges. 
  The national committee organized 15 delegations for visits 
to 
more than 20 countries and established ties with organizations 
and parliaments of 14 host countries. So far, the CPPCC 
National Committee has established friendly relations with 46 
organizations and parliaments in 36 countries. 
  Subcommittees of the CPPCC National Committee also made 
surveys on some important issues and put forward 24 reports. 
They attracted attention from the CPC Central Committee, the 
State Council, government departments and local authorities. 
Many suggestions contained in the reports have been adopted. 
  In addition, the national committee has also made new 
progress in expanding domestic and overseas friendship ties, 
promoting the reunification of the motherland, participating in 
the anti- corruption campaign, helping state organs build clean 
government, improving inspection work of its members, raising 
suggestions for reform and development, improving the handling 
of proposals raised by CPPCC members, and revising the 
constitution of CPPCC. 
  On this year's work, Ye Xuanping said that the CPPCC 
National 
Committee will uphold the banner of patriotism and socialism, 
focus on the central work of CPC and the state, actively engage 
in political consultations and exercise democratic supervision, 
improve its work efficiency, seize favorable development 
opportunities, and make further contributions to the country's 
economic reform, open policy implementation, economic 
development and social stability. 
  Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee in the New Year will 
make systematic and in-depth investigations on issues concerning 
economic development, reform, the open policy and people's life, 
put forward policy proposals and report them to the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council. CPPCC, Ye said, will make 
better use of itself as a pool of talented people, its extensive 
information sources and its wide contacts. 
  In the New Year, Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee will 
continue to develop friendly exchanges with parliaments and 
non-governmental organizations of foreign countries, promote the 
reunification of the motherland, urge direct and two-way 
exchanges of mail, air and shipping services as well as trade 
between the mainland and Taiwan, devote itself to maintaining 
the stability and long-term prosperity of Hong Kong, and work 
for a smooth hand-over and transition of the sovereignty of 
Macao in accordance with the basic law of the territory.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China has tightened control over the leaking of 
information on the annual plenary sessions of the NPC and CPPCC, 
which open today and on Thursday [10 March] respectively. 
Deputies said the move was another indication of the tense 
political atmosphere in Beijing. 
  Sources said the 2,000 deputies of the CPPCC had been warned 
not to divulge the contents of reports marked "confidential". 
These include the Government Work Report to be submitted by the 
premier, Li Peng, to the second plenum of the Eighth National 
People's Congress session. "It appears that the atmosphere is a 
bit more tense this year," a CPPCC delegate said. "Of course, 
there's nothing really sensitive in the work reports." But how 
the Chinese leadership saw the political situation was 
different, he said. 
  The communist regime tightened control over the media 
following the leaking of a work report by the Communist Party 
chief, Jiang Zemin, at a party plenum in 1992 -- days before it 
was scheduled to be delivered by Mr Jiang.

<F P=106> ["Special News Program on the Second Session of the Eighth </F>
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [video shows medium close-ups of unidentified 
person speaking] Ladies and gentlemen, friends: The second 
session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] will now begin its 
news briefing. I will invite Mr. Li Luye, spokesman for the 
session and vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee 
Foreign Affairs Committee, to give you a news briefing. 
  [Li Luye] Ladies and gentlemen, friends, comrades: I give 
this news briefing today at the request of the secretariat of 
the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Conference. The 
second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Conference is 
scheduled to open ceremoniously at the Great Hall of the People 
in Beijing at 1500 [0700 GMT] on 8 March. The session will last 
12 days. The session's main agenda is: Examining the work 
report of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing 
Committee; attending the second session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] as observer; hearing and discussing the 
government work report and other reports; examining and 
approving the motion of revising the CPPCC constitution; 
examining and approving the report about the handling of motions 
submitted since the first session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee; electing additional vice chairmen and standing 
committee members of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and 
electing a new secretary general; and examining and approving 
all resolutions to be made by the second session of the Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee. During the closing session, Chairman 
Li Ruihuan will give an important speech. During the fifth 
session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing 
Committee, which closed on 5 March, 30 additional members of the 
CPPCC National Committee were elected; and the session also 
nominated Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping to deliver the work report 
of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee. 
  Over the past year, people of all nationalities in the 
country, earnestly implementing the guidelines laid down by the 
14th National CPC Congress and its third plenary session, 
continued to march forward along the course charted by Comrade 
Xiaoping of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
New successes were achieved in reform, opening up, and 
socialist modernization. In that year, under the leadership of 
the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, 
the CPPCC National Committee, as the broadest patriotic united 
front organization of the Chinese people, rallied all democratic 
parties, mass organizations, democrats without party 
affiliations, and people of all nationalities in all circles to 
earnestly implement the basic line characterized by one center 
and two basic points, and to work hard in exploring a new course 
for CPPCC organs' operations. 
  Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee, focusing 
on 
the state's central tasks, earnestly performed its functions of 
providing political consultation and democratic supervision, and 
participating in and discussing state affairs. Consequently the 
CPPCC National Committee's operations in all fields continued to 
develop on the basis of the experiences accumulated by the 
previous committees, thus contributing positively to promoting 
reform, opening up, and social stability. 
  Although the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee is an annual regular meeting, it is a very important 
meeting to be held at a crucial time when China is accelerating 
the pace of building a socialist market economic system. During 
this meeting, the committee members will seriously sum up the 
work accomplished since the previous session, and will freely 
express their views on reform, development, stability and other 
major issues having a bearing on the national economy and 
people's livelihood. I believe that, under the current 
gratifying situation -- exemplified by rapid economic 
development, stable political situation, solidarity among people 
of all nationalities, and social progress at home -- this 
session certainly will be a democratic, truth-seeking, united, 
and morale-boosting meeting which will expedite China's 
socialist modernization and socialist democratic construction. 
  Now all the preparations for the second session of the 
Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee have been made. As of the afternoon on 
6 March, 1,265 of the 2,097 members of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee had reported their presence to the secretariat of the 
session. To assist Chinese and foreign reporters in their news 
coverage, a CPPCC National Committee office has been set up in 
the information center of the CPPCC and NPC sessions. 
  Now I would like to take up your questions with regard to 
the 
session that will soon be held. 
  [Li Xiaomin] I am Li Xiaomin, reporter of the ZHONGGUO 
[word indistinct] BAO, I have a question to ask: How many major 
parts of the CPPCC National Committee Constitution have been 
revised? What are the major improvements the CPPCC National 
Committee has made with regard to its participation in 
administration and state affairs discussions? Thank you. 
  [Li Luye] I will ask Mr. Zhao Weizhi [deputy secretary 
general of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee] to answer your 
first question. I will answer your second question. 
  [Zhao Weizhi, reading from paper] The current CPPCC National 
Committee Constitution was adopted in 1982. It is a good 
Constitution. Only some parts of the Constitution will be 
revised and the revision will be based on the actual 
developments and changes over the past 12 years. The principle 
of revising the Constitution is based on the guidelines of the 
14th National CPC Congress to come in line with the newly 
revised PRC Constitution in some important wordings and to 
stress the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the basic line of the primary stage of 
socialism, the system of multiparty cooperation and political 
consultations under the CPC's leadership, and the socialist 
market economy. At the same time, the new Constitution will 
also incorporate the new experiences and new successes China has 
gained and achieved in socialist democratic construction and in 
developing CPPCC operations since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee. In the new Constitution, some 
of the provisions with regard to CPPCC organs' functions in 
providing political consultations and performing democratic 
supervision will be enriched. It states, for example, that the 
CPPCC National Committee is an important multiparty organ 
providing political consultations under the CPC's leadership; 
the CPPCC National Committee's principal functions are to 
provide political consultations and democratic supervision, and 
organize member parties, mass organizations, and people of all 
nationalities in all circles to participate in administration 
and state affairs discussions. Moreover, the CPPCC National 
Committee will provide political consultations before decisions 
are made on major state and local policies and on major 
political, economic, cultural, and social issues. It will also 
provide political consultations on major issues when decisions 
are being carried out. The motion of revising the Constitution 
to be submitted to the second session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee for discussion and adoption was drafted and 
redrafted many times on the basis of the views expressed by 
persons in charge of all democratic parties, industrial and 
commercial federations, and local CPPCC organs, as well as 
relevant central authorities. 
  [Li Luye, reading from paper] With regard to participating 
in administration and state affairs discussions, the Eighth 
CPPCC National Committee did so in many ways. I will briefly 
describe some major one. On participating in administration and 
discussion of state affairs, the Eighth CPPCC National Committee 
Standing Committee held a total of five plenary sessions in 1993 
to discuss issues concerning the state's economic problems and 
solutions, international situation, the establishment of a 
socialist market economic system, ethical construction, and 
crackdown on corruption. Leading comrades of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council who reported at the CPPCC 
National Committee Standing Committee included Zhu Rongji, Qian 
Qichen, Wen Jiabao, and Wei Jianxing. Standing Committee 
members have presented very good opinions and suggestions on 
major state affairs. The Standing Committee meetings have made 
new headway in participating in administration and discussion of 
state affairs. In other respects of participating in 
administration and discussion of state affairs, special 
committees under the CPPCC National Committee presented 24 
important investigation reports in 1993. These reports were 
about stabilizing grain and cotton output, rescue and 
preservation of historical relics which can be destroyed by the 
construction of the Three Gorges Project, the construction of 
high-tech industrial development zones, and projects that 
minority areas can carry out to eliminate poverty and develop 
their economy. The CPC Central Committee and relevant 
departments under the State Council have attached great 
importance to these reports. Many views expressed in the 
reports have been adopted. 
  [Liu Hanzhen in Mandarin] I am from the SOUTH CHINA 
MORNING POST. You just mentioned that the CPC National Committee 
was involved in fighting corruption in 1993. What conclusions 
have you come up with? How corrupt is the Chinese Government? 
What kind of work has to be carried out? Have there been any 
CPPCC National Committee members who have been investigated or 
found to have committed corruption? 
  [Li Luye] The CPPCC National Committee not only gives the 
CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council its all-out support in 
their fight against corruption, we have also taken an active 
part in the fight. Six investigation groups, with CPPCC 
National Committee members as heads or deputy heads, have 
investigated the anticorruption struggles waged by four 
ministries under the State Council and eight provinces. The 
fifth session of the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee 
also specially discussed the anticorruption issues, and promptly 
reflected the views and requests of people in all circles. 
During their discussion on fighting corruption, CPPCC National 
Committee members unanimously agreed that the struggle was an 
important matter having a close bearing on the survival of our 
state. The anticorruption struggle will continue to be a 
formidable and protracted mission. With regard to whether any 
CPPCC National Committee members have been investigated for 
having committed corruption, I can tell you that recently the 
National Committee's Standing Committee adopted a decision to 
dismiss Liu Huanzhen from his posts as a Standing Committee 
member and as a CPPCC National Committee member because of his 
involvement in fraud. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] I am reporter from China Central 
Television. Spokesman, since 1993, China has come up with many 
measures and plans for reform, such as reform of the financial 
and taxation systems. Which of these measures and plans are 
based on proposals presented or drawn up by the CPPCC National 
Committee for Reform? 
  [Li Luye] The proposal presented by our Economic Committee 
on 
the state's economic situation and solutions to the economic 
problems -- the proposal on intensifying macroscopic regulation 
and control and curbing inflation -- has been adopted by the CPC 
Central Committee and relevant departments under the State 
Council. 
  [Huang Zhikuan] I am Huang Zhikuan from the CENTRAL NEWS 
AGENCY in Taipei. Does the CPPCC National Committee have any 
new plans for its Taiwan operations? And how does the CPPCC 
National Committee view the efforts made by the Taiwan 
authorities in fighting for international space for activities 
[sheng huo kong jian]? Thank you. 
  [Li Luye] The CPPCC National Committee has been making 
positive efforts in supporting the national cause of achieveing 
peaceful reunification. In 1993, the CPPCC National Committee 
received many countrymen from Taiwan. With regard to promoting 
the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the CPPCC National 
Committee thinks that it is significant to promote mutual and 
common understanding in this regard. We will continue to 
intensify our work in this regard. With regard to your question 
about Taiwan's fight for survival space [sheng cun kong jian], I 
think that this is not a problem about fighting for survival, 
but a move attempting to create two Chinas or one China and one 
Taiwan. 
  [Moderator] This news briefing has now come to end an end. 
There will be several news conferences. You are welcome to 
attend. Thank you all.

Reform, Development, and Stability -- Congratulating the Opening 
of the Second Session of the Eighth Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth CPPCC National Committee opens in Beijing today. We 
extend our warm congratulations to the session and wish it great 
success. 
  In the past year, Chinese people of all nationalities, 
guided 
by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, resolutely implemented the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; made headway 
in reform, opening up, and modernization; and scored tremendous 
achievements on all fronts. The national economy developed in a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, with the gross domestic 
product breaking 3 trillion yuan, and advanced further in all 
social undertakings, and continuous improvement of urban and 
rural residents' life. The situation is heartening. 
  The new situation arising from reform and construction has 
put forth new tasks and requirements for people's political 
consultative conferences, and has provided a more favorable 
opportunity and condition for them to open up a new situation in 
their work. In the past year, the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee, on the basis of the work and experiences of the 
previous committees, earnestly organized the implementation of 
the tasks laid out by the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC 
National Committee, worked hard to explore new ways to exercise 
the functions of political consultation and democratic 
supervision under the new situation, and took part in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs focused on the 
work of the party and the government, thereby achieving 
significant progress in all fields of endeavor and bringing 
about a more lively situation. The CPPCC National Committee's 
Standing Committee held a total of five meetings; made numerous 
constructive suggestions and proposals concerning major issues 
in the political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic fields; and 
injected new vitality in the administration and discussion of 
state affairs. All special committees worked energetically to 
score notable results. They have been highly valued by the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council, as well as relevant 
departments and local governments, which have already adopted 
some of the suggestions and proposals. The CPPCC National 
Committee also achieved breakthroughs in developing exchange and 
enhancing friendship and cooperation with foreign countries, 
expanding contacts between people at home and Overseas Chinese, 
and promoting the motherland's peaceful reunification. 
Meanwhile, the CPPCC National Committee actively organized its 
members to make suggestions for reform and development, to take 
part in the anticorruption drive, and to help handle motions 
made by members. The fruitful results of the work in these 
areas crystallize the painstaking efforts of CPPCC organizations 
and members, and reflect the vigorous vitality of people's 
political consultative conferences. 
  This year is a very crucial one for China's progress in 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. The result of 
the work has a very important bearing on the relationship 
between reform and development in the future. The party and 
state have decided on the basic principles for their work, 
namely, to implement the guidelines of the 14th national party 
congress as well as the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee in an all-around way; to 
accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; to 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa 
zhan 0202 2170 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 
4099 1455]; to maintain political stability; and to promote 
sweeping social progress under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line. The burden 
shouldered by the CPPCC committees at all levels is even 
heavier. We believe that the CPPCC committees' work will surely 
meet the needs of the new situation, enjoy new development, and 
blaze new trails. 
  The CPPCC committees have the strong points of abundant 
intellectual resources, far sightedness, and broad channels. 
These strong points are extremely valuable and play an 
important role in China's modernization. The achievements 
scored by reform and opening up over the past 16 years include a 
large number of outstanding contributions by CPPCC members. The 
CPC Central Committee highly appraised their contributions. At 
the Fifth Session of the Fifth CPPCC National Committee, Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping pointed out that our united front "has a bright 
future and bright prospects." As the CPPCC committees' work 
continued to make new strides forward and score new achievements 
in recent years, the fine tradition -- "long-term coexistence, 
mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and 
sharing honor and disgrace" -- shines forth with new splendor. 
There are many new contradictions and problems that need to be 
solved in our endeavor to accelerate the establishment of a 
socialist market economy in the new year. The CPPCC committees 
must unite the masses of the people to support the governments 
to implement various reforms and to promote integration between 
reform, development, and stability. We believe the CPPCC 
organizations and CPPCC members will surely be able to carry 
forward their fine tradition, to give full play to their own 
strong points, to improve the concrete results of participating 
in and discussing government affairs by closely revolving their 
efforts around the central tasks of the party and state, and to 
make suggestions for and make greater contributions to seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability. 
  During the session, members will examine and discuss the 
work 
report of the CPPCC National Committee's Standing Committee, 
amend the constitution of the CPPCC National Committee, attend 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress as 
observers, and hear and discuss government work and other 
reports. We hope members will give full play to their role of 
political consultation and democratic supervision, actively 
participate in and discuss government affairs, speak out freely, 
draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas, and make 
the session a democratic and realistic one that is marked by 
unity and arouses the enthusiasm of all participants.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, has toned down 
criticism of Britain in his Government Work Report to be tabled 
at the National People's Congress [NPC] when it opens on 
Thursday [10 March]. According to the 35-page report, copies of 
which were distributed to delegates yesterday, Mr Li has adopted 
a milder stance towards the British Government in spite of icy 
ties in the wake of the collapse of democracy talks on Hong 
Kong. The tone and rhetoric of the Hong Kong sub-section are 
less confrontational compared with the vociferous volleys fired 
by Mr Li in his NPC work report last year. 
  In Thursday's report, Mr Li asserts that the British side 
has 
to shoulder the "full responsibility" for the breakdown of the 
17-round diplomatic talks. Noting that the work of the 
Preliminary Working Committee has already started, the premier 
says the Chinese Government "is fully determined and has the 
capability" to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
"in accordance with the schedule regardless of twists and turns". 
  Mr Li reaffirms the determination of Beijing to maintain the 
long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. But he 
emphasizes that the "colonial rule of the British Government" is 
coming to an end. "This can never be blocked by any forces," he 
says. The premier stops short of high-decibel name-calling or 
provocative remarks about the integrity of Whitehall or the 
"conspiracy of neo- imperialists". 
  His relatively mild remarks appear to suggest a return to 
pragmatism on the part of the Chinese Government in the wake of 
its "disillusionment" over any possibility of greater political 
cooperation with the British side in the next three years. This 
is despite a flurry of harsh words about Britain by senior 
Chinese officials on the heels of the publication of details of 
the talks and the gazetting of the controversial parts of 
Governor Chris Patten's political blueprint 10 days ago. 
Official sources said although China had never ruled out the 
possibility of an early takeover, it had never considered an 
earlier date for resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
  On the question of Macau, Mr Li praises Lisbon for the close 
Sino-Portuguese cooperation on the handover of the enclave. 
Similar to previous government work reports, the Hong Kong 
issue forms a part of the section dealing with "the 
reunification of the motherland" which also covers Macao and 
Taiwan. 
  The 15,000-character report compares to a 17,000 character 
document last year. The bulk of the premier's report touches on 
the economic development of the country, which has seen 
fluctuations in the past year marked by hyperinflation and 
austerity measures. 
  In the first section of his report, Mr Li reviews the past 
year's economic development including the austerity programme. 
He maps out the strategy of seeking a harmonious relationship 
between "development, reform and stability" this year. The 
reports also reiterates the dictum adopted by the politburo in 
January: "Seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand the open 
door, promote development and maintain stability." 
  In the second section, entitled "Maintenance of sustained, 
high- speed and healthy development of the economy", Mr Li 
emphasises the need to promote development in tandem with the 
enhancement of efficiency. In the third section, the premier 
underscores the significance of speeding up reforms for the 
development of a socialist market economy. The fourth section 
deals with the promotion of science, education and culture, 
while the fifth is on the strengthening of democracy and the 
legal system. The final part of the report covers diplomacy. 
Mr Li says Beijing has improved relations with all major 
countries. But Britain is not mentioned in this regard. 
  Mr Li sets the national growth rate this year at nine 
percent, and vows to keep inflation within 10 percent. While 
indicating that major achievements have been made in a wide 
range of areas, Mr Li concedes much still needs to be done in 
economic and social spheres. These include tackling soaring 
inflation, the "irrational" economic structure money-losing 
state firms, the worsening law-and-order situation, and laxity 
in fighting social evils as well as corruption. 
  Mr Li assures that the party centre and central Government 
have already taken measures to solve the problems. Stressing 
that this year's work should be governed by the 20-character 
dictum, he calls on the nation to put the national situation 
before local concerns. "We must seriously handle the 
relationship between development, reform, and stability," he 
says, adding the three are "inter-related". 
  "Economic construction is the core of our work. Reform is 
the impetus for promoting development. Development and reform 
are the way to ensure stability in the long run. And 
maintaining stability will guarantee (the smooth implementation 
of) development and reform." 
  In spite of his somewhat mild stance on Hong Kong, Mr Li 
speaks in harsher terms on the reunification of Taiwan. "The 
realization of the peaceful unification of the motherland is the 
wish of all the people of China. Any attempts and activities to 
split the motherland, no matter in what form, is in 
contravention of the interest of the Chinese people. They will 
all be futile," he says. 
  In spite of the controversy over the three-month-long 
austerity programme last year, Mr Li maintains in his report 
that the retrenchment exercise has attained positive results. 
He reiterates the need to impose macro-level adjustments and 
controls over the economy to solve outstanding contradictions 
and problems. Echoing the instructions made by octogenarian 
leaders Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, the premier underscores the 
significance of boosting the centre's authority in macro-level 
economic control. 
  According to an economist, the central Government should be 
able to attain a growth rate of around 10 percent in spite of 
the strong pressure of economic overheating. A veteran 
legislator said the whole report was "quite balanced" and 
moderate, adding he expected no major dispute over it at the 
upcoming plenum. Mr Li also vows before the year 2000 to 
provide "food and clothing" for the 80 million people who are 
living below the poverty line.

<F P=106> [By staff news team: "Li Peng's Government Work Report Is </F>
Divided Into Seven Parts, Consists of 16,000 Characters; 
Economic Growth of 9 Percent Is Proposed, and Efforts Will Be 
Made To Expand Opening Up, Enhance Level of People's Livelihood"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (WEN WEI PO)--It has been learned 
that State Council Premier Li Peng's government work report, 
which will be submitted to the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC] for examination and 
deliberation on 10 March, has been finalized. The report 
defines the basic principle for the country's work in 1994 as: 
taking Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance; 
comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; precipitating the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure; maintaining sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; 
maintaining political stability; and promoting comprehensive 
social progress. 
  The current 16,000-character government work report to be 
presented to the NPC for examination and deliberation is divided 
into seven parts. As disclosed by a member of the NPC Standing 
Committee, the seven parts comprise: 1) a review of domestic 
work in 1993 and basic principles for work in 1994; 2) 
maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy; 3) accelerating the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure; 4) developing scientific, 
technological, educational, and cultural undertakings; 5) 
intensifying building of socialist democracy and legal system; 
6) positively pushing forward the peaceful reunification of the 
motherland; and 7) work with regard to foreign affairs. 
According to the committee member cited above who was 
interviewed by this news team, in the first part of the report, 
assessment is made on work in 1993, primarily from the following 
four aspects: the national economy maintained sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development; new headway was made in reform and 
opening up; further development was attained in various social 
undertakings; and urban and rural people's living standards 
continued to improve. In the meantime, the report particularly 
points out: It is necessary to take positive measures to 
seriously resolve the following problems: excessive investment 
in fixed assets; the relatively big margin of price increases; 
the irrationality of the economic structure; the relatively 
difficult situation in the production and operations of some 
large and medium state enterprises; the poor condition of social 
security in some localities; the ineffective crack down on ugly 
social tendencies; the corruption of a small number of 
government officials bending the law to commit graft, 
embezzlement, and irregularities; and formalism and 
bureaucratism existing in government organs, and so on. 
<H3>  The Distribution Relationships Between Central and Local 
Authorities and Between State and Enterprises Have Yet To Be 
Straightened Out </H3>
  The report maintains that GDP growth of 9 percent in 1994 is 
a positive and sound growth rate. It is necessary to intensify 
the position of agriculture as a foundation, comprehensively 
develop the rural economy, improve operation and management, do 
a good job of production in industry and communications, 
maintain a rational investment scope, optimize the investment 
structure, open wider to the outside world, boost foreign 
cooperation and exchange, and continue to enhance the people's 
living standards. The report emphatically points out that 
family planning and environmental protection are China's 
national policies. 
  Meanwhile, it is necessary to conscientiously put into 
practice the financial taxation reform plan, straighten out the 
distribution relationship between central and local authorities 
and between state and enterprises, steadily carry out monetary 
structural reform, transform operational mechanisms in 
state-owned enterprises, explore an effective way of 
establishing a modern enterprise system, further rationalize 
price relations, develop and cultivate a market system, continue 
carrying out organizational reform in a proper way, 
conscientiously transform government functions, reinforce the 
building of a clean and honest government, and so on. These are 
the major contents of the third part. 
  With regard to the development of scientific, technological, 
educational, and cultural undertakings, the report highlights 
the following issues: bringing about the close integration of 
the economy and science and technology, taking firm control of 
educational reform and development, making socialist culture 
prosperous, and developing public health undertakings. 
  In the section on intensifying the building of socialist 
democracy and legal system, the report stresses the necessity of 
continuing to strengthen the building of socialist democracy, 
taking the building of the legal system seriously, and 
conscientiously doing a good job in the overall control of 
social security.

<F P=106> [Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1253 GMT on 7 </F>
March transmits a report on Pu Jie's cremation in Beijing 
together with a service message canceling the following item and 
asking that it be replaced with the next item] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The remains of Aisin 
Giorro Pu Jie, member of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress [NPC], vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities 
Committee, and a special member of the Cultural and Historical 
Data Research Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], were cremated in Beijing today. 
  Aisin Giorro Pu Jie died of illness in Beijing on 28 
February, aged 87. 
  Born in Beijing on 16 April 1907, Pu Jie, of the Man 
[Manchu] 
nationality, was a younger brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, the 
last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. When he was young he studied 
at Prince Chun's residence in Beijing and served as a study mate 
of Pu Yi. After 1929, Pu Jie was sent to study at Gakushuin 
University in Tokyo and at the Japanese Military Academy. After 
returning to northeast China in 1935, he served as a military 
officer with the puppet state of Manchukuo, which was supported 
by the Japanese Army. In 1937, he married Hiro Saga, the 
daughter of the Japanese Marquis Saneto Saga. After the 
Japanese Army surrendered in 1945, he and Pu Yi were captured by 
the Soviet Red Army. In August 1950, they were handed over to 
the Chinese Government to be locked up for reform. In November 
1960, they were pardoned and freed. After his release, the 
party and the government showed great concern for and took very 
good care of Mr. Pu Jie. When Premier Zhou Enlai cordially met 
with Pu Yi and with Pu Jie and his family members in 30 January 
1961, he encouraged them to study and to work hard to make 
contributions to the country. Because of the concern shown by 
Premier Zhou Enlai, Pu Jie's wife Hiro Saga and a daughter who 
had been separated from Pu Jie for many years returned from 
Japan in June of that year to live with him. Starting in May 
1962, Mr. Pu Jie served as a special member of the CPPCC 
Cultural and Historical Data Research Committee and as a member 
of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC Committee. After 1978, he was 
elected a deputy to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's; 
a member of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC Standing 
Committees; and a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities 
Committee. The fact that Mr. Pu Jie transformed himself from a 
brother of a feudal emperor into a citizen of New China and then 
advanced to become a member of the highest legislative organ of 
the people's political power demonstrates the CPC's great vision 
and brilliant policy regarding the transformation of society and 
classes, and this also demonstrates Mr. Pu Jie's high quality of 
seeking truth and a bright future. 
  Mr. Pu Jie supported the CPC and cherished the socialist 
motherland. This sentiment was embodied in his accounts of 
himself and the poems that he wrote over the years. He once 
wrote in a poem that "Under a sea of Red flags today, one can 
see the total difference between the new and old land." He once 
sincerely said that "in the evening of my life, I will try my 
best to make use of every available minute." As vice chairman 
of the NPC Nationalities Committee, he conscientiously carried 
out his duties as a people's deputy by showing concern for 
development and progress in minority nationality areas. 
Ignoring his feeble condition caused by his old age, he went 
deep into minority nationality areas to carry out investigations 
and studies. He offered many valuable suggestions for improving 
nationality work and worked very hard to safeguard the 
unification of the motherland and to strengthen unity among 
nationalities. Being enthusiastic about public welfare work, he 
vigorously supported welfare and cultural institutions. In 
April 1990, he was lauded by all sectors of society when he 
donated his life savings to the 11th Asian Games Organizing 
Committee. 
  For many years Mr. Pu Jie dedicated himself to promoting 
peace and friendship between China and Japan. He had broad ties 
with the Japanese royal house and with people of all circles 
both inside and outside the government. He visited Japan 
several times. He did a great deal of work to promote 
Sino-Japanese friendship by according a warm reception to 
visiting Japanese friends from various circles and by briefing 
them on the great achievements that China has made in reform, 
opening up to the outside world, and the modernization drive. 
When his majesty Emperor Akihito was enthroned, Pu Jie made a 
special trip to Japan to extend his regards to the emperor 
during which the Japanese Government and public thought highly 
of him. For many years, when he cordially received visiting 
Japanese friends from various circles, he told them of his wish 
that China and Japan would maintain friendly relations for one 
generation after another. In 1991 he was awarded an honorary 
doctor of law degree by Japan's Ritsumeikan University. 
  Mr. Pu Jie was a capable poet and calligrapher because he 
studied calligraphy and poetry when he was young. He was a 
well-known calligrapher at home and abroad. He summed up his 
calligraphic experience this way: "When you copy a model of 
calligraphy, it is necessary to use the strength of the wrist. 
If your mind is made up and your concentration is strong, you 
will turn out graceful and charming calligraphy." Because his 
life experience was unique, the poems and prose that he wrote 
about any event came naturally and were sincere in their feeling 
and artistic in their conception. He authored the "Selected 
Poems of Pu Jie."

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The remains of Mr. Aisin 
Giorro Pu Jie, member of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress [NPC], vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities 
Committee, and a special member of the Cultural and Historical 
Data Research Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], were cremated at the Babaoshan 
Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing today. Mr. Pu Jie died of 
illness in Beijing on 28 February 1994. 
  When Mr. Pu Jie was critically ill, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, 
Tian 
Jiyun, Cheng Siyuan, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Zhao 
Puchu, Qian Weichang, and Gu Mu visited him at the hospital. 
Qiao Shi asked Cao Zhi to visit him at the hospital. When Mr. 
Pu Jie passed away, Hu Jintao telephoned Mr. Pu Jie's relatives 
to send his condolences and to express his regards to them. 
  Those who went to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery to 
pay 
their last respects to the remains of Mr. Pu Jie included Tian 
Jiyun, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Ye Xuanping, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi 
Ngawang Jigme, and Zhao Puchu. Leading comrades of the NPC 
Standing Committee, the CPPCC National Committee, the United 
Front Department of the CPC Central Committee, the State 
Nationality Affairs Commission, the Beijing Municipal CPC 
Committee, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and other 
concerned departments also took part in paying last respects to 
the remains of Mr. Pu Jie. 
  Japanese Ambassador to China Junihiro Michihiko was present 
as a representative of the Japanese emperor and empress, who 
sent a wreath. 
  Born in Beijing on 16 April 1907, Pu Jie, of the Man 
[Manchu] 
nationality, was a younger brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, the 
last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. When he was young he studied 
at Prince Chun's residence in Beijing and served as a study mate 
of Pu Yi. After 1929, Pu Jie was sent to study at Gakushuin 
University in Tokyo and at the Japanese Military Academy. After 
returning to northeastern China in 1935, he served as a military 
officer with the puppet state of Manchukuo, which was supported 
by the Japanese Army. In 1937, he married Hiro Saga, the 
daughter of the Japanese Marquis Saneto Saga. After the 
Japanese Army surrendered in 1945, he and Pu Yi were captured by 
the Soviet Red Army. In August 1950, they were handed over to 
the Chinese Government to be detained for reform. In November 
1960, they were pardoned and freed. After being released, the 
party and the government showed great concern for and took very 
good care of Mr. Pu Jie. During the sixties, he was cordially 
received by Premier Zhou Enlai. Because of the concern shown by 
Premier Zhou Enlai, he was able to be reunited with his wife and 
daughter, who had lived in Japan and were parted from Pu Jie for 
many years, and to live together with them in China. From May 
1962, Mr. Pu Jie served as a special member of the CPPCC 
Cultural and Historical Data Research Committee and as a member 
of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC Committee. After 1978, he was 
elected a deputy to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's; 
a member of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC Standing 
Committees; and a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities 
Committee. The fact that Mr. Pu Jie transformed himself from 
being a brother of a feudal emperor into a citizen of New China 
and then advanced to become a member of the highest legislative 
organ of the people's political power demonstrates the CPC's 
great vision and brilliant policy regarding the transformation 
of society and classes and also demonstrates Mr. Pu Jie's high 
quality of seeking truth and a bright future. 
  Mr. Pu Jie supported the CPC and loved the socialist 
motherland. As a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities 
Committee, he conscientiously carried out his duties as a 
representative of the people, put forward many valuable 
suggestions for further improving nationality affairs work, and 
made active contributions to safeguarding the unification of the 
motherland and strengthening the unity of various nationalities. 
  For a long time, Mr. Pu Jie dedicated his life to promoting 
peace and friendship between China and Japan. He visited Japan 
many times and enthusiastically received visiting Japanese 
friends from various circles. He actively introduced the great 
achievements of China's reform, opening up, and modernization 
drive. He made painstaking efforts to promote friendship 
between China and Japan. In 1991 he was awarded an honorary 
doctor of law degree by Japan's Ritsumeikan University. 
  Mr. Pu Jie was a world-renowned calligrapher. His 
openhearted and graceful poems were full of sincere sentiments. 
He authored the "Selected Poems of Pu Jie." 
  According to Mr. Pu Jie's will, his ashes will be spread 
over 
the vast land of China. 
  In appreciation for the concern shown to Mr. Pu Jie by the 
party and the state over a long period, his daughter Kosei 
Fukunaga asked the CPPCC National Committee to present a portion 
of her share of her inheritance to the state.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a forum of 
officials attending a national party school work conference at 
the Huairentang Hall in Zhongnanhai today, Jiang Zemin, CPC 
Central Committee general secretary, said: In view of the new 
situation and tasks, the entire party membership should set 
great store by, and step up efforts at study. Leading cadres 
should take the initiative to launch a down-to-earth study 
campaign and vie with each other for more efforts and better 
efficiency in study so as to ensure smooth progress in the work 
of all fields. 
  The forum was presided over by Hu Jingtao, Standing 
Committee 
member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of 
the CPC Central Committee and president of the Central Party 
School. Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and Secretariat; and Wen Jiabao, alternate 
member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of 
the CPC Central Committee; were present at the forum. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Our party has always set great store by 
study. Whenever revolution and construction develops to a 
critical turning point and whenever the whole party faces a new 
situation and tasks, we stress even more the need to study. 
Every step of advance taken and every victory won in our 
party's cause during the past several decades are inseparable 
from the study and advancement made by all party comrades. 
Fruitful results of extensive study by the entire party 
membership were especially conspicuous during the Yanan period 
and on the eve of nationwide liberation. Following the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's 
endeavor to build socialism entered a new development period. 
At Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal, the party launched a 
campaign to renew study. The remarkable achievements in China's 
economic reform and development over the past more than a decade 
should, to a large extent, be attributed to our efforts to 
study. Looking back at our party's experiences over the past 
several decades, it is of crucial importance to steadfastly take 
our own road by persistently integrating the basic tenents of 
Marxism with China's reality, and to diligently study and 
continually do pioneering work based on the demand of the 
situation and tasks facing the party in different periods of 
time. It is precisely because our party upholds the fine 
tradition of study and continually promotes and strengthens the 
integration of the Marxist theory with China's national 
conditions based on changes in the situation and tasks that our 
party has been able to overcome dangers and difficulties, to 
develop from a small and weak to a big and strong party, to 
unite and lead the broad masses of people in taking the road of 
revolution and construction commensurate with China's national 
strength, to open up a new situation, and to advance from 
victory to victory. 
  Jiang Zemin emphasized: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
14th CPC National Congress set the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure as the objective of reform. A 
blueprint for a new economic structure has been drawn up in the 
decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee. Our reform has entered a new stage of 
combining package reform with breakthroughs in key economic, 
political, cultural, and social areas. At present, we all 
realize that the rapidly-changing situation presents to us many 
new and thorny problems and the difficulty in our work has 
increased. All these explain that the establishment of a brand 
new economic system for further emancipating and expanding 
productive forces and expediting the pace of socialist 
modernization has set a new and higher demand for our level of 
theory, policy, knowledge, and work. There are many things we 
are not familiar with or do not understand at all. What should 
we do? The way out is to admit our weaknesses and 
conscientiously study and master new knowledge and skills. 
Moreover, we should realize that China's socialist 
modernization drive is being carried out amidst a complicated 
and everchanging international environment. The world today is 
characterized by fierce competition, with the competition for 
economic and overall national strength as the core issue. In a 
sense, it is also a competition for talented people, for the 
ability of leaders and the quality of nations. Amidst fierce 
international competition, we must seize the opportunity to 
develop ourselves and become invincible. We must work and study 
hard. With a big party, big country, big population, our nation 
cannot effect a real take-off and succeed in modernization if we 
fail to arm ourselves with scientific theory and to master new 
knowledge in various fields. Therefore, the issue of study 
concerns not only the advancement of cadres at large, but also 
the prosperity of the country and its people and the success of 
the modernization drive. The entire party membership and the 
whole nation must reach this consensus. 
  Touching on what leading cadres need to study in the face 
of the new situation and tasks, Jiang Zemin said: Two important 
aspects need to be studied: first, Marxist theory and, second, 
social practice and the practices of the masses of the people. 
At present, so far as the requirements for leadership work are 
concerned, the most fundamental need is to study well the theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Meanwhile, 
efforts must be made to study the basic knowledge of a socialist 
market economy and its related principles, policies, laws, and 
regulations; the basic knowledge of modern science and 
technology; and the experiences of Chinese history and, in 
particular, of modern history and the world history of socialism. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed once again that it is necessary to 
firmly grasp the quintessence of emancipating the mind and 
seeking truth from facts and to study hard and have a thorough 
understanding of the world outlook and methodology of 
dialectical materialism and historical materialism contained in 
Comrade Xiaoping's works when we study his theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. He said: After we have 
adopted a correct stand, viewpoint, and method, it will be 
relatively easy for us to have a thorough and comprehensive 
understanding of the party's line, principles, policies, and 
various reform plans and prevent one-sidedness or absoluteness; 
to reach a consensus and reduce unnecessary disputes when we 
carry them out; and to encourage a pioneering and realistic 
spirit as well as a spirit to blaze new trails and to avoid 
subjectivism and blindness when we handle tasks. Having a 
thorough understanding of more materialist dialectics and 
reducing idealism and metaphysics through study is an important 
requirement for leading cadres at all levels. When studying 
historical materialism at present, we must place more emphases 
on the mass viewpoint of Marxism and on the party's mass line. 
It is necessary for us to adhere to the party's basic line, to 
implement the party's various principles and policies, to 
improve the work style of leadership, to successfully carry out 
various tasks, to remold our world outlook, and to enhance our 
ability to resist corruption and prevent peaceful evolution. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin called on party schools at all levels to 
further successfully implement the principle of integrating 
theory with practice. He said: Integrating theory with 
practice is a fine tradition, a fine work style, a good style of 
study, and a particularly strong point of our party. Persisting 
in integrating theory with practice is an important issue that 
must be solved when we strengthen and improve theoretical study 
and an important principle for us to successfully carry out our 
tasks. If we want to achieve a new breakthrough in promoting 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, we must work 
hard to make big progress in integrating theory with practice. 
At present, the problems of inadequate study of theory and 
losing contact with reality exist among our cadres; the issue of 
integrating theory with practice remains to be satisfactorily 
solved. If we want to strengthen and improve the work of party 
schools, to improve the quality of their education, and to 
enhance the level of their scientific research, fundamentally 
speaking, we must further successfully solve the issue of 
integrating theory with practice by proceeding from their 
characteristics. If we want to persist in integrating theory 
with practice, first of all, we must attach importance to 
studying theory well. It is extremely important for us to 
unswervingly adhere to the party's basic line for a hundred 
years. The party's basic line is established on the basis of 
scientific theory. Only by unswervingly upholding the party's 
basic theory can we unswervingly adhere to its basic line. The 
evolution of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics signals that the level of 
our party's theory has reached a new height. However, it does 
not mean that all party organizations and all party-member 
cadres automatically solve the problem of arming themselves with 
theory. A process of assiduous study is needed to fulfill the 
task. Persisting in using theory to guide practice is the 
fundamental purpose of our theoretical study. We must integrate 
our study of the party's basic theory with our party's history, 
with the reality of our work, and with the reality of our 
ideology; we must sum up experiences and lessons; and we must 
enhance our consciousness of correctly implementing the party's 
basic line in an all-around way and strengthen our resolve in 
this endeavor. 
  Jiang Zemin urged party committees at all levels to treat 
the work of educating cadres on the important status and role of 
party schools in the light of the overall strategic situation of 
socialist modernization and from the high plane of long-term 
peace and stability of the party and the state. Resolute 
efforts should be made to prevent and overcome such short-term 
behavior as paying attention to making use of personnel to the 
neglect of cultivating more talented persons. Due attention 
should be paid to the integration of the selection, use, and 
cultivation of cadres. He said: Over the past years, party 
schools at all levels have achieved great results in cultivating 
many leading cadres and talented personnel in theoretic fields. 
The current issue is that party schools should suit themselves 
to the new situation and enhance teaching quality. Party 
committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership and 
guide party schools to center around the work of the whole 
party, follow a correct orientation of running schools, and 
strive to conduct reform in depth. In line with their limits of 
authority in managing cadres, party committees at all levels 
should be responsible for carrying out the task of training 
cadres in rotation. They should promptly study and solve 
important problems in the work of party schools. Attention 
should be paid to replenishing and strengthening the leading 
groups and teaching staff of party schools so as to gradually 
improve conditions for running schools. 
  In conclusion, Jiang Zemin pointed out: At present, the 
whole 
party and the people across the country are striving to seize 
the opportunity, deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, 
promote economic development, and maintain stability. The new 
situation and tasks have put forward higher requirements for the 
work of party schools and, at the same time, provided a new 
motive force for running party schools better. It is hoped that 
comrades in party schools at all levels will have a better 
understanding of the situation, clearly define their tasks, 
enhance their sense of mission and responsibility, diligently 
study, and work in a thoroughgoing manner, and under the 
leadership of party committees at all levels, work hard to 
create a new situation in the work of party schools so as to 
promote the educational undertakings of party schools to a new 
level, and make new contributions to the great cause of 
vigorously carrying out the work of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics! 
  At today's discussion meeting, Wang Jialiu, vice executive 
president of the Central Party School, briefed on the situation 
of the national party school work conference. Zhang Guoying, 
deputy secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee; 
Liang Jinquan, deputy secretary of Yunnan Provincial CPC 
Committee; Xu Bingxi, vice executive president of the party 
school of the Shandong Provincial CPC Committee; and Du Guang, 
vice executive president of the party school of Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region spoke at the meeting. 
  Attending today's meeting were responsible comrades of 
relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee including Lu 
Feng, Hou Zongbin, Chen Zuolin, Xue Ju, Wang Weicheng, Zhao 
Zongnai, Xu Weicheng, Chen Fujin, Su Xing, Xing Bensi, and Zheng 
Keyang. 
  The meeting began on 4 March and ended today.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
today called on the State Council departments and governments at 
all levels to combine the anti-corruption struggle with the 
efforts of reform and development, handle properly the new 
contradictions, ease and eliminate hot social problems so as to 
create a stable social environment for reforms and opening up 
and promote a sustainable, fast and healthy development of the 
national economy. 
  The premier told a meeting in Beijing on the struggle 
against 
corruption and for a clean government that it is essential to 
handle well the relations between reforms and development on the 
one hand and stability on the other and strengthen leadership 
over the struggle against corruption and for a clean government. 
  He said that every Communist Party member and every 
government functionary must conscientiously subordinate all 
their work, including anti-corruption struggle, to the overall 
efforts of reform, development and stability. 
  The premier reviewed the achievements of the anti-corruption 
struggle, saying that it has boosted the confidence of the 
masses of the people and promoted reform, opening and social 
development and stability. 
  But he said that much remains to be desired by the people 
and 
what has been achieved has not been consolidated. He called on 
the governments at all levels to strengthen leadership and 
persist the struggle stage by stage and make it more fruitful. 
  He warned not to relax the anti-corruption efforts or stop 
where it is. 
  While making investigations into corruption cases, Li Peng 
said, emphasis should be made to investigate into and deal with 
major cases, which must be exposed without delay, irrespective 
of official rankings. 
  While carrying on with the anti-corruption struggle, Li 
said, 
it is necessary to perfect the systems, especially the legal 
system, in order to deal with the root cause of corruption. 
  He called on officials to carry forward the fine traditions 
of the party and perform their duties honestly and serve the 
people whole-heartedly. He urged them to study more and attend 
less social functions, carry out investigations and study, hear 
the voices of the people and do concrete things for them, 
improve their work efficiency and overcome bureaucracy, and take 
the overall situation into consideration in doing everything so 
as to ensure the smooth implementation of the reform measures to 
be produced this year. 
  Li concluded that the campaign against corruption and for a 
clean government is not an expedient measure, but a strategic 
step to maintain the country's long-term stability. 
  The meeting on the struggle against corruption and for a 
clean government was called by the State Council. Cao Qingze, 
minister of supervision, Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the 
State Economic and Trade Commission, and Liu Jibin, 
vice-minister of finance, reviewed the anti-corruption struggle 
and its achievements over the past year.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "China's Poverty Reduction Enters Crucial Stage"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Following its success 
in helping 120 million Chinese escape from poverty since 1978, 
China's poverty reduction now enters the most arduous stage. 
  According to a plan announced by the Chinese Government 
earlier this week, China is determined to wipe out abject 
poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing shortages 
for its now-remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens. 
  The ambitious plan is significant in the history both of the 
Chinese people and mankind, for the rights to subsistence of 
1.18 billion Chinese, which make up a quarter of the world 
population, will soon have this fundamental human right secured. 
  Most of the 80 million people, about the same number as the 
whole German population, live in remote mountain regions, rocky 
regions, Loess plateau areas and remote deserts. Their lives 
are disastrously affected by acute shortage of water and poor 
public transport services, which make agricultural production 
difficult, not to mention industrial development. 
  The per capita share of water in the poor areas is between a 
16th and a 24th of the world's average. Electricity, education 
and transport services are hardly available to most of the areas. 
  Compared with the poverty eased among about 45 million poor 
people during the 1986-1992 period, the remaining poverty facing 
80 million Chinese is much more difficult to wipe out than the 
steps taken by China in 1978-1985. 
  The population of the poor decreased from about 200 million 
in 1978 to 125 million in 1985, when China abolished the commune 
system and introduced the household contract responsibility 
system. The reform resulted in a sharp increase in grain output 
and farmers' incomes. 
  During the eight-year poverty-reduction drive since 1986, 
China earmarked about 30 billion yuan worth of grain, clothes 
and other consumer goods for poverty alleviation, and allocated 
about five billion yuan in aid or discount loans to help the 
poor areas. 
  For the next seven years, in comparison, China should do at 
least twice as much. It should help 11 million escape from 
poverty each year during the coming seven years, while, on 
average, only 6.4 million poor people did so each year in the 
past seven, by getting enough food and clothes. 
  Despite the difficulty, China has many positive factors in 
its fight against poverty, such as the growing government 
investment, the priority given by the central and local 
governments to social and economic development in the poor 
areas, and support given by all walks of life and the 
international organizations. 
  A recent government decision stipulates that when preparing 
national and regional budgets, a set sum of money should be used 
for poverty reduction by the central and local financial 
departments. 
  To beef up the poverty reduction drive, the central 
government also made a decision to increase its investment in 
the "work for food program" by one billion yuan each year before 
the end of this century, and also extend one billion yuan 
discount loans to the poor areas. 
  The investment in the program would total four billion yuan 
in 1994 and 1995, respectively. 
  China's opening of its developing inland areas, particularly 
the border areas, has promoted local businesses and benefited 
from their trade with their neighboring countries or other areas. 
  The booming Chinese economy also contributed greatly to 
poverty alleviation, offering many jobs to surplus laborers in 
the poor area. 
  About 10 million surplus farmers in China's most populous 
Sichuan Province were employed last year by businesses in and 
outside the province, who earned a total of 10 billion yuan. 
  Past practice shows that if a laborer from a poor rural 
family is hired by a business, the money earned by the laborer 
will enable the whole of his poor family to get enough food and 
clothes. 
  In addition, the poor areas, which are rich in resources, 
will earn much more money as China is reforming its commodity 
circulation and pricing systems, including a gradual lifting of 
its control over prices of raw materials and primary goods. 
  All these factors, together with other efforts, such as 
making water, power, education, public health and transport 
services available to the poor, will certainly ensure the 
realization of the plan to wipe out abject poverty in China.

into a staunch position of Marxism." Li Peng's message reads: 
"Make the study of theory on socialism with Chinese 
characteristics your lofty mission." Ding Guangen called CASS 
and said: "I hope CASS will firmly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line as guidance, comprehensively follow the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, emphasize the 
important task of `arming the people with scientific theory,' 
emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, take the actual 
situation into consideration, make the focal points stand out, 
and intensify study in the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as well as in important issues in the 
field of social sciences to better serve reform, opening up, and 
the modernization drive." Li Tieying said in his letter: "It is 
clear that China is now making greater efforts in reforming its 
economic and political systems and is stepping up the pace of 
modernization. Under the new situation, our tasks are very 
arduous and we are bound to meet a great deal of new problems. 
There are no existing experiences and answers ready for 
resolving these problems; we need to study and search them. The 
CPC, the state, and the people have placed great hopes on social 
sciences workers in this regard. We should firmly seize this 
historic opportunity; uphold Marxism as our guidance; better 
serve reform, opening up, and the construction of spiritual and

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Support Reform With a Clear-Cut </F>
Stand"] 
  [Text] Spring comes to the earth again and everything 
looks fresh and radiant. With life-giving spring breezes and 
rains, our great socialist motherland is full of life and energy. 
  This year is a vital one for China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive; a year significant to the people of all 
nationalities in their efforts to implement the spirit of the 
14th party congress and to put into practice all the 
"resolutions" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee. It is also the first year since China's 
economic structural reform entered a new phase of comprehensive 
promotion and specific breakthroughs. The adoption and 
implementation of the package of comprehensive reform measures 
will serve to alleviate many profound contradictions and 
problems that long have existed in China's national economy and 
that China always has wanted, but failed to resolve over the 
past many years. It also will give initial shape to a solid 
foundation for a socialist market economy structure. Therefore, 
it is our unshirkable responsibility to act in accordance with 
the arrangements of the party Central Committee, to support 
reform with a clear-cut stand, to unremittingly promote reform, 
and to enthusiastically plunge ourselves into reform. 
  To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we should regard 
reform as our own duty and be eager to meet the needs of reform. 
The energetic cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics 
is created by the billions of the masses themselves. The 
process of building a socialist market economy structure is, in 
essence, a process in which the masses of the people create 
history. Reform is a cause that relies on the masses and 
benefits the people. Every one of us is the master of reform. 
Taking reform as our own duty means that we need to fulfill 
tasks and duties as masters, regard difficulties in reform as 
our own difficulties, and share weal and woe with reform. 
Experience gained from reform and opening up over the past 15 
years has told us that the extensive support and participation, 
as well as the conscious creation of the masses of the people 
are the motive of the constant deepening of reform, and also a 
basic guarantee for success in reform. Without the support, the 
wisdom and strength, or the understanding of the masses, we can 
see no hope of success in our great cause. 
  Reform is an undertaking from which the people can benefit. 
To achieve its ultimate target, our party has adopted major 
measures, policies, and principles to suit the development needs 
of social productive forces, with the aim of bringing benefits 
to all the people. This is determined by the socialist nature 
of reform. However, we cannot but see that reform is a 
readjustment of the original interest structure, as well as a 
recombination of interest relations among the people. 
Therefore, during the implementation of a certain policy, it is 
unavoidable that the benefits enjoyed by the masses living in 
one location are different from those enjoyed by the masses 
living in another, that there still remain wide gaps between 
different regions, and that we have to sacrifice the interests 
of some for the time being. By no means can we lose sight of 
the glorious prospects of reform in favor of temporary 
interests, nor can we sacrifice the future for immediate 
interests. The shape and shift of things always should be taken 
with a broadness of view. Only when we integrate immediate 
interests with long-term ones, and partial interests with the 
interests of the whole can we always remain confident in reform. 
  To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we must safeguard 
the authority of the party Central Committee and the government, 
seek unity of understanding, and coordinate our actions. In a 
large country like ours with such a vast territory and such a 
large population, extensive and thoroughgoing revolutionary 
changes cannot succeed without correct theoretical guidance, 
powerful spiritual backing, or an authoritative and firm leading 
core. Having withstood the grim tests of complicated practice 
over the past couple of years, the leading collective of the 
party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, 
is a leading nucleus that can be trusted fully by the whole 
party and the people of all nationalities throughout the 
country. It is of particular significance in today's reform to 
firmly safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee, 
and to seek unity of understanding and action under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping said in as early as 1988: "To succeed in reform, we 
must carry out reform in an orderly way under a correct 
leadership. What can we achieve under a chaotic situation in 
which everyone goes his own way?"; "If the party Central 
Committee and State Council have no authority, the situation 
will get out of control"; "Macroeconomic management should be 
reflected by the authority of the central authorities." Comrade 
Jiang Zemin also stressed in his speech at the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee: "Party organizations 
at all levels should consciously place the interests of the 
party and country before everything else. They should subject 
partial interests to overall ones and immediate interests to 
long-term ones. They should take the overall situation into 
consideration, ensure the implementation of all policies and 
principles of the central authorities, and promote a high degree 
of unity within the whole party -- politically, 
organizationally, and practically." To safeguard the authority 
of the party Central Committee and the government, we should 
implement to the letter the principles, policies, and decisions 
of the party Central Committee and the State Council, and must 
never permit the existence of the practice whereby "the higher 
authorities draw up policies, while the grass-roots levels adopt 
countermeasures." It is imperative to put into effect all the 
orders and bans imposed by higher authorities, and no one will 
be allowed to continue banned practices in disregard of repeated 
prohibitions. Some leading cadres, on the one hand, are 
extremely enthusiastic in starting new projects; competing with 
each other to attain a higher speed; and go in for ostentation, 
extravagance, and high consumption. On the other hand, they 
show little interest in improving economic efficiency; 
practicing thrifty; putting an end to deficits and increasing 
profits; strengthening management; or concerning themselves over 
market development, commodity prices, and the livelihood of the 
masses. On seeing this, one will find it hard to convince 
oneself that these leading cadres really are doing their bit to 
safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee. 
  To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we need to make 
active explorations and have the courage to carry out practice. 
The establishment of a socialist market economy structure is, 
in the final analysis, an issue of practice. We need to engage 
ourselves in practice if we wish to overcome difficulties and 
resolve problems. We need to study policies, work out measures, 
sum up experience, and distinguish right from wrong. We should 
take note of the fact that in carrying out major reforms this 
year in such sectors as finance and taxation, the monetary [jin 
rong 6855 5816] industry, investment, and commodity prices, we 
have gained experience in certain fields, yet we still know very 
little about others. Facing things totally new to us, we should 
draw up plans carefully and have the courage to put them into 
practice, just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "Once we 
determine the direction, we need to have the courage to 
experiment and to open up new paths." Without the courage to 
open up new paths or the spirit to carry out practice, we can 
never take a correct new road, accomplish new undertakings, or 
bring about the stable progress of reform. 
  At present, we are faced with a favorable historic 
opportunity to carry out reform and promote development. We now 
are enjoying sound natural conditions, topographical advantages, 
and unity and coordination within our own ranks. Under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the 
party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, 
let us unswervingly carry out the party's basic line, firmly 
seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform and expand opening 
up, bring about greater development, maintain and stabilize the 
overall situation, and strive for new victories in the socialist 
modernization drive!

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese legislators 
favor tough punishment for organizers of illegal emigration and 
border crossing. 
  The proposed penalties include life imprisonment or a death 
sentence for "snake heads," as the mercenaries engaged in the 
traffic have been dubbed. 
  The members of the standing committee of the Eighth National 
People's Congress (NPC) were today deliberating a draft 
supplementary decision on the punishment of organizers of 
illegal emigration and border crossing. 
  The lawmakers said the draft decision is ready to be 
promulgated in the current fifth session of the NPC Standing 
Committee. 
  Such a decision is expected to help the country in combating 
illegal emigration and border crossing, to maintain border order 
and protect the legitimate rights of Overseas Chinese, according 
to the lawmakers. 
  The draft said that snake-heads could face life imprisonment 
or the death penalty if they committed other serious crimes 
against emigrants they organized. 
  Lin Liyun, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that 
some snake-heads become involved in crimes of violence, murder, 
drug trafficking and selling human beings. 
  "Life of overseas Chinese are disturbed by the crimes and 
their legitimate rights infringed upon because of the 
influence," Lin said. 
  Member of the NPC Standing Committee Cai Cheng said the 
decision was necessary to curb the illegal border crossing and 
illegal emigration along China's vast border areas, and is 
conducive to stability in border areas and the nation's security.

<F P=106> [By Gong Xinwen (7895 6580 2429): "Public Security Organs </F>
Cracked 1.21 Million Criminal Cases Last Year"] 
  [Text] The media spokesman for the Ministry of Public 
Security disclosed that in 1993, public security organs across 
the country received 1.617 million reports of various kinds of 
criminal cases, a 2.2-percent increase over 1992, and that the 
rising tendency of criminal cases has been kept under control. 
Last year, public security organs cracked a total of 1.21 
million criminal cases which occurred in the current year, a 
12.3-percent increase over 1992, and cracked some 290,000 cases 
which occurred in the previous year. Their ability to crack 
criminal cases has obviously improved and efforts against 
criminal activities have been stepped up. 
  Of the 1.617 million criminal reports received by public 
security organs across the country in 1993, 539,000 were very 
serious cases, an 18-percent increase over 1992. 
  At present, public security problems in a few cities and 
counties are comparatively salient and the masses there have 
reacted strongly to this. The Ministry of Public Security has 
already urged public security organs in all localities to step 
up blows and to mainly straighten out order in a few areas where 
public security problems are salient.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to the State 
Nationalities Affairs Commission, China has achieved remarkable 
success in training and selecting minority cadres, and also, the 
nation's policies and rules in this regard have further improved. 
  The CPC and the state always attach great importance to 
minority cadres affairs, and they always consider forming a 
large contingent of ethical and capable minority cadres to be a 
major policy for people of all nationalities to achieve 
equality, unity, progress, and common prosperity. Thanks to the 
efforts made by party committees and governments at all levels 
as well as by relevant departments over the past four decades, 
the number of minority cadres has increased from 10,000 or so in 
1950 to more than 2.28 million today, including large numbers of 
party workers, administrators, economic workers, scientists, 
technicians, cultural workers, educators, and health workers. 
Many minority cadres have assumed leading posts and are playing 
leading roles in minority regions' political, economic, and 
social development. 
  As reform and opening up continue to proceed, minority 
regions have also taken effective measures for training, 
selecting, and appointing minority cadres, and the valuable 
experiences they have gained have enhanced the work of bringing 
up minority cadres. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been 
training minority cadres while carrying out reforms and opening 
up to the outside world. Under a cadres exchange program, the 
region has adopted all kinds of measures -- such as rotating 
minority cadres at different posts, retraining incumbent cadres, 
sending outstanding college students to work at grass-roots 
units, providing counterpart support, exchanging cadres with 
different areas, and appointing cadres to work in developed 
provinces and regions -- to improve minority cadres' competence 
so that they can mature and become more proficient during the 
course of their training. Meanwhile, Xinjiang has hired experts 
to teach management and technology, to carry out scientific 
research, to take part in academic exchanges, and to help set up 
plants and mines in the region. Today all prefectures and 
counties in Xinjiang have launched similar cooperative projects, 
and the results that some have achieved are remarkable. Many 
minority cadres have become business directors and managers or 
persons in charge of science and technology projects. 
  Tibet's programs for training minority cadres give priority 
to five categories: 1) To people of minority nationalities 
while selecting trainees. Since 1980, Tibet has trained 27,363 
minority cadres of various categories and at various levels -- 
or 72.75 percent of the total number of cadres who have been 
trained -- through various channels. 2) To county- and 
higher-level leading cadres. 3) To intensive, short-term 
training for minority cadres. 4) To training local cadres 
through channels linking Tibet with other parts of the country. 
Tibet has a program for each year sending minority cadres to 
other parts of the country for advanced studies. 5) To training 
courses which are of practical use. 
  While striving to build strong ranks of minority cadres, 
minority autonomous regions also pay great attention to 
combining training programs with the need to exercise autonomy. 
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has stated that training 
and selecting minority cadres must be underscored in projects 
for training, recommending, and evaluating the performance of 
cadres; reorganizing or reelecting leading groups; or drawing up 
policies and regulations for cadres. The region also has stated 
that such affairs must be organically integrated with the 
exercising of regional autonomy. The region has also stressed 
that the number of minority cadres must account for a proper 
percentage in the region, and that the number of Mongolian 
cadres and cadres of the Han and other nationalities -- 
especially leading cadres -- must account for a proper 
percentage of cadres in leading organs so that the number of 
minority cadres can be proportionally in line with the minority 
population as well as with the regulations of the "Law on the 
Regional Autonomy of Minority Nationalities." In light of this 
law, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has done as much as 
possible so that cadres of all nationalities, while increasing 
in number, will become more competent in handling political 
affairs and in involving themselves in scientific and cultural 
projects. The region has made it a policy that there should be 
no arbitrary uniformity in training and in selecting minority 
cadres, that preferential treatment must be given to people of 
minority nationalities who have few cadres, and that 
consideration should be given to past and present circumstances 
and the situation of people of other nationalities. 
  While training and selecting minority cadres, all regions 
also stress the need to foster the concept of viewing cadres 
affairs as a whole. Guangxi emphasizes that cadres of the Han 
and minority nationalities must respect each other, learn from 
one another, and assist one another. All autonomous regions 
have promoted the unity between people of all nationalities by 
emphasizing the view that people of the Han nationality and 
people of minority nationalities need one another.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Mei Hongru (2734 3163 1172) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- The People's Liberation 
Army [PLA] General Logistics Department, the Finance Ministry, 
the Ministry of Internal Trade, and the State Grain Reserve 
Bureau jointly convened the Eighth National Army Provisions Work 
Conference today to study reform of the Army provisions supply 
system. 
  Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier of the State Council; and Fu Quanyou, 
member of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and director of 
the General Logistics Department; met with representatives to 
the conference. Li Lanqing said: The party Central Committee, 
the State Council, and the CMC have shown concern for and 
attached great importance to the supply of Army provisions, 
which is an important basic task guaranteeing the Army's 
modernization and regularization. Jiang Zemin, CPC Central 
Committee general secretary and CMC chairman, has made important 
instructions on Army provisions work many times. All localities 
and departments have long conscientiously implemented the 
instructions of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council. They have coordinated with one another in doing 
everything possible to ensure the supply, to improve the 
quality, to adjust the variety, and to increase financial 
subsidies for Army provisions, thereby raising the standard of 
Army provisions supply and winning the appreciation of PLA and 
Armed Police officers and men. 
  Li Lanqing emphasized: Army provisions supply is a serious 
political task. Ensuring the supply of Army provisions is of 
great significance to stabilizing and developing Army building 
and guaranteeing national security. Governments at all levels 
and all departments concerned should, as always, do a good job 
in ensuring the variety, quality, quantity, and timeliness of 
Army provisions supply. 
  In his speech, Bai Meiqing, vice minister of internal trade 
and director of the State Grain Reserve Bureau, emphasized the 
necessity of reforming the Army provisions supply system. He 
said: Reform of the Army provisions supply system will begin in 
April this year. Specific points of the reform are as follows: 
The existing method of procuring grains at the state fixed 
price shall be replaced by procurement at negotiated prices and 
supply to Army units at the fixed price. Subsidies for price 
differentials in grains, edible oil, and soybeans supplied to 
the Army shall be shared by both central and provincial-level 
financial resources. Financial affairs related to Army 
provisions shall be managed under special projects, special 
accounts, and special bookkeeping; and funds related to Army 
provisions shall be delivered collectively to the 
provincial-level finance departments for management. After the 
introduction of the reform, state-owned grain enterprises shall 
continue to be responsible for Army provisions supply. Grain 
departments shall be the functioning departments of Army 
provisions supply; and, Army grain supply stations (stores or 
depots) set up by grain departments in various localities shall 
be the special outlets of Army provisions supply. Grain 
departments shall be responsible for arranging and ensuring the 
supply of grains, edible oil, and other provisions for the Army.

Decision of Ministry of Finance, State Land Administration, and 
PLA General Logistics Department, Army Will Transfer Land Use 
Rights According to Law"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Finance, the State Land 
Administration, and the PLA General Logistics Department 
recently issued a joint "Circular on Issues Concerning Transfer 
of Surplus Military Land-Use Rights by the Army With 
Compensation." According to the circular, surplus military land 
must be developed in a planned way and under organized 
leadership. The army units which transfer their surplus 
military land must, as required by the relevant state 
regulations, register with the local land administration 
department at the county level and above for the change in the 
land-use right, so that they will be exempted from paying 
charges for transferring land. The proceeds from transferring 
and leasing surplus military land are collected by the General 
Logistics Department and then put into a special account and 
only used as designated. The "Circular" also provides that the 
state will not require the land users to donate to the budget 
adjustment fund and the fund for key construction projects 
including energy and transportation.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Fang Yuen (2488 0337): "Faced </F>
With Numerous Difficulties Combating Corruption, Central 
Military Commission Will Strengthen Leading Body"] 
  [Text] Due to differences of opinion on the anticorruption 
struggle inside the Chinese Army, the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] is beset with great difficulties and faced with great 
resistance in unfolding the anticorruption struggle, according 
to a well-informed source in Beijing. News spread that, taking 
into consideration of the fact that the average age of the 
current leadership tier of the Central Military Commission [CMC] 
is on the high side, its leading body will be readjusted and 
strengthened within this year, with one or two vice chairmen 
added and its secretary general's office restored. Because of 
a shortage of funds, with the silent consent of the Central 
Committee, from the top down, the Chinese Army from the General 
Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, and the 
General Logistics Department down to army units at regimental 
and battalion level, have all engaged in construction projects 
and business one after another in a wide range of diversified 
business including weapons exports, munitions, and karaoke, 
which have involved all of the armed services and which form a 
huge economic power, while establishing complicated relations 
with local warlord economies [di fang zhu hou jing ji 0966 2455 
6175 0186 4842 3444]. 
  It was disclosed that when China augmented macroeconomic 
readjustment and control and rectified the banking order last 
year, funds from many localities acquired from loans obtained in 
violation of rules and regulations actually went to army-run 
enterprises, and their recovery is impossible. At that time, a 
vice premier in charge of the economy required the CMC to go out 
and help recover those funds. A responsible person from the CMC 
ridiculed this, saying "money should be contributed" (referring 
to an increase in the military expenditure allotment) before the 
funds were recovered. 
  When the nationwide anticorruption struggle started last 
year, the CPC top echelon accepted suggestions from scholars and 
experts to strictly restrict Army businesses, while abolishing 
such practices step by step on the one hand and increasing 
military expenditure on the other, with large pay increases for 
officers and men effective 1 January. However, the 
implementation of this policy met with resistance in all of the 
services, arms of the services, and major military regions of 
the whole Army; consequently, the anticorruption struggle inside 
the Army came to a halt, whereas all sorts of Army-run companies 
continued to do big business, and the law-breaking activities of 
some Army units, such as smuggling and tax evasion, have 
continued despite repeated bans. 
  For this reason, the CMC called a work conference on 
discipline inspection for the whole Army not long ago. At the 
conference, Liu Huaqing, member of the Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and concurrently vice 
chairman of the CMC, stated with unprecedentedly fierce and 
stern words that senior military cadres should acquire a concept 
of the overall situation and should strictly abide by political 
discipline. On all matters, instructions from the Central 
Committee and the CMC should be resolutely implemented; as for 
activities that are banned with explicit orders, they should be 
avoided absolutely; and for those matters covered by 
institutional stipulations, they should be faithfully carried 
out accordingly. 
  In addition, Liu Huaqing called on senior cadres of the 
whole 
Army to "genuinely maintain unanimity with the Central Committee 
politically, ideologically, and in actions." To make such a 
call to the most reliable PLA is rare in the history of the CPC. 
  Aside from the reaction of some special interest groups that 
have been shaped inside the Army, that the current leadership 
tier of the CMC is short of authority accounts for the great 
difficulties in unfolding the anticorruption struggle inside the 
Army; furthermore, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, the current vice 
chairmen of the CMC, are over 75 years of age. In view of this, 
the CPC top echelon is planning to "readjust the top-echelon 
leadership of the CMC, adding one or two vice chairmen and 
restoring the office of secretary general." It was disclosed 
that Chi Haotian, a member of the CMC and concurrently defense 
minister, is likely to become a vice chairman of the CMC vice 
chairman in addition to its secretary general's office. The 
65-year-old Chi Haotian falls in the category of an officer of 
the new generation, a typical professional soldier who has fine 
relations with both old generals and junior officers. Another 
source holds that there is presently a force inside the military 
calling for the return of Yang Baibing, former secretary general 
of the CMC and concurrently director of the PLA General 
Political Department. Whether or not such voices lead to the 
return of the "Yangs" [Yang Shangkun and Yang Baibing] will be a 
focus of attention in Chinese politics in the days to come.

2455): "The Hudong Shipyard: The `Cradle' of Corvettes"] 
  [Text] The Hudong Shipyard and the naval representatives 
office in the shipyard have worked hard together over the last 
30 years. They have manufactured six different models of 
corvettes, and 95 percent of the corvettes now in service were 
manufactured by this shipyard. Therefore, the shipyard is 
called the "cradle" of Chinese corvettes. 
  Corvettes are the main vessels a naval unit uses in combat. 
Since its production of the first Chinese-made corvette in the 
early 1970's, the Hudong Shipyard and the naval representatives 
office have jointly created 14 top products including totally 
enclosed [quan feng bi 0356 1409 7028] corvettes, new types of 
propellers, and vessels for helicopters to land on. Central 
Military Commission leaders praised the shipyard for these 
achievements. The tactical [zhan shu 2069 2611] and technical 
functions of Chinese-designed and Chinese-made corvettes have 
stood the tests of major activities including sea combat, 
sailing to the South Pacific, and visiting three South Asian 
countries, leaving their tracks in the Pacific and Atlantic 
Oceans. 
  "Providing top-quality naval vessels for the party and the 
people and qualified combat effectiveness for the armed forces" 
has been the pursuit of the Hudong Shipyard's cadres and 
workers, as well as naval representatives in the shipyard. They 
are very meticulous about their work: After carefully welding 
thousands of steel plates on a naval vessel, they use magnifying 
glasses, X-rays, and supersonic equipment for double checks. 
Cables on a vessel are generally dozens of kilometers long and 
of more than 100 sizes. Military engineers in the shipyard 
conduct repeated checks on each joint and rivet and test the 
land and maritime functions of each weapon and equipment. In 
the last 30 years they have discovered and handled more than 
2,000 quality problems. As a result, over 95 percent of their 
military products are up to standard. The corvettes they have 
produced have won 13 gold and silver prizes from the state. 
  A corvette is a science city on the sea. The Hudong Shipyard 
and the naval representatives office have always focused their 
attention on the world's advanced shipbuilding technology and 
brought about a higher level of combat effectiveness by means of 
science and technology. They have established relations of 
technological mutual assistance with more than 30 scientific 
research institutions and applied some 30 high-tech projects 
including laser, electronics, remote sensing, ultraviolet rays, 
and simulation to the manufacture of modernized naval vessels. 
In the meantime, they have used more than 1,000 scientific 
renovation achievements to improve the functions of equipment.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Concentrate Efforts on Probing </F>
Ways of Leading Troops in New Situation--Second discussion on 
Strengthening and Improving Troop Management." For the first 
discussion in this series, see page 52 of the 3 March China 
DAILY REPORT.] 
  [Text] Leading troops is a kind of learning experience 
involving wide and expert knowledge. Militarists of the past 
and present have done a lot of expositions on management of 
armies and troops. In generalizing the four major functions of 
commanders-- leading, maintaining, training, and using 
troops--Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older 
generation explicitly put forward the idea of "putting leading 
troops in the first place." This shows that leading troops is 
fundamental and essential and sometimes racks the brains more 
than using troops. In the new situation today, it is all the 
more necessary and pressing to put consummate skill at leading 
troops into management practice of the armed forces. In a 
certain sense, making efforts to study the new constantly 
developing and changing situations the armed forces are faced 
with and studying with concentration how to lead troops in 
keeping with the new situation are points at which to make a 
breakthrough in strengthening and improving troop management at 
present. 
  A correct understanding of the new situation the armed 
forces 
face is the prerequisite for the study and exploration of how to 
lead troops in the new period. We should see that further 
reform and opening up and the acceleration of establishment of 
the socialist market economy structure have provided many 
favorable conditions for the building of the armed forces and 
have also set new and even higher demands on the management of 
the armed forces. For example, the composition, concept of 
value, and the changes and improvements of the cultural quality, 
of officers and soldiers have set new standards for leading 
troops in a scientific manner; the changes in the social 
environment where the troops are garrisoned have an impact on 
the traditional mode of management of the armed forces; and with 
the growth of national strength and the constant updating of 
weapons and equipment, many new tasks have cropped up the 
management of the armed forces. All this needs great enthusiasm 
and efforts to study and explore. In the new situation, it will 
not do to one-sidedly exaggerate some negative factors and to 
attempt nothing and accomplish nothing, and we should adopt an 
attitude of making full use of favorable factors to educate and 
manage the armed forces, skillfully changing negative factors 
into positive factors, and skillfully summing up the laws of 
activities in practice in order to lead the troops better. 
  To explore how to lead troops in the new situation, we must 
further emancipate our minds, be courageous in conducting 
reform, and grope new paths and create new ways in practice. 
With the prerequisite of contributing to increasing combat 
effectiveness, maintaining a high degree of stability, 
centralization, and unity, and strengthening the adhesive force 
of the armed forces and of contributing to maintaining the good 
relationship between officers and soldiers, we should be 
courageous and good at learning from, and making use as 
reference, all advanced and useful experience and methods of 
management in China and abroad and within and outside the armed 
forces in a bid to strengthen and improve management work of our 
armed forces. 
  Exploring ways of leading troops in the new situation is not 
contradictory to inheriting and carrying forward the glorious 
traditions of our armed forces in managing and leading troops, 
and we should never set the two against each other. A whole set 
of fine traditions characteristics of the people's armed forces 
formed in over a long period of practice in managing of troops 
remain to be magic weapons in managing and leading troops in the 
new period. Recently, Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed: It is 
necessary to properly study new things cropped up in the 
relationship between officers and men in the new situation, 
carry forward the fine tradition of respecting officers and 
cherishing soldiers and unity between officers and men, and form 
a close and good relationship of mutual care and mutual help 
between officers and men. This is the essence of the traditions 
of leading troops of our armed forces and is the fundamental 
attitude which the new generation of troop leaders must adopt. 
Only if we, while carrying forward fine traditions, explore new 
ways of leading troops in accordance with the constantly 
developing new situation can we deal with changes through making 
changes, handle matters with facility, and raise the management 
of the armed forces to a high level. 
  If a qualified commander, a commander in war, can adapt 
himself to changing conditions, and make successful offensive 
and defensive, he of course should be praised. Likewise, if, in 
times of peace, a commander can skillfully manage the armed 
forces under various conditions, has good ways of leading troops 
so that the troops can always maintain a high combat 
effectiveness, his contribution should not be left unrecognized. 
Today, before a series of new situations and new tasks, troop 
leaders at all level are required to go all out to explore the 
art of leading troops to keep abreast of the new situation, to 
display their talent in the vast field of troop management, and 
to render meritorious services in their sacred posts of leading 
troops!

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "What Is Important Is to Improve </F>
the Quality of Troop Leaders--Third Discussion on Strengthening 
and Improving Troop Management"] 
  [Text] To strengthen and improve the management of the 
armed forces in the new situation, it is necessary to study new 
circumstances and solve new problems, and it is even more 
necessary to improve the quality of troop leaders. 
  Proceeding from improving the quality of troop leaders and 
strengthening management of the armed forces in the new period 
form the new situation in the building of the armed forces and 
the objective demand of the building of the contingent of 
cadres. Cadres at all levels, grass-roots cadres in particular, 
are leaders of management of the armed forces and people who 
carry out practical work in this respect. If cadres lack 
dedication, do not have a strong sense of responsibility, are 
not willing to do management work, or do not know how to carry 
out management work because their management ability cannot meet 
the needs of the new situation, it will not be possible to 
properly carry out various kinds of management work. Leaders 
and leading organs at all levels must earnestly make greater 
efforts to adopt effective measures to improve the quality of 
troop leaders. 
  To strengthen ideological education of troop leaders, to 
deepen the dedication and the sense of responsibility of troop 
leaders in building the armed forces, and to encourage cadre 
willingness to carry out management work are basic engineering 
steps to improve the quality of troop leaders. Viewed from the 
present situation of the armed forces, both the problems of 
cadres not being willing to manage and cadres not knowing how to 
manage exist, but the former is the major one. Therefore, it is 
necessary to carry out powerful ideological education in light 
of the actual ideological problems of cadres. It is necessary 
for cadres to take a correct attitude toward the soldiers, 
establish the concept of cherishing and understanding soldiers 
with great enthusiasm, show concern and care for soldiers, 
understand and respect soldiers, and become close friends with 
solders, thus acquiring the qualifications for leading troops. 
It is necessary to proceed from the nature and purpose of the 
armed forces and and from education on function, and to arouse 
the sense of mission and the spirit of dedication among cadres 
so they will fulfill their duties and do a good job in managing 
the armed forces. On the other hand, leaders and leading organs 
at all levels should show concern for cadres and energetically 
solve practical problems for cadres, particularly practical 
problems of grass-roots cadres. All reasonable requests and 
problems which can be granted or solved should be 
enthusiastically and actively granted or solved in order to 
create conditions for cadres to wholeheartedly manage the armed 
forces. We should believe that all our cadres, directly 
nurtured by the party and the armed forces, have grown to 
maturity and they have deep feelings toward the armed forces. 
Only if thorough and meticulous ideological work is carried 
out, as many practical problems are solved as possible, and 
cadres are used in a fair and rational manner, the enthusiasm of 
cadres can be aroused and the problem of being not willing to 
manage can also be gradually solved. 
  The issue of not knowing how to manage is also important in 
improving the quality of troop leaders. At present, management 
of the armed forces is faced with many new tasks. It is 
necessary to guide cadres to strengthen study and exploration of 
these tasks in light of changes and characteristics of soldiers 
in the new period, grasp objective laws, integrate development 
of the fine traditions of the armed forces with modern 
management, and constantly improve methods for leading troops. 
The leadership at all levels should do a good job in training 
grass-roots cadres at their posts in a planned manner, 
organizing cadres to study the good traditions of management of 
the armed forces, acquiring knowledge and study methods of 
modern management, and, in light of the difficulties and major 
problems in management of the armed forces, exploring measures 
to deal with them, summing up experience, and improving the 
ability of leading troops in the new period. 
  "What is important is that cadres should identify themselves 
with soldiers." Setting examples for soldiers and influencing 
and inspiring them by exemplary acts are indispensable qualities 
of troop leaders. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "If 
a company commander or a political instructor cannot set a good 
example, he cannot bring up good soldiers; and if a leading 
cadre cannot set a good example, he cannot establish good common 
practice or enhance combat effectiveness." If cadres at all 
levels can set an example in taking the lead in observing rules, 
regulations, and discipline, in being the first to charge at the 
enemy and the first to bear hardship, and in taking the lead in 
fairly and honestly fulfilling their official duties, the entire 
armed forces will, guided by "noiseless orders," regularly and 
in an orderly manner carry out various kind of work under new 
historical conditions.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Concentrate Efforts on Regular </F>
Activity--Fourth Discussion on Strengthening and Improving Troop 
Management"] 
  [Text] The key link and most difficult aspect of army 
management lies in regular operation. In order to strengthen 
and improve army management in the new period, it is necessary 
to devote much effort to regular operation. 
  Regular management is the long-term, fundamental task for 
army building. Massive, concrete, and extensive regular 
management can be seen everywhere and every day. It is carried 
out according to existing rules, regulations, ordinances, and 
systems, to meet the needs of the army regarding daily war 
preparations, military training, army operation, the soldiers' 
daily life, and all other duties. So long as a good job is done 
in this regard, we will be able to implement all rules, 
ordinances, and regulations down to every unit, every member of 
the army, and every specific task, thus ensuring the successful 
completion of all tasks with military training as the core. 
  Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly 
handling the relationship between shock operations and regular 
jobs. It is necessary to carry out intensive rectification of 
discipline and work style to cope with some specific prominent 
problems in respect of troop management during a certain period. 
However, such intensive operations cannot replace regular 
management. For instance, the cultivation of discipline and 
work style of the army, the fostering of servicemen's fine 
qualities, and establishment of regular order in work and 
everyday life cannot be achieved overnight or through a couple 
of shock operations. Even if some longstanding, knotty problems 
can be resolved through shock operations, regular efforts are 
still necessary to ensure that such problems will not arise 
again. By the way, many problems regarding army management may 
not be very serious at the outset, and they can be readily 
resolved at this initial stage by moderate or precautionary 
measures. However, if such problems are left unattended at 
first, and shock operations are only launched just before 
accumulative effects are about to cause a catastrophe, then the 
development of the army will have been more seriously impaired. 
  Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly 
handling the relationship between management and education, and 
persistently carrying out regular management and ideological 
education. The nature and goal of our army determine that 
strict management must be based on persuasion, education, 
enlightenment, and initiative. This is one of our army's fine 
traditions and one of our basic principles for army management. 
To uphold this principle, we must, as far as management is 
concerned, start from ideological education, making our officers 
and fighters not only understand what they should do but also 
why they should do it that way, thus enhancing their sense of 
obedience to management. To uphold this principle, officers who 
are in command must be aware of what fighters are thinking 
about, and strengthen management to cope with specific problems 
to fulfill the objective of strict management. Practice has 
proved that extensively launching the drive of "four knowing's 
and one catching up with" [si ge zhi dao yi ge gen shang 0934 
0020 4249 6670 0001 0020 6418 0006] and that of "four reports 
and one reliance" [si ge bao gao yi ge yi kao 0934 0020 1032 
0707 0001 0020 0181 7237] could be an effective approach to 
ensuring the perfect integration and sure implementation of 
regular management and ideological work. Our leading people and 
organs at all levels must give better guidance to ensure that 
these drives will be carried out in a deep-going and 
down-to-earth manner within all the army. 
  Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly 
handling the relationship between specific duties and 
management. Our army's regular management can by no means be 
separated from its various missions with military training as 
the core. Without effective management, the army can hardly 
complete any tasks; but without the tasks the army is 
undertaking, management will become meaningless. Regular 
management must apply to every specific task, and all kinds of 
military officers at all levels must do a good job in management 
with a view to accomplishing all the tasks. Only in this way 
will we be able to give full play to the role of management work 
in safeguarding the smooth operation of the army and the 
completion of all tasks. Only by applying management to all 
specific tasks will we be able to do away with, once for all, 
inconsistency in management performance, and thus ensure that 
fighters will perform equally well on and off the drill ground, 
both in the presence and absence of leading officers, and both 
during and after inspection periods. So we will be able to 
constantly improve the overall management efficiency. 
  Massive, concrete, and extensive management operations are 
the most prominent characteristics of regular management. This 
determines that our officers in command must keep an 
industrious, meticulous, and down-to-earth work style. Being 
industrious means to be industrious in thinking, in going around 
to keep in touch with and talk with the fighters, to inspect 
work frequently, and to be ready to discover and solve problems 
at any time. Being meticulous means to always keep general 
interests in mind when organizing and carrying out management 
work and doing a meticulous job when dealing with specific 
tasks. Working in a down-to-earth manner means taking an honest 
attitude and doing practical work with regard to management, 
doing a solid job in ensuring implementation of orders, 
preventing formalism, and opposing trickery and deception. In 
this way, we will be able to keep up our good, efficient job in 
regular management of the army.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Take the Path of Comprehensive </F>
Management--Fifth Discussion on Strengthening and Improving 
Troop Management"] 
  [Text] In recent years, the armed forces as a whole from 
top to bottom have been making explorations of how to improve 
management of troops under the new situation and have acquired a 
lot of fresh successful experience. From their own experience 
many units have found it necessary to take the path of 
comprehensive management. 
  So-called comprehensive management means that under the 
unified leadership of party committees at all levels, the staff, 
political, logistics, and technical departments of military 
units cooperate closely; military, political, logistics, and 
technical officers make joint efforts to conduct management; 
work in the fields of education, training, management, and 
logistics guarantees is combined closely; and ideological, 
administrative, legal, and material means are used 
comprehensively to exercise across-the-board management over all 
troops at all times. Troop management and education should also 
be conducted jointly by military units, local governments, and 
families of soldiers by various available means in order to 
establish a systematic management network. Thus, advantages of 
all quarters may complement each other and achieve comprehensive 
management results. 
  Comprehensive management embodies the principle of 
materialist dialectics and reflects the internal regularity of 
troop management under the new historical conditions. For a 
long time in the past, many comrades just regarded troop 
management as a matter concerning the management of internal 
affairs of troops, such as keeping barracks clean, performing 
formation drills, and maintaining required standards for 
appearance and bearing, and regarded this as the tasks of a 
certain department. This caused some artificial limitations in 
management work. We admit that an important aspect of troop 
management is related to organization of the troops' daily lives 
and duties, the coordination of internal relations, and the 
maintenance of the internal order. It is the foundation for 
troop management in all aspects, but it is not the whole of 
management work. In fact, many problems in troop management are 
not just administrative problems; instead, they were caused by 
comprehensive factors and could not be properly solved if only 
one department was responsible for handling them. Practice 
shows that management work is related to a wide-range of 
affairs, comprehensive factors, and day-to-day work in various 
aspects. Comprehensive management is suited to these 
characteristics of management work and may ensure that troop 
management is conducted regularly and scientifically. 
  The key to proper conduct of comprehensive management lies 
in 
unifying thinking and strengthening leadership. In the final 
analysis, comprehensive management needs the mobilization and 
participation of forces in all aspects. All officers and men, 
no matter what rank they hold, should take troop management as 
their own task. Military units should warmly consult local 
governments and families of soldiers and solicit their help 
within the scope of their ability. In this regard, if people's 
thinking is unified, then a solid ideological foundation will 
exist for comprehensive management. Being a systems project, 
comprehensive management requires strong leadership to exercise 
organization and coordination. Party committees at all levels 
must take this work as a major matter concerning the 
consolidation of troops in all aspects, and should include it in 
their work schedules, regularly studying it, settling problems 
in good time, and coordinating the work of all departments. As 
long as party committees effectively and properly coordinate 
everything, a new situation will certainly appear in troop 
management. 
  Chairman Jiang pointed out when talking with cadets of the 
National Defense University that it is necessary to strictly 
enforce troop discipline, strengthen troop management, and 
effectively manage the troops well. Leaders and departments at 
all levels and cadres of all sorts should work for the aim of 
enhancing combat effectiveness, concentrate on troop 
construction and troop management, take the initiative in 
studying management skills, make efforts to improve management, 
and take the path of comprehensive management in order to raise 
the work of troop management to a new stage as quickly as 
possible.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 6 (XINHUA) -- Over 110,000 township 
enterprises in East China's Jiangsu Province have shown their 
strength on home and world markets. 
  The gross value of industrial output made by the township 
enterprises in 1993 topped 400 billion yuan, a hefty 58 percent 
rise from 1992, accounting for 60 percent of the province's 
total. 
  At the same time, about 80 percent of the province's workers 
and staff, about 7.3 million people, are in township enterprises. 
  Half of the counties and cities in south Jiangsu gained 20 
billion yuan each from township industrial output value, thus 
forming a key industrial area in the country. 
  In addition, the township sector has also played an 
important 
part in the province's foreign economic trade. 
  There are over 10,000 township enterprises which have 
economic ties with foreign counterparts. The total foreign 
investment in these local companies in 1993 hit 7 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  The gross exports of the township sector last year reached 
more than 56 billion yuan, about 30 percent of the country's 
total. 
  To boost the booming township industrial sector, the 
province 
has earmarked billions to purchase new advanced equipment and 
technology and to renovate old equipment for township 
enterprises. 
  In Wuxi, in southern Jiangsu, each of the companies with an 
annual production output of more than 50 million yuan has 
established its own research institute. 
  In 1993, a shareholding system was introduced in township 
enterprises to further improve company management and economic 
returns. 
  Farmers for the first time became company shareholders. 
  So far, over one billion yuan has been raised through the 
joint stock mode by some 10,000 such township companies in the 
province. 
  And more than 110 township group companies, each with fixed 
assets of over 50 million yuan, have been organized in the 
province. 
  A fast growth of the township sector also has brought about 
a 
social change in rural areas. 
  Also in Wuxi city, the average per capita GDP [gross 
domestic 
product] in 1993 surpassed 10,000 yuan, and the average income 
of the farmers also reached 2,240 yuan.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's Pudong new 
area has seen the building of a large manufacturer which 
produces compressors for air-conditioners within one year, 
whereas such a project usually takes 830 days. 
  Before this, the area had already set records for 
constructing a 24-km highway within a year and two world-level 
bridges within five years. 
  Jointly invested by Japan's Hitachi Ltd, a Shanghai company 
in the sector and a Chinese investment company, the Shanghai 
Hitachi Appliances Co. Ltd, aims to introduce advanced 
compressors from Hitachi to give a push to the domestic industry. 
  According to Shen Jianfang, two modern workshops with a 
total 
floor space of over 10,000 sq m, have been erected in the 
Jinqiao Export Processing Zone. 
  He said that the project is listed among the state-level 
high- tech projects and is planned to be built into China's 
biggest production center in the industry, with an annual 
capacity of 1.4 million compressors and an output value of 1.6 
billion yuan. 
  He attributed the high efficiency to the urgent demand on 
the 
domestic market. In 1992 over 1.57 million air-conditioners 
were sold, while only 300,000 compressors were produced. 
  The project introduced highly automated equipment from 
Japan, 
the United States and Germany. 
  Tested by Japanese quality supervisors, the products have 
overtaken those from its counterparts in Southeast Asian 
countries which were also launched by Hitachi, Shen said.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Though Shanghai women 
believe that being a professor is the most respect-worthy 
career, they would actually rather choose highly-paid jobs for 
themselves, as managers and factory directors, a recent survey 
showed. 
  The conclusion was reached by the Shanghai Sociological 
Institute, which delivered 500 questionnaires to local women in 
all walks of life. 
  Three occupations -- professor, lawyer and writer -- gained 
the highest esteem among local women, followed by serving in the 
armed services, factory director, doctor, engineer, journalist, 
primary and middle school teacher. 
  Asked what kind of job they wanted to take up, the 
guinea-pigs put factory director and manager on the top. The 
second choice was bank clerk, accountant, lawyer, doctor, boss 
of private business, journalist, tax collector, primary and 
middle school teacher and pop singer. 
  In the eyes of Shanghai women, manager, factory director, 
boss of private business and pop singer are the three fattest 
jobs in current China. 
  Based on the results of the survey, sociologists said that 
instead of staying home to be housewives, Shanghai women are 
trying to find their own direction in the fast-moving society. 
  It also showed that esteem of knowledge and intellectuals is 
rising.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 5 (XINHUA) -- New progress has been 
made in east China's Zhejiang Province, one of the economically 
developed provinces in the country, over the past few years in 
attracting foreign investment and expanding its foreign trade 
sector. 
  Official statistics show that the province approved some 
4,487 foreign-funded firms last year, involving a total 
investment of more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. The figure 
exceeded the total number for the previous 14 years. 
  Moreover, total value of foreign trade reached more than 6.1 
billion U.S. dollars in the province last year, according to the 
statistics. 
  To date, Zhejiang has set up eight state-level development 
zone and some 37 zones listed at the provincial and city levels. 
Their combined area accounts for nearly 50 percent of the total 
area of the province. 
  Official sources said that nearly one third of the total 
foreign funds invested in the province has flowed in those 
development zones. 
  As part of the measures to open wider to the outside world 
as 
well as to adopt the international practice, the province has 
implemented the share-holding system in most of its state-owned 
foreign trade companies. 
  In addition, more management powers have been relegated to 
foreign trade firms as well as manufacturers at all levels, 
which has greatly promoted the development of the foreign trade 
business. 
  At the same time, the provincial government encouraged its 
large and medium-sized enterprises to open and expand overseas 
businesses. 
  According to official statistics, more than 180 companies of 
the province have invested or set up branches in nearly 40 
countries and regions in the world. 
  Most of those firms set up abroad are engaged in such 
industries as tourism, processing and building industries, 
fishery and agriculture, official sources said.

  [Text] Lanzhou, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Dingxi prefecture, 
one of the poorest areas in northwest China's Gansu Province, 
has experienced a fast growth of rural industry over the past 
years. 
  According to local officials, the prefecture now has 41,867 
rural and township enterprises which created one billion yuan of 
output value last year, accounting for more than half of the 
total rural output value. The rural and township enterprises 
contributed 33.82 million yuan to the local revenue in the past 
year. 
  For a long time, Dingxi had been so poor that about half of 
its rural population did not have enough to eat or wear. 
  Since 1983, local government, together with relevant local 
departments, has proceeded in accordance with local conditions 
and begun to adjust the production structure in rural areas. 
They have adopted measures to encourage local farmers to set up 
rural and township enterprises or be engaged in diversified 
economy without neglecting grain production. 
  As a result, rural and township enterprises engaged in 
engineering, transport, carpet-making and food-processing 
sectors have mushroomed in Dingxi prefecture. 
  At the same time, the prefecture has also worked out 
preferential policies to attract outside investment for 
development of local resources. 
  The quick development of rural industry has also created 
more 
job opportunities for surplus rural labor, effectively improving 
the living standards of local residents. 
  At present, 170,000 rural laborers, or about 12 percent of 
their total, have found jobs in local rural and township 
enterprises.

  [Text] Lanzhou, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Gansu Province has slightly increased its cultivated area over 
the past five years, a local government official said here today. 
  The gain comes from a consistent policy of protecting 
farmland and an active approach to reclaiming wasteland. 
  He said that since 1989 about 33,367 ha of farmland had been 
taken over for non-agriculture construction in the province, 
while 46,953 ha of wasteland had been reclaimed. 
  Though its per capita possession of farmland is 0.16 ha, 
about one third higher than the national average, expanding 
cities and towns had been nibbling away cultivated area by some 
20,000 ha -- almost a mid-sized county -- a year in the early 
1980s. 
  To arrest the decrease in its cultivated area, the 
provincial 
government issued a series of laws and policies, according to 
which, taking any land for construction purpose had to be 
approved by, and only by, the land administration. 
  The provincial government also ruled that performance in 
land 
administration would be an important aspect of assessing the 
work of local governments. 
  The more than 60 development areas of the province were 
subjected to a review, and those with scant investment were 
declassified, so that the land could be cultivated again. 
  Over the years, the province also uncovered 1,494 cases in 
which construction projects had gone ahead without proper 
approval for use of land. 
  Meanwhile, the province has been encouraging farmers to 
reclaim wild land. Newly-developed farmland is used by the 
reclaimer and is immune from agricultural tax for the first 
three years. 
  In another development, 57 counties in the province have 
completed the setting up of "farmland protection areas," a 
program aimed to subject to protection those farmlands that are 
considered essential to its grain production, the official added.

  [Text] Lanzhou, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Aerial seeding has 
proved a great success in bringing more forests to Northwest 
China's Gansu Province. 
  So far, 19 counties of the province have used aerial seeding 
on 64,667 hectares, and have seen trees grown on 29,300 
hectares, including 15 large stretches of forest each with an 
area of 667 hectares. 
  With vast areas of arid land and deserts, Gansu only has a 
forest cover of 3.9 percent, far from the national average of 
13.63 percent. 
  Local governments have worked out regulations and set up 
more 
than 30 permanent stations for tree management and protection 
work in areas to conduct regular aerial seeding, in a bid to 
guarantee the success of the aerial seeding. 
  Aerial seeding, which is said to be cheaper than manual 
afforestation, has not only helped grow more trees for Gansu, 
but also helped reduce soil erosion by 80 percent, said local 
officials, adding that they will grow more trees on more land by 
way of aerial seeding in the coming years.

  [Text] Police in Qinghai have been cracking down on all 
religious groups since Muslim protests last autumn, and a 
Catholic priest says he has been one of the prime targets of the 
campaign. Following the protests "an order was sent down for 
strict rectification of all religious groups in Qinghai", said 
Father Li Zhixin, a 38-year-old Catholic priest in the 
provincial capital of Xining. "Their prime target has been 
Muslims, then Catholics, because most of them belong to the 
underground church." 
  Father Li said that in addition to being watched by police, 
he had recently come under surveillance by the State Security 
Bureau, which handles cases thought to threaten national 
interests. They have branded him a counter-revolutionary. 
Police have warned him several times to stop celebrating Mass, 
and have told him he would be arrested if caught doing so. The 
latest threat came last week. They have also demanded that he 
turn over all money collected from followers. "I told them, 
it's my responsibility, I have to do my missionary work," he 
said. 
  Father Li has been a priest since 1982 and has celebrated 
Mass daily in homes of followers. But in the past year, it has 
become increasingly dangerous. Father Li, who works as a deputy 
manager at a factory, said police last November raided a convent 
where he had just celebrated Mass. Thanks to a tip-off, he 
managed to leave before the police arrived. Another priest was 
arrested and held for a day, and five nuns were taken away in 
handcuffs and sent back to their homes. 
  The state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association has one 
priest and at most about 200 followers in Xining, while the 
underground church, which in defiance of government regulations 
pledges allegiance to the Vatican has three priests and about 
10,000 followers, according to Father Li. Last spring he was 
detained while celebrating Mass in Jiangsu province. Police 
handcuffed, beat and interrogated him in an attempt to get him 
to admit he was acting illegally and selling out China. 
  Sometimes they made him sit on the floor and hold out his 
arms straight in front of him for two hours at a time. They hit 
him when his hands began to drop. The interrogations took place 
up to five times a week. He also was forced to break rocks. 
Police threatened him with up to seven years in jail for his 
missionary work, but to his surprise, he was released and sent 
back to Qinghai after two months.

  [Text] At a just-concluded provincial meeting on foreign 
economic and trade relations, Vice Governor Wang Shuangxi asked 
all foreign economic and trade departments in the province to 
speed up reform; transform their operational mechanism; 
establish a new system; and promote the sustained, speedy, and 
healthy [chi xu, kuai su, jian kang] development of the 
province's foreign economic and trade relations. 
  In his speech, Wang Shuangxi confirmed the province's 
achievements in foreign economic and trade relations over the 
last few years. On foreign economic and trade structural 
reform, Wang Shuangxi stressed: First, we should seize the 
opportunity to promote the province's foreign economic and trade 
relations to a new height. Second, we should rationalize 
relations, delegate powers to the lower levels, and exercise 
graded management. Third, we should speed up foreign economic 
and trade structural reform in cities and prefectures; city and 
prefectural foreign trade organizations should be put under city 
and prefectural management and their revenues should be 
separated from the provincial-level foreign trade revenue. 
Fourth, great efforts should be made to transform the foreign 
trade operational mechanism and gradually to form a modern 
enterprise system. 
  Wang Shuangxi also set demands for strengthening leadership 
and transforming functions, saying: The foreign trade tasks set 
by the provincial government are to ensure $1.05 billion in 
foreign exchange earnings through exports this year and to 
strive for $1.1 billion; to increase the number of three-capital 
enterprises to 2,000 by the end of this year; to top $400 
million in foreign capital actually used; to ensure $96 million 
in three-capital enterprises' foreign exchange earnings 
throughout exports; to ensure $40 million in the amount of 
contracts for overseas projects and labor services; to obtain 
three or four international aid projects; and to ensure $20 
million in the amount of contracts for technology exports. 
  Governor Bai Qingcai and Vice Governor Xu Shanlin also 
attended and addressed the meeting. The director of the 
provincial foreign economic relations and trade department made 
a work report at the meeting. Governor Bai Qingcai; Vice 
Governor Wang Shuangxi; Ren Guoyi, vice chairman of the 
provincial people's congress standing committee; and Liang Qi, 
vice chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference; attended the closing 
ceremony on 21 February and presented prizes to units that had 
won the glorious title of best enterprise in creating foreign 
exchange earnings in 1993.

of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's Congress, on 
22 February; place not given -- live or recorded, in Uygur with

program;] 
  [Text] Comrades: Today is the first anniversary of the 
promulgation of the State Security Law. The State Security Law, 
which was passed on 22 February 1993 at the 30th meeting of the 
Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee after 
deliberations, is China's first special law for state security. 
Since the founding of the Republic, our struggles against 
espionage organs and various hostile forces outside China's 
territory have been acute and complicated. The State Security 
Law is a law mainly aimed at forestalling and checking 
activities outside the country or activities plotted by forces 
inside and outside the country which threaten state security. 
The promulgation and enforcement of the State Security Law will 
be conducive to the promotion of state security work, reform and 
opening up, and the creation of a good social and political 
environment. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin demanded that we seriously enforce the 
State Security Law. Organizations at various levels in Xinjiang 
should educate the broad masses of cadres and people in studying 
hard the law so that it will be known to all. Organizations at 
various levels and people of all nationalities should vigorously 
support and facilitate state security work. State security 
organs should strictly enforce the law and consciously subject 
themselves to the public's supervision. Citizens and 
organizations supporting, assisting in, and making contributions 
to state security work should be commended and receive awards, 
whereas those who refuse to fulfill their obligations and 
obstruct state security work will have their responsibilities 
investigated according to the law. 
  It is the common duty of the entire party and people around 
the country to safeguard state security. Let us earnestly study 
and enforce the State Security Law and make greater 
contributions to maintaining state security.

  [Text] Reform of Xinjiang's foreign trade system will be 
deepened this year. 
  Since last year, the foreign trade departments of Xinjiang 
have actively promoted reform and broadened the scope of opening 
up, achieving noticeable results in foreign economic relations 
and trade and enabling the region to sharply increase its 
imports and exports--its import-export volume totaled $911.545 
million last year, an increase of 30.3 percent over the previous 
year. However, due to the slow transformation of the operating 
mechanisms of state- owned foreign trade enterprises, and due to 
their poor ability to cope with the changing situations, their 
exporting capacities have been seriously affected. This year 
the region will adopt six reform measures to encourage and guide 
foreign trade enterprises to earn more foreign exchange and 
profits. 
  -- All state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be 
required 
to link their economic results to the total amount of their 
wages, and make workers' wages and bonuses directly dependent on 
enterprises' foreign exchange earnings and economic 
results--there will be no upper or lower limits for workers' 
wages and bonuses. In addition, a distribution incentive 
mechanism becoming to foreign trade enterprises will be 
established, and foreign trade enterprises will be encouraged to 
boldly experiment with instituting the system of "deciding one's 
wage according to the amount of their finished work computed in 
U.S. dollars" [mei yuan gong zi han liang, 5019 0337 1562 6327 
0698 6852]. 
  -- State-owned foreign trade enterprises will institute the 
all-personnel labor contract system and the system of promoting 
people based on competition and on their work 
performances--people with ability will be promoted and 
incompetent people will be demoted. The "iron armchair 
[guaranteed rank]" and "life-long tenure" systems will be 
abolished. 
  -- Accounting units of foreign trade enterprises will be 
subdivided to eliminate enterprises' equalitarianism and to 
break their "large rice bowls." Enterprises with required 
conditions may establish branches, and under the macroeconomic 
regulation and control of their head companies should work to 
consolidate their branches' functions, responsibilities, and 
powers. 
  -- In allotting quota permits to foreign trade enterprises, 
we should consider the enterprise's efficiency, adhere to the 
principle of being fair, and do things openly. At the same 
time, we should encourage competition among enterprises and 
allot quota permits to winners. 
  -- We will encourage joint operations by enterprises. This 
kind of joint operation is to be based on trade and is aimed at 
improving enterprises' economic results. Enterprises may enter 
in joint operation by buying shares of other companies, by 
joining their business activities, by pooling funds, or by 
cooperating with each other. They also may establish foreign 
trade enterprise groups. 
  -- We will systematically carry out enterprise reform. At 
first on a trial basis, we will create necessary conditions to 
gradually reorganize foreign trade enterprises with required 
conditions into regular limited liability companies or 
joint-stock companies.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- A four-day national 
meeting on promotion of overseas investment ended here today. 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with all the participants and 
Premier Li Peng delivered a speech at the meeting. 
  Since China began implementing the policies of reform and 
opening to the outside world 15 years ago, more and more foreign 
investment has poured into the country, especially in the past 
two years. 
  The contracted foreign investment volume in 1992 exceeded 
the 
total for the 13 years before while that of 1993 doubled 1992's. 
  Officials in charge of the foreign investment promotion work 
in the State Council, provinces and municipalities attended the 
meeting. 
  In the meeting with the participants, President Jiang 
affirmed the accomplishments in using overseas investment in the 
past 15 years and encouraged the participants to do a better job 
in the use of overseas capital. 
  Jiang noted that the overseas investment has played a 
positive role in China's economic development. 
  To attract more foreign investment, Li Peng pointed out in 
his speech that China should better the investment environment, 
establish a comprehensive legal system, perfect the market 
mechanism, improve the work efficiency of the government and 
enhance the professional quality of the personnel. 
  China not only has cheap labor and many technicians but also 
a market with large potential, Li said, adding that these 
advantages could attract more foreign investment and enable 
investors to obtain legal profits. 
  However, Li stressed, China will not attract foreign 
investment at the expense of its socialist culture and morals. 
  Li said that China would pay more attention to its 
cooperation with international financial consortiums and large 
transnational enterprises. 
  Chinese enterprises and foreign investors should both 
benefit 
from cooperation, Li said, adding that China should not only 
concentrate on introducing foreign investment, but also protect 
the interests of overseas investors and strengthen its 
administration over foreign-funded enterprises according to law. 
  Li said that China will draft comprehensive industrial 
policies to guide the distribution of foreign investment and 
avoid blind or redundant investments. 
  China can also introduce foreign capital to transform old 
state-run enterprises, Li said. But the assessment of 
state-owned properties should be strengthened to avoid the 
drain-off of state-owned properties. 
  As for China's ability to pay foreign debts, Li said the 
country should do its best to ensure its ability to repay the 
principal and interest. He added that as long as the economic 
efficiency of the enterprises is good, there will be no problem 
in repayment. 
  The premier also stressed the necessity to protect the legal 
interests of Chinese workers in foreign-funded enterprises. 
  Chinese vice-premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing also 
attended 
the meeting.

  [Text] China says reports by foreign mass media about the 
detention of Chinese dissidents are groundless. The Chinese 
Ministry of Public Security made the statement on Monday [7 
March] after overseas news organizations carried lists of 
dissidents detained during the weekend. The ministry explained 
some of the dissidents listed are under investigation because 
they are suspected of inciting turmoil and disrupting social 
order. Others named have not been detained. 
  The dissident Wei Jingsheng, one of those named by the 
foreign media, has applied for permission to leave Beijing on a 
private matter. The ministry said his application has been 
approved.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Beijing by staff reporter: "Wei </F>
Jingsheng Will Not Appear in Beijing Before the End of This 
Month"] 
  [Text] An informed source in Beijing has said that 
according to Wei Jingsheng's secretary, Tong Yi, Wei will 
probably not show up in Beijing by the end of March. From now 
until then, Wei Jingsheng will keep in touch with Tong Yi by 
phone every day. Meanwhile, an official from the U.S. Embassy 
in Beijing yesterday said the itinerary for U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's Beijing trip has been set out, the 
focus of this mission will be on human rights issues, and if 
there are no goodwill moves on the part of the Chinese this 
week, the United States will be much more likely to implement a 
hard-line policy. 
  The informed Beijing source said Wei Jingsheng, during his 
meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck more 
than a week ago, did make some critical remarks about the 
Chinese side's human rights policy, its treatment of dissidents, 
and Deng Xiaoping's deeds. This irritated the Chinese 
leadership very much. 
  The informed source said: What has made the authorities even 
more unhappy is that the Chinese side is deeply worried that 
these dissidents will form organizations, establish ties among 
themselves, and collaborate with hostile forces and 
organizations abroad. He revealed that the Chinese side had set 
up an organization recently to investigate these organizations 
and contacts among democratic activists and dissidents, and this 
led to some strong actions afterwards. The Chinese side does 
not want to see social "stability" upset by any activities by 
these people to mark the anniversary of the 4 June Incident or 
by any related activities. Therefore, the Chinese side has made 
this move in anticipation of such a possibility, despite 
pressure from the United States. 
  The informed source said the Chinese side does not want to 
see organizations formed by these people emerge, nor does it 
like western countries exerting pressure on it under such a 
pretext, and this is why the Chinese side has made this move. 
On the other hand, the Chinese side's operations against 
subversion can be combined with its hard-line foreign policy, 
thus rationalizing the strong action it may take next at home 
and abroad under the camouflage of nationalism and patriotism. 
  Qian Yumin, a co-signatory to the Peace Charter who works 
with the Ministry of Railways, was released the night before 
yesterday [6 March]. He said he had been warned by the police 
not to make any "move" or do anything to impair the national 
interest during the current two sessions. 
  Ma Shaofang, a student leader in the 1989 democracy 
movement, 
was stopped and picked up by the police at Tianjin railway 
station en route to Beijing from Jiangsu five days ago. It is 
said that Ma Shaofang is now being kept under direct 
surveillance by the Jiangsu provincial public security bureau. 
  A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Government has already 
fully expressed its stand on the Wei Jingsheng case and some 
others. During his visit to Beijing, Christopher will place 
special stress on the human rights issue. The official 
maintained that if the Chinese side takes no specific action to 
improve conditions, the Clinton administration, under pressure 
at home and abroad, will take a tougher attitude toward the 
Chinese side. How the United States reacts depends on the 
Chinese side's "performance this week." 
  The U.S. Embassy official said Christopher will give a news 
conference before he leaves Beijing, and his evaluation of the 
outcome of his talks with Chinese officials and his assessment 
of human rights conditions and the other issues he will present 
will outline the Clinton administration's future China policy.

Shude (3769 2885 1795) and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719 
1807 2455); Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1349 
GMT on 4 March transmits a service message placing an open-ended 
embargo on this item] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 Mar (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, met 
all the delegates to the all-army legislative work meeting 
today; and so did Central Military Commission Vice Chairman 
Zhang Zhen and Central Military Commission members Zhang 
Wannian, Yu Yongbo and Fu Quanyou. Liu Huaqing said: The 
People's Liberation Army [PLA] has made great achievements in 
military legislation. The tasks of governing the state and 
managing the Army according to law remain very heavy in the days 
to come, and we should continue to make efforts. 
  The all-army legislative work meeting was held in Beijing on 
3 March with the approval of the Central Military Commission. 
It was the first all-army legislative work meeting in the PLA's 
history. The meeting seriously adhered to the party central 
committee's guidelines on strengthening legislative work, as 
well as the Central Military Commission's principle of managing 
the Army according to law. It concentrated on studying how to 
accelerate military legislation, create a new situation of 
military legislation, and use military laws in guiding, 
promoting and protecting defense construction and army building 
under the conditions of building a socialist market economic 
structure and stepping up army building in the new period. 
Present at the meeting were persons in charge of relevant 
departments under the PLA's three general departments and major 
units and the Armed Police Force headquarters. The comrades in 
charge of the legislative affairs departments of the party 
central committee, the National People's Congress, and the State 
Council attended and addressed the meeting. 
  China has paid great attention to military legislation in 
recent years. The Central Military Commission set up its 
legislative bureau in 1988 to strengthen its leadership over 
military legislation. So far, the National People's Congress 
and its Standing Committee have successively promulgated nine 
military laws and legal decisions, including the "Military 
Service Law" and the "Law on Protection of Military 
Installations." More than 100 military regulations and military 
administrative regulations have been enacted either by the 
Central Military Commission alone or by the Central Military 
Commission and the State Council jointly. More than 1,000 sets 
of military rules have been formulated and published by the 
three general departments and major PLA units. So, a more 
feasible military legal system has been preliminarily 
established, and the planning of military legislation has 
improved. Moreover, the PLA has made great efforts to supervise 
and inspect law enforcement and to register all military rules 
and regulations, and the efforts have promoted the 
implementation of military laws and upheld the unity and dignity 
of the legal system. The PLA has also made remarkable 
achievements in publicizing the law, carrying out legal 
education, training legal affairs cadres, and providing legal 
counsel, as well as in jurisprudential studies.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Most farmers living in 
the environs of Hangzhou, in east China's Zhejiang Province, 
will no longer have to live at the mercy of the weather. 
  When a natural disaster strikes, they can get a premium from 
disaster insurance. 
  In the nine counties and cities around Hangzhou, the 
provincial capital, a cooperative disaster-relieving insurance 
now covers more than 70 percent of the farm households. 
  To work out a social security system in rural China is a new 
issue which the country is exploring in the process of 
developing a market economy. 
  Such insurance also helps put an end to the traditional 
practice of farmers having more children in order to guarantee a 
secure old age, one of the causes of China's huge population.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jingyue (1776 0079 6460)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (XINHUA) -- Over the past 10 years, 
as many as 10,000 scientific and technological findings achieved 
by our country's space industry have received scientific and 
technological advancement awards at or above the ministerial 
level, as well as state invention awards. Space technology is 
becoming an important hallmark of the country's overall strength. 
  It is reported that our country's space industry has 
established development, production, and testing bases, which 
boast a fairly large scale, a wide range of specialties, and a 
complete set of technologies. An integrated system of research, 
design, testing, trial development, and production has taken 
shape, and a nationwide network of cooperation in scientific 
research and production has been established. Thus far, the 
space industry has received 170 state scientific and 
technological advancement awards, of which there are nine 
special prizes, 15 first prizes, 46 second prizes, and 100 third

Products For Civilian Use Are Moving Faster into the World 
Market"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb--Since its establishment eight 
months ago, the China Spaceflight Industrial Corporation has 
displayed its strong points in integrating technology, industry, 
and trade and in exploring the international market. It has 
established economic and technological cooperation with more 
than 70 countries and regions and enjoys a good reputation for 
its top-quality service. 
  As reported, the corporation has satisfactorily completed 
contracts for launching Asian, Australian, Pakistani, and 
Swedish satellites. Now it has started carrying out a number of 
contracts for launching international commercial satellites. 
  Now the corporation is manufacturing the Dongfanghong [East 
Is Red] No. 3, a high-capacity telecommunications and broadcast 
satellite; the Fengyun [Storm] No. 2, a geostationary 
meteorological satellite; and the Ziyuan [Resource] No. 1, a 
multipurpose earth resources satellite. A large number of 
telecommunications satellites and meteorological satellites will 
go into operation soon. The Chengzheng [Long March] No. 3, a 
carrier rocket with low-temperarure, high-energy fuel, has 
emerged. The Changzheng carrier rocket series is taking on a 
development pattern of systematization, generalization, and 
standardization. It can meet domestic needs better and provide 
a wider field of service for the international market. 
  In recent years the corporation has stepped up use of 
spaceflight technological achievements to serve the national 
economy. The output value of its civilian products has 
increased at an annual rate of 34 percent. Through developing 
its three main products -- satellites, cars and their 
components, as well as computers--the corporation is making 
efforts to improve the quality of its civilian products, expand 
their scale, and improve their economic results. In the near 
future, the corporation will turn a number of projects with 
prominent spaceflight characteristics and major influence on 
social progress into civilian products, such as developing a 
satellite information system, a mobile telecommunications 
subscriber's station system, and a global television 
transmission system for civilian purposes.

Jiuwei (2799 0036 0251)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- Our country's 
new-generation meteorological satellite, "Fengyun-2," was 
recently transported to the Xichang satellite launching center, 
where it will be lifted into space on a "Long March-3" carrier 
rocket in April. 
  This stationary-orbit meteorological satellite, developed by 
the Chinese Research Institute of Space Technology, will be used 
primarily to collect information for the preparation of 
visible-light and infrared-light cloud charts and water 
distribution maps; to collect and transmit observation data 
compiled by meteorological, maritime, and hydrological 
departments; to disseminate extended digital cloud charts, 
low-resolution cloud charts, and weather maps for use by ground 
stations at home and abroad; and to provide observation data for 
use in satellite engineering and space environmental science 
research. 
  Compared to the two "Fengyun-1" satellites launched in 1988 
and 1990, the new-generation meteorological satellite 
"Fengyun-2" reportedly represents a breakthrough in terms of 
technical performance, scope of application, and service life. 
The satellite employs a number of advanced technologies, such 
as scanning radiometry, slender-body control technology, and 
apogee engine separation, marking the first time such 
technologies have been used domestically, and signalling a new 
stage in our country's space technology.

Lei: "Chinese Intellectuals Eye World Competition"] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 7 -- At the beginning of the spring 
of 1994, which is dubbed "the year of reform," leading Chinese 
intellectuals are hoping to play a greater role in the 
international arena as the country is opening wider to the world. 
  "Bringing the Chinese scientists to the frontiers of the 
world science and technology" was what Professor Zhou Guangzhao, 
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the 
country's top scientific body, called it. 
  "We're trying to make CAS one of the most active and 
productive members of the world's scientific family," said 
Professor Zhou in an interview at his office in Beijing, where a 
huge world map hangs on the wall. 
  CAS, which was set up 45 years ago on a Soviet Union-style 
framework, now has 125 research institutes and 100,000 
scientists, engineers and other staff members. 
  The country's reforms over the past 15 years have freed the 
academy from its closed ivory-tower system and established a new 
system which is fully open to the world and society. 
  So far, the CAS has established close ties with 3,000 
Chinese 
industrial enterprises and more than 500 high-tech enterprises 
or joint ventures. 
  In another move, at the Congress of CAS Academicians this 
June, a number of outstanding foreign scientists are due to be 
elected to the prestigious scientific body, for the first time 
in its 45 year- history. 
  "Natural sciences are the laws of nature and they are free 
from the limits of national boundaries," Professor Zhou said, 
"and scientific discoveries and inventions are the common 
property of mankind." 
  He added: "Only in an open system can the CAS fully absorb 
the advanced scientific results of the world to raise China's 
academic level, while making their own contributions to the 
world." 
  Professor Zhou said that the academy will join the 
international efforts to solve such global issues as the 
problems of sustainable development, rapid growth of population, 
shortages of resources and deteriorating ecological environment. 
  "If scientists are not able to make breakthroughs in the 
technologies of solar energy and nuclear fusion in the next few 
centuries, it will be difficult for human civilization to 
continue," Zhou said. 
  Zhou said that the academy has taken a number of moves such 
as setting up national open laboratories, post-doctorate posts, 
national research centers, sending graduate students abroad, and 
cultivating 100 internationally-known scientists before the end 
of this century. 
  "Once at the frontiers of the world sciences, the Chinese 
scientists will provide the world with their own contributions," 
he said. 
  "Building a world-class university" was what professor Wang 
Dazhong, president of Qinghua University was thinking about. 
Qinghua is the country's top university. 
  Professor Wang spoke to the reporters at his office, which 
dates back to the mid-19th century. 
  "Since the competition of economy, science and technology in 
the 21st century will eventually turn out to be the competition 
of talents, Qinghua will strive to become one of the top-notch 
universities in the world by the year 2011, its centenary," he 
said. 
  "Best university means producing best students," he said. 
"We 
will train high-level scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and 
government officials who are in great demand by China's emerging 
market economy." 
  According to Professor Wang, among the more than 500 
academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 160 graduated 
from Qinghua. Twenty-nine members or alternative members of the 
14th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party graduated 
from or once worked in Qinghua. 
  A comprehensive university, Qinghua has Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji as head of its School of Economic Management, Professor 
Zhou Guangzhao head of the School of Sciences, and Professor 
Teng Teng, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences, head of the School of Humanities. 
  Professor Wang said that the university will promote the 
transfer of scientific results into productivity by developing 
high-tech enterprises. 
  It is planning to set up an enterprise group and a science 
and technology garden for cooperation with the industries and 
enterprises from both home and abroad. 
  A committee consisting of representatives from the 
university 
and from industry is expected to be established to develop 
cooperation with the world's renowned enterprises. 
  "Taking a firm hold of the world's market of high-tech 
products" is what Professor Liu Chuanzhi, president of the 
Legend Group, the largest Chinese high-tech enterprise overseas, 
is thinking about. 
  When he launched his company in Beijing nine years ago, Liu 
could not afford 200 yuan to install a telephone at his office. 
Now his company has become the biggest computer firm in Hong 
Kong. 
  Liu spoke to the reporters at his luxurious office in 
Beijing, which he explained was prepared to receive 
international industrial giants. 
  "I have now finally realized my dream of turning scientific 
results into products, and sold China's high-tech products in 
the world market," Liu said. 
  The company was started with seed money of 200,000 yuan 
provided by the CAS. 
  The company, which expands as fast as a legend can tell you, 
is now producing 10 percent of the computer display cards in the 
world, making it a well-known computer firm abroad. 
  Its sales volume last year hit three billion yuan, 40 
percent 
of which was sold on overseas markets. Last month, Legend 
became China's first high-tech company to be listed on Hong Kong 
stock market. 
  He said, "In the highly competitive world of the computer 
industry, in order to keep a significant market at home, we are 
also striving to enter the world market." 
  "The Legend Group has set up its information center at 
Silicon Valley in the United States, its research center in 
China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, and its development 
center in Hong Kong," Liu said. "That is why we are leading the 
world in the computer display cards manufacturing." 
  According to Liu, the Hong Kong branch of the Legend was set 
up with only 300,000 Hong Kong dollars of investment. Now it 
has turned up to be the number one computer firm in Hong Kong, 
with a fixed asset of one billion Hong Kong dollars. 
  Liu said the Legend is to combine the mainland's high 
technologies, market, and distribution system with Hong Kong's 
sales style and information. 
  The company has now established 14 branch companies in the 
United States, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and 
Singapore, selling its products all over the world.

Tang Hua (3282 5478): "The Development of Science in China in 
the Next Century"] 
  [Text] The development model set down for the Chinese 
Academy of Science (CAS) as it prepares to move into the next 
century is as follows: "A council made up of fellows elected 
from the ranks of China's most outstanding scientists; a group 
of scientific research centers, institutes, and engineering 
(technology) research centers which are up to international 
standards and have close ties with society at large; and 
surrounded by modern high-tech enterprises (groups) where CAS 
has partial or controlling shares and which have close ties with 
the academy in such areas as manpower, information, research 
achievements, and funds." 
  At the end of January, CAS held its annual work conference 
in 
Beijing to plan further reform and development for the year 
1994. CAS President Zhou Guangzhao, who had just returned from 
his Taiwan trip to chair the meeting, gave LIAOWANG an exclusive 
interview. During the interview, he spoke of what model the CAS 
should adopt in order to abolish the operational practices of 
the planned economy era, how the CAS should actively and 
steadily make the transition to a modern scientific research and 
development structure, and how it will make use of its new 
overall superiorities to fulfill the important work which the 
state and the nation have assigned to it. 
  Zhou Guangzhao emphasized that the development objective of 
CAS is "to become a base of international advanced standards 
which struggles along the frontiers of science; to become a base 
for training top-level scientific and technological personnel; 
and to become a base for promoting the formation and development 
of new- and high-tech industries." 
<H6>  I. </H6>
  Zhou Guangzhao has always stressed the importance of making 
observations from the plane of the latest ideas ideas science. 
This time, he also paid particular attention to the latest 
scientific, technological, social, and economic trends when 
deliberating on the reform and development of CAS. 
  Zhou Guangzhao said retrospectively: The invention of 
semiconductors and microelectrons opened a new electronic era 
after World War Two. A variety of high-quality and 
multi-function electronic products, which met the needs of 
consumers at different levels, have made their way into homes 
and offices, changing people's life-styles and work styles. 
During this period, that which created the highest labor 
productivity was no longer workers who controlled machines, or 
American-style centralized command systems, but the Japanese 
system of worker participation in innovation which stressed 
coordination. 
  Today, with the introduction of computerized automation and 
production systems, and the popularization of satellite and 
optical fiber communication facilities, production of diverse 
varieties in small quantities at a low cost has become a 
widespread practice. This calls for rapid acquisition and 
handling of large quantities of information as well as a 
flexible and swift response. Big companies with tight-knit but 
unwieldy organizational setups are no longer suited to this 
change, which has been caused by scientific and technological 
development, and a process of reorganization has begun. 
  Zhou Guangzhao mentioned two opposite yet complementary 
trends: On the one hand, there has been a strengthening of the 
overall order. Modern scientific and technological development 
has created more effective means for better planned management 
and supervision. For example, the introduction of electronic 
equipment and facilities in banking, financial, and taxation 
organs makes it possible to control, in a timely fashion, the 
circulation of money in the whole society, halt speculation and 
tax evasion, and check inflation and price raises. The remote 
monitoring of energy, material, and manpower supplies as well as 
natural disasters to prevent possible trouble, has also become a 
possibility. These have turned the society into a more ordered 
and coordinated system. 
  On the other hand, there has been a development of local 
autonomy. The rapid conversion of scientific and technological 
achievements and the diversification of market demands, have 
brought about intensified competition and uneven development. 
The more technology is made use of in our work and everyday 
life, the greater will be the demand on people's knowledge and 
ability. The vitality of a unit is reflected through the 
initiative and creativity of its members. The decentralization 
of power, the streamlining of management hierarchies, and the 
promotion of continuing education aimed at improving the quality 
of laborers and arousing the enthusiasm of individuals, have 
become a world trend. 
  Regarding the influence of, and example set by, CAS in these 
respects, Zhou Guangzhao said: In an open market economy, 
scientific research units must engage in competition on a world 
scale. A research unit without vitality will be eliminated. 
Units that have vitality but work on their own will also meet 
the same fate because their forces will be dispersed or will be 
offset by others and cannot be strengthened. Only by correctly 
formulating development strategies in accordance with the actual 
conditions of our institutes, academy, and country; properly 
organizing our ranks; concentrating our strength on the most 
important and fastest developing frontiers of science, as well 
as on projects that have a vital bearing on the national 
economy; and by creating an overall strength and superiority and 
launching several major assaults which will have a major impact 
on scientific and technological development, will we have the 
opportunity to develop further. Thus, we can understand that 
the structural readjustment now underway in the CAS is 
definitely not a short-term contingency measure aimed at tiding 
over current difficulties. 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  Zhou Guangzhao disclosed that the CAS has a three-step 
strategy: The first step, which covers the last two years of the 
"Eighth Five-Year Plan," is to accelerate the structural 
readjustment of disciplines, manpower, organization, and 
operational mechanisms, concentrating a superior force on 
several major assaults. The second step, which covers the 
period of the "Ninth Five-Year Plan," is to further improve the 
structure, bring about a generational transfer in the ranks of 
key scientific researchers, achieve major successes in 
scientific research, develop a benign mechanism for the 
application of scientific and technological achievements, and 
support the entry of China's high-tech industry into the 
international market. The third step, which covers the first 
decade or two of the next century, is to ensure omnidirectional 
and rapid scientific research and development and join the world 
front ranks. 
  Zhou Guangzhao gave the following cool-headed analysis: The 
shortage of financial resources and outstanding young academic 
leaders is the biggest headache confronting CAS. However, there 
are also many opportunities and the deepening of reform is a 
favorable opportunity greeting the historic new development of 
CAS. 
  First, the demands of the state and society for science and 
technology will exceed any period in China's history. It is 
predicted that the need to sustain the development of the 
Chinese society during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" and thereafter 
will compel the state to attach greater importance to long-term 
basic research. CAS is organizing people to analyze major 
problems which are likely to confront China's economic and 
social development over the next five to 10 years. By fully 
taking into account the possibilities and opportunities offered 
by the latest scientific and technological developments, it will 
be possible to secure better task and development opportunities 
during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan." 
  Second, a standardized market economy essentially refers to 
a 
fine environment where the productive forces of science and 
technology have been fully emancipated. Following 
implementation of the "Decision on Several Problems Concerning 
the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic Structure," 
the work of integrating science and technology with the economy 
will receive more support and see a better external environment. 
  Third, CAS scientific and technological personnel have the 
fine tradition of dedicating themselves to the cause of China's 
science and technology and have years of experience in reform 
and opening up. Among the more than 50,000 CAS scientific and 
technological personnel, nearly two-thirds are under 45 years of 
age. While continuing to bring into play the role of 
middle-aged backbone cadres, it is necessary to give outstanding 
young cadres the heavy responsibility of taking charge of 
first-line research and development tasks. In this way, it will 
be possible to speed up the gradual takeover of key scientific 
research posts by outstanding young scientists in the next few 
years. 
<H6>  III. </H6>
  The implementation of structural readjustment is a 
pioneering 
move taken by CAS in China's scientific and technological 
circles. When asked how it came about, Zhou Guangzhao said that 
it was a decision made by CAS in the summer of 1993. Reforms 
undertaken by CAS over the past 10 years and more were basically 
functional reforms carried out on the basis of the old 
structure. In other words, they were no more than readjustments 
of the functions of various research institutes within the old 
framework. In mid-1992, CAS began a comprehensive reform 
program embracing scientific research, development, and various 
support systems. The fact that these reforms increasingly 
touched on deep structural problems made structural readjustment 
imperative. 
  Zhou Guangzhao said: The structural readjustment in CAS 
mainly involves the orientation of various disciplines and the 
establishment of research institutions, the contingent of 
scientific and technological personnel, and various support 
systems. 
  The "Ninth Five-Year Plan" scientific and technological 
development program for CAS as it prepares for the 21st century, 
will be the guideline for the readjustment of the disciplinary 
structure and the establishment of research institutions. 
According to Zhou Guangzhao, since this is the first program to 
prepare CAS for the transition to the new economic structure, it 
is necessary to scientifically predict the economic and social 
development conditions and the scientific and technological 
demands which are likely to prevail in the early part of the 
next century; fully understand the role and impact of the market 
economy; analyze the trends and advances of scientific and 
technological development in the international arena in the next 
10 to 20 years; and attach importance to personnel training and 
development. 
  Zhou Guangzhao then went on to talk about new 
deployments by CAS for basic research 
  1. Priorities for basic research in the academy have been 
set down and the orientation and arrangement of disciplines have 
been readjusted to muster the limited manpower and material 
resources behind those areas which are fast developing in 
international scientific circles and in which we have already 
established basic capacities, as well as exploratory spheres 
which have major strategic significance for economic 
construction and social development. Arrangements have also 
been made for those areas of frontier science which are 
developing rapidly internationally and are of great significance 
but which do not yet have the basic capacity. 
  2. Modern comprehensive scientific research centers will be 
organized for some of the fast-developing and important 
interdisciplinary subjects to make up for the shortage of 
research facilities and open laboratories which were basically 
established for the use of individual disciplines in the past. 
These centers will be headed by accomplished scientists and 
will have post- doctoral scholars and doctoral candidates as 
their main researchers. These positions will be advertised both 
locally and internationally and appointments will be offered for 
fixed terms. The centers will work closely with related 
research institutes, offices, and sections. 
  CAS has decided to open two such centers this year. One is 
the Shanghai Life Scienec Research Center which will operate on 
the basis of various biological institutes in Shanghai and will 
bring research forces from chemical, physical, and technological 
science under one roof. The other will be the Modern Earth 
Science Research Center to be set up by revamping the Institute 
of Geophysics, which will work closely with international bodies. 
  3. While undertaking projects under the state's 
Scaling-the-Peak Program and other major foundations, 
appropriate steps will be taken to organize and give all-out 
support to major projects on life science and other areas in 
which CAS has an advantageous edge and which are developing 
rapidly. A given proportion of elective topics will be 
preserved. 
  4. A number of large-scale scientific installation projects 
within our national capabilities will be selected and 
recommended to the state so that appropriate deployments can be 
made during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan." These projects should 
be ones which can stimulate significant technological progress, 
are likely to reach international advanced standards, and 
produce an impact. 
  5. Cooperation with other institutions of higher learning 
will be strengthened through such means as the mutual offering 
of part- time positions, joint training of postgraduate 
students, and cooperation in the establishment of research 
centers. More substantial cooperation with institutions engaged 
in similar research abroad will be encouraged and efforts will 
be made to cooperate in the establishment of laboratories and 
research centers. 
<H6>  IV. </H6>
  Of the main battle-front of economic and social services, 
Zhou Guangzhao said: On the basis of research carried out in 
past years, and bearing in mind the long-term needs of national 
construction, CAS has decided to organize several major 
"assaults" using the new mechanism. With the support of 
relevant research institutes, CAS will practice systems 
integration by establishing several engineering (technology) 
headquarters. These bodies will have the ability for 
organizational coordination, can assume overall responsibility 
for major tasks, and will be run on the basis of the market 
mechanism. 
  Zhou Guangzhao also briefed this reporter on major projects 
involving a number of institutes which CAS will start preparing 
this year and will submit to the state for inclusion in the 
"Ninth Five-Year Plan": 
  Coal purification, combustion and conversion. Since the 
early 1980's, five or six institutes under CAS have been engaged 
in research on technologies aimed at raising combustion 
efficiency, reducing pollution, and developing coal processing, 
combustion, and conversion, achieving some successes. In these 
areas, the necessary conditions exist for putting the research 
achievements into industrial application. 
  The harnessing and coordinated economic development of the 
red earth undulating hills of South China. The undulating hills 
of South China make up one-fifth of China's total land area and 
most of these are poverty-stricken areas which urgently need 
opening up. Having previously done research and developed new 
technologies in such areas as comprehensive planning, soil, 
species, fertilizers, resource processing, environmental 
protection, and ecological restoration, and with its experience 
in the comprehensive harnessing of the Huanghe-Huaihai region, 
it is high time that CAS began this "assault." 
  The comprehensive exploitation and utilization of rare earth 
resources. China has not yet developed the technologies for the 
purification and ultrafine powdering of rare earth, and has not 
yet made much of a breakthrough in the application of high 
technologies and new materials. With its multidisciplinary 
strength, CAS should be in a position to organize a superior 
force and develop China's own technologies and industries using 
rare-earth luminescent materials, battery materials, and 
magnetic materials. 
  Information technology. CAS and related organs have already 
built up an excellent research force and capability in such 
areas of information technology as computers, automated systems, 
and optical-mechanical-electrical devices. For example, it has 
two microelectronic bases, one in the north and the other in the 
south, and has successfully developed the "Shuguang-I" parallel 
processor which is up to international standards of the early 
1990's. CAS must organize its strength to study its own 
development strategies and speed up development. 
  Zhou Guangzhao said that high-tech enterprises under CAS 
must 
practice standardized management under the modern enterprise 
system. On the basis of sorting out property relations, steps 
must be taken to define the relations between the institutes and 
enterprises in accordance with law. The joint-stock system 
should be instituted in all types of enterprises, with the 
majority of them being turned into limited liability companies. 
  Zhou Guangzhao disclosed that CAS will start a project this 
spring to train and select leaders who will lead various 
disciplines into the next century. At the same time, more 
post-doctoral scholars, postgraduate students, and postgraduate 
students who are doing both their masters and doctoral programs 
will be recruited. Subsidies for postgraduate students will 
gradually be replaced by scholarships and more grants will be 
issued. These postgraduate scholars and postgraduate students 
will be assigned to research programs and regarded as part of 
the mobile workforce of various institutes. Those students on 
masters degree and doctoral programs who demonstrate academic 
excellence and are engaged in part-time research should be 
rewarded as research trainees and assistant researchers 
respectively. He emphasized that CAS must truly become a place 
which trains and provides top grade scientific and technological 
personnel for the state.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (CNS) -- According to a survey by 
relevant research institutions, Chinese sturgeons have 
extricated themselves from a predicament as a result of the 
construction of the Gezhou Dam at the river's upper reaches, 
with the young sturgeons now appearing in many places at the 
river's lower reaches in Anhui, Jiangxi and Jiangsu Provinces 
and the Shanghai Municipality, indicating success of the 
comprehensive sturgeon rescue plan including artificial 
sturgeon-breeding and the sending back of young sturgeons into 
the river. The Chinese sturgeon, an important endangered 
aquatic animal protected by the Chinese Government, used spawn 
in the Jinsha River, a branch of the Yangzte at its upper 
reaches. [sentence as received] With the construction of the 
Gezhou Dam, this species of fish was greatly reduced in number 
since their way back upstream for spawning had been cut off by 
the dam. In order to protect this variety of fish, considered a 
precious "living fossil", the Chinese Sturgeon Research 
Institute succeeded in developing an artificial sturgeon 
reproduction programme in 1984 and since that time they have 
sent back 2.35 million young sturgeons into the river. A survey 
conducted in 1991 showed that the number of this fish in the 
river has nearly reached the level before the construction of 
the dam. 
  According to experts, the above success has offered 
beneficial experience for the protection of precious endangered 
species facing similar environmental problems with the 
construction of the three Gorges Project.

  [Text] Dhaka March 8 (XINHUA) -- A senior Canadian 
official has pledged his country will strengthen exchanges with 
China in various fields. 
  Addressing a press conference tonight at the end of his 
three-day official visit to Bangladesh, Canadian Secretary of 
State for Asia-Pacific Raymond Chan said that Canada is not in 
favor of linking trade with the so-called "human rights" in 
China. 
  It will strengthen it's trade as well as political, social 
and cultural exchanges with China, Chan affirmed. 
  Replying to a question, Chan also said that "Asia-Pacific 
region is playing more and more important role in the world and 
is becoming a more important trade partner of Canada." 
  Canada has to be more aggressive to seek out more trading 
partners in the region, the secretary for state said, adding: 
"Canada will continue to be friends of Asians." 
  As regards water sharing dispute between India and 
Bangladesh 
as well as Kashmir issue, Chan noted that his country is in 
favor of resolving those issues through bilateral talks and 
negotiations. 
  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) 
is a good forum for resolving bilateral issues among SAARC 
member states, he stressed. 
  Chan described Canada-Bangladesh relations as "very good," 
saying the recent economic and political developments here "make 
us optimistic about Bangladesh" and Canada would continue with 
its assistance to this country. 
  Canada's development program for Bangladesh is its largest 
worldwide and Canada is one of the major contributors to 
development assistance here. Approximately 2 billion Canadian 
dollars (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) has been provided to 
Bangladesh since its independence in 1971. 
  Chan arrived here on March 6.

6892): "U.S.-Japanese Trade Frictions Will Aggravate"] 
  [Text] Washington--U.S. President Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held a meeting at the White 
House on 11 February. This was the first formal meeting between 
the leaders of the two countries since Hosokawa became Japanese 
prime minister. The meeting was aimed at resolving trade issues 
between the two countries, but ended in failure without any 
agreement. The United States indicated its readiness to take 
retaliatory steps. Thus, U.S.-Japanese trade frictions will be 
further aggravated. 
  At a press conference after the meeting, Clinton directly 
criticized Japan by saying that Japan is still unwilling to open 
its market to U.S. products, it was the G-7 country with the 
most tightly closed market, and proposals raised by Japan at the 
meeting could not even meet the criteria provided by the 
"framework agreement" concluded by the two countries in Tokyo 
last year. Hosokawa stressed that although no trade agreement 
had been reached at the summit meeting, both sides agreed that 
"this result should not be allowed to undermine the solid and 
friendly relations between the two countries," adding that both 
sides maintained that cooperation in the political and security 
fields had developed and strengthened. 
  Since the Clinton administration assumed office, U.S. 
foreign 
policy toward Japan has changed noticeably. The United States 
no longer puts U.S.-Japanese security relations in primary 
position in U.S. policy on Japan, but stresses the importance of 
U.S.-Japanese trade relations. For a long time, the United 
States has registered a huge adverse balance of trade with 
Japan. Although both sides have signed almost 30 different 
trade agreements since 1980, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan 
keeps increasing. Last year, the deficit with Japan rose by 20 
percent, standing at almost $60 billion. 
  The Clinton administration has always exerted pressure on 
Japan on the trade question. It has asked Japan to open its 
market to U.S. products and reduce the huge trade deficit to 
provide more job opportunities in the United States and 
stimulate U.S. economic development. In the "framework 
agreement" concluded last year, the United States asked Japan to 
work out detailed quotas to import U.S. products. The United 
States calls this "target criteria." 
  Prior to the summit meeting, Hosokawa sent a special envoy 
to 
meet Clinton and ask the United States to give Japan more time 
on the trade talks, to put aside their differences during the 
summit meeting, and to prevent the first summit meeting between 
Clinton and Hosokawa from breaking down. However, Clinton 
replied that the seven-month period from July last year had been 
adequate and that differences were better than an agreement 
where nothing had been achieved. Subsequently, Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomo Hata arrived in Washington to hold talks with 
U.S. Trade Representative Kantor and Treasury Secretary Bentsen. 
The talks went on from 10 February until the early hours of 11 
February without result. Japan indicated that the "target 
criteria" were actually "numerical quotas" to "manage trade," 
which did not correspond with Japan's basic principle of free 
competition. Japan could not accept this U.S. demand. 
  On 12 February, at a press conference prior to his departure 
from the United States for Japan, Hosokawa stressed that Japan 
would not ease its stand in this respect and "we will not accept 
numerical quotas." He said that after a "cooling down period," 
both sides would be able to resolve all kinds of differences. 
In the meantime, Hosokawa hoped that the United States would 
not take retaliatory measures unilaterally against Japan, as 
this would violate GATT principles. 
  While the United States could possibly take this step, U.S. 
congressmen and some influential leaders in U.S. business 
circles keep asking the Clinton administration to take a 
hard-line attitude on Japan. In their opinion, over the last 
20-odd years, the United States has tolerated Japan's trade 
surplus with the United States, out of consideration for 
U.S.-Japan security relations. But the United States should not 
make this mistake any longer. Some U.S. officials say that 
after the summit talks failed, they were no longer interested in 
resuming trade talks with Japan, unless Japan changed its 
stance. The Clinton administration has prepared a series of 
specific programs to force Japan to open its markets, which 
include meting out trade sanctions against Japan. According to 
some reports, if the United States takes retaliatory measures, 
the first thing it will do is to raise import tariffs on 
Japanese telecommunications products and vans, apart from 
restricting imports of Japanese products. In addition, it could 
possibly list Japan as a country engaging in unfair trade and 
apply corresponding measures. 
  In some analysts' opinion, if the United States takes 
retaliatory measures, this will cause Japan to retaliate also. 
In such a case, a trade war would break out between these two 
big economic countries. This is something the United States is 
unwilling to see, because not only would a trade war damage the 
interests of the enterprises and consumers in the two countries, 
but also endanger U.S.-Japanese political relations. Apart from 
this, it will also undermine the achievements the United States 
has made in promoting global free trade through the GATT and 
NAFTA [North Atlantic Free Trade Association]. This would be 
unfavorable to the United States. However, if the United States 
does not take strong measures, Clinton will be criticized and 
his policy toward Japan will be regarded as the same as that 
toward Bosnia-Herzegovina: "Loud thunder but small raindrops." 
Furthermore, U.S. credibility in trade negotiations would be 
much decreased. 
  Clinton has indicated that the United States has no 
alternative but to take action. This may be announced next 
week. On 13 February, THE WASHINGTON POST disclosed that the 
Clinton administration had decided to impose retaliatory 
measures on some Japanese products. Evidently, the aggravation 
of U.S.-Japanese trade frictions is inevitable.

1730): "PRC Active Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] The year 1994 has just begun and a situation of 
unprecedented vigor has appeared on China's diplomatic front. 
Qiao Shi, National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee 
chairman; Liu Huaqing, Central Military Commission[CMC] vice 
chairman; Qian Qichen, vice premier and foreign minister; and 
Liu Huaqiu, deputy foreign minister left in turn for visits to 
Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, France, and the United States. 
Meanwhile, Hwang Jang Yop, secretary of the Workers' Party of 
Korea Central Committee; Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom 
Narariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen; U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and a U.S. Congressional delegation; 
Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister; Andrei Kozirev, Russian foreign minister; and 
Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Hasang Hasangnuofu [0761 2718 0761 
2718 6179 1133] also paid visits to China. Such a busy lineup 
of bilateral exchanges within a short span of one month shows 
China's expanding diplomatic front and that China's increasingly 
active diplomatic activities are yielding fruitful results. 
  NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi's recent 
three-nation tour of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, the 
first visit by a Chinese leader to these three countries for 
four years, received a warm and high-profile welcome. While in 
Germany, Qiao Shi expressed the view that China and Germany 
should approach and handle their bilateral relations from a 
strategic plane. German Chancellor Kohl also said that Germany 
and China share a special relationship and could do much 
together in many spheres. During Qiao Shi's visits to 
Switerland and Austria, the leaders of these two countries also 
expressed their willingness to further promote understanding, 
strengthen cooperation, and develop economic and trade ties with 
China. 
  Because of its proximity, Southeast Asia has had traditional 
ties of friendship with China. Recent years have seen a steady 
growth in exchanges and cooperation between China and some of 
the Southeast Asian countries on the economic and trade fronts. 
Thus, strengthening and developing ties of friendship and 
cooperation with Southeast Asian countries is not only conducive 
to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region but is in the fundamental interest of the peoples of 
China and the Southeast Asian countries. China has always 
attached great importance to its ties of friendship and 
cooperation with Southeast Asian countries. CMC Vice Chairman 
Liu Huaqing visited Thailand and Indonesia recently and made a 
brief stopover in Singapore. During his tour, Liu Huaqing met 
with the leaders of these countries and explained China's 
consistent principled stand of hoping to see peace and 
stability, friendly cooperation, and common development in the 
Asia- Pacific region. China's sincerity received high acclaim 
from Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. 
  During his tour of the six African countries of Ethiopia, 
Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar, and Mauritius, Qian Qichen 
reiterated China's policy toward Africa, emphasizing that it is 
the fundamental point of departure of China's foreign policy to 
strengthen solidarity and cooperation with African nations and 
other developing countries. In international and regional 
affairs, China has many points in common with the African 
nations. During Qian Qichen's six-nation tour of Africa, all 
sides expressed the desire to further expand economic and trade 
cooperation. Qian Qichen noted that economic and trade 
relations between China and Africa embodied the spirit of mutual 
benefit and assistance for common development. This shows that 
China's policy of opening to the outside world is 
multidirectional and that China not only wants to develop ties 
of economic and trade cooperation with the developed countries 
of the West and with its neighbors but also sincerely wishes to 
develop diverse forms of cooperation based on mutual benefits 
with the vast numbers of developing countries. 
  Not long after the Chinese and French Governments issued a 
joint communique on the restoration of the traditional ties of 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries on the 
basis of the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic 
relations, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen paid an official visit 
to France and received a warm welcome from the French. The 
visit marked the beginning of "a new period" in Sino-French 
relations after a difficult period. China and France are both 
permanent members of the UN Security Council and both possess 
nuclear weapons. Thus, an improvement in Sino-French relations 
is not only conducive to economic and trade cooperation between 
the two countries but will contribute to world peace and 
stability. As Qian Qichen said in his recent meeting with 
Peileifeite [0160 7191 5481 3676], the French prime minister's 
special envoy, Sino-French relations have played a constructive, 
stabilizing, and balancing role in the world over the past 30 
years. In his opinion, the importance of these relations 
exceeds the limits of bilateral relations and should be carried 
forward in the current international situation. 
  While in Paris, Qian Qichen also met U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. Both sides reiterated that: China 
and the United States share common interests and assume 
important responsibilities in the maintenance of international 
peace and security and in a wide range of other affairs; there 
are huge potential and broad prospects for economic and trade 
cooperation between the two countries; and that it is in the 
fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries to expand 
exchanges and cooperation on the economic, trade, and scientific 
and technological fronts. Both sides also noted that the 
meeting between Chinese State President Jiang Zemin and U.S. 
President Clinton in Seattle last November represented a good 
start to bilateral relations. At the end of January, in his 
meeting with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu in 
Washington, Christopher reiterated that the United States was 
working hard on developing major ties with China and was willing 
to continue working hand in hand with the Chinese in bringing 
bilateral relations onto the road of healthy development as 
quickly as possible. 
  This favorable situation in China's foreign relations has 
come about as a result of its efforts to uphold a peaceful 
foreign policy of maintaining independence and taking the 
initiative in its own hands; it is also the fruit of its reform 
and open policy, which has brought about an excellent situation 
of political stability, unity among the people, and economic 
development. It shows that China's sincere approach has been 
increasingly widely understood and that its market, with its 
immense potential, has become more and more attractive. 
  Looking around, it is only with Britain that we are having a 
little trouble. We are also willing to develop ties of 
friendship and cooperation with Britain. Of course we are not 
going to do so at the expense of principle and sovereignty. We 
have the desire and the patience and believe that the problem 
between our two countries will be resolved sooner or later as 
the trend of the times dictate.

"Two Options for Settling International Conflicts"] 
  [Text] There are two options for settling the current 
international conflicts, including regional conflicts: One is 
by nonpeaceful means, namely, using force or armed threats or 
the application of pressure; the other is by peaceful means, 
namely, negotiations, dialogue, and peaceful consultation. 
Which option should actually be adopted? This is a great issue 
which has a bearing on the peace and development of the 
countries and regions concerned and also the world at large. 
Recently, the West has adopted the first option. 
  On 9 February, the U.S.-led NATO issued an ultimatum to the 
conflicting parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the 
Serbs, demanding that Serb armed forces withdraw their heavy 
weapons to areas 20 km away from Sarajevo within 10 days, 
otherwise NATO would launch air strikes against Serb armed 
forces positions around the city. Hence, the situation in the 
region suddenly became tense. Nevertheless, the international 
community believed that: NATO had unexpectedly issued an 
airstrike ultimatum, bypassing the UN Security Council, and was 
prepared to resort to force or armed threat before investigating 
and ascertaining who was responsible for the shelling of 
Sarajevo. This manner of doing things was inappropriate. 
  If the NATO ultimatum is carried out, this will be the first 
military action taken by the organization outside its own 
defensive areas since its founding 44 years ago and also the 
first eastward shift of its defense areas. This will seriously 
affect Russia's strategic interests. Thus, the ultimatum 
aroused Russia's strong dissatisfaction and opposition. Russian 
leaders, including the president, prime minister, and the 
defense minister, issued statements one after another expressing 
opposition to NATO air strikes against Bosnia-Herzergovina. 
  On 19 February, Churkin, special presidential envoy and vice 
foreign minister, emphatically told reporters: If NATO takes 
reckless action against the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
disregard of Russian suggestions, this will lead to a tense 
situation in Sarajevo and also a crisis in the relations between 
Western countries and Russia. 
  If the NATO ultimatum is put into effect, the peace process 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina will break down and all efforts for peace 
made so far will be wasted and the civil war will continue and 
there will be a danger of it further escalating and spreading. 
People are worried that a surprise attack may trigger a Balkan 
war. Since the outbreak of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
2.7 million people have become refugees, supporting themselves 
and their families by relying mainly on international aid. 
However, air strikes will fuel the flames of war and the 
transport lines for the international aid goods and materials on 
which the refugees, who are living in hunger and cold, rely for 
their existence may possibly be sabotaged or cut off. If that 
happens, their lives will become more miserable. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina is different from Iraq. Once NATO puts 
its ultimatum into effect, it will possibly get so deeply stuck 
in the conflict that it will be unable to extricate itself 
because, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, many mountains are covered with 
thick forests and its geographical conditions are complicated. 
Therefore, the targets for attack are hard to identify and 
particularly most of the positions where the Serbs are well 
concealed. Thus, it is difficult for air strikes to achieve the 
desired results. Once the Serbs switch to the offensive, the 
personnel in the countries concerned in which the UN 
peacekeeping troops are stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
become the selected targets of attack. Since air strikes will 
solve no problems, if NATO dispatches ground forces for a large- 
scale military intervention, it is possible for the organization 
to sink into the quagmire of a "Vietnam-style" or 
"Lebanon-style" war. 
  In view of the abovementioned situation, the international 
community has universally opposed NATO air strikes against 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and the use of the NATO ultimatum as a means 
of settling the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. The 
Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict, which has lasted for 22 months, is 
currently confronting the danger of external military 
intervention and the expanding flames of war but the final way 
out, and the wisest choice, is a peaceful settlement through 
negotiations. In particular, the three parties in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict recently agreed to form a union 
after the country is divided into three parts, letting the 
Muslims possess one-third of the territory and have access to 
the sea. Because the Muslims were dissatisfied with the plan and 
demanded more territory, the three conflicting parties still 
need to bargain over it. If the peace talks continue and a 
breakthrough is made, this will bring new hope to the peaceful 
settlement of the Bosnia- Herzegovina issue. 
  Through frequent consultations between the United Nations 
and 
the various sides concerned, and also through diplomatic 
efforts, the Serbs pulled back 80 percent of their heavy weapons 
from the areas surrounding Sarajevo. NATO has decided not to 
carry out, for the time being, its plan to launch air strikes 
against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since last year, some 
"long-standing, large, and difficult" regional hot-spots, such 
as the Middle East, Cambodia, and South Africa, have made 
"historic breakthroughs" through negotiations and dialogue. 
This shows that so long as there is hope for peace, be it only 
a thin hope, efforts in this regard should not be abandoned. 
This way of doing things is advantageous to peace and 
development.

they are using human rights as a political tool to exert 
pressure [on other countries]... (adding graph.)

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the 
coming session of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
expressed the hope today that the upcoming visit to China by 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will be conducive to 
the promotion of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Zhou Jue, spokesman for the NPC session, made the remark at 
a 
press conference this morning, in response to a question on the 
timing of Christopher's visit. 
  China is willing to expand friendly relations with all 
countries in the world, including the United States, Zhou said. 
  Reiterating China's policy towards the United States, he 
said 
that China hopes to "increase mutual trust, reduce troubles, 
expand cooperation and avoid confrontation." 
  Calling China and the U.S. two influential countries, said 
that the development of Sino-U.S. relations is not only in the 
interests of the two peoples, but also conducive to peace in the 
Asia-Pacific region and the world, as well.

by special correspondent in Washington Chu Hsing-fu (2612 1630 
4395): "United States Must Not Cancel China's MFN Status -- 
Written on the Eve of Christopher's Visit to China"] 
  [Text] Washington, 7 Mar -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who currently is on visit in the Asia-Pacific 
region, is scheduled to pay a three-day visit to China on 11 
March. He is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit China 
since the visit to Beijing by former U.S. Secretary of State 
James Baker in November 1992, and also the most important of 
U.S. official to visit China in recent years. 
  As reported by the U.S. media, Christopher's visit is aimed 
exclusively at China's most-favored nation [MFN] trading status. 
Two months from the 3 June deadline by which U.S. President 
Clinton is to make a decision on renewing China's MFN trading 
status, the U.S. side wants to make a final sprint and do its 
best to force China to make more concessions on the human rights 
issue. If China does make major concessions, the U.S. secretary 
of state may suggest to President Clinton before the end of May 
that China's MFN status be renewed. However, if China refuses 
to make major concessions, the Clinton administration probably 
will stop granting MFN trading status to China. 
<H5>  China Has Done a Great Deal on the Human Rights Issue </H5>
  According to the U.S. Presidential Executive Order signed by 
Clinton last year when renewing China's MFN trading status, 
China must attain major and comprehensive headway in improving 
its human rights record in a number of fields, otherwise the 
United States will not be so easy on China this year. In its 
human rights report issued on 1 February, the U.S. State 
Department reaffirmed the fact that China has made some headway 
on the human rights issue, but the U.S. side still insists that 
the concessions China has made are insufficient, and it 
continues making constant threats to end China's MFN trading 
status. 
  China and the United States have different cultural 
traditions and values, and the economic development levels of 
the two countries also are widely different. Therefore, it is 
only natural that China and the United States should have 
different understandings and perceptions of human rights 
standards. Even so, China has done a great deal on the human 
rights issue. For example, China used to consider the human 
rights issue an internal affair and refuse to discuss the issue 
with the United States, but now it is willing to discuss the 
human rights issue in detail with the United States, which only 
minds other countries' business without giving proper care to 
things at home. China also has held talks with the 
International Red Cross concerning visits to Chinese prisons, 
and it has released a number of "pro-democracy" activists before 
the completion of their terms of imprisonment. Knowing that the 
United States itself also exports prison products to foreign 
countries, China has reiterated its strict implementation of the 
Agreement on Banning Exports of Prison Products; moreover, it 
also has agreed to allow officials from the U.S. Embassy in 
China to conduct shock inspections of Chinese factories under 
suspicion. 
  The Chinese Government's great efforts on the human rights 
issue last year are obvious to all. It would have been 
impossible for China to achieve all these breakthroughs before 
reform and opening up. However, one cannot build up his 
constitution on one mouthful. The higher the requirements and 
expectations the United States has unduly set on China's human 
rights issue with a view to forcing China to accept all its 
demands regardless of China's national conditions, the greater 
is the disappointment to which United States is doomed. The 
U.S. Presidential Executive Order is sacred and solemn on the 
territory of the United States, but forcing this Order on China 
is inappropriate. It is just as the diplomat of an Asian 
country has put it: As a large country, China has national 
dignity, as well as its own Constitution and laws. China will 
not allow itself to be led by the nose by the U.S. Presidential 
Executive Order. 
<H5>  China Will Not Kowtow to the United States </H5>
  During Christopher's visit to China, both sides will reach a 
consensus on a number of international issues, and China may 
make some gestures on the human rights issue, perhaps promising 
that China will do more, in accordance with its Constitution and 
laws, to abide by the World Declaration of Human Rights; or 
continuing to release jailed dissidents for their satisfactory 
performance in prison; or reiterating its willingness to hold 
talks with the exiled Dalai Lama. However, China will not 
kowtow to the United States, neither will it promise not to 
arrest law-breaking dissidents who attempt to stir up turmoil 
inside the country. Moreover, China will not sacrifice its 
principles on holding talks with the Dalai Lama, unless the 
latter agrees to give up his stance on Tibetan independence. 
  People tracking the development of Sino-U.S. relations all 
share the opinion that no matter how hard China tries on the 
human rights issue, dialogue and fights between China and the 
United States over the human rights issue are going to be 
protracted. This year's pressure will last until the end of the 
coming May. Will the United States really abolish China's MFN 
trading status this year? The Clinton administration will not 
do so if it is sober-minded and has foresight. The undue 
stubbornness of the United States on the issue of China's human 
rights will lead only to the effect that "haste makes waste," 
which is contrary to its original wish. In China, no one dies 
because of insufficient food and clothing, no one loses his leg 
or hand for his violations of the law, no one obsequiously begs 
for economic aid from the West, and no woman is deprived of her 
right to participate in political affairs. The human rights 
situation in many other countries is even worse than that in 
China, so why does the United States not go and condemn them? 
  The reason the U.S. Government always adopts a tough 
attitude 
toward China on the human rights issue is that the government is 
faced with pressure imposed by a number of U.S. senators and 
human rights organizations. Although many senators have urged 
efforts to increase pressure on China on the human rights issue, 
and even have called for abolishing China's MFN status, not one 
of them really wants, deep in his heart, to stop granting the 
MFN trading status to China. Human rights are just a tool used 
by the United States to impose pressure on China. If China's 
MFN status is canceled this year owing to its poor human rights 
record, those U.S. senators will be unable to find any other 
excuse in the future for their criticism of China, and their 
public exposure will come to an end following the cancellation 
of China's MFN status. 
  A China undergoing reform and opening up is beneficial, not 
only to the interests of the Chinese people, but also to the 
interests of the United States. If it really wants to improve 
Sino-U.S. relations, the United States must not cancel China's 
MFN trading status.

<F P=106> [Second of unknown number of installments: "Special </F>
article" by special correspondent in Washington Tsu Hsing-fu 
(2612 1630 4395): "Revoking China's MFN Will Achieve a Little 
at the Expense of a Great Loss -- Written on the Eve of 
Christopher's Visit to China"] 
  [Text] Washington, 7 Mar -- From an economic point of 
view, as well, the United States cannot now revoke China's MFN 
status over human rights issues. The United States may gain a 
little but will suffer greatly by revoking China's MFN status, 
for it will pay a heavy price. If China and the United States 
can work together to overcome the difficulty this year, the 
United States can avoid putting its relations with China on a 
narrow human rights basis. Only then can Sino-U.S. relations 
break free of this ludicrous circle and return to the normal 
path. 
<H5>  Target for American Companies' Overseas Expansion </H5>
  The United States currently has a fairly good share of the 
Chinese market, and the situation is getting better. Here is a 
breakdown of U.S. exports to China last year: $2 billion worth 
of aircraft and parts and components; $1 billion worth of 
computers and electric power generators; and $272 million worth 
of wheat. Agreed U.S. investment in China in the past year 
alone amounted to $7 billion, and actual investment to more than 
$3 billion. Five hundred and fifty U.S. companies have set up 
branches or offices in China. Most of the FORTUNE 500 firms are 
viewing China as their strategic target for overseas expansion. 
U.S Deputy Commerce Secretary Garten also visited China 
recently to lobby vigorously for $6 billion worth of contracts 
for U.S. companies. If the United States revokes China's MFN 
status over human rights issues, it will be tantamount to 
announcing that it is surrendering China -- a market with 
enormous commercial potential for U.S. companies -- to Japan and 
Europe. 
  As long as Sino-U.S. bilateral ties remain healthy and 
stable, the future China market will become only more attractive 
to U.S. companies. The National Commission of U.S.-China Trade, 
a nongovernment organization comprised of some 200 large and 
medium-sized firms trading with China, forecast that China will 
require $40-$100 billion worth of electric power generating 
facilities in the next 25 years, $30 billion worth of 
communications facilities in the next five years, and $29 
billion worth of demand for automobiles in the next three years. 
<H5>  200,000 More People Unemployed </H5>
  If the United States revokes China's MFN status over human 
rights issues and if China responds with trade retaliations by 
doubling import duties on imported U.S. goods, U.S. goods will 
lose their competitiveness in the Chinese market, which in turn 
will cost 170,000 to 200,000 jobs in the United States. The 
U.S. market will be deprived of cheap but good China-made goods, 
and each of the 94 million U.S. families will pay an average of 
$170 more annually in consumer goods purchases. If Sino-U.S. 
relations are destabilized, it will be difficult for U.S. 
businessmen to invest and do business in China. Manufacturers 
of other countries will have gained a secure footing in the 
Chinese market by the time the United States wakes up and renews 
China's MFN status three or five years later. 
  The Clinton administration will not solve any problems by 
revoking China's MFN status over human rights issues. On the 
contrary, it will create new problems and troubles. Will U.S. 
industrial and commercial sectors sit back and watch the Chinese 
market being taken over by other Western countries? Will the 
Republican Party, which represents the interests of industrial 
and commercial sectors, allow the Clinton administration to 
isolate the United States in the Asia-Pacific region? 
<H5>  The Need To Cooperate With China on International Issues </H5>
  For the sake of U.S. security in the Asia-Pacific region, 
the 
United States cannot revoke China's MFN status. Revoking 
China's MFN status will cause Sino-U.S. relations to deteriorate 
and will obstruct Sino-U.S. cooperation in various areas. From 
the late 1980's to the early 1990's, a considerable number of 
Americans thought that with the end of the Cold War, China had 
ceased to have any strategic value for the United States. Now, 
however, it seems that China still has strategic value for the 
United States; moreover, there are needs and bases for 
cooperation between the two sides on many international issues. 
The United States may have to double its efforts, though with 
fewer results, if China's cooperation is not available on some 
important international issues. 
  If it is seeking China's cooperation on international 
issues, 
the United States should not isolate and undermine China. It 
may be necessary for the United States to maintain some suitably 
reasonable pressure on China over human rights [dui mei guo lai 
shuo, dui zhong guo zai ren quan fang mian shi dang bao chi yi 
xie he li di ya li ye xu shi bi yao di 1417 5019 0948 0171 
6141, 1417 0022 0948 0961 0086 2938 2455 7240 6624 3981 0202

4104], but the United States cannot victimize 1.2 billion 
Chinese for the human rights of a few. An isolated and enraged 
China is not good for anyone -- the Asian countries, the United 
States, or China itself. If the United States is wise, it will 
not revoke China's MFN status over the issue of human rights 
without finding out the truth.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Interests Behind Pretext of Human Rights"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is going 
to visit China on 11 March. He said that he would discuss 
economic and trade issues with China on the trip, but that the 
United States attached more importance to human rights. Through 
various channels, the United States once again has spread the 
atmosphere that "if a decision were to be made now as to whether 
or not to grant China most-favored-nation [MFN] status, the 
United States would decide to cancel it, and that therefore 
China must make further progress." 
  The United States is attempting to use "human rights" as a 
big stick to exert pressure on China, interfere in China's 
internal affairs, and issue orders as to what road China should 
take and how its reform should proceed. In the months before 
each June, the United States uses the MFN status as a trump card 
to continuously make various unreasonable demands, such as 
"allowing the United States to broadcast to China," issuing a 
list of prisoners they want released, "improving political and 
religious freedoms," "exporting no prison-made products," 
"visiting prisons in China," and "human rights in Tibet." The 
United States not only makes demands verbally, but at the same 
time supports some troublemakers in intentionally making trouble 
within the territory of China. With voices from the outside and 
the inside, they create all kinds of so- called "human rights" 
incidents in a planned way as a pretext for taking further 
interfering action. 
  In 1989, U.S. officials repeatedly met with Fang Lizhi, Wang 
Dan, and others, and closely collaborated with them in making 
trouble. Last August, when China made a bid for the Olympic 
Games, Han Dongfang, who has close ties with U.S. labor unions, 
collaborated by attempting to return to the mainland via Hong 
Kong to "promote democratic movements." After he had failed in 
an attempt to steal through customs and had his passport 
withdrawn, some people in Hong Kong held gatherings and 
processions to show support. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten 
gave a speech attacking China. This year, on the eve of the 
U.S. secretary of state's China visit, some Americans went from 
Hong Kong to Henan's Fangcheng County and carried out illegal 
missionary activities there. They had overnight gatherings, 
made videotapes, and faxed records of their activities back to 
Hong Kong in different batches and at different periods. As 
they would not listen to the warning by the quarters concerned, 
action was taken to enforce the law, but the Americans 
immediately responded by lumping that togethre with the MFN 
status. A few days ago, the United States sent Assistant 
Secretary of State Shattuck to Beijing to "prepare" for 
Christopher's China visit. That was an official visit on which 
he should have respected diplomatic protocol by being with the 
host on his itinerary and schedule. Shattuck, however, went to 
meet with opponents of the Chinese Government, and discussed 
with them whether or not to grant MFN status to China. Some of 
them suggested that the United States cancel China's MFN status; 
others even wished to arrange for meetings between the secretary 
of state and the dissidents. Does the United States want a 
sincere dialogue with the Chinese Government, or is it 
attempting to do something to support the dissidents by making 
use of the visit to send them a political gift and give them 
support with a view to achieving the political aim of 
interfering in China's politics? 
  Any country must safeguard its sovereignty and security, 
keep 
its internal affairs from outside interference, and allow no 
foreign country to support political dissidents in making 
trouble, let alone Wei Jingsheng, who is a parolee who still has 
to observe parole regulations. Now that he has violated the 
regulations, the Chinese public security authorities, naturally, 
could take legitimate summoning measures in accordance with law. 
The fact that the United States attempted to interfere in 
China's legal procedures and parole regulations, and to put 
China's judicial organs under its control naturally has violated 
international law. 
  Clause number seven under article two of the UN Charter 
provides for the safeguarding of state sovereignty. It reads: 
"This Charter must not be considered as empowering the United 
Nations to interfere in any affairs that are of nature within 
the jurisdiction of a country." The human rights question 
involves the enforcement of law and is the internal affair of a 
country. If a foreign country is allowed to interfere in the 
internal affairs of a country as it wishes, it will lose its 
sovereignty, its political situation will become turbulent, and 
it will lose the right of national development, and in turn 
personal human rights will have no guarantee. Facts of 
aggression and intervention in the Third World explain this 
well. The developing situations in former Eastern European 
countires, and in Yugoslavia, also explain this. 
  The United States knows very well how to safeguard its own 
sovereignty. Although there are seven international human 
rights pacts, the United States has joined only one, not the 
other six, because the pacts affect its sovereignty. The United 
States insists that its Constitution and laws prevail over the 
human rights pacts and that it is not interfered with by these 
pacts. On the one hand, it says it is safeguarding "human 
rights," but on the other, it is violating them. For instance, 
it carried out the armed aggression against Cuba, kidnapped its 
president, and bombarded its civilians. In Somalia, it shot 
women and children with guns. It openly supported cannon 
attacks on the people-elected parliament and the killing of 
several hundred people. It has tacitly allowed the slaughters 
and strikes in the Israeli-occupied territories every day, and 
has grossly intervened in the political criteria and social 
patterns of other countries. These countries have no political 
choice, as their right of choice is dependent on American will 
and new criteria are set by the U.S.-supported political 
parties. This U.S.-style "human rights" concept obviously is 
unacceptable to the Chinese people. 
  If Christopher is going to discuss China's human rights 
question with an attitude of equality during his China visit, 
China will be glad to discuss it with him. If he wants to 
develop economic and trade relations with China, China holds a 
positive and cooperative attitude, as this is a mutually 
beneficial matter. However, if someone is going use "human 
rights" to pressure China to open its market, with a view to 
reaping economic interests or benefiting himself at China's 
expense, and if he goes so far as to use this to test China's 
ability and will to safeguard its sovereignty and to force China 
to swallow the bitter pill of having its internal affairs 
interfered with, then he underestimates China's determination 
for independence and self-determination, and will only end up in 
dream. If the United States cooperates, then both sides will 
benefit, but if it uses MFN status as a threatening means, it 
ultimately will harm its own interests.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Azerbaijani 
President Gaydar Aliyev said here today that his country desires 
to establish direct economic and trade ties with large-sized 
Chinese enterprises. 
  He made the remark at a meeting with the leaders from more 
than 20 large Chinese companies here this morning. 
  The president said that during his visit to China he had 
exchanged views with Chinese leaders on a wide range of issues. 
The two countries also signed a series of important documents 
aimed at promoting the growth of bilateral ties, economic 
co-operation and trade in particular, he said. 
  Aliyev said these agreements should be fully implemented 
through concerted efforts by the relevant departments of the two 
countries. 
  He said China is a big country while Azerbaijan is a young 
country, and both of them have great potential for economic 
development. 
  Azerbaijan, situated at the junction of the continents of 
Europe and Asia, has enjoyed traditional contacts and ties with 
the Asian countries including China. So it can play the role of 
a "bridge" in linking these two continents. 
  Viewed from Azerbaijan's geographical position, there exist 
good conditions for furthering bilateral economic co-operation 
and trade. 
  in his speech, Aliyev also briefed the Chinese entrepreneurs 
on his country's advantages in industry and agriculture, which, 
he said, will lay a basis for bilateral economic co-operation 
and trade. 
  Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade, noted that a good beginning 
has been made for the pursuit of China-Azerbaijan economic ties 
and trade. 
  He expressed the hope that the entrepreneurs of the two 
countries would frequently exchange visits and deepen their 
mutual understanding so as to further promote such a 
relationship.

<F P=106> [Article by Eric Meyer: "Robert Urbain, Belgium's Traveling </F>
Salesman in China"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain is 
certainly starting to know the way to China by heart. He has 
already been there three times, his most recent visit ending in 
Beijing last Friday. And his meetings with Mrs. Wu Yi, his 
Chinese counterpart, minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, have a touch of complicity, rather like school 
friends meeting again after the long vacation. 
  This did not prevent Robert Urbain from giving Mrs. Wu Yi a 
short expose on the beauties of democracy and giving her a list 
of political prisoners drawn up by Amnesty International. Last 
year, the minister remained silent on the subject of human 
rights, not without prompting some criticism...in Belgium. The 
minister is pursued by his public even on the other side of the 
world! 
  Despite these admonitions which are generally frowned upon 
by 
China, Mrs. Wu Yi had no hesitation in giving the 
Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union (UEBL) a "good report" with 
regard to the development of trade. According to her figures, 
bilateral trade increased by 39 percent last year, reaching $1.4 
billion, of which $786 million were Belgian exports (in other 
words up 71.4 percent). This Belgian trade surplus is due 
(according to the Belgians) to Chinese industry's insatiable 
demand for new and imported materials. But China also tried to 
inundate the European markets last year at any cost, believing 
that this year would serve as a reference for fixing the 
European single market's import quotas: This hope was dashed, 
the reference years stop at 1992, and Mrs. Wu Yi was strongly 
critical of the European Union (EU), even reserving the right to 
take "any measures" necessary to protect her country's 
interests... 
<H5>  Economic Growth of At Least 9 Percent This Year </H5>
  Mrs. Wu Yi's only criticism of Belgium is the (high) prices 
and especially the reduction in credit from Brussels to fund its 
purchases of Belgian technology. Before 1989, the year of the 
Tian Anmen Square [as published] massacre, it amounted to 400 
million Belgian francs, it was then reduced to 200 million, 
before increasing to 230 million last year, providing finance 
for only 40 percent of Chinese purchases... Indeed, China is 
trying increasingly to have its development paid for by other 
countries, even if its means repaying the (reduced) interest 
over very long periods, whereas the industrialized states prefer 
to allow the capital markets (and the client states) to fund 
infrastructure projects. A trial of strength has therefore 
started between China, which intends to impose its preconditions 
as the only country in the world to maintain strong growth (at 
least 9 percent this year), and the GATT signatory countries who 
are trying to guard against "development for free." 
  Robert Urbain gave an indirect response to the Chinese 
expectations, stating that the ceilings on the pledges of the 
National Export Guarantee Office (providing state guarantees for 
contracts signed with China) for China had just been doubled, 
making it possible to considerably increase the cover for 
exports by Belgian enterprises operating in the Celestial Empire. 
<H5>  Alcatel Bell, and ATEA Confirm their Presence </H5>
  Foremost among them is Alcatel Bell with its new telephone 
exchange factory in Pudong, Shanghai: A Belgian loan of $125 
million is imminent and, when it reaches cruising speed at the 
end of this year, it will become the biggest factory of its kind 
in the world, with a production capacity of 5 million lines per 
year, with a significant proportion of the components being 
imported from Belgium. 
  In the same niche, ATEA, a subsidiary of Siemens, is 
preparing to export exchanges worth $133 million to China. 
Finally, among other promising Belgian developments, we should 
mention Ahlers, the shipowner, which, after setting up an 
initial joint consulting enterprise, is waiting for the go-ahead 
to set up "Asco," a Belgian-Chinese maritime company, in the 
port of Shanghai... 
  Finally, Robert Urbain's visit, which also took place in 
Shanghai and Suzhou [as published] (another large coastal city), 
made it possible to show what the minister calls the "growing 
interconnection" of the two countries' economies, in particular 
with the holding of the 13th Belgian-Chinese joint commission 
meeting devoted to the funding of projects some of which have 
already been mentioned. This public mission is announcing at 
least three more visits by industrialists scheduled to take 
place between May and September. 
<H5>  Logistics Entrusted to the Chinese Administration? </H5>
  These visits are being organized by Fabrimetal (with the 
Bank 
Association) and by the Antwerp chamber of commerce (with the 
Kredietbank). They will provide an opportunity to make the 
essential visits to Beijing and Shanghai, but also to less usual 
cities like Dalian, Chongching, Nankin, or Xian. [as published] 
  Unfortunately, according to several Belgian sources in 
China, 
these missions, to reduce their organizational costs, tend to do 
without the support of local expatriates and to entrust their 
logistics to cumbersome Chinese administrative departments like 
the CCPIT (Central Commission for Industrial Promotion), thus 
depriving themselves of contacts and services which would be 
very useful to novice businessmen arriving on Asian soil...

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng met here this afternoon with visiting Dutch Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Pieter Kooijmans, saying that China attaches 
much importance to developing friendship and cooperation with 
the Netherlands. 
  Li said that the Netherlands was one of the earliest Western 
European countries to acknowledge the independence of the 
People's Republic of China. 
  He noted that there are no conflicts of fundamental 
interests 
between China and the Netherlands. 
  He said that the Netherlands is China's fifth largest trade 
partner in Western Europe and the two countries are cooperating 
in a wide range of areas including electronics, shipbuilding, 
petrochemicals, water conservancy and agriculture. 
  Li expressed the hope that the two sides will make fast 
progress in the talks on some large cooperation projects now 
underway. 
  China is a big market, Li said, and it offers many new 
cooperation opportunities to Western European countries 
including the Netherlands and the momentum of development in 
trade and cooperation between the two countries should continue. 
  Kooijmans said that Sino-Dutch economic and trade relations 
have been strengthened and the prospect for such cooperation is 
broad. 
  He noted that while meeting with the Chinese foreign 
minister 
and foreign trade minister, he expressed the sincerity of the 
Dutch side to further develop bilateral relations. 
  This afternoon, Minister of Justice Xiao Yang and Minister 
of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi met with Kooijmans 
on separate occasions. 
  Kooijmans and his party will end their China visit tomorrow 
morning.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (AFP) -- Dutch Foreign Minister 
Pieter Kooijmans has asked Chinese leaders for information about 
40 Chinese and Tibetan "political prisoners" during his official 
visit here, Dutch embassy sources said Wednesday. 
  "No progress was made on the KLM file", the Netherlands 
national airline's bid to open an air link between Beijing and 
Amsterdam, they added. 
  Kooijmans, who left Beijing Wednesday, had talks with Prime 
Minister Li Peng, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Justice 
Minister Xiao Yang. "The human rights issue was discussed more 
in detail with Qian Qichen," a diplomatic source said. It was 
during this meeting that Kooijmans submitted his list of 
political prisoners and asked China to "pay attention to these 
cases," the diplomat added. 
  Kooijmans, a professor of international law, is a former 
United Nations rapporteur on human rights in China. His visit 
coincided with the arrests and detention of several dissidents, 
including democracy movement leader Wei Jingsheng, in a 
crackdown on opposition circles. 
  China responded harshly Tuesday to U.S. attacks on its 
human rights record. 
  "No foreign country, organisation or individual has the 
right 
to make irresponsible remarks or interfere," a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. 
  The diplomatic sources signalled no progress on the air 
links 
dispute. KLM is banned from landing in China because it runs 
flights to Taiwan, China's Nationalist rival. 
  KLM is the only European airline to operate daily flights to 
Taipei, and China has insisted that it suspend these flights as 
a condition of opening up links with Beijing. 
  The Taipei route is one of KLM's most profitable and it is 
loath to abandon it because Taiwan has warned that unlike other 
European airlines which operate the route through subsidiaries, 
it will not allow a subsidiary for the Dutch company to land in 
Taiwan.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (AFP)--As the world's fourth 
largest economic power, France does not have the place it 
deserves in China and plans to "bridge the gap" it sees in its 
economic relations with the communist giant, France's ambassador 
here said Wednesday. 
  Speaking to foreign journalists, Francois Marcel Plaisant 
said just 1.6 percent of Chinese imports come from France. 
Increasing that number will be one of the priorities of Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur when he visits China next month, the 
first visit by a French premier since 1978. 
  "One of the main objectives of the French government is to 
bridge the gap between between the French share in world trade 
and the French share in the Chinese economy," Plaisant said. 
  After more than a year of cool relations following France's 
sale to Taiwan of Mirage fighter planes, the two countries 
signed a normalization agreement in January. France promised 
not to sell any more offensive weaponry to Taiwan, and China 
indicated French companies were again welcome to do business. 
  French investment in China came to 250 million francs (45 
million dollars) in 1992, as against 100 billion francs 
worldwide. Still, France extended 12 billion francs (2 billion 
dollars) worth of preferential credits toward China between 1985 
and 1992, second only to Japan.

  [Text] At the 4 March provincial conference of party 
secretaries of the schools of higher learning, Jiang Chunyun, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out the 
need to further strengthen and improve the ideological and 
political work of the schools of higher learning, promote their 
reform, development, and stability, and strive to build well the 
socialist universities with Chinese characteristics. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee, Jiang Chunyun 
set four expectations and demands on the work of the schools of 
higher learning. 
  First, it is imperative to thoroughly study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, adhere to the socialist orientation for running 
schools, build well the socialist universities with Chinese 
characteristics, and strive to bring up the builders and 
successors to carry on the socialist cause who are morally, 
intellectually, and physically developed. 
  Second, firmly focusing on the general objective of 
establishing the socialist market economy system, it is 
imperative to comprehensively promote the reform of the schools 
of higher learning. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Educational 
reform should be focused on the general objective of 
establishing the socialist market economy system, and a new 
mechanism for education compatible with the development of the 
socialist market economy should be established as soon as 
possible. 
  Third, it is imperative to greatly strengthen and improve 
ideological and political work, train the new people who have 
lofty ideals and moral characters and are better educated and 
well-disciplined, and urge party members, teachers, students, 
and administrative personnel to embrace correct ideals, faith, 
and concepts on life and value. 
  Fourth, it is imperative to further strengthen party 
leadership over the schools of higher learning, improve their 
leading bodies, attach importance to upgrading their teachers 
and cadres in charge of political work, and increase investment 
in higher education. 
  Jiang Chunyun urged the schools of higher learning to uplift 
the spirit, unite as one, work in a down-to-earth manner, and

  [Text] Nanjing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province has taken new steps to boost rural economic development 
and accelerate the adaptation of its agricultural sector to the 
market economy. 
  Based on the improved contracted responsibility system for 
agricultural production, contracted rights and utilization 
rights of land can be divided and transferred to promote 
production. 
  Establishment of collective farms and small household farms 
are encouraged to promote the sizeable management of the land. 
  Further reform measures will be introduced to the markets 
for 
major agricultural products. The prices of grain, cotton and 
cocoon silk will be shifted to the control of the market from 
the traditional uniform state pricing system. 
  The provincial government also aims to increase agricultural 
input by readjusting the allocation of funds. It is stipulated 
that the annual growth rate of expenditure on agriculture must 
be higher than that of the total in the financial budgets of 
governments at all levels. 
  More capital will be earmarked for building and renovating 
irrigation works and water-conservancy facilities. 
  Moreover, funds for agricultural technology research will be 
increased and more credits and loans will be provided to farmers. 
  Export-oriented agricultural development zones will be set 
up 
to expand the opening-up of rural economy and accelerate 
agricultural restructuring. 
  Disaster-relief reserve funds will be established to 
guarantee supplies of materials for farming production. 
  Poverty-relief efforts will continue to be emphasized. The 
provincial government has earmarked 100 million yuan as special 
loans to boost township enterprises in poor areas.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, the 
financial and commercial center of China, approved in the past 
month some 308 overseas-funded projects, involving a total 
investment of about 640 million U.S. dollars, according to 
official sources. 
  Figures from the municipal foreign economic relations and 
trade commission show that 256 of these foreign-funded projects 
are in industry, with a total contractual investment of about 
320 million U.S. dollars. 
  Other popular sectors, such as real estate and public 
utilities services, which last year absorbed most of the foreign 
funds flowing into Shanghai, in February attracted the smaller 
proportion of the total overseas investment. 
  However, experts say that overseas investors will still take 
interest in the real estate sector as Shanghai is stepping up 
the construction of an international financial and trade power 
houses. 
  "Anyway, the amount of foreign investment in real estate 
this 
year will not be less than 1993's," they predicted. 
  Official statistics show that though the number of 
foreign-funded projects in February was sightly higher than in 
the same period last year, the total of contractual foreign 
investment was 150 million U.S. dollars less than last year. 
  According to sources from the commission, Hong Kong is 
currently ranking top among investors, pouring some 410 million 
U.S. dollars into 136 projects, accounting for 64 percent of the 
total overseas investment. 
  The sources said that Japanese businesses have expanded 
their 
investment in Shanghai this year. In February, they invested 
more than 50 million U.S. dollars in Shanghai, up 54 percent on 
the same period last year. 
  Countries which each have invested more than ten million 
U.S. 
dollars in Shanghai include the United States, Britain, 
Singapore and the Philippines. 
  Official statistics show that to date, business people from 
56 countries and regions in the world have invested in Shanghai, 
involving a total investment of some 14.9 billion U.S. dollars 
in 7,547 projects.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has recently 
instituted an examination and approval procedure for real estate 
companies. 
  Funds started to rush into the real estate industry in 
Shanghai, China's large metropolis, in April 1990, when the 
State Council declared Pudong, part of the city, an open area. 
  In 1991, more than 63 million dollars worth of foreign funds 
poured into the real estate industry in the area. In 1992, the 
figure soared to some 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and in 1993 it 
further jumped to 3.4 billion U.S. dollars. 
  It is estimated that by the end of 1995, there will be more 
than 100 high rise buildings in the Pudong new area alone. 
  At the same time, more than 100 real estate companies came 
into being. They included state-owned, collective-owned, 
jointly-funded and private-run ones, sprouted into being. 
  These companies broke away with the convention that official 
housing departments should monopolise housing development. 
  However, quite a number of these companies were only 
money-minded and often failed to meet their clients' needs, 
according to local housing development agencies. 
  The examination system aims to tighten the management of 
these companies and push forward the housing reform, some 
officials said. 
  Under the system, Shanghai Housing Bureau will be the 
administrative body for the real estate industry. 
  The system stipulates that a real estate company must 
possess, or be entrusted to develop an area of more than 10,000 
sq m [square meters], and have a registered capital of more than 
200,000 yuan, have legal management rules, have a fixed, 
registered company address and necessary managerial personnel. 
  The real estate managerial personnel are required to have 
professional diplomas or certificates.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 7 (XINHUA) -- China's reform of its 
labor employment system is pounding at lifelong-employment which 
was practised for decades, and opening a channel for enterprises 
to shift their operational mechanism. 
  In Shanghai, China's largest economic center, it is now 
common for both staff and workers to get their jobs through 
competition. 
  According to the latest statistics, more than 1.6 million 
employees, accounting for 97.53 percent of the total, at state 
enterprises in Shanghai, are working under labor contracts in 
different forms. 
  A municipal government official in charge of the reform said 
that Shanghai began the reform of its labor employment system in 
1992. Altogether 1,118 enterprises, accounting for 82.94 percent 
of the total, are participating in the reform. 
  "Getting jobs through competition has given both enterprises 
and employees more opportunities to choose each other," the 
official noted. 
  The transactional volume of Shanghai's Farm Machinery 
Company 
and the Machinery and Electrical Appliance Import and Export 
Company has been expanded by linking income to output. 
  The Shanghai No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant has drawn up a plan 
to train its employees technically and widen their general 
knowledge. 
  Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the 
Chinese Government had carried out the "iron rice bowl" system 
-- a term signifying commitment to secure employment and the 
guarantee that the state would provide at least the basic 
necessities for everyone. 
  The reform of the labor system in Shanghai, China's leading 
industrial center, has cut 5.18 percent of the workforce from 
the state-owned sector. 
  A survey shows that many of these people wanted to try the 
market economy. 
  After leaving his former post, Zhang Miaoguo, a worker at a 
large state enterprise in the Minhang District of suburban 
Shanghai, found a job as a cleaner at the social service 
department under the Shanghai Fuyu Quanye Development Company. 
  Although his job is dirtier than his former one, he earns 
more than before. 
  After giving up her "iron rice bowl" post, Ye Aguo, a 
47-year-old female worker is serving as a casual laborer in the 
neighborhood and earns more than 300 yuan per month. She is 
satisfied with her present work. 
  According to the municipal labor department, Shanghai will 
focus on improving the social security setup to pave the way for 
a more flexible labor market.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Scientific farming in 
east China's Jiangsu Province has paid off. 
  A survey shows that farmers obtained an additional 2.43 
billion yuan from growing new varieties of grain and cotton on 
eight million hectares of farmland, averaging 240 yuan per 
household over the past three years. 
  Jiangsu began to encourage farmers in 1990 to undertake 
scientific farming in line with the market economy. 
  The province now has 12 comprehensive experimental farm 
centers, 324 townships and more than 2,000 villages doing 
pioneer work in the application of agro-science, and 150,000 
households specializing in scientific farming. 
  These organizations and households have formed a network to 
popularize agro-science. 
  While encouraging scientists to go to the rural areas to 
help 
farmers boost production, Jiangsu has paid attention to 
importing advanced technology for growing grapes and apples and 
cultivating rice.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
Province, the country's leading silk producer and exporter, has 
recovered from a slump by updating its technologies and 
retooling equipment. 
  The silk industry, like other traditional manufacturing 
sectors in Zhejiang and elsewhere in China, has been enlivened 
through input of new and high technology. 
  Since the beginning of the 1990s, Zhejiang has focused on 
the 
development of industries that concentrate on high technology 
and are capital intensive, and yield high added value. 
  High-tech development zones have been set up in this 
provincial capital, the port city of Ningbo and Wenzhou, where 
private enterprise thrives. 
  The machinery, chemicals, construction materials, textiles 
and light industry sectors have achieved better product quality 
and lower costs through the introduction of advanced technology. 
  According to Chang Jinming, deputy director of the 
provincial 
science and technology commission, as a province rich in labor 
but short on energy, resources and transportation, the only way 
for Zhejiang to gain a competitive edge in a market economy is 
to bring labor resources and technology into full play.

  [Text] Guangdong Province posted record growth in foreign 
trade last year. The province's two-way trade hit US$46.9 
billion (about HK$362.06 billion [Hong Kong dollars]), which 
breaks down to $19.9 billion worth of imports and $27 billion 
worth of exports This is an increase of 71 percent for imports 
and 4 percent for exports over 1992. The export volume ranked 
first for the eighth consecutive year among China's provinces, 
municipalities and regions. The figure raised the province's 
export volume percentage from 24.3 percent in 1992 to 29.4 
percent last year. 
  Guangdong signed 19,012 cooperation contracts last year with 
overseas investors, involving contractual foreign investment 
worth $34.89 billion, a rise of 47.2 percent and 75.7 percent 
over 1992, respectively. The province used more than $9.65 
billion in foreign investment last year, up 98.6 percent over a 
year earlier. The figure is about 26.25 percent of the foreign 
investment used in China. Provincial officials said the growth 
rates were all unprecedented. 
  There are now 1,000 foreign trade enterprises in Guangdong. 
Many large foreign trade enterprises have formed trade groups, 
and 56 foreign enterprises have been singled out to experiment 
with reform policies. 
  In recent years, Guangdong has been engaged in rationalizing 
its import and export pattern. As a result, export of primary 
products have dropped, while export of machinery, electrical and 
textile products have increased. The province has also 
increased its imports of infrastructural products raw materials 
and hi-tech items. Exports of machinery electrical and textile 
products increased last year and the province also increased its 
imports of products and raw materials for infrastructural 
projects. 
  Officials said Guangdong has established close trade and 
economic relations with more than 50 countries and regions all 
over the world, and the province's exports have be come more 
diversified. Following the reform and liberalization efforts, 
Guangdong has remained a favoured area for foreign investment 
for more than a decade. Investment now pours in from over 70 
countries and regions worldwide. 
  While investment from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan keeps 
increasing, some developed countries like Japan, Sweden, Canada, 
Australia and Britain have also raised their investments by 
large margins. Overseas investors are showing more interest in 
the province's telecommunications, energy, transportation, real 
estate, commerce, trade and tourism sectors. 
  The number of large and technology-intensive investment 
projects has increased. Some translational corporations and 
financial groups have invested heavily in Guangdong's power 
projects as well as bridge and road building. Sources said the 
mountainous areas of Guangdong have attracted 115 percent more 
foreign investment than in 1992. Guangdong give licences to 
44,705 foreign-invested enterprises by the end of last year.

After Taxi Company Gives Warning That Those Continuing To Strike 
Will Not Be Allowed To Hire Taxis"] 
  [Text] Following the participation of nearly half of all 
taxi drivers the day before yesterday, the three-day strike 
initiated by Shenzhen taxi drivers basically ended yesterday. 
  A taxi driver estimated that only about 10 percent of the 
drivers continued with the strike yesterday. In front of the 
communications building, taxis again formed a long line to wait 
for passengers. 
  The driver said: The strike ended quickly as a result of the 
involvement of the taxi company. The company issued a circular 
to taxi drivers, saying that if they continued to strike, they 
would not be allowed to hire taxis. The drivers had no 
alternative but to return to work. 
  But some drivers who were still on strike said that they 
would take further action after collecting views from people in 
the same trade.

  [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- China Securities 
Regulatory Committee (CSRC), the country's top securities 
watchdog, has nullified a recent decision of the Shenzhen 
securities authorities. 
  The Shenzhen decision would have allowed trading in 1994 
bonus shares issued by former wholly state-owned enterprises six 
months after they were issued. 
  This is allowed for individual shareholders, but not for the 
50 percent of shares held by the enterprise on behalf of the 
state, nor for the 30 percent of the shares which may have been 
bought by other enterprises. 
  "Trading of state shares is an important issue concerning 
the 
readjustment of the government securities policy," said Zhu Li, 
the CSRC spokesman. 
  "Local securities offices or stock exchanges have no right 
to 
make any decision disregarding present relevant government 
rules." 
  So far, trading in shares other than those held by 
individuals is banned because it involves aspects of transfer of 
national property rights. 
  Zhu said that the CSRC had not been notified of the decision 
by Shenzhen securities office until the Beijing body read it 
today in a Shanghai newspaper. 
  But he said that the issue of allowing trading in those 
shares was now under heated discussion.

  [Text] Shenzhen, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Crossing points in 
this special economic zone bordering Hong Kong have adopted new 
management methods to make it more convenient for people and 
goods to enter and leave. 
  To make the work more efficient, some of the examination and 
management fees are now collected at one go by the city 
immigration office without change of payment standards, instead 
of payment item by item. 
  Beginning May 1 this year, freight vehicles going through 
land ports will receive unified examination concerning customs 
affairs, sanitation and animal and plant quarantine. 
  As a result, freight vehicles entering or leaving the border 
only have to stop twice instead of four times as at present. 
  By the end of the year computers will be installed at the 
crossing points to handle examination and payment.

  [Text] Nanning, March 4 (CNS) -- The Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region has made noticeable achievements in cracking 
down on gun-and drug-smuggling with over 1,000 firearms of 
various kinds and a batch of narcotics being seized and 49 gun- 
and drug-smuggling gangs campaigned against within just the last 
half-year. 
  Since the normalization of relations between China and 
Vietnam, the two countries have seen their border trade 
developing very rapidly while at the same time criminal 
activities including gun- and drug-smuggling across the border 
have been increasingly rampant. Starting from June last year, 
the frontier guards under the armed police force in the region 
have concentrated their strength and adopted effective measures 
to fight against such criminal actiities with the cracking down 
on 152 gun- and drug-smuggling cases involving 1,463 firearms, 
7,179 bullets, 418 grenades, 69.037 kilograms of opium and 7.099 
kilograms of heroin being seized and 49 criminal rings involving 
239 persons smashed. 
  The executive deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee, Mr. Ding Tingmu, speaking at a victory meeting on 
fighting against these crimes, said that the fight facing the 
region against these criminal activities remained arduous since 
there was a land and sea border of over 2,000 kilometres to 
patrol there. In order to safeguard the normal order of 
production and living and the economic development in the border 
areas, the fight against such crime would be carried on for a 
long time to come.

  [Text] Haikou, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Hainan Province in 
south China has poured more than one billion yuan into improving 
its telecommunications service during the past six years. 
  The installed capacity of urban telephones has reached more 
than 200,000 lines, eight times that of 1988, when setting up 
the province, as well as designating it as the largest special 
economic zone in China, was approved by the State Council. 
  The capital city of Haikou now has 27 telephones for every 
100 people, ranking among the top of China's provincial capital 
cities. 
  At present, automatic telephone service has been put into 
operation at or above the country town level. The province is 
thus on line with more than 1,400 cities at home and 195 
countries and regions in the world. 
  Various advanced communications facilities related to 
digital 
micro-wave, optical fiber, satellite, program-control, mobile 
and paging functions are in service in the province. 
  During the six-year period, the capacity of switchboards in 
the province's rural areas increased by 90 percent.

year from both at home and abroad. 
  Already, the sources said, eight illegal buildings, 
including 
residential houses of city officials and an office building of 
the city bureau of cultural relics, have been removed.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 4 (XINHUA) -- The Foreign Investment 
Office and the Administration for Industry and Commerce of Wuhan 
city, capital of Hubei Province, recently revoked licences of 26 
unqualified Sino-foreign joint ventures. 
  This is the first time that Wuhan city has withdrawn the 
business permits from joint ventures. 
  The 26 companies were engaged -- or supposed to be -- in 
operations in food-stuffs, catering services, fashion, video 
tapes, medical instruments, car repairs and leather processing. 
  Sources said that some of the shut-down joint ventures had 
not started operating even three or four years after they 
registered with the local administration for industry and 
commerce. Others had suspended trading for several years after 
some conflicts within the enterprises. 
  A few of the enterprises even had no permanent location and 
had disappeared from the city. 
  Sun Shiyu, director of Wuhan Foreign Investment Office, said 
that a few of the joint ventures failed to meet the demands of 
the market and their products could not be sold at home or 
abroad. 
  He said that there were also some overseas businessmen who 
had no capital at all and ran their operations entirely by 
borrowing money from banks in the city. When the local banks 
refused to lend them loans, they failed in their attempts. 
  Now Wuhan Foreign Investment Office and Wuhan Municipal 
Administration for Industry and Commerce are jointly tightening 
up supervision of the operations of registered joint ventures so 
as to help overseas-funded enterprises to function normally.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Excerpt] Protests erupted in Hubei province days before 
the Lunar New Year among peasants forced to leave their homes to 
make way for the massive Three Gorges dam project. 
  The Premier, Li Peng, shortly afterwards ordered a State 
Council inspection team to visit the scene of three separate 
incidents in Yichang county, where an immediate injection of 
funds was promised to resolve the problem, a Yichang city 
official said. 
  But Beijing may be concerned that the provincial and local 
governments have orchestrated or turned a blind eye to the 
protests in order to draw the central government's attention to 
the plight of the displaced people, most of whom have received 
little or no compensation and remain in temporary housing. A 
mass propaganda rally will run for three days from Sunday in 
Yichang city. The Hubei Governor, Jia Zhijie, will officiate 
and hopes this will attract national press coverage. 
  Lu Youmei, the president of the State Council's China Three 
Gorges Development Corporation in Beijing, has been persuaded to 
give a speech at the rally. A former vice-minister of water 
conservancy and of energy resources, Lu is expected to pledge 
Beijing's "all-round support" to solve the resettlement problem. 
  Details of the new year resettlement flare-ups are scant, 
but 
it is understood that resistance to resettlement has been most 
acute among the elderly, whose job opportunities in new areas 
are poor and who are worried the 90 renminbi (about HK$80) per 
month promised to resettled pensioners may not materialise. 
"The protests were quite superficial, but Beijing took notice 
of them," one official said. 
  Sources in Yichang said the freezing weather in January 
exacerbated discontent among more than 5,000 residents who had 
been left in flimsy temporary housing because of slow progress 
at new housing sites in Zigui and Xingshan counties. "In fact, 
not a single family has moved into new permanent housing, 
because of slow progress and a lack of funds," one official 
said. Most of the 5,000 Yichang settlers were promised they 
would spend the Spring Festival in new houses far superior to 
what they left behind. Misuse of compensation funds earmarked 
for residents has intensified resentment. 
  Compensation commitments for each family range from a few 
thousand to as much as RMB 80,000, depending on the size and 
condition of the housing that will be lost, which has also 
stirred a great many charges of unequal treatment. 
  Yichang's government had initially agreed only to offer 
subsidies of RMB 20,000 to RMB 30,000 to residents, leaving some 
without enough funds to build new homes. "The living conditions 
of these people have deteriorated very rapidly because the 
expected support from Beijing has not materialised," one 
official said. 
  Following the protests, Beijing agreed to bolster the RMB 
44m 
set aside by the provincial and local governments for the proper 
resettlement of the 5,000 people. It also promised to speed up 
approval of privileged policies similar to those in special 
economic zones to draw foreign investment into the public 
facilities and cheap housing sectors. "Foreign interest in 
resettlement projects has been minimal, but we realise this is 
part of the `all-round support' needed if we are to avoid future 
disturbances," an official said. 
  The situation has rekindled memories of communist China's 
resettlement efforts of the past, which Beijing admits have left 
3 million people in dire straits since 1949. About 100,000 
people in Hubei province and 950,000 people in Sichuan province 
will be moved by the year 2000 to make way for the dam. An 
additional 10,000 Yichang residents should be resettled in the 
next few years. [passage omitted]

have gone into operation, including Dayong Airport, three 
telecommunication projects and a bridge.

  [Text] Changsha, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hunan 
Province has boosted export-oriented vegetable production in the 
bid to increase farmers' income. 
  The province has taken full advantage of local geographic 
conditions, with two cities and a prefecture bordering on 
Guangdong Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 
which are near to Hong Kong, Macao and Vietnam. 
  It has set up sales agencies in Guangdong and Guangxi to 
promote vegetable exports to Hong Kong, Macao and Vietnam. 
  Last year lingling prefecture exported over 200 million kg 
of 
garlic, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and radishes to Hong Kong and 
Vietnam, double the total of the previous year. 
  Tinned chillies from the Jianghua Autonomous County of the 
Yao nationality sells well on world markets. The product was 
the winner of a gold medal for new products at the fifth Chinese 
Commodity Fair. 
  Changsha, Yueyang and Hengyang cities exported 1,300 tons of 
tinned mushrooms last year, and more mushroom-growing villages 
and towns have emerged. 
  Guidong, Pingjiang and Lengshuijiang cities have succeeded 
in 
growing non-polluted vegetables for export. 
  Now the province has built up a number of export-oriented 
vegetable-growing bases with priority on developing more 
varieties and improving quality. 
  Meanwhile, advanced storage, processing and package 
techniques are being stressed.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province must open wider to the outside world to boost 
its economy, according to Xie Shijie, secretary of the 
provincial committee of the Communist Party. 
  In an article carried in the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" today, Xie 
said 
the province's gross domestic product last year increased by 
12.8 percent over the previous year, its industrial output value 
by 20.9 percent, and its agricultural output value by 1.5 
percent, despite natural disasters. 
  "However, we must be clear about the fact that the 
development of Sichuan is still behind that of the coastal 
provinces," Xie noted. 
  According to Xie, 1994 is a key year for China to develop 
its 
socialist market economy, and Sichuan has pledged to increase 
its gross domestic product by 9.6 percent and industrial and 
agricultural output value by 12.8 percent. 
  "To accomplish the objective," the secretary said, "Sichuan, 
with a territory of 570,000 sq [square] km and a population of 
more than 100 million, must rely on itself." 
  The secretary encouraged localities to open wider to the 
outside world in order to boost its economy. 
  Last year saw the province succeed in holding a number of 
trade seminars in Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand and the Republic of 
Korea. 
  It imported investment totalling more than two billion U.S. 
dollars and set up 1,900 foreign-funded enterprises. 
  More and more international financial groups are showing 
interest in tapping the province's energy resources and 
improving its transportation facilities. 
  In addition, Sichuan has made progress in exports, overseas 
labor service, opening enterprises abroad and tourism, Xie 
revealed.

<F P=106> [Video report by reporter Li Yuangao (2621 6678 7559) and </F>
correspondent Yan Xinggao (2518 5281 7559) -- from the "Regional 
News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] After having satisfactorily fulfilled various 
tasks, a regional conference on judicial, procuratorial, and 
public security work ended on the afternoon of 26 February. 
Deputies attending the meeting held group discussions on how to 
improve judicial, procuratorial, and public security work to 
maintain social stability in Tibet under the new situation. 
Their dicussions revolved around Comrade Zi Cheng's report. 
They made valuable suggestions in light of the actual 
conditions of judicial, procuratorial, and public security work 
in their respective localities, departments, and units and in 
light of certain important issues raised by Comrade Zi Cheng in 
his report. 
  Gyaincain Norbu, Danzim, Zi Cheng, Pudoje, Namgyai, Gyamco, 
Zhou Qishun, (Bai Zhao), and Zhang Zhu, leaders of the 
autonomous region, attended the closing ceremony. 
  Gyamco, executive vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous 
Regional People's Government and deputy secretary of the Tibet 
Regional Commission on Politics and Law, delivered a concluding 
speech. He said: The year 1994 is an extremely important one for 
China to deepen reform. The number of destablizing factors will 
continue to increase due to the readjustment of the relationship 
of interests and due to various reasons existing at home and 
abroad. We must truly carry out judicial, procuratorial, and 
public security work under the new situation of our effort to 
meet the needs of reform and opening up; we must spend time and 
effort on implementation; we must persist in and carry forward 
the fine tradition of integrating special organs with the mass 
line; we must catch up with the pace of our times by reforming 
ourselves. 
  Chairman Gyaincain Norbu of the Tibet Autonomous Regional 
People's Government delivered a speech at the closing ceremony. 
He called on those who are engaged in judicial, procuratorial, 
and public security work to have a clear understanding of the 
situation; to seek unity of thinking; to persist in the 
principle of attaching equal importance to two types of work 
[promote reform and opening up and, at the same time, crack down 
on various criminal activities], and to persist in taking a 
tough stand on both so as to provide a stable environment for 
reform, opening up, and economic construction; to vigorously 
wage struggle against splittism in a bid to ensure stability in 
the whole region; to persist in the principle of dealing a harsh 
blow to criminals and to step up the crackdown; to further 
mobilize the forces from all walks of life to vigorously improve 
comprehensive management of public security; to successfully 
carry out self-construction by the contingents of personnel for 
judicial, procuratorial, and public security work in a 
down-to-earth manner; and to strengthen the party's leadership 
over judicial, procuratorial, and public security work.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The final stage of the 
renovation project on the Potala Palace has started here in the 
capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  During this final stage, workers are expected to repair and 
reconstruct ancillary parts of the Potala Palace, including the 
Western Buddhist Scriptural Printing House and the numerous 
turrets on the ancient city wall. 
  Located on a hill in the heart of the Lhasa River Valley, 
the 
13- story palace, with 10,000 separate buildings, houses a great 
number of precious cultural relics as well as eight pearl-inlaid 
and gold- plated stupas holding the remains of the fifth and 
seventh to 13th Dalai Lamas. 
  The renovation of the whole Potala Palace started in October 
1989. The entire reconstruction work, which is carried out in 
four main phases, will cost the central government 33 million 
yuan. 
  After four periods of repair work, reconstruction of all 
principal parts of the palace has been completed and has passed 
appraisal by experts. 
  Palace maintenance workers have now been working hard on the 
restoration of cultural relics in each of the halls. Some of 
the halls have been opened to visitors and believers. 
  Besides working out a set of comprehensive, scientific, 
strict management rules and regulations, local officials said 
that they planned to install some advanced security equipment to 
help prevent fires, guard against theft, give alarms, and carry 
out visual supervision through closed circuit TV. 
  The officials added that the final stage of the restoration 
is expected to be completed at the end of next July. A grand 
ceremony will be held in early August to mark the completion of 
the entire rebuilding project.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's Tibet 
Autonomous Region has over the past few years stepped up its 
"green drive", to improve the stock-raising ecological 
environment. 
  By now the region has a total afforested area of some 23,450 
ha [hectares], including more than 201 ha of nurseries of young 
trees and over 2.4 million economic trees. 
  Currently, the annual afforestation area in the region has 
jumped to more than 50,000 ha from 20,000 ha in the past years, 
according to official statistics. 
  Since Tibet began its drive for economic development in the 
areas along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the biggest river in this 
region, local governments have concentrated some manpower as 
well as funds on the afforestation drive. 
  After years of hard work, a 20-km-long forest belt of some 
670 ha has been formed along the southern bank of the river. 
  Official sources said that Tibet is one of the few regions 
of 
the country which have protected the environment well and 
Tibet's good ecology is still in good condition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Report: "Frontier Area Bids For New Markets"] </F>
  [Text] Once a closed province in Southwest China, Yunnan 
is now opening itself up to the outside world. 
  Governor He Zhiqiang said, "Development of foreign trade is 
the only way in which the province can be lifted out its 
closed-door mentality and backwardness. We'll do all we can to 
take part in world trade to promote our local economy. This is 
a good opportunity for us to catch up with world development." 
  Bordering Viet Nam, Myanmar and the Laos, the province is in 
an ideal position to open itself up to the outside world. 
  Yunnan's capital Kunming and the three border cities of 
Wanding, Ruili and Hekou, are in the forefront of promoting 
foreign economic relations. 
  Situated in a remote mountainous area, the province has a 
bountiful supply of nonferrous metal resources and a large 
variety of animals, plants and medical herbs. 
  But, its commodity-based economy is still under-developed. 
And its economic and social development is imbalanced. Though 
some of its products such as tobacco, have occupied an important 
position in China, Yunnan's economy and education still lag 
behind that of other parts of the country. 
  In the 21st Century, Southeast Asia will be one of the 
world's most vibrant economic centres. With its advantages in 
geography and natural resources, Yunnan wants to develop its 
economy so that it capture its share of the trade in the 
Asian-Pacific Region. 
  To reach this objective, the province will take the 
following 
measures: 
  1. Adjust the industrial structure to suit the development 
of export-oriented economy and transform raw material industries 
into raw material processing industries. A Southeast 
Asia-oriented industrial system to produce such daily 
necessities like beverages, rubber and wood products, garments, 
textiles, shoes and building materials, will be established. 
  2. Attract more foreign investment through sponsorship of 
import and export trade fairs in the province and overseas. The 
province had approved a total of 682 foreign-funded enterprises 
with a contractual value of $1.46 billion by November of last 
year. A total of 407 such enterprises were approved in 1993, 
attracting $938 million of foreign funds, nearly twice as much 
as the total of the past 13 years. Yunnan's exports valued $21 
million in 1993. In addition to the first import and export 
trade fair in Kunming, the province organized fairs in 
Singapore, Northern Europe and Hong Kong last year. 
  The Kunming fair attracted 5,169 businessmen from 45 
countries and regions and sealed $1.57 billion worth of trade 
contracts. Most of the traders were from Southeast Asian 
countries, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The Kunming fair has 
become one of the country's most important trade fairs, together 
with the Guangzhou fair in the south, Shanghai fair in the east, 
Urumqi fair in the west and Harbin fair in the north. 
  3. Establishing various markets to promote commodity and 
material exchange in a bid to link up with the rest of the 
world. Over the past years, 3,096 markets covering agricultural 
and side-line products, information, capital and properties have 
been set up in the province. Specialized markets in machinery, 
tobacco and cigarettes, sugar and tea, and information have seen 
brisk business. 
  4. More to be done to boost border trade. The border trade 
value was 2.27 billion yuan ($260 million) in 1992, up 35 per 
cent over the previous year and making up 30 per cent of 
Yunnan's total foreign trade. Menghai County earned 100 million 
yuan ($11 million) in border trade in the first eight months of 
last year, up 11 times over the previous year. 
  6. More attention to be paid to enhancing regional economic 
co-operation. An economic co-operative network covering Yunnan, 
Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, Tibet and Chongqing and Chengdu 
cities has been taking shape. 
  5. Development of its tourism industry to increase foreign 
exchange earnings, balance revenue and expenditure and promote 
other kinds of industries. 
  Yunnan has a vast number of tourist attractions. It boasts 
six State-designated beauty spots, 30 provincially-designated 
historical sites and seven State-designated travel routes. In 
1992, the province received more than 310,000 overseas visitors. 
The figure increased several times in 1993.

"Province To Develop Its Export Industries"] 
  [Text] Yunnan hopes to rejuvenate its economy by 
developing export-oriented industries and opening up domestic 
and world markets. 
  The province has set up the Beijing Yunnan Economic and 
Trade 
Promotion Corporation Limited in Beijing to help develop 
Yunnan's export-oriented economy and to establish trade ties 
with countries like the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  Over the past decade, the province has achieved significant 
progress in economic development. Its gross domestic product 
increased from 6.9 billion yuan ($793 million) in 1979 to 64.8 
billion yuan ($7.4 billion) last year. The annual revenue 
jumped from 1.1 billion yuan ( $126 million) to 20 billion yuan 
($2.2 billion) during the same period. 
  Moreover, the province invested more than 10 billion yuan 
($1.1 billion) in a number of infrastructure projects involving 
communications, energy, telecommunications and water 
conservation. 
  Yunnan's foreign trade was valued at $840 million including 
2.8 billion yuan ($321 million) of border trade deals in 1993. 
  Located on the Southwest border of China, the province is 
rich in natural resources. It is well aware of its potential to 
become an export-orientated economy. 
  Last year, the province produced 874,000 tons of tobacco, 
5.3 
cases of cigarettes 92,000 tons of rubber, 63,000 tons of tea, 
750,000 tons of tropical fruit,270,000 tons of nonferrous metals 
and 5 million tons of phosphate ores. 
  There's been a boost in exports to Southwest and South Asia, 
Europe, Australia and the United States. And the province also 
aims to concentrate on opening up markets in North, Northeast 
and Northwest China. 
  Yunnan plans to adjust its industrial structure to develop 
perfume, pharmaceutical, building material and wood processing 
industries. 
  Yunnan, which has a population of more than 38 million, has 
an abundance of biological, mineral and energy resources. 
  Sharing a long land border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar 
and 
linked to Thailand and Cambodia by the same river, the province 
is China's gateway to Southeast Asia. 
  With its neighbours keen to foster trade links, Yunnan is in 
a good position to take an active part in cross border trade. 
  The government has recently worked out a plan to speed up 
the 
pace of development in the western part of the country in the 
1990s. 
  To implement the plan, five of China's southwestern regions, 
Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi and Tibet, are working 
together to enhance economic co-operation and open up to the 
outside world. 
  Sponsored by the five provinces and Chengdu and Chongqing 
cities, the Kunming Export Commodity Fair held last August 
proved to be a success. 
  During the Third Plenary Session of the Party's 14th 
Congress 
and according to Deng Xiaoping's speech during his trip to South 
China in 1992, emphasis was placed on speeding up economic 
development. In line with this spirit, Yunnan will work hard to 
open its door even further to the outside world. It will import 
more advanced technology, human resources, materials and 
equipment that the province needs. 
  At the same time, Yunnan hopes to export more of its 
products. 
  The Beijing Yunnan Economic and Trade Promotion Corporation 
will establish more trade channels in North and Northeast China 
as well as in foreign countries. 
  The corporation will act as agents for the province and 
promote the sales of various commodities and purchase raw 
materials, technology and equipment. It will also deal with 
real estate and investments; provide information, consultancy, 
transportation and advertising services; absorb foreign 
investment, finance domestic funds and further develop resources 
in the province.

  [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- Taiwan will most likely be 
hit with sanctions by the United States and the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) for alleged 
poor performance in wildlife protection, according to Ted Ting, 
head of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation (BTF). 
  Ting, who is visiting several wildlife protection groups in 
Washington D.C., said in a message to BTF headquarters Wednesday 
[9 March] that there seems to be a consensus among US and CITES 
officials to "sanction Taiwan first and keep the Chinese 
mainland on the watch list." 
  Ting said that the international community seems to be 
losing 
patience over Taiwan's inability to crack down on alleged 
illegal trade in rhino horns and tiger bone. 
  Besides, he added, they are also upset with Taipei's failure 
to keep its promise to submit amendments to its Wildlife 
Protection Law to the Legislative Yuan for approval by the end 
of February. 
  The US and CITES have several times turned down requests by 
non- governmental organizations to impose sanction against 
Taiwan. 
  But now, Ting said, they believe Taiwan is not serious about 
improving its wildlife protection record. 
  In related news, Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung of the 
Council 
of Agriculture said Wednesday that his council will send the 
revised Wildlife Protection Law to the legislature March 20.

<F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- A recently-completed 
Ministry of National Defense (MND) white paper on Taiwan 
security issues concluded that Beijing remains Taiwan's top 
security threat and would be most likely to attack if the island 
declares independence. 
  The soon-to-be released white paper discussed events which 
would provoke a mainland attack and detailed possible military 
tactics Beijing would use against Taiwan. 
  The paper also listed the six most likely ways Beijing would 
attack Taiwan with an airstrike across the Taiwan Strait topping 
the list. 
  Communist forces might opt for a sudden missile attack 
against targets on Taiwan's west coast, the paper said, or seize 
the pretext of fishing disputes to confront Taiwan's navy. 
  The MND said that Beijing may prefer to lure Taiwan air and 
sea forces into battle after first attacking Taiwan-held islands 
or supply vessels plying the Taiwan Strait. 
  Another tactic would be a rapid invasion and takeover of 
Taiwan-held islands using a small combat force, the paper noted. 
  And rounding out the list would be a conventional, 
full-scale 
assault on Taiwan using a combination of strategies and forces. 
  The white paper said that Taiwan faces an increased threat 
from Beijing since the Communists have stepped up the pace of 
their military buildup. 
  Sources from Beijing confirmed recently that Beijing's 
defense budget will increase 20 percent this year to top 50 
billion renminbi (US$5.75 billion). 
  The paper also noted that Taiwan is facing increased 
security 
threats from other Asia-Pacific nations, especially over 
disputes concerning the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands. 
  Defense Minister Sun Chen said Tuesday [8 March] that a 
10-year plan, launched this fiscal year, will upgrade the 
efficiency of the military in both hardware and software buildup 
while cutting the number of personnel. 
  The white paper was the second of its kind. The MND 
published the first edition in February, 1992.

<F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- The government is 
encouraging domestic banks to make inroads into Southeast Asian 
countries in tandem with the "southern strategy." 
  Chen Mu-tsai, director of the Bureau of Monetary Affairs 
under the Ministry of Finance, said Wednesday [9 March] that the 
bureau has mapped out guidelines on financial support for the 
strengthening of trade ties with the Southeast Asian region. 
  Under the guidelines, Chen pointed out, domestic financial 
institutions are encouraged to set up operations in Southeast 
Asia to render services to Taiwan manufacturers, who need easier 
financial access to increase investment. 
  Currently, five Taiwan banks have branches in Southeast 
Asia, 
including the International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in 
Bangkok, the First Commercial Bank and Chiao Tung Bank in 
Singapore, Cathay Investment and Trust Co. in Ho Chi Minh City, 
and Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Ltd. in Hong Kong. 
  Nine others maintain representative offices including ICBC 
and Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Manila, the Export-Import Bank 
of the Republic of China [ROC] and Chinatrust in Jakarta, and 
the First Commercial Bank and Chinatrust in Hong Kong. 
  More banks are gearing up to follow suit, Chen noted, saying 
Taiwan investors wanting to go to Southeast Asia will benefit 
from increased availability of financing. 
  The financial strategy also calls for the export-import bank 
to enhance services in loans and guarantees for the export of 
technical engineering, export insurance, and overseas investment 
insurance. 
  In addition, domestic leasing companies which have offices 
in 
Southeast Asia and engage in the business of machinery leasing 
will be covered by the credit guarantee fund for overseas 
Chinese financing. 
  Meanwhile, members of the Legislative Yuan's Financial 
Committee, including legislators H.H. Ho, C.P. Chen, and H.J. 
Hung, are planning to visit Southeast Asia next month to help 
promote efforts to enter the banking business in that region. 
  "We will meet with government officials and parliamentarians 
of those countries and get first-hand information on the 
establishment of foreign bank offices," Ho said. 
  The government's southern strategy has been fueled by 
Premier 
Lien Chan's vacation trip to Malaysia and Singapore at the 
beginning of the year and President Li Teng-hui's unofficial 
visit to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand in February.

  [Text] Taipei, March 3 (CNA) -- Taiwan will push Southeast 
Asian countries to open their financial service markets during 
the forthcoming meeting of finance ministers from the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member states, a 
Finance Ministry official said Thursday [3 March]. 
  Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo, who will represent Taiwan in 
the March 18-19 meeting in Hawaii, will also ask Southeast Asian 
nations to allow Taiwan banks to set up branches in order to 
provide better financial services to Taiwan-invested firms 
there, the official said. 
  Taiwan businessmen have invested more than US$15 billion in 
Southeast Asian nations during the past few years but many 
investors have complained about difficulties in getting 
financing there. Most Southeast Asian nations impose strict 
restrictions on the opening of foreign bank branches. 
  Lin will also discuss the signing of bilateral tax exemption 
agreements with his counterparts from Malaysia, Thailand, 
Indonesia and the Philippines, the official said. Taiwan has 
signed an agreement with Singapore to avoid double taxation on 
investors from either side. Its negotiations with other 
Southeast Asian nations for similar accords have, however, been 
stalled for various reasons. Lin will try to mend differences 
with those nations over the tax issues during the upcoming APEC 
ministerial-level meeting, the official said. 
  APEC groups the United States, Canada, Japan, Singapore, 
Malaysia, The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Taiwan, 
Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, 
Mexico and Papua New Guinea. 
  The Ministry of Finance has proposed three issues -- 
economic 
growth strategy, external financing and capital market 
development -- for Lin and other Taiwan delegates to raise in 
the first-ever APEC finance ministers meeting, the official said. 
  He added that eight APEC members have expressed intentions 
to 
hold bilateral talks with Taiwan during the meeting. The United 
States hopes to discuss problems concerning commodity taxes on 
imported compact cars and other goods; The Philippines wants 
Taiwan to reduce tariffs on coconut and palm oil; and South 
Korea, Japan, Canada and Indonesia will discuss Taiwan's dumping 
charges against them. 
  At the end of their meeting, APEC finance ministers are 
expected to issue a "declaration" or "joint statement" pledging 
to promote regional economic prosperity through free capital 
flows and financial cooperation, the official said. 
  Vice finance ministers from all APEC members are currently 
meeting in Hawaii to work out a full agenda for the 
ministerial-level meeting.

  [Text] Taipei, March 3 (CNA) -- The Council of Labor 
Affairs (COLA), in a major shift of policy, has decided to limit 
the number of foreign laborers working on major construction 
projects to 65 percent of the total work force. 
  Cola Chairman Chao Shou-po said that the new regulation will 
go into effect March 16. 
  Previously, the COLA allowed public construction works to 
rely entirely on foreign laborers, but an easing of Taiwan's 
labor shortage has brought more domestic workers into the labor 
market. The average labor shortage rate in Taiwan was only 2.91 
percent in 1992, down from 5.16 percent in 1987. The labor 
shortage rate measures the percentage of unfilled positions in 
local firms. 
  Meanwhile, despite protests from workers' groups Wednesday 
[2 
March], COLA vice director of the labor-management relations 
department, Lai Ching-fong, reaffirmed COLA's decision to deport 
two Thai workers who the COLA said led a recent strike in 
central Taiwan. 
  The workers groups had requested that COLA overturn its 
decision to deport the two Thai workers. They also asked the 
COLA to provide interpreters for Filipino, Thai, Indonesian and 
Malaysian workers to give the workers a way of voicing their 
complaints. 
  Some 500 Thai workers at Taichung's Cheng Tai Yi 
Construction 
Co., went on strike last week, marking the first foreign 
workers' strike since the introduction of foreign labor to 
Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, March 3 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Economic 
Affairs (MOEA) formed a strategic industrial alliance with a 
Danish environmental technology firm Thursday [3 March]. 
  Under the pact, both sides will cooperate on environmental 
protection technology to produce high value-added products. 
  Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien, who signed the pact 
with Voluno Ecology Systems Chairman S. Costa in Taipei, said 
the deal is the 12th of its kind since the MOEA embarked on the 
mission to form strategic alliances with foreign enterprises. 
  The Voluno group is a world-renowned multinational 
enterprise 
which has been an environmental technology leader for more than 
60 years. The Danish firm has built 170 incinerators in 18 
countries, including the United States, Japan, and Germany. 
  Yang said at the signing ceremony that Voluno will set up 
Asia- Pacific business and manufacturing centers in Taiwan and 
establish long-term cooperative ties with local companies and 
investment consortia. 
  He also stressed that through the alliance, Taiwan will be 
able to upgrade its industrial design and production ability as 
well as boost research and development. 
  Yang said Voluno's willingness to enter into the venture 
reflects its confidence in Taiwan's potential to become a 
Asia-Pacific business hub. 
  The Voluno pact brought the number of foreign enterprises 
which have signed strategic alliances with Taiwan to twelve. 
Strategic alliances have been signed with AT&amp;T, GE, General 
Motors, Motorola, HMM [expansion unknown], Westinghouse, and 
Carpenter Technology Corp. of the United States, Holland's 
Philips, ABB [expansion unknown] of Sweden, CSR [expansion 
unknown] of Australia, and Cida-Geigy Ltd. of Switzerland.

  [Text] China's trade quota will be cut when the European 
Community replaces national trade restrictions with 
Community-wide measures next week; but Britain is arguing 
against trade barriers not only in Europe, but in the United 
States as well. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Anson 
Chan will lobby for unconditional renewal of China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status when she visits 
Washington. Jenny Lam reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Lam] The chief secretary will set out to 
the Americans the importance to Hong Kong of unconditional 
renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status, in 
Washington and New York. 
  [Chan] We don't think that in principle it is right to use 
trade as a tool to achieve other objectives. 
  [Lam] The U.S. wants China to show improvements in human 
rights before deciding whether MFN can be renewed in June. But 
for Hong Kong no MFN means up to 75,000 jobs here may be lost. 
The blow will be even more devastating if Chinese trade is in 
jeopardy not only with the U.S. but with the European Union as 
well. Trade restrictions which apply to all 12 member states of 
the Union will replace national ones next week. China will have 
her quota cut on seven types of products, including 20 percent 
in the toy industry. 
  [Etienne Reuter of European Union Office in Hong Kong, 
identified by screen caption] Given that out of a total of more 
than 7,000 national restrictions in the world, 4,700 concerned 
China, I would say that the trade with China is probably the 
most, you know, concerned with this issue. 
  [Lam] Britain was the only country in the Union which voted 
against slapping trade restrictions on China. The British 
ambassador to China [Sir Robin McLaren] made clear his country 
is keen to maintain a cordial relationship with Beijing despite 
political differences: 
  [McLaren] The British Government attaches enormous 
importance to this area as a whole and is devoting, and I'm sure 
will continue to devote, a great deal of diplomatic effort to 
it, and I'm sure that that will continue after 1997, just as the 
British government will continue to attach enormous importance 
to Hong Kong after 1997. 
  [Lam] Sir Robin added that so far, Sino-British trade is 
business as usual, with no sign of Britain being singled out for 
discrimination. Jenny Lam, TVB News. [end recording]

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 9 (AFP)--Governor Chris Patten 
forged ahead Wednesday with his democratic reforms for Hong 
Kong, tabling stage two of his proposals in the Legislative 
Council despite a souring of Sino-British relations. 
  Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng told 
legislators they should aim to adopt the reforms before July in 
order to prepare for 1995 legislative polls -- the last before 
Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. "The timetable is very 
tight... We must press ahead as quickly as we possibly can," he 
said. 
  China ruled out any more talks with Britain on Hong Kong's 
political development after the Legislative Council, ignoring 
its fierce protests, adopted the first stage of Patten's reforms 
on February 23. 
  Stage two calls for broadening the voting franchise in 1995 
so that all 2.7 million workers in Hong Kong will be able to 
cast ballots for 30 seats reserved for special interest groups 
and industrial sectors. It would also make directly-elected 
district board members responsible for filling another 10 seats 
in the 60-seat legislature -- in which only 20 seats will be 
filled by direct election. 
  Shortly before Wednesday's tabling, China's de facto 
consul-general in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, said they would make no 
difference to the way China will govern the thriving territory 
after 1997. "The Hong Kong British government can do whatever it 
likes... It's not at all surprising," he said in Beijing. 
  Britain's ambassador to Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren, 
currently 
visiting Hong Kong, said he wished the row over Hong Kong's 
political future would not overshadow other 1997 issues. "Our 
wish is to resume cooperation in other areas," he said. 
  The reforms' first stage, intended for local-level polls 
later this year, abolished appointed seats on municipal councils 
and district boards, lowered the minimum voting age from 21 to 
18, and enshrined the principle of British-style, single-seat 
constituencies. 
  Political analysts say Patten's reforms would tend to favor 
liberal politicians who are openly critical of communist-party 
rule in Beijing. 
  Wednesday's tabling came a day before the opening in the 
Chinese capital of the annual National People's Congress, which 
last year mounted fierce attacks on Patten's policies.

  [Text] The first Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
government will be set up well before July 1, 1997, if a radical 
proposal by a group of NPC delegates is adopted. The motion, if 
adopted may produce a Legislative Council with no directly 
elected members, according to one of the delegates who supported 
the proposal. 
  Hong Kong NPC delegate Victor Sit Fung-shuen, who supports 
the move, said the proposal could demonstrate the determination 
of the Chinese Government in setting up the second stove, while 
Britain sets out the framework for the pre-1997 Government. 
  The motion reads: "In view of the lack of cooperation from 
the British side and the absence of a through-train arrangement 
[the NPC] urges the Preparatory Committee to form the first SAR 
government in due course under the principles set out in the 
Basic Law so as to facilitate the takeover of Hong Kong on July 
1, 1997." 
  It is expected that the proposal will be raised in the 
current session of the NPC to supplement a 1990 resolution on 
the formation of the Preparatory Committee as stipulated in the 
Basic Law. However, Mr Sit would not reveal the identities of 
supporters behind the proposal but said at least 10 delegates 
from Hong Kong and Guangdong had given their backing. 
  Under the Basic Law, the SAR Preparatory Committee is to be 
set up in 1996 to prepare for the establishment of the SAR and 
the formation of the first post-1997 government. This will 
include election of the first chief executive and the so-called 
"through-train" arrangement for legislators elected in 1995 to 
continue to serve in the first SAR legislature. But, under the 
proposal, the Preparatory Committec would be empowered to pick 
the first Chief Executive, "elect" the first SAR legislature and 
make preparations for the executive authorities well before the 
handover. 
  Under such circumstances, the first SAR may not include any 
directly elected legislators, according to Mr Sit. He claimed 
the first legislature should not include any directly-elected 
members considering the heavy workload of the SAR government 
immediately after the sovereignty handover. But he refused to 
disclose details of the arrangements.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 9 (AFP)--Hong Kong's oldest 
trading firm, Jardine Matheson Ltd., said Wednesday it had not 
approached Hong Kong's stock exchange over a planned request for 
exemption under the territory's takeover code. 
  Jardines said in a statement that "no approach has been made 
to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong", regarding an exemption from 
the British colony's takeover code. 
  But it said that following the adoption of a new takeover 
code in Bermuda last December, it had informed shareholders it 
would continue its discussions with the Securities and Futures 
Commission (SFC) over the relationship between Hong Kong's and 
Bermuda's takeover code. 
  Earlier, Jardines company secretary Neil McNamara said talks 
with SFC for an exemption from the British colony's takeover 
code were still under way, but would neither confirm nor deny 
whether a delisting of any or all of the six Jardines-controlled 
companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange might result if the 
exemption fails to come through. 
  The takeover-code issue stems from Jardines' announcement in 
1984 that it would register in Bermuda, another British colony, 
before Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997. It now wants to 
be subject exclusively to Bermuda's takeover code, which comes 
into effect in July this year, thus avoiding the legal 
uncertainties of a post-1997 Hong Kong. In particular, the 
Bermuda code would allow Jardines to resist a hostile takeover 
attempt in the Bermuda courts and, in the case of a final 
appeal, through the Privy Council in London. 
  However, legislator Chim Pui-chung, financial services 
representative in the Legislative Council, said Jardines should 
not be exempted from Hong Kong's takeover code. He said that 
"under Hong Kong common law and takeover code, all companies, no 
matter how big or small, must obey the rules of the Securities 
and Futures Commission and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong." 
  Founded in 1832, Jardines is Hong Kong's most pervasive 
conglomerate, involved in almost every sector from real estate 
and stockbroking to supermarkets and parking lots.

<F P=106> [By reporter Shi Meisi (0670 5019 3128): "Xie Fei Says </F>
Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao Should Strengthen Cooperation To 
Strive for Common Prosperity"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 20 Feb (XINHUA Hong Kong)--Xie Fei, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, tonight 
told Hong Kong and Macao delegates to the Guangdong Provincial 
People's Congress and provincial Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] members from Hong Kong and Macao 
that Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao should give full play to 
their own strong points to supplement each other and intensify 
their cooperation to achieve common prosperity. 
  Leaders of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, the 
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, the Guangdong Provincial 
Government, the Guangdong CPPCC, and the Guangdong Provincial 
Discipline Inspection Commissions had a cordial meeting with 
Hong Kong and Macao delegates to the Second Session of the 
Eighth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress and Guangdong 
Provincial CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macao attending the 
Second Session of the Seventh Provincial CPPCC. They enjoyed 
themselves together at the evening party at the Guangdong Guest 
House tonight. 
  At the beginning of the evening party, Xie Fei first 
extended 
cordial greetings to Hong Kong and Macao delegates to the 
provincial people's congress and to provincial CPPCC members 
from Hong Kong and Macao, expressing heartfelt gratitude to the 
large numbers of compatriots residing in Hong Kong and Macao for 
their care and support for Guangdong for a long time past. He 
said that after achieving a 19 percent GNP increase in 1992, 
Guangdong succeeded in boosting its GNP to 310 billion yuan in 
1993, up 21 percent. "Guangdong is now working in a 
down-to-earth manner to basically attain the strategic goal of 
modernization in 20 years from 1990. Guangdong will set up a 
market economy, perfect its legal system, and build a clean and 
honest government. It will also pay extra attention to the 
development of agriculture, basic infrastructure, education, and 
science and technology. In addition, it will optimize the 
industrial structure and improve the ecological environment and 
the people's quality. Guangdong will not accomplish these 
glorious and arduous tasks without support from compatriots in 
Hong Kong and Macao," he said. 
  Xie Fei maintained that since Guangdong's investment 
environment is continually improving and Hong Kong and Macao 
enjoy superiority in funds, market, management, and information, 
they should intensify their cooperation to supplement each other 
and that there is a lot to be achieved in this respect. He 
stressed the role Guangdong's modernization drive will play in 
maintaining Hong Kong and Macao's prosperity and stability and 
the role the latter will play in promoting Guangdong's economic 
development. He said: "Common interests have made links 
between Guangdong, on the one hand, and Hong Kong and Macao on 
the other, closer and further developing their cooperative 
relations is of greater and greater significance." Xie Fei hoped 
that Hong Kong and Macao delegates to the provincial people's 
congress and provincial CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macao 
will further display patriotism and contribute to Guangdong's, 
and the country's, economic development. 
  Over 300 people attended the evening party. Also present was 
Zhu Senlin, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee 
and Guangdong mayor.

  [Text] The head of Hong Kong's newest political party, 
the Alliance of Chinese and Expatriates (ACE), has called on the 
Chinese government to clarify its position on the right of abode 
for foreign passport holders in the territory after 1997. 
Alliance chairman, Guy Lam, told Eastern Express yesterday that 
ACE, which will be officially launched today, would make written 
submissions to the Chinese and Hong Kong governments on the 
issue within the next few weeks. The party will initially seek 
support from returning migrants, although Lam said ACE would aim 
for a wider band of supporters in the runup to next year's 
Legislative Council elections. 
  Lam, 39, a solicitor who holds a Canadian passport, said the 
issue of right of abode after 1997 for an estimated 500,000 
foreign passport holders -- many of whom are Hong Kong born 
Chinese--would be a priority for ACE. His comments came as the 
Secretary for Security, Alistair Asprey, told the Legislative 
Council yesterday that the Government had yet to reach an 
agreement with China on the alignment of the Immigration 
Ordinance with the Basic Law, including the provision of right 
of abode for foreign residents. 
  In a written reply to a question from Leong Che-hung, Asprey 
said the Government would publish a guide as soon as an 
agreement was reached on the right of abode in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region. Lam said the Basic Law, which 
regards all foreign passport holders as non-Chinese citizens, 
was "vague" and "open to interpretation" on the issue of right 
of abode. "We shall be making ourselves known to both 
governments after our launch," he said. 
  "We need something that is much more elaborate than what 
exists. We are working towards a proposal or some kind of 
formula to be presented to the Chinese government that will be 
fair and open to the people of Hong Kong. 
  "It will be very comprehensive and detailed and something 
more than just brief comments by Chinese officials." 
  Lam said a legally binding agreement could be necessary to 
ensure that right of abode was granted fairly. "We want it to 
be a legally binding agreement but if not, it should be 
formulated in such a way that would clearly ensure foreign 
passport holders after 1997 can retain right of abode," he said. 
  He said ACE, which has an initial membership of 20 local and 
expatriate businessmen and professionals, would also closely 
follow the localisation of the Civil Service and the issue of 
allowing legislative councillors to hold foreign citizenship 
after 1997. "Ours is a pragmatic approach although some may call 
it conservative -- a word I don't like to use. One of our 
priorities is the continued economic prosperity and stability in 
Hong Kong," Lam said. "We don't want to rock the boat, and, 
therefore the sensible person, whether he or she holds a foreign 
passport or not, who agrees with our stance will support us. 
  "I think the sensible person will agree that Hong Kong's 
success is built to some extent on foreign expertise, and that 
foreign expertise is brought to Hong Kong by returning migrants 
and expatriates." 
  ACE, which began preparing for its launch just over a year 
ago, will field several candidates, including Lam, in direct 
elections and in functional constituencies in next year's 
elections. "We will be targeting returning migrants but we will 
limit our activity to Hong Kong. We won't be trying to expand 
ourselves overseas," Lam said. "The best way to become known is 
through our performance."

<F P=106> [By Feng I-fan (7458 0076 0416): "Delay of New Airport </F>
Project Is Beneficial to Chinese Side"] 
  [Text] Affected by the deadlock of Sino-British 
relationship, whether the project of Hong Kong's new airport can 
be completed by 1997 as scheduled is a big question. Hong Kong 
Governor Patten said that he wished to return home at the end of 
his service here by taking off from the new airport. Now, it 
seems that his wish will probably come to nothing. Unless there 
is a dramatic solution of the dispute over the political system, 
or the Chinese side can really handle political and economic 
issues separately, there will be no chance of smoothly carrying 
out the new airport project. Even though the two sides are 
forced to resume talks, nothing will come of it. 
<H5>  Kai Tak Airport Was Built Half a Century Ago </H5>
  The present Kai Tak Airport was built 50 years ago, and its 
facilities and capacity have reached the limit. Last year, Kai 
Tak Airport handled 24.5 million passengers, exceeding the 
maximum figure originally set. If the new airport cannot be put 
to use in three to four years, the load that Kai Tak will have 
to face will be inconceivable. According to the figures 
provided by the Civil Aviation Department, a total of 6,700 
flights were refused landing at Kai Tak Airport last year, which 
means 1.4 million passengers were unable to come to Hong Kong. 
This is absolutely detrimental to the development of Hong 
Kong's tourism, industry, and commerce. 
<H3>  Direct Flight Across the Taiwan Strait Will Ease the 
Pressure on Kai Tak Airport </H3>
  The Chinese side is not opposed to the construction of a new 
airport. However, it is politically unacceptable to China if 
the project is allowed to be completed before 1997 by Britain 
and the Hong Kong Government, and there may be other factors for 
consideration in terms of economics and practice value. First, 
one of the major causes that made the saturation date of the Kai 
Tak Airport come earlier than expected is that large numbers of 
Taiwan and mainland passengers are travelling via Hong Kong, who 
account for approximately 40 percent of all the passengers 
arriving here. If Taiwan and the mainland can make certain 
arrangements for direct flights, and mainland passengers can use 
the Shenzhen airport which is close to Hong Kong and the Macao 
airport which will soon go into operation as much as possible, 
the pressure on Kai Tak will be considerably lightened. In a 
period of time to come, the problems that have hampered 
coordinated operations of Kai Tak and its nearby airports will 
be reduced or resolved following the handover of Hong Kong and 
Macao to mainland China one after the other. So long as the 
transregional cooperation is smoothly carried out, the 
saturation point of Kai Tak may be put off for some time, thus 
providing sufficient conditions for the new airport to be 
gradually completed after 1997. 
  Moreover, the official completion of the new airport project 
after 1997 not only will bring honor to Beijing and the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Regional Government, but the 
arrangements for the use of land after Kai Tak terminates 
operations will be entirely in the hands of the SAR Government 
and Beijing, as it will no longer be necessary to consult anyone 
representing the interests of Britain or other countries. With 
expensive land prices in Hong Kong, the vast area of Kai Tak 
Airport and relaxation of building's height in the entire 
Kowloon Peninsula will bring profits up to several dozen billion 
dollars to the SAR Government. Naturally, the Chinese side will 
not let the British side concern itself with these considerable 
profits now when it still administers the territory. 
<H3>  The Chinese Will Not Make Concessions in the New Airport 
Project </H3>
  Taken politically or economically, the Chinese side will not 
make concessions in the new airport project. Whether Britain 
and the Hong Kong Government still cherish any illusions about 
this will be judged by their future actions. Even though both 
sides return to the negotiation table, they will be nothing more 
than the nature of putting on performances. Perhaps, those 
consortia waiting for contracts of project facilities and 
supplies need more patience. At least, this spectacular and 
controversial new airport project will not become a reality 
until after 1997.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Hoped That the New Airport Issue Will Be </F>
Settled As Early As Possible"] 
  [Text] Ambassador Guo Feng-min, the Chinese Joint Liaison 
Group team leader, said this week: The Chinese side has taken a 
preliminary look at the "fourth financial package" proposed by 
the British side on the new Hong Kong airport and related 
projects, and still has to study some of the problems in an 
in-depth manner. In addition, it is necessary to exchange views 
with the British side, so we hope that the expert panel under 
the Airport Committee will call a meeting this month. The 
so-called "fourth financial package" was proposed by the British 
side early this month. The Spring Festival holidays interrupted 
the process, but the Chinese side still studied the package very 
quickly and immediately proposed the expert panel meeting. It 
indicates that the Chinese side is, as always, positive and 
practical in dealing with the Hong Kong airport construction 
project. 
  The Chinese Government consented to the construction of a 
new 
airport in Hong Kong a few years ago. As far as this project is 
concerned, the Chinese side has been consistently saying that it 
is necessary to handle the matter in strict accordance with the 
Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] signed by heads of both the 
Chinese and the British Governments and with relevant 
stipulations of the Annex III to the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, which not only abides by the mutual commitments 
made between China and Britain, but also safeguards the 
interests of Hong Kong residents and of the future government of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. With the 
exception of these, the Chinese Government does not have any 
gains from the Hong Kong new airport project. Actually, the 
problem would have been settled long ago if the previous 
financial packages proposed by the British Hong Kong authorities 
accorded with the Sino-British MOU. 
  When the "fourth financial package" was proposed, officials 
of the British Hong Kong authorities went so far as to describe 
it as "presenting a big gift," saying that it "meets every 
demand of the Chinese side." As a matter of fact, the wealth of 
Hong Kong belongs to its people, and there is no point in saying 
that the British side "presents a gift." Moreover, as far as 
the lately proposed "fourth financial package" is concerned, 
what needs to be studied is merely the question of whether or 
not it accords with the Memorandum of Understanding and meet 
other relevant requirements, and whether or not it meets the 
demands of the Chinese side is not a question in itself. 
  A review of the past shows that even when China vehemently 
argued with Britain on the issue of electoral arrangements in 
Hong Kong, the Chinese side still extended its timely support to 
construction projects which accorded with Hong Kong people's 
interests. For example, the Chinese side consented to the 
construction of the Western District Cross-Harbor Tunnel and to 
the reclamation project from the Central District to Wanchai. 
Regarding the problem of financing the new airport, the Chinese 
side has already stated its views in a systematic manner at the 
Airport Committee meeting last August. However, the British 
side merely called for the reconvening of the Airport Committee 
meeting without redrafting the package so as to make it conform 
to the stipulations of the MOU. Only after the matter was 
delayed for almost half a year then the British Hong Kong 
authorities put forward the "fourth package," whereas during 
this period, they repeatedly broke the package into different 
parts to appropriate funds for individual projects. Even when 
the "fourth package" was sent to the Chinese side and the 
content was not made public, they allowed the Legislative 
Council, which did not have a clear idea of the package, to pass 
an appropriation of nearly 4.8 billion dollars for the new 
airport project. Hence, the Chinese side could not but state 
that before China and Britain reach an agreement on the 
financing problem, the Chinese side and the future SAR 
Government will not bear responsibility for any cost and debt 
incurred by the new airport. On the one hand, the British Hong 
Kong authorities put off proposing the overall financial 
package. On the other hand, they authorized, without the 
consent of the Chinese side, the appropriation for project 
expenses. People cannot but doubt whether or not they are 
sincere about working according to the understanding and 
agreement reached between China and Britain. 
  What the Sino-British MOU asked for is that the airport 
project should be in line with the cost-benefit principle in 
order not to put a burden on the future SAR Government: Up to 
30 June 1997, no less than 25 billion Hong Kong dollars of 
financial reserves and no more than 5 billion dollars of debts 
will be left over for the SAR Government. As far as the new 
airport project is concerned, all debts, whether incurred by the 
Airport Authority or the Airport Railway Company, must be 
finally undertaken by the SAR Government. If the total amount of 
all these debts exceeds 5 billion dollars, the Chinese side has 
to raise a query on it according to the MOU. 
  As prescribed by Annex III to the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, land granted before 1997 shall be considered and 
decided by the Sino-British Land Commission and the total amount 
of land to be granted shall be limited to 50 hectares a year, 
but an increase in the amount of land granted each year can be 
considered after proposals by British Hong Kong Government. 
Investing some of the proceeds gained by selling land along the 
new airport rail line in the airport project was the original 
proposal of the Chinese side. Land along the airport rail line 
granted before 1997 should be, of course, discussed by the 
Sino-British Land Commission. As shown by its performance over 
the past few years, the Chinese side always took a positive 
attitude towards this and approved sales over the annual limit 
of 50 hectares of land in many years. The Chinese side can 
guarantee that it will support the construction of the airport 
railway by granting land through the Land Commission. 
  As a matter of fact, it is not difficult to settle the new 
airport financing problem as long as the matter is handled in 
accordance with the stipulations of the MOU and of the Joint 
Declaration. The people of Hong Kong hope that the Sino-British 
expert panel meeting to be held at the end of this month can 
conscientiously and profoundly discuss the matter and make 
preparations for calling the Airport Commission meeting and 
finally reaching an agreement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Should Britain Have a 'Moral </F>
Responsibility' After 1997?"] 
  [Text] Recently, when being interviewed by Hong Kong 
reporters in Australia, Chris Patten said that Britain would 
bear moral responsibility toward Hong Kong after 1997, that is, 
it should ensure that Hong Kong's freedom and values are 
maintained beyond 1997. He even said that "it is contradictory 
to say that the Joint Declaration indicates that Britain will 
have no moral responsibility and interest toward Hong Kong 
beyond 1997." This was the "grounds" Patten created when he 
played the "international card" in Australia. Patten's remark 
was in open disregard of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and 
also thoroughly exposed the British colonial rulers' intention 
to prolong their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong. 
  The Joint Declaration explicitly specifies that Britain will 
return Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997. Before that, Britain 
will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong. It is 
self-evident that after the transfer of government in 1997, the 
Hong Kong issue will be purely China's internal affair and no 
foreign countries will have the right to meddle in Hong Kong's 
affairs. Britain is naturally no exception. The so-called 
"moral responsibility" has no foundation in the Joint 
Declaration. 
  Although Patten repeatedly stressed Hong Kong's 
international 
status and tried to turn Hong Kong into an "international 
asset," this was just a trick played by the British in an 
attempt to solicit the help of the international forces to 
prolong the British colonial interests in Hong Kong. In fact, 
before the signing of the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the 
British did not allow other countries to have a hand in Hong 
Kong affairs. Now, because the Hong Kong issue has been solved 
and Britain will have to withdraw from Hong Kong and the Chinese 
Government will resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong, 
Britain finds it necessary to encourage other Western countries 
to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and step up the process of 
"internationalizing" Hong Kong politically. This fully shows 
that the British side has no sincerity toward implementing the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and is still unwilling to 
withdraw from the Chinese territory it forcefully seized more 
than 100 years ago. Patten's emphasis on Britain's "moral 
responsibility" to Hong Kong precisely reflects such a mentality. 
  The so-called "British moral responsibility toward Hong 
Kong" 
after 1997 has no legal foundation at all. Patten himself also 
could not utter any tenable argument to justify this. As 
everyone knows, Hong Kong was occupied by old British 
colonialists in a predatory way. The signing and implementation 
of the Joint Declaration should help Britain terminate its 
shameful history and enable China and Britain to bring their old 
grudge to an end so that the two countries may thus furhter 
consolidate and develop their bilateral relations on a new 
basis. However, as Hong Kong will soon be returned to its 
motherland, the British have talked a lot about their "moral 
responsibility" toward Hong Kong beyond 1997. This sounds like 
a burglar continuing to claim "moral responsibility" after the 
thing he stole has been taken back by its owner. How shameless 
such people are! In the past, many places in North America, 
Asia, and Africa, including the United States, were subject to 
colonial rule by the British Empire. Would it not be ridiculous 
if Britain now continued to claim "moral responsibility" toward 
so many countries? 
  If they really want to talk about some "responsibility," 
then 
Britain's "responsibility" exists before rather than after 1997. 
That is, in the transitional period, Britain must honestly abide 
by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and provide sincere 
coopertion for China's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong 
Kong. The British side bears unshirkable historical 
"responsibility" for this. To put it more accurately, this is 
not just "moral responsibility" but the British side's duty 
which it must perform according to the norms of international 
law and the Joint Declaration. 
  It is regrettable that the British side erroneously assessed 
the situation, broke its own promise, and suddenly changed its 
policy toward Hong Kong. In particular, Patten, on taking 
office, undermined the foundation for Sino-British cooperation, 
wantonly violated and trampled upon the Joint Declaration, 
impeded China in reexercising sovereignty over Hong Kong, and 
tried to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent 
political entity so that Britain can continue to control Hong 
Kong from behind the scenes and extend its colonial rule beyond 
1997. 
  By analyzing the essence of the "political democratization" 
program pursued by Patten, the so-called "Hong Kong freedom and 
values" he advocated were only a synonym for Hong Kong's 
"politial independence or semi-independence." Hong Kong has 
never experienced such "independence or semi-independence" in 
the past; still less is this allowed by the Joint Declaration 
and the "one country, two systems" policy. This is just a 
sinister plan which the British side is trying to impose on the 
future special administrative region through changing Hong 
Kong's existing political structure. Fundamentally, it goes 
against the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and it 
unfavorable to Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. 
Therefore, it is doomed to be short-lived.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Shadows Over Budget"] </F>
  [Text] Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday brought down a Budget 
which should be the envy of the developed world. In what other 
country could the government cut salaries tax and profits tax -- 
taxes that already are low by world standards -- order big 
increases in spending on social welfare, health, education and 
roads, and still produce a surplus? If the Financial 
Secretary's forecasts prove correct, the surplus will help 
produce reserves of more than $260 billion, to be handed over to 
the Special Administrative Region [SAR] government in 1997. 
  The Budget is generous--but Sir Hamish could afford to be 
big- hearted. As he said, the task of this Budget was to manage 
prosperity. That this is so is a tribute to the Government and 
its basic philosophy of keeping its own activities restrained to 
allow the private sector to blossom and to the productive energy 
of the people of Hong Kong. It is a tribute, too, to fortune -- 
the good fortune of being in the world's fastest-growing region 
and the bad fortune of a sky-rocketing property market which 
nevertheless keeps filling the administration's coffers. 
  The salaries tax concessions will help ease the financial 
burden on millions of people. The profits tax cut should help 
to make Hong Kong business a little more competitive. The 
forecast reserves awaiting the new sovereign government in 1997 
should calm China's fears that borrowing to build the airport 
and related projects would risk leaving the SAR bankrupt. 
<H5>  High Growth Needed </H5>
  All this is based on the assumption of continued high 
economic growth. Growth in 1994-95 is estimated to stay at 5.5 
percent -- well above growth rates in other developed economies. 
The territory's growth should be helped by better performance 
in the United States and United Kingdom and by continued rapid 
expansion in China. 
  Unfortunately, another key figure is forecast to be 
unchanged 
in 1994-95: The rise in the cost of living will again be 8.5 
percent, eroding the gains people will make from tax cuts and 
salary rises. As the Budget is in surplus, it should make a 
small contribution to keeping inflation controlled. But the tax 
cuts will fuel more consumer spending, helping to push inflation 
up. 
  The property boom will continue to be one of the biggest 
contributors to inflation. Sir Hamish admitted that Government 
moves to try to control property prices (including the 
restrictions on mortgage lending) had been ineffective. He 
proposed a number of measures to increase the supply of new land 
and building sites and cut delays in getting projects finished 
in an effort to control prices. 
  But he also decided to reduce the impact of property stamp 
duty for lower- and medium-priced flats. Making it easier for 
people to buy homes is desirable socially but the effect of 
higher demand will be to pull prices up. The Budget will not 
keep a lid on the price of property. 
  Inflation, however, is not the only cloud on the budgetary 
horizon. The territory's dependence on China, which accounts 
for so much of our prosperity, also brings risks. 
<H5>  Beware the Fallout </H5>
  One flows from the possibility that China's economy will 
grow 
too quickly, producing a bust to follow the present boom. That 
would hurt Hong Kong businesses and families and make nonsense 
of the Budget forecasts. Another comes from the annual debate 
over China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status with the US. If 
MFN were not continued both the US and the Chinese economies 
would be damaged. The fallout for the territory would be 
devastating. 
  The Budget documents estimate that, if China lost its MFN 
status, Hong Kong would suffer a loss of up to $26 billion in 
income and of up to 75,000 jobs. Growth would be cut to just 
over three per cent. Little wonder that the Government supports 
China's case in this annual battle with the US. 
  Hong Kong began compiling growth statistics in 1966. Since 
then the territory has enjoyed -- and earned -- 27 unbroken 
years of expansion. That historical fact is no guarantee that 
growth will go on. So people here should be concerned about 
China and its trade. We should hope that Beijing manages to keep 
high growth going without losing control. And we should hope 
that the US puts its muscle behind levers other than trade as it 
tries to press China for improvements in human rights. 
  If those hopes are realised, the clouds will cast nothing 
but 
shadows on the bright economic picture. Hong Kong will have its 
28th straight year of rising prosperity.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus" page: "Weekly Notes" column by Assistant </F>
Editor Jackie Sam: "PR Exercise Will Endear PLA Soldiers to the 
Public"] 
  [Text] If Mr Liu Guinan, vice-director of the People's 
Liberation Army (PLA) Guangzhou political department, is to be 
believed, China will soon be throwing open some PLA camps to 
Hong Kong people. These are camps where soldiers sent here in 
1997 are being trained. 
  This will be a PR exercise. No more, no less. Or, 
re-phrased in the language of the Cold War, a campaign to win 
the hearts and minds of Hong Kong people. It's a good start. 
Hong Kong people have to get used to the PLA and vice versa. 
The last thing we would want to see in 1997 is the PLA regarded 
as an occupation army. Or the PLA treating the Hong Kong 
population with hostility. 
  Widespread anxiety about a PLA presence is a fact of life. 
The reasons are historical. Beijing is aware of this, 
otherwise it would not have gone to such lengths to select and 
train the men and women who will be stationed here. Their 
special preparation includes the study of Hong Kong laws, way of 
life, languages (Cantonese and English), and all the 
nitty-gritty which makes this territory so exasperatingly 
unique. Regular visits to the Guangdong camps by Hong Kong 
people will foster understanding, goodwill and -- hopefully -- 
lasting bonds. 
  Hong Kong Affairs Advisers and the territory's National 
People's Congress deputies appear to be at the top of the PLA 
invitation list, presumably because they are important people. 
Giving important people first crack is, of course, the 
Chinese-way in such matters. But if the object of this exercise 
is winning hearts and minds, the people who matter are the 
ordinary folk. Will the common folk get invited? Or are 
invitations to be confined to community leaders? Will 
grassroots leaders like District Board [DB] members get a chance 
to visit the camps? Will all these people -- DB members or 
common people -- have to pass political muster, meaning their 
views must be acceptable to China? These are some of the 
questions which need to be asked. Because the converted have 
less anxieties about a PLA presence than the apolitical majority 
or those opposed to the transfer of sovereignty. Inviting only 
the converted will not advance the PLA cause of building 
bridges, making friends. Ultimately the whole population has to 
get along with the PLA, and vice versa. 
  There are other areas the PLA can usefully explore to 
achieve 
its aims. Inviting university undergrads to participate in 
language training would help to foster better understanding 
between the young soldiers and Hong Kong youth. Another way 
would be to liaise with the Hong Kong Administration to enable 
batches of PLA men to visit the territory informally, to 
familiarise them with the sights and sounds of Hong Kong. If 
this was done on a regular basis, the PLA contingent would not 
be total strangers on arrival in 1997. 
  If the Hong Kong Administration is sincere about a smooth 
transition, it would offer to arrange such familiarisation tours 
without waiting to be asked. It would also be reassuring to 
Hong Kong people if China could enact laws covering the 
behaviour of its troops in the territory speedily and 
disseminate them. This way both Hong Kong people and the 
individual soldiers would know exactly what each other's rights 
and responsibilities are. 
  Hong Kong people want to be assured that PLA men posted here 
would be subjected to the rule of law. They would want to be 
assured, too, that their public behaviour would be subject to 
civilian control. What goes on within the camp where Hong Kong 
people and Hong Kong interests are not involved is another 
matter. But a PLA officer who gets involved in a drunken brawl 
with a local in Wan Chai, or runs up a bill he cannot settle 
must be subject to local laws. If a soldier has committed an 
offence outside his camp and the aggrieved party is a local, it 
would be most reassuring to know that a policeman can arrest him 
and deal with him under Hong Kong laws, without a superior PLA 
officer having the right to intervene. The PLA, undoubtedly, 
has this in mind. But, for most people here, seeing will be 
believing. 
  The PLA is not the monster that a minority in Hong Kong have 
made it out to be. But the PLA is made up of many soldiers, all 
human beings. And Hong Kong is a city of countless temptations. 
Hong Kong people are also far more individualistic than their 
mainland counterparts. The PLA is off to a good start. But it 
needs to keep in mind at all times its aim to endear itself to 
Hong Kong people.

  [Text] Macao, March 8 (XINHUA) -- In 1993, Macao posted a 
total foreign trade deficit of 1.9 billion Macao patacas (about 
240 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 18.5 percent over 1992. 
  Last year's exports totalled 14.2 billion Macao patacas 
(about 1.84 billion U.S. dollars), a 1.1 percent rise over the 
previous year's figure. While the imports reached 16.1 billion 
Macao patacas (about 2.09 billion U.S. dollars), climbing by 2.9 
percent. 
  Textile and clothes are Macao's main export commodities, 
accounting for 72.9 percent of the total export volume. 
However, the ratio dropped by 3.4 percent in 1993 as compared 
with 1992. 
  There was also drop in exports to Europe and the United 
States, two main export markets of Macao, which absorb 60 
percent of the total export volume. 
  Exports to Asian markets continued to rise reaching 28.6 
percent last year. 
  Rise in imported consumer goods, raw materials and 
semi-finished products, which amounted as high as 82.7 percent, 
has resulted in the increase of Macao's imports.

  [Text] Macao, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The Working 
Committee of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group discussed 
handling of three major issues during the transitional period in 
Macao at its 11th meeting held here today. 
  Han Zhaokang, a representative from the Chinese team of the 
Joint Liaison Group, told reporters after the meeting that the 
Chinese side mainly listened to the introduction by the 
Portuguese side on their work to deal with the three major 
issues, namely localization of public servants and law as well 
as officialization of Chinese language. 
  The official said that the Chinese side also made initial 
comment on the Macao Criminal Law handed over by the Portuguese 
side recently. 
  The official added that the two sides have all stressed the 
importance and pressingness to handle the three major issues 
during the transitional period, as 1999 is nearer. 
  Moreover, the two sides also expressed the hope to handle 
these issues as quickly as possible, he said.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Wang Dan Was Detained and Later </F>
Released by Public Security Authorities; Given Five Warnings"] 
  [Excerpts] Wang Dan, a student leader during China's 1989 
democracy movement, was taken from his home by Beijing public 
security officers for questioning and was given five warnings. 
Wang said after the incident that he had been mentally prepared 
for all sorts of misfortunes, including being arrested and 
sentenced. This was the fourth summons for interrogation over 
the last two months. 
  China has detained and summoned for interrogation many 
dissidents over the last few days. This has elicited a strong 
reaction from the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who is to visit China soon, warned that such a move 
may force Washington to apply trade sanctions against China. 
  In an interview through the trunk-line exchange after his 
release, Wang Dan told this newspaper's reporter that he was 
taken away by three plainclothes public security officers 
yesterday while having supper at his home, and was released 
after an hour of interrogation. 
  Wang also disclosed that the public security officers gave 
him five "strongly worded" warnings during the interrogation: 
  1. His words and deeds have overstepped the limit set by 
rules and regulations for a socialist citizen. 
  2. The rules and regulations require every socialist citizen 
to uphold the socialist system and no citizens or organizations 
are allowed to oppose the socialist system. 
  3. Some of his words were groundless and sheer fabrication. 
He must pay the price if what he says tarnishes the country's 
image. 
  4. China is a sovereign country and no interference in its 
internal affairs is allowed. 
  5. He has violated the criminal law. If he does it again, 
he will be punished without leniency. 
  To the public security officer's "stern warnings" he 
responded: "I will hold to my own views and to the behavior I 
consider lawful. If I violate the law, I will accept the 
consequences," according to Wang. 
  Wang also told this reporter that nothing will compel him to 
give up his efforts to promote democracy in China and his belief 
in the cause, adding that he is mentally prepared for any 
consequences, including being arrested and sentenced. [passage 
omitted] 
  In another development, Ma Wendu, who has participated the 
1989 democratic movement, was also taken away by public security 
officers two days ago and was released yesterday after being 
detained and interrogated for one day. Ma told his friends that 
the public security authorities had asked him about the "peace 
charter" and warned him watch his behavior.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yu Yiguo (0358 1355 0948) and Zhang Huanli </F>
(1728 3562 0448)] 
  [Text] Tokyo, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- Xiao Rong, the author of 
My Father Deng Xiaoping, said here on 8 March: 
Although Deng Xiaoping will be 90-years-old, he continues his 
workout, walking three km daily. 
  Xiao Rong made the above remark at a press conference at 
Tokyo Akasaka Prince Hotel. She arrived in Tokyo 7 March at the 
invitation of the Japanese bookstore Tokuma to launch the 
publication of her book in Japan. 
  At the 8 March news conference, Xiao Rong discussed the 
process of her writing the book and fielded questions from 
reporters. 
  On her father's view regarding China's present and future, 
she said: Deng Xiaoping believes China's decade-long policy of 
reform and opening up has laid the foundation. China is facing 
a new opportunity now, and China should seize it. He is fully 
confident about the future of China. 
  She said: "My father has a strong desire to go to Hong Kong 
after it returns to China in 1997. He said: 'In 1997, I will be 
93 years old and probably unable to walk. But I will go to Hong 
Kong even if I am in a wheelchair. I will be very happy even if 
I stay in Hong Kong for only a minute'." 
  In response to a Japanese reporter's question about Deng 
Xiaoping's everyday life, she said: "The secret of my father's 
longevity is living a regular life." She said Deng Xiaoping 
likes reading and subscribing to a dozen newspapers which he 
finishes everyday.

  [Text] Tokyo 8 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Xiao Rong (aka 
Mao Mao 3029 3029,) author of the book My Father Deng 
Xiaoping, talked about her father's recent conditions and 
life when answering Japanese reporters' questions at a news 
conference on the occasion of the circulation of the book in 
question here today. 
  Xiao Rong said: The description of my father's conditions 
today can be boiled down to two sentences. The first is that he 
is not ill, and the second is that he is, after all, 90 years 
old. It is the law of nature; his physical quality, in its 
entirety, is poorer than it was a couple of years ago. 
Nevertheless, he persists in doing some exercises every day, 
mainly walking. He makes it a rule to walk three kilometers 
each day, even against Beijing's cold wind. 
  Xiao Rong said: I personally believe that a secret of my 
father's longevity is precisely an orderly life. Even before 
his retirement, when he was still in office, he led a very 
orderly life. Since his retirement, he has continued to maintain 
a very orderly life. Every day, he gets up at around 0700, then 
he does some exercises, in a workout with several movements, 
which he himself has worked out. After breakfast, he reads the 
press. My father just loves to read newspapers. I believe, in 
his mind, reading the press is no less important than reading 
documents. He subscribes to a dozen or so newspapers, which he 
invariably reads through -- the whole lot. We used to say as a 
joke that the source of information in our family is precisely 
my father because, none of us in our family reads the press as 
earnestly as he does, none of us reads such a huge volume as he 
does. Sometimes, he will ask us which team won a famous 
football match a day before, and none of us can say. Then he 
will be very pleased with himself, telling us the result. After 
reading the press, it is time for a walk in the morning. In the 
remainder of the day, he sometimes does some reading, or watches 
television. Then, there are his grandchildren. When they are 
back from school at noon, they invariably will go to see their 
grandpa and play with him. My father is a person who just loves 
the family, his children and grandchildren. Therefore, being 
together with his family members is his happiest time every day. 
He spends most of his time in the evening playing bridge. He 
has a few loyal partners playing bridge, most of whom are 
retired old men.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- China's veteran leader Deng 
Xiaoping is healthy, but avoids making public appearances unless 
he feels his presence is necessary to encourage reforms, his 
youngest daughter Xiao Rong said in Tokyo on Tuesday [8 March]. 
  "His only aim of appearing in public is to encourage better 
(implementation of)... overall policies, to assist and help our 
current leaders in even better implementing the route of 
construction," Xiao said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Xiao is in Tokyo to promote the Japanese edition of her book 
My Father, Deng Xiaoping, the first part of a 
biography of the 89-year old revolutionary covering the years up 
to 1949. 
  In one of his rare public appearances the frail-looking Deng 
was shown on television during the Chinese Lunar New Year 
Festival last month. 
  On these occasions Xiao is always seen at her father's side 
supporting him by the arm, whispering into his partially deaf 
ears and translating his almost incomprehensible utterings. 
  She laughingly dismissed allegations that her 
interpretations 
of his utterings reflected more her own opinion than her 
father's views, saying that was "incomprehension and ignorance." 
  "Wouldn't that be putting my father to a much too low 
level?" 
She said, adding that her father has no speech problems and 
often talks for 30 minutes at a time. 
  At a press conference earlier in the day, Xiao said, "at the 
moment (Deng) has no disease" and walks three-kilometers a day, 
even during Beijing's cold winter weather. 
  Xiao said that although her father is frail, he is usually 
amused by frequent foreign press reports that he is rumored to 
have cancer or has already died. 
  The secret of her father's longevity is his regular routine, 
she said. Deng wakes up at 7 A.M., reads the newspapers in the 
morning, enjoys playing with his grandchildren in the afternoon 
and plays bridge with old friends in the evening, she said. 
  Although he has given up all political posts, the mastermind 
of China's market reforms is still believed to have his say in 
major policy decisions. 
  Deng has complete confidence in the current leadership, said 
Xiao, indicating that he has entrusted day-to-day politics 
entirely to President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. 
  The three "actually come to see him very seldom," but still 
consult with the senior leader on important matters, she said. 
Yet Deng does not expect them to adopt his advice, which he 
wants to be understood as "his personal opinion," she said. 
  Xiao adamantly dismissed efforts in China to create a new 
personality cult around the father of China's socialist market 
economy. 
  She said the Deng family would agree to setting up a 
monument 
after her father's death, but oppose the construction of a 
pendant to Mao Zedong's mausoleum in Beijing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deng Rong, daughter of Chinese leader Deng </F>
Xiaoping, by NHK announcer Yoko Sakurai at a Tokyo hotel; date 
not given; Deng speaks in Mandarin with Japanese subtitles 
appearing on screen -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sakurai speaking from the NHK studio] Today, we 
will televise an interview with Deng Rong, daughter of China's 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. She is now in Japan to 
commemorate the publication of Japanese edition of her book: 
My Father, Deng Xiaoping. 
  [Video shows Sakurai sitting face to face with Deng Rong] 
[Sakurai] You resemble your father. Your face is round and your 
brow is broad. You resemble your father. 
  [Deng] [Laughter] I resemble my father a bit but not 
completely. I have my mother's eyes and eyebrows and my 
father's nose, mouth, and chin. I told my father that I am more 
good-looking than he is. [laughter] [video shows Deng Xiaoping 
holding Deng Rong in his lap when she was a child] 
  [Sakurai] We saw Mr. Deng Xiaping on the New Year's Day by 
the lunar calendar for the first time in one year. How is your 
father's health? 
  [Deng] Generally speaking, he is in fairly good health [shen 
ti zhuang kuang bi jiao hao di]. Specifically, for a man at the 
ripe old age of 90, his condition can be described in English as 
perfect [the preceding word rendered in English]; that is his 
current health condition is remarkable [heng chu se]. What is 
important is that he is not ill; however, because he is at the 
advanced age of 90, his health and overall physical condition 
are naturally not as good as two or five years ago. There is an 
old Chinese saying that when a man gets old, his feet are the 
first to age. Therefore, he does not walk as fast as before. 
[video shows Deng Rong accompanying her father on New Year's 
Day] 
  [Sakurai] What is Mr. Deng Xiaoping's dream or hope? 
  [Deng] My father is a statesman, and his greatest concerns 
are none other than major domestic affairs and international 
political and economic matters. However, because he has 
retired, he has begun to pay heed to his grandchildren's report 
cards. If their academic performance was not so good, he would 
make comments in order to show that he was concerned about his 
grandchildren's studies in his capacity as a grandfather. My 
father is a bridge enthusiast who plays bridge three or four 
times a week but not every night. [laughter] Before he retired, 
he played twice a week. After he retired.... [pauses] We spent 
this winter in Shanghai, where he invited his bridge partners so 
that they could play bridge everyday, not three or four times a 
week. After he returned to Beijing, they reduced the frequency, 
to three or four times, because they live quite far apart. 
  [Sakurai] Mrs. Deng, you just said your father's feet have 
become weak, but he walks three km every day. [Deng's response 
not heard]

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Zhou Jue, spokesman 
for China's top legislature, answered questions about the NPC's 
[National People's Congress] legislative work, the Hong Kong 
issue and the law on protection of Taiwan investors at a press 
conference held in the Great Hall of the People this morning. 
  Asked about the law on the protection of investment by 
Taiwan 
compatriots which was promulgated by the National People's 
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee recently, Zhou, spokesman for 
the current session of the Eighth NPC, said that the law was 
designed to suit the current situation. He said that economic 
exchanges across the Taiwan straits and Taiwan investment in the 
Mainland have been increasing substantially. But there are 
still no direct transport and commercial links between the two 
sides of the straits. 
  Zhou said that the new law is formulated to ensure the 
personal safety and economic interests and rights of Taiwan 
investors to the Mainland and keep their enterprises on the 
Mainland from being requisitioned. This has fully demonstrated 
the Mainland's respect for the interests and rights of Taiwan 
investors and its sincerity in developing trade relations across 
the straits, he said. 
  Asked about possibility of an agreement on protection of 
investment by the two sides, Zhou said that Taiwan is an 
inseparable part of China and the relations between the Chinese 
Central Government and Taiwan are the relations between a 
central government and a locality. 
  "It is out of the question that the two sides may sign any 
agreement," he said. 
  In response to a question about whether Hong Kong's 
three-tier political structure will be terminated when China 
resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the spokesman blamed 
the uncooperative attitude of the British side for the breakdown 
of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. 
  Zhou pointed out that the three-tier political structure of 
Hong Kong will be terminated by June 30, 1997, the date set in 
the Sino- British joint declaration. 
  Asked about NPC accelerating the pace of legislation and 
strengthening legislative supervision, he said that the NPC and 
its standing committee has accelerated legislation, especially 
in the economic field, in the past year. It passed 22 laws in 
1993, including 12 economic laws, setting a record in NPC 
history. 
  He said that last year the NPC Standing Committee sent ten 
inspection teams to 15 provinces and autonomous regions to 
oversee the implementation of the laws, and learned opinions of 
relevant departments on key tasks of the government and the 
issues that people are concerned about. 
  The spokesman said that the Eighth NPC will strive to 
promulgate 152 laws during its term of service, which will end 
in 1998. The laws will form the framework of the legal system 
of the socialist market economy and perfect legislation in other 
areas. 
  At the press conference attended by several hundred 
correspondents from China and abroad, Zhou also answered 
questions about Sino-U.S. relations, reform of large- and 
medium-sized state- owned enterprises and the securities law.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 KYODO -- The Second Session of 
China's Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) will open its 
two-week meeting Thursday [10 March] with delegates expected to 
debate the main issues of the country's ongoing economic reform. 
  Premier Li Peng will open the annual session with a reading 
of his government work report which will lay down the themes of 
the congress and the government's main tasks for this year. 
  Li is expected to call for 9 percent economic growth this 
year and an inflation rate below 10 percent, while he will push 
forward reforms in the banking, financial and tax sectors, 
Chinese sources said. 
  Much of Li's report is based on the decision by the Third 
Plenum of the 14th Communist Party Congress last October to 
construct a "socialist market economy," sources said. 
  The report is expected to address China's main economic 
problems including inflation, high fixed asset investment and an 
inefficient state sector, as well as other problems including 
corruption and excessive bureaucracy. 
  Not much new is expected in the report, although Li will 
announce new regulations on fixed assets investment and the 
establishment of a state development bank to stabilize the 
funding of basic construction projects, well-placed sources said. 
  Li will also announce a plan for reappropriating funds 
raised 
by state-run enterprises for infrastructure projects to help pay 
for the bankruptcy of inefficient enterprises and displaced 
workers, the sources said. 
  The report will briefly praise the work done in 1993 in 
nearly every area of government including, propaganda, science 
and technology, culture, health and education, while laying down 
the work outline in these areas for 1994. 
  Li will stress that continued economic development will need 
a stable social environment and call on all levels of government 
to safeguard social order and fight corruption in government. 
  On foreign policy, the premier is not expected to harshly 
criticize the British handling of issues concerning Hong Kong, 
but in a veiled reference to the U.S. he will staunchly 
maintain that China will refuse to accept any form of hegemony 
or power politics, sources said. 
  On Friday, Chen Jinhua will give his report on the 
implementation of national economic and social development and 
submit his draft plan for 1994, while Finance Minister Li 
Zhongli will report on the 1993 and 1994 state budgets. 
  During the congress, the 2,970 deputies will later debate, 
amend and approve the reports along with reports from the 
Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procurator and the 
NPC Standing Committee.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Li Peng Stresses Scheduled Restoration </F>
of Sovereignty Over Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong -- In his government work report to the 
National People's Congress [NPC] tomorrow, Premier Li Peng of 
the mainland State Council will stress that, no matter what 
setbacks occur, the government and people of the Chinese side 
have the determination and ability to restore the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled and end British colonial 
rule in Hong Kong. 
  On the Taiwan issue, Li Peng says: Any attempt or move to 
separate the motherland will be in vain, "no matter what kind of 
trick is used." 
  The sixth part of Li Peng's government work report, which is 
on "actively promoting the motherland's reunification," very 
briefly reviews the progress of bringing about reunification 
with Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and deals with the Hong Kong 
issue in quite a moderate tone. 
  The full text of the part on "reunification" in Li Peng's 
speech is as follows: 
  In the new year, we will continue to unswervingly implement 
the policy of "peaceful reunification and one country, two 
systems" and will actively promote the great cause of reunifying 
the motherland. 
  The dates for China to resume the exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong and Macao are approaching. As always, the 
Chinese Government will abide by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, the Basic Law of the Macao 
Special Administrative Region, and the relevant decisions of the 
NPC Standing Committee in making all kinds of preparations for 
ensuring Hong Kong's and Macao's smooth power transfers and 
steady transitions. Now Chinese-Portuguese cooperation on the 
Macao issue is proceeding smoothly. The talks between Chinese 
and British representatives on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements have ended and the responsibility is completely on 
the British side. According to the decision of the NPC Standing 
Committee, the Preliminary Work Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region's Preparatory Committee has 
started its work. No matter what setbacks occur, the Chinese 
Government and people have the determination and ability to 
restore the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled 
and ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. 
  As a result of the common efforts of the people on both 
sides 
of the strait, both sides' economic and trade cooperation 
continued to develop last year. People-to-people contacts, as 
well as exchanges in the cultural, scientific, technological, 
and sports fields, further increased, and an initial 
understanding was reached through consultations on routine 
matters. We insist that the differences between the two sides 
of the strait should be resolved by increasing contacts and 
consultations under the principle of one China. "The 
realization of the motherland's peaceful reunification is the 
common wish of all Chinese people. Any attempt or move to 
separate the motherland violates the fundamental interests of 
the Chinese nation and will be in vain, no matter what kind of 
trick is used. We hope the Taiwan authorities, and all the more 
hope the Taiwan people, put national interests above everything 
else and, together with us, make common efforts for the 
development of both sides' relations and the advancement of the 
motherland's peaceful reunification." 
  The possibility of Li Peng making revisions while delivering 
the speech to the NPC session cannot be completely ruled out.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung in Beijing and Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has decided to scale down several market 
reform initiatives unveiled at the watershed Third Communist 
Party Central Committee plenum last November. In their reports 
to be delivered after the National People's Congress opens to 
morrow, senior cadres, including Prime Minister Li Peng, Finance 
Minister Liu Zhongli and State Planning Minister Chen Jinhua 
will underscore traditional themes such as bolstering the state 
sector, bailing out poor regions, subsidizing agriculture, and 
controlling prices to ensure political stability. 
  The three senior ministers have also mothballed the radical 
exhortations that patriarch Deng Xiaoping recently made in 
Shanghai to speed up the introduction of a market economy. 
Moreover, Mr Li and his colleagues have given strong hints that 
the three-month-long austerity measure last autumn will continue 
in the coming year. 
  Sources close to the legislature said yesterday Mr Li and 
other State Council stalwarts had bowed to last-minute lobbying 
from the sectors of the polity that stood to lose from the 
implementation of Mr Deng's radical reforms: Entrepreneurs and 
workers in state enterprises, impoverished heartland provinces, 
and the agrarian lobby. 
  In his Government Work Report, Mr Li highlights Mr Deng's 
theory of the construction of a socialist market economy as well 
as the need to proceed with just announced reforms such as 
therestructuring of the ailing state enterprises. However, Mr 
Li and finance chief Mr Liu, who will deliver a Budget report on 
Friday, have made provisions for shoring up government-run 
enterprises as well as boosting aid to workers laid off in the 
interest of improving the efficiency of state firms. 
  For example, Mr Li indicates that "for the sake of helping 
large and medium-scale enterprises get out of their plight," 
Beijing will exempt such units from levies including 
contributions to funds for the construction of energy and 
transport projects. The premier also discloses that the central 
Government will set up special funds for the relief of laid-off 
workers. 
  In deference to the old goal of "taking grain as the key 
link", Beijing will assure the agrarian sector a new deal 
including raising the procurement price for rice, wheat, cotton 
and oil-bearing crops. 
  State subsidies will be vouchsafed 500 counties specializing 
in producing "commodity grain" as well as 150 counties 
specialising in cotton. 
  Mr Li pays a lot of attention to the plight of the rural 
sector and the growing hardship of the 900 million peasants. He 
acknowledges that the rate of growth of agriculture has fallen 
further behind other sectors in the past few years. The senior 
leader also pointed to bad harvest in the past few months which 
is set to put addi tional strain on the supply of grain and 
staple foods this year. Sources said Mr Li has promised to 
boost the annual growth of agriculture to at least five percent. 
  The reports by the three senior ministers spell a temporary 
end to price reform, a key component of Mr Deng's strategy for 
economic liberalization. 
  Mr Li and Mr Chen, who will address the NPC on social and 
economic development in 1994, endorse measures announced over 
the past week concerning the strict policy of controlling price 
levels by state price administration bureaus. Moreover, the 
premier says that Beijing will introduce a "mayor responsibility 
system" whereby leaders of municipalities will be asked to 
guarantee the stability of prices in their cites. 
  Mr Li indicates that the central authorities will continue 
to 
use economic tools to control prices. "Prices of commodities 
have to be supervised. We should seek further lifting of 
control in the process of supervision. We cannot lift all 
controls over price in one go," the premier says in his report. 
Informcd sources said the State Council had succumbed to 
intensive lobbying from heartland and western regions to ensure 
a more equitable distribution of national income, particulally 
increasing central-government aid to the poorer provinces. 
  The reports of Mr Li and Mr Chen will play up the centre's 
willingness to provide equal opportunities for laggards in the 
open-door policy. For example, a segment of the increased 
contributions to central funds will be distributed to the less 
well-off areas in the form of transfer payments. 
  NPC members who have read the reports said Beijing will 
continue to implement a tight money policy this year to curb 
speculative activities and avoid hyperinflation. In spite of 
protests from coastal provinces, Mr Li is expected to insist 
that the strict control over money supply and credit imposed 
since mid-1993 will have to stay. 
  Unregulated loans for investment in real estate will face 
severe curbs under the Government's development strategy for 
1994. The freeze on development zones, high-technology 
districts and industri al parks imposed last year will 
remainintact. 
  Sources said Mr Li's Government Work Report spoke positively 
about last year's austerity programme, which had been attacked 
by liberal economists as a "plot" by central planners to 
reimpose control in the name of curing economic dislocations. 
The macrolevel adjustment and control measures have helped 
tighten control over the surge of money supply and credit last 
year, Mr Li's report says. Greater government control will be 
imposed in order to establish "effective supervision" over the 
property market, the report says. 
  According to a copy of the report the central Government 
will 
make further efforts to push ahead with the drastic fiscal 
reform whose details have been laid down by Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji at the national financial work conference in mid-1993.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Chang Sheng-tai (1728 5110 </F>
1486) ] 
  [Text] The portion of the work report made by mainland 
premier Li Peng on foreign affairs was smaller compared to 
previous years in terms of length and number of characters. The 
highlighted keynote was still that China wishes to have a 
peaceful environment to promote economic development. As to 
bilateral relations with other countries, special emphasis was 
laid on diplomacy with the United States, indicating the 
latter's importance to China. But he made no mention of 
relations with Britain. To counter the "China threat theory" 
discussed by foreign media in recent years, the work report made 
a point of creating a "peace-loving" image of the CPC. 
  The portion of Li Peng's report on diplomatic work is under 
1,300 characters, shorter than those of previous years, which 
devoted nearly 2,000 characters to this topic. Therefore, 
almost all the topics that were given much space in previous 
years were mentioned only briefly this time. Also, there was 
not much originality, but much of the same old tune. On the 
overall international situation, Li Peng first highlighted that 
the world is moving toward multipolarization and that hegemonism 
and power politics still exist. This has been a consistent 
viewpoint held by the CPC authorities in recent years on the 
post-cold-war period, especially after the Gulf War in 1991. 
But Li Peng made a special point that the economy is becoming a 
dominant factor which influences the development of 
international relations. 
  On the topic of bilateral relations with other countries, 
apart from the Sino-U.S. relations that took up quite some 
space, all other relations were mentioned briefly with such 
wording as "the relations made progress" and "the friendly and 
cooperative relations gained further development." Last year, 
China devoted much space to emphasizing the importance of 
improving relations with surrounding countries, but the 
treatment of this topic in this year's report simply cannot be 
compared. Besides, the part on the Third World, which China 
used to set great store by, was almost completely left out this 
time. On the front of diplomacy with West Europe, Sino- German 
relations have obviously become China's focus in its Europe 
diplomacy and in the meantime, France's restoring friendship 
with Beijing was also praised. 
  In last year's report, when talking about relations with the 
United States, Li Peng only emphasized the importance of 
observing three communiques, saying that it would lead to the 
improvement of bilateral relations. This year's report, besides 
repeating this idea, held Deng Xiaoping's 16-character 
statement, i.e. "increasing trust, reducing trouble, developing 
cooperation, and refraining from confrontation," as the standard 
and emphasized the importance to have in mind the whole world 
and the 21st century. This shows that the two sides restored 
their relations after mainland President Jiang Zemin and U.S. 
President Clinton met each other last year, and that China needs 
the U.S. market, technology, and cooperation in security affairs. 
  Unlike previous years, in the final two parts on China's 
role 
in the United Nations and China's opinion on international 
issues, Li Peng strongly expressed the hope for peace and 
refuted the "China threat theory." Li Peng said: China stands 
for overall prohibition of nuclear weapons and the conclusion of 
agreements on banning all nuclear tests through negotiations. 
China does not engage in the arms race, does not join any 
military bloc, and does not seek its sphere of influence. He 
also emphasized that since there are many differences between 
countries, the relations between any two countries should be 
built on generally recognized norms of international relations. 
China is against hegemony. It does not seek hegemony now and 
will not do so after its economy is developed. It will not pose 
a threat to the world and the region. This effort to create a 
"peace-loving" image indicates that China's diplomatic policies 
in the coming years will serve its economic construction.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Nearly 3,000 deputies 
to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) have arrived in 
Beijing by this afternoon to attend its second session due to 
start Thursday (March 10). 
  The annual NPC session is an important event in China's 
political and economic life. During the coming session, 
deputies will deliberate Premier Li Peng's government work 
report, the national economic development plan, the state 
budget, and work reports of the Supreme People's Court, Supreme 
People's Procuratorate and the NPC Standing Committee. 
  This year's NPC session comes about 10 days earlier than 
usual, and future sessions are expected to be convened still 
earlier in the year. Observers say this is to ensure better 
planning of government work for the whole year. 
  Deputies know what business they will be doing during the 
session. In the past year most of them have made extensive 
investigations in their respective constituencies. Upon their 
arrival in Beijing, they start reading documents, preparing 
motions and exchanging information with one another. 
  Punco, a Tibetan deputy from Monba, an ethnic minority in 
China with the smallest population, said participation in state 
affairs was beyond the dream of Monba people in the past. 
Though the "gexia" (parliament) of old Tibet held meetings 
every year, it had nothing to do with Tibetan serfs. 
  Punco said he plans to raise a motion on developing Tibetan 
economy, especially its agriculture and animal husbandry. 
  Wang Dazhong, a deputy from a big state enterprise in 
Shaanxi 
Province, said that, as the country is probing ways for the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system in 1994, he plans to 
express his opinions on the necessity of establishing standards 
for market behaviors and strengthening law enforcement. 
  The Eighth NPC has 2,978 deputies. In the past year, five 
deputies passed away, one resigned, and two were disqualified. 
Standing committees of local people's congresses elected 
deputies for the vacancies according to law.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The 
most-urgently-needed human right is economic development, 
according to Puncog and Gyainzim, deputies from Tibet to the 
National People's Congress (NPC). 
  Puncog, of the Monba nationality, and Gyainzim, of the Lhoba 
nationality, are here to attend the Second Plenary Session of 
the NPC, China's legislature. 
  People of the Monba nationality live in Lebu in the depths 
of 
the Himalayas, while Lhoba people have their home in Medog 
County, known as an "isolated island on the Qinghai-Tibet 
plateau." 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Puncog said, "in old 
Tibet, we Monba and Lhoba people lived in harsh conditions and 
had no right whatsoever." 
  The parliament of the old Tibetan local government held a 
session every year, but "we Monba and Lhoba people were never 
invited to attend," he recalled. 
  People of the two ethnic minorities were liberated after 
democratic reforms were carried out in Tibet in 1959. 
  The two peoples were recognized by the central government as 
minority nationalities enjoying the same rights as other 
nationalities in China, he said. "As a result, we Monba and 
Lhoba people have become masters of the country together with 
people of the other 54 nationalities." 
  "The NPC has deputies from Monba and Lhoba people. We can 
now participate in the running and discussing of state affairs 
-- something unimaginable under the rule of the old Tibetan 
local government," he said. 
  Gyainzim said that, in old Tibet, the Monba and Lhoba people 
had absolutely nothing to do with state affairs. 
  "But now, as NPC deputies, we can say what our compatriots 
want to say to the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and 
the State Council," he said. 
  During the First NPC Session held a year ago, President 
Jiang 
Zemin visited the Tibet delegation and inquired about the 
living conditions of the Monba and Lhoba people, he recalled. 
  The two NPC deputies also noted that people of the two 
minority nationalities are now becoming increasingly prosperous. 
  For example, the population of Lhoba people has more than 
doubled in Medog county over the past four decades, Gyainzim 
said. 
  In old Tibet, there was not a single doctor or nurse in 
either Medog or Lebu, he recalled. 
  But now, hospitals have been built there and doctors are 
available in every township inhabited by the Monba and Lhoba 
people. 
  Previously, Monba and Lhoba people were all illiterates, he 
said. Now, a public primary school has been set up in Lebu and 
non-government-run primary schools have opened in four townships. 
  According to the two deputies, Monba and Lhoba people now 
all 
learn the Tibetan language. They have their own college 
students, technicians, teachers and doctors. 
  "The government has done everything in its power to help us 
ethnic minority people living in border areas become 
prosperous," Gyainzim said. 
  Medog County used to be the only county in China without 
access to roads, he said. To date, the state has spent 37 
million yuan building a road leading to Medog. 
  Many workers gave their lives while building the road, he 
said, adding that the road opened to traffic earlier this year. 
  The per-capita annual income in medog reached nearly 800 
yuan 
in 1993, up from just 100 yuan in the 1950s. 
  Puncog said that the Lebu area has scored even faster 
economic growth in recent years. 
  The per-capita annual income there exceeded 1,000 yuan last 
year, up from 90 yuan before 1959. 
  Savings deposits in the four townships inhabited by the 
Monba 
people totaled 450,000 yuan at the end of 1993, he said. 
  In old tibet, most Monba and Lhoba people lived in adobes 
worse than cattle pens in shape, he said, adding that most of 
them now live in new houses. 
  The government has earmarked 700,000 yuan to assist Monba 
people in Lebu in improving their housing conditions. As a 
result, 120 of the 144 Monba families have moved into new homes, 
he said. 
  The rapid progress made by Monba and Lhoba people in recent 
years serves as a good answer to the question of whether Tibet 
has human rights, they noted.

  [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping and leaders Jiang Zemin and 
Li Peng might have to make a declaration of assets including the 
investments of their children if the politically-sensitive 
policy is adopted by the Communist Party, it was suggested 
yesterday. According to a key adviser to China, Xu Simin, the 
present leadership is inclined to introduce the practice of 
declaration of economic interests, adding that he hoped it would 
be implemented in six months. 
  Mr Xu, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC, said senior 
party leader Li Ruihuan, also chairman of the conference, had 
agreed to make a declaration. Mr Xu, publisher of the Hong 
Kong-based monthly THE MIRROR, said he had further suggested 
that details of the education and work of the children of cadres 
should be reported. 
  Meanwhile, Cheng Yiu-tong, a Hong Kong delegate to the NPC 
said yesterday that he would suggest in the congress that the 
Chinese Government set up an anti-corruption body independent of 
the government. It was understood that the antigraft body would 
be similar to the Independent Commission Against Corruption 
(ICAC) in Hong Kong. A few provincial and municipal 
legislatures have already taken steps to enact local-level codes 
on the formation of ICAC-like bodies. 
  Talking to Hong Kong reporters yesterday, Mr Xu said a 
declaration of assets by leaders would help eliminate graft 
activities. "It might be likely that some cadres will transfer 
their money to accounts under the name of their children," he 
said. It is widely known that children of some senior leaders 
have been deeply involved with business activities overseas, 
particularly through Hong Kong. 
  They included the children of Mr Deng, the late Wang Zhen, 
and the Rong Yiren families. A number of children of current 
leaders such as Mr Jiang, Mr Li Peng, Mr Qiao Shi are also known 
to have studied and settled abroad. 
  Mr Xu said: "I'm not fingering any individuals but I just 
want to propose a way to solve the problem. "Yes. It's 
possible that there will be a lot of misreporting or 
underreporting of property. But at least we can have some 
information to pursue the matter. If people like Deng Xiaoping 
and Li Peng have made the declaration, others are not to evade 
the reporting," he said. 
  Mr Xu asserted that the crux of the battle against 
corruption 
was to launch the fight at the leading echelon of the party and 
the government. "If the leaders do not behave themselves you 
cannot expect the people further down to give a damn to the 
[anticorruption] campaign," he said. 
  The CPPCC Standing Committee said it reacted strongly at 
internal meetings on corruption and was critical over the 
achievements of the campaign since it was launched in August. 
  In an apparent move to quieten discontent, Mr Xu said the 
central government would hold a nationwide anti-corruption work 
conference in the next few days. The convening of the work 
conference coincides with the meetings of the CPPCC plenum which 
opened yesterday and the plenary session of the NPC scheduled 
for opening tomorrow. 
  Early this week, premier Li said in a meeting that unless 
the 
leadership was serious in the crackdown on corruption, the 
ruling party might lose its grip on power. 
  During the peak of the pro-democracy movement in 1989, 
former 
Communist Party boss Zhao Ziyang suggested that senior officials 
should make public their wealth and face public scrutiny. His 
suggestion was rejected by the senior echelon who accused him of 
using the issue to divide the party.

work of the Standing Committee over the past year. He said: 
Since the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, 
the Standing Committee, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, has worked 
hard to explore new ways to engage in political consultation and 
exercise democratic supervision, paying attention to selecting 
issues, bringing into play the favorable factors, and ensuring 
effective participation in the administration and discussion of 
state affairs focused on the central task of the nation. The 
Standing Committee has given full play to the role of the 
special committees and organized members to take part in various 
activities on a regular basis; has stepped up information 
service and reflected popular feelings in a timely and accurate 
manner; and has actively conducted CPPCC's exchanges with 
foreign countries in line with the overall arrangements of 
national diplomacy; thereby making advances in all fields of 
endeavor. 
  He said: The party and the government have already decided 
on the basic policy for 1994, a year of vital importance to 
China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive. 
This year will be the second year for the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee to carry out its work. The main points of the 
Standing Committee's work are: studying in depth the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to continuously 
raise the consensus; selecting major topics in economic 
construction, reform and opening up, spiritual civilization 
construction, and the people's life for investigation and study 
to ensure effective participation in the administration and 
discussion of state affairs; carrying forward the fine tradition 
and bringing into play the role of the democratic parties and 
the people's mass organizations in participating in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs; forging close 
ties with the people of all nationalities and in various 
circles, and harmonizing their relations and transmitting 
viewpoints of higher authorities to lower levels to safeguard 
political and social stability; improving and strengthening 
inspection and the work of handling motions to promote 
democratic supervision; broadening channels of communication 
with overseas Chinese to promote the motherland's peaceful 
reunification; utilizing the CPPCC's advantages to continue to 
develop friendly exchanges with parliaments and nongovernmental 
organizations of other countries; and improving the performance 
of offices in an all-round way by raising the quality of 
officers and raising office work efficiency. 
  Ye Xuanping's report received thunderous applause from

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will become a 
guiding principle in a revised constitution of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), according to 
a top CPPCC leader. 
  Also included in the CPPCC Constitution will be guidelines 
resulting from the recognition that China is at present in the 
primary stage of socialism as well as China's reform goal of 
establishing a socialist market economy, according to Hu Sheng, 
a vice-chairman of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and one 
of the vice-chairmen of a panel entrusted with revising the 
constitution. 
  New developments in China cry out for a revision of the 
CPPCC 
Constitution, Hu said. In the wake of Deng Xiaoping's 1992 
south China tour and the 14th National Congress of the Chinese 
Communist Party, he said, a new tide of reforms has swept the 
country and the national economy has been surging at an 
unprecedented speed. 
  Furthermore, to conform better to the Constitution of China, 
which was amended last year, a revision of the CPPCC 
Constitution has become more urgent, Hu said. 
  "When all is said, the 1982 CPPCC Constitution is a good 
one," he said. "What we'll do is only a partial revision."

<F P=106> ["Backgrounder: Chinese People's Political Consultative </F>
Conference" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is an intensive 
patriotic united front organization established on the eve of 
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It was 
founded jointly by the Communist Party of China (CPC), 
democratic parties, individuals without party affiliation, 
people's organizations, and personages from various social 
circles. 
  The first plenary session of the CPPCC was held in Beijing 
between September 21 and 30, 1949 and attended by 662 
representatives from all sections of the Chinese society. At 
the time, CPPCC exercised the functions and powers of the 
later-formed National People's Congress (NPC), China's 
legislature. The first CPPCC session adopted the "Common 
Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference," proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic 
of China (PRC), and elected the committee of the central 
people's government of the PRC with Mao Zedong as its chairman. 
It also decided the national flag and anthem, elected the first 
180-member National Committee of the CPPCC. 
  The Second CPPCC National Committee convened its first 
plenary session in Beijing in December, 1954. It declared that 
because of the convention of the First National People's 
Congress (NPC), CPPCC ceased to function as the country's 
legislature, but continued to exist as an organization of the 
People's Democratic United Front. 
  The plenary session elected Mao Zedong honorary chairman and 
Zhou Enlai chairman of its national committee. The Second 
National Committee of the CPPCC held three plenary sessions. 
  The Third CPPCC National Committee held its first plenary 
session in Beijing in April, 1959. From this session on, CPPCC 
members have begun to attend NPC sessions without voting rights. 
The session elected Mao Zedong honorary chairman and Zhou Enlai 
chairman of the National Committee. The Third CPPCC National 
Committee held four plenary sessions. 
  The first plenary session of the Fourth CPPCC National 
Committee was held in Beijing between December 1964 and January 
1965. It re- elected Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai its honorary 
chairman and chairman respectively. CPPCC was forced to stop 
operation during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and, as a 
result, the Fourth CPPCC National Committee held only one 
plenary session. 
  The Fifth CPPCC National Committee convened its first 
plenary 
session in Beijing in February 1976. Deng Xiaoping was elected 
its chairman. The National Committee held five plenary sessions. 
  The Sixth CPPCC National Committee, which convened its first 
plenary session in Beijing in June 1983, elected Deng Yingchao 
its chairwoman. The National Committee held five plenary 
sessions. 
  The Seventh CPPCC National Committee, which held its first 
plenary in Beijing between March 24 and April 10 of 1988, 
elected Li Xiannian its chairman. The National Committee 
convened five plenary sessions altogether. 
  The Eighth CPPCC National Committee held its first plenary 
session in Beijing during March 14-27, 1993. Attended by 2,093 
members, it elected Li Ruihuan its chairman. 
  CPPCC has always been an organization for patriotic united 
front work under the leadership of CPC. It consists of members 
of CPC and eight democratic parties, democratic personages 
without party affiliation, members of people's organizations, 
representatives of minority nationalities, prominent figures 
from all walks of life, representatives of Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Macao compatriots and returned overseas Chinese, and specially 
invited people. 
  CPPCC is an important instrument for promoting socialist 
democracy in China's political life. It participates in 
political consultations on major state policies and important 
issues concerning people's life, and exercises democratic 
supervision over CPC and the government by making suggestions 
and criticisms.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- The coming second 
session of the National Committee of the Eighth Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) should be democratic, 
practical, united and inspiring, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
CPPCC National Committee, said here today. 
  He said so at the fifth meeting of the Standing Committee of 
the CPPCC National Committee, which was preparing for the coming 
session and adjourned today. 
  Li said the coming session has to be democratic, for the 
CPPCC itself, as an organization through which the system of 
multi-party co-operation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can be achieved, is an 
important part of socialist democracy. 
  Furthermore, he said, the annual CPPCC session has become a 
big event in the national political life. It was only by 
following strictly the democratic procedures and creating a 
solid democratic atmosphere at the session that the principle of 
the people as the owners of the country could be truly embodied. 
  In building a socialist market economy, China will encounter 
many new and complicated issues, which demand all-round 
consideration, Li said. Various factors, whether favorable or 
unfavorable, and points of view, whether of the majority or of a 
small group, must be duly considered. 
  Li pointed out that only by taking a scientific attitude and 
a responsible approach could the CPPCC play a fair role in 
political consultations. 
  On the question of unity, Li said that since democracy has 
been stressed for the coming session, there might be different 
opinions and debates. Criticism and counter-criticism are 
unavoidable. 
  He said that all those are necessary, for the differences 
and 
debates are for seeking truth and solving problems. 
  He called for starting from a wish for unity and reaching 
the 
objective of unity. 
  He said that the People's Political Consultative Conference 
represents unity and the session of the CPPCC should display 
unity and promote unity so as to promote the unity of the people. 
  Talking about the guideline of "inspiration", Li Ruihuan 
said that since China adopted reforms and opening to the outside 
world, the country had achieved remarkable progress and at 
present, the situation in China was good. 
  But, he noted, since China is a large country with large 
population, the unprecedented reform in China was an arduous 
task. It has a positive side with success, inspiration and 
beauty, but also it has a negative side with mistakes and 
worries. 
  He called for a cool head for the objective phenomena in 
social life so as to make a complete analysis, accurate 
judgement and good management. 
  He said that the objective of criticism and exposition is to 
study and solve problems. 
  Li pointed out that the guidelines should be completely 
understood. Democracy and being realistic should be helpful to 
unity and inspiration, while stressing that unity and 
inspiration should promote democracy and being realistic. 
  He noted that the guidelines were formulated in 1990 for the 
plenary session of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the 
plenary session of the CPPCC.

<F P=106> ["Li Ruihuan's Speech on Guidelines for the Upcoming Chinese </F>
People's Political Consultative Conference, CPPCC, Session 
Delivered at the Fifth Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee Standing Committee on 5 March 1994" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the Fifth Session of 
the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee that 
closed today, Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the CPPCC 
National Committee, delivered an important speech on guidelines 
for the upcoming CPPCC session. The full text follows: 
  Originally I did not intend to speak at the current standing 
committee session. The chairmen's meeting yesterday decided 
that it would be better if I gave a speech and suggested that I 
address ways to properly convene the upcoming Second Session of 
the CPPCC National Committee. 
  The upcoming Second Session of the CPPCC National Committee 
is a very important meeting. Issues to be discussed at the 
meeting are major issues affecting the overall situation and 
concern China's reform, development, and stability. People 
across China and all CPPCC members pay great attention to the 
meeting and have expressed the hope that the meeting should be 
convened properly. To properly convene the upcoming meeting, 
the CPPCC National Committee has submitted a special report to 
the CPC Central Committee, proposing guidelines to facilitate a 
proper convening of the meeting. Under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the guidelines will promote democracy, realism, 
unity, and motivational atmosphere. The CPC Central Committee 
approved the report and the guidelines. I believe that to 
properly convene the upcoming meeting, we must thoroughly 
understand and earnestly implement the guidelines. 
  As I see it, the reasons why the guidelines stress 
"democracy" are first, the CPPCC organizations' nature mandates 
such decision. The CPPCC is an organizational format that 
facilitates a basic system of multiparty cooperation and 
political consultation under the CPC's leadership, and is an 
important channel that promotes socialist democracy. Therefore, 
a CPPCC meeting should certainly stress democracy. Second, the 
meeting's contents require such a move. The upcoming meeting 
will discuss many important issues. Only by thoroughly promoting 
democracy and pooling the wisdom of the masses can the meeting 
make correct decisions. Third, people across China hope for 
such characteristics. The annual "sessions of the National 
People's Congress [NPC] and CPPCC" have become a major political 
event for the Chinese people and a hot public topic. The 
Chinese people hope the "NPC and CPPCC sessions" will be 
enthusiastically held and will yield substantial results. They 
hope that the CPPCC session will strictly implement democratic 
procedures, that the execution of democratic rights is earnestly 
guaranteed, that a much more democratic atmosphere [nong hou de 
min zhu qi fen 3426 0624 4104 3046 0031 3049 3050] will be 
formed, and that the principle stressing the masses of people as 
masters of their own destiny can be truly displayed. 
  The guidelines stress "realism" because our meeting is not a 
formality merely for show; it aims to truly study and explore 
issues. At present, we are striving to establish a new 
socialist market economy. During the process, we are facing 
many major, new, difficult, and complicated issues. We need to 
comprehensively consider, carefully weigh, and repeatedly 
compare these issues. While studying and deciding on the issues, 
we should consider both the present and the long-term future, 
both the overall and partial situation, both their advantages 
and disadvantages, and both the current requirements and various 
possibilities. Additionally, while listening to the majority's 
views, we should also pay attention to the minority's ideas. 
Therefore, during the upcoming meeting, we should adopt a 
scientific attitude, and warmly, extensively, specifically, 
comprehensively, and thoroughly conduct in-depth discussions in 
an effort to fully demonstrate our strong sense of 
responsibility and the extent of our involvement in 
participating in and discussing government and political affairs. 
  We stress "unity" because we stress that democracy should 
be promoted at the CPPCC session where participants should 
freely express their views and study and discuss issues 
conscientiously and in a responsible way. This being the case, 
controversies over different opinions, criticism, and counter- 
criticism will be difficult to avoid. We think this is 
necessary and beneficial; at the same time, we must realize that 
all these are for better results in studying and solving issues, 
and are aimed at realism and achieving unity by proceeding from 
the desire for unity. Unity concerns the overall interest, and 
the overall interest is unity. The People's Political 
Consultative Conference is a symbol of great unity. A CPPCC 
session should embody and promote unity; and the result of such 
a meeting should promote unity among the people of the whole 
country. We hope that the participants to the session will 
respect and learn from one another; they should show more 
understanding and tolerance and reduce arguments. Through the 
session, they should enhance understanding, eliminate 
misunderstanding, promote consensus, and strengthen friendship. 
In short, they should unite to make the session a success and 
promote unity through the session. 
  The reason we stress "motivational atmosphere" is that since 
the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, the 
achievements we have scored are universally recognized. Our 
achievements last year were outstanding, and the current 
situation in all fields of endeavor is good. However, in 
embarking on undertakings which are unprecedentedly complex and 
arduous in such a huge country with a large population as ours, 
there are bound to be successes and failures; there will be 
encouraging news and matters that concern people; there will be 
a positive side and a negative side; and there will be a good 
side and an ugly side. It is necessary for us to be soberly 
aware of these objective phenomena in social life and to 
thoroughly analyze, accurately judge, and properly handle them. 
We allow criticism and exposure of all negative and evil 
phenomena, but at the same time we also hope that in the act of 
criticizing and exposing negative and evil phenomena, we should 
not lose sight of the positive and correct aspect -- or the 
mainstream. The purpose of criticism and exposure is study and 
solution of problems. We should pay attention to social 
effects, to the methods of solving problems, and to boosting 
morale and enhancing aspirations. We should bring the drive of 
the CPPCC members into full play during the entire process of 
the session and, through our session, instill the motivational 
atmosphere into the people of the whole country. 
  These eight characters -- "democracy, realism, unity, and 
motivational atmosphere" -- are interconnected and supplement 
each other, comprising an organic entity. They must be 
thoroughly understood. To strengthen democracy and realism, we 
must not neglect unity and motivational atmosphere; to stress 
unity and hard work, we must not cast aside democracy and 
realism. If we neglect unity and motivational atmosphere, we 
cannot achieve good results in holding a meeting; but if we 
abandon democracy and realism, it is meaningless to hold a 
meeting; democracy and realism should help promote unity and 
motivational atmosphere, while unity and the motivational 
atmosphere should promote democracy and realism. 
  "Democracy, realism, unity, and motivational atmosphere" was 
the principle adopted in 1990 for publicizing reports on the NPC 
and CPPCC sessions. In publicizing reports on these two 
sessions, we have applied this principle since 1990. In fact, 
it has become a guiding principle for convening the two sessions 
successfully. In recent years, these principles have been 
applied when people's congresses and CPPCC committee meetings 
were held by the provinces and cities. The implementation of 
this principle in our current session is required by the 
objective fact and also conforms to the desire of all CPPCC 
members. It is hoped that all of you will thoroughly understand 
it and conscientiously implement it. Under the leadership of 
the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core, let us conscientiously strive to make our session a 
meeting for democracy, realism, unity and motivational 
atmosphere.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The coming session of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is expected to give a boost to 
China's modernization drive and socialist democratic politics, 
according to a CPPCC spokesman. 
  Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Li Luye, the 
spokesman, said that the second session of the CPPCC Eighth 
National Committee to be opened tomorrow will be convened at a 
time when the country witnesses a robust economic development, 
political stability, unity of all nationalities and social 
progress. 
  Reviewing the work of the National Committee over the past 
year, Li said that CPPCC has played an important role in 
promoting exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, steps toward the 
reunification of China. 
  Answering a question on the ongoing anti-corruption drive in 
China, Li said that CPPCC has spared no effort to support and 
participate in the anticorruption drive launched by the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State 
Council. 
  Members of the CPPCC National Committee formed six groups, 
which conducted corruption-related investigations together with 
relevant departments of the State Council, the spokesman said. 
  Zhao Weizhi, deputy secretary-general of the National 
Committee, answered a question about revision of the CPPCC 
Constitution. Revision of the existing Constitution, which was 
adopted in 1982, is being guided by the spirit of the 14th 
National Congress of the Communist Party of China and aims at 
its convergence with the amended Constitution of the People's 
Republic of China, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China's main united front body has amended its 
constitution to play down class struggle among Chinese or 
between China and "hostile foreign forces" stating it is no 
longer the country's "major contradiction." The proposed 
amendment, the first since 1982, has been tabled at the opening 
of the second plenum of the Eighth Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held at the Great Hall of the 
People yesterday. 
  The amendment says the struggle between Chinese and "hostile 
forces in and out of the country" will be a long-term task. 
"Class struggle within a certain area will exist over a long 
period of time. But [it is] no longer the major contradiction 
of the society," it says. 
  The CPPCC constitution will state clearly the primary task 
of 
the country is modernization in accordance with the theory of 
Chinesestyle socialism and the "preliminary stage of socialism." 
Elaborations will also be made on the system of "political 
consultation" and "democratic supervision" over the party and 
Government. 
  The system forms a major component of the Chinese-style 
democratic political structure under Communist Party leadership. 
For instance, it spells out that the major function of the CPPCC 
is to organize political consultation and democratic supervision 
and the political participation of other sectors. 
  Ruling out the possibility of a multi-party system, the 
Communist Party has offered the CPPCC as well as the National 
People's Congress, nominally the highest power organ in China, 
greater say in national affairs. Delivering a work report of 
the CPPCC Standing Committee yesterday, Vice-Chairman Ye 
Xuanping reminded the 2,000- odd deputies of their vital role in 
the "historic period of vigorous development." 
  He asked members, however, not to "go beyond their terms of 
reference" when monitoring the government. Mr Ye maintained 
that the united front organ dubbed by cynics a "political vase" 
had made new progress in the first year of the current five-year 
session. He said the CPPCC's Standing Committee had taken part 
in the making of public policies on major issues facing the 
country such as corruption and inflation. 
  Warning that the enforcement of successive reform measures 
this year would inevitably lead to fresh social disputes, Mr Ye 
said in the report deputies should strive to help maintain 
political stability and unity. "[You should] mobilize all 
positive factors and transform negative factors into positive 
ones, so that the government can successfully implement its 
reform packages. "All CPPCC affiliates sub-committees and 
general membership should excel themselves in preserving the 
overall interest and in maintaining stability without doing 
anything prejudicial to unity and stability." 
  Mr Ye urged deputies actively to listen to and pass on the 
grievances of the populace and suggest effective solutions. 
"When a problem is not amenable to a quick solution, we should 
assist the government to plead for understanding by the public 
so as to defuse a crisis," he said.

<F P=106> [Speech by Li Peng at a gathering of foreign and domestic </F>
women to celebrate International Women's Day and to greet the 
1995 World Women's Congress in Beijing on 8 March] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- Guests, comrades, 
friends, sisters: 
  Today Chinese and foreign women are happily gathering here 
to 
celebrate the 8 March International Working Womens Day. On 
behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I 
extend felicitations to Chinese women of all nationalities, 
women compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas 
Chinese women; as well as warm welcome to guests from various 
countries present here today. 
  Chinese women constitute a great force for China's reforms 
and opening up and modernization. Since China adopted economic 
reforms and opened up to the outside world, there have been 
great changes in Chinese womens outlook, with remarkable 
progress in the quality of the women. Filled with ardor and 
sincerity, they have actively taken part in economic 
development; and have made important contributions in political, 
cultural, and social sectors, as well as in safeguarding family 
happiness. Chinese women enjoy a high status in society and 
they really hold up "half the sky" in building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  At present, China, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line, enjoys economic growth, political stability, 
national unity, and social progress. In international 
relations, the Chinese Government has steadfastly implemented an 
independent foreign policy of peace; and has made positive 
contributions to developing good neighborly relations with 
peripheral countries, strengthening friendship with various 
nations in the world, and promoting world peace and development. 
China's international prestige has been enhanced, and China has 
friends everywhere in the world. 
  In 1995, the United Nations will hold the Fourth World 
Womens 
Congress in Beijing. The congress is an important meeting to 
study womens issues of the world. It is a great honor for China 
to have the opportunity to prepare for and host the congress. 
The Chinese Government, Chinese people, and Chinese women will 
go all out to prepare for the congress, and will ensure its 
success. Only some 500 days are left until the Fourth World 
Womens Congress is convened. We should step up preparations and 
strengthen leadership over the preparatory work. All 
departments should work concertedly to provide favorable social 
milieus and first-rate service for the convocation of the 
congress. We should further attach importance to work related 
to women at home, guaranteeing their status, protecting their 
lawful rights and interests, and promoting their development and 
progress to ensure the realization of various goals set in the 
"Nairobi Strategy" before the end of this century. The broad 
masses of women should make further contributions to society 
while the community should do more concrete work for women. The 
mobilization and participation of the whole society will be a 
reliable guarantee for China's successful hosting of the Fourth 
World Womens Congress. 
  Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability are the overall 
interests of the work for the whole country and of the work 
related to women this year. Womens federations at all levels 
should get a clear understanding of the overall interests, 
strive to do well in all fields of endeavor, and encourage women 
at large to dedicate themselves to the great cause of 
modernization. Once the strength of Chinese women is fully 
harnessed, they will play an immeasurable role in promoting 
social progress and prosperity. We earnestly hope that Chinese 
women will, on the basis of striving to improve their 
ideological, moral, cultural, science and technology, and 
physical qualities, make still greater contributions to 
promoting the building of material and spiritual civilization, 
realizing the motherland's peaceful reunification, and 
safeguarding world peace. 
  Comrades, friends! China is at an important development 
period. It is the common will of all Chinese people, including 
Chinese women, to turn China into a prosperous, democratic, 
civilized modern socialist country. We believe that China's 
future is bright and the world future is broad. Let us, under 
the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin at the core, unite and work with one heart and one mind in 
striving from even greater victories in the cause of socialist 
modernization!

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- Publishers of DANGJIAN 
YANJIU [STUDY OF PARTY BUILDING] magazine under the CPC Central 
Committee's Organization Department held a forum on party 
building and a meeting commemorating the fifth anniversary of 
the magazine's publication in Zhongnanhai this morning. Jiang 
Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi wrote separate inscriptions on the 
fifth anniversary of the magazine's publication. 
  Jiang Zemin's inscription reads: "Make a success of party 
building research and serve the party's basic line," whereas Li 
Peng's inscription reads: "The more we carry out reform and 
opening up, the more we need to strengthen party building." 
Qiao Shi's inscription reads: "Build the party into a strong 
core that leads the cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics." Song Ping, Bo Yibo, and Song Renqiong also 
wrote inscriptions. 
  During the forum, Hu Jintao, Song Ping, and comrades in 
charge of relevant departments held spirited discussions with 
veteran comrades, party workers, and comrades from news 
organizations who were invited to attend the forum. They 
discussed ways to further strengthen research and publicity 
regarding party building theory in order to better serve the 
party's basic line under the new situation characterized by an 
accelerated drive for reform, opening up, and socialist market 
economic development. 
  In his speech, Comrade Hu Jintao first affirmed the 
achievements scored by DANGJIAN YANJIU magazine and noted: 
Since its inception five years ago, DANGJIAN YANJIU has been 
run efficiently and has played an important role in research and 
publicity regarding party building theory, thanks to the party 
Central Committee's concern, the solicitude and guidance of 
veteran comrades, and the support and assistance of people 
engaged in party building around the country. 
  Hu Jintao said emphatically: The key to developing the 
favorable situation further and to constantly advancing the 
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
lies in building our party well. During the new historical 
period, we have amassed a wealth of useful experiences in party 
building but are also confronted with many new circumstances and 
problems. We should understand the status and role of party 
building from the vantage point of the general international and 
domestic situation, long-term interests, and the future. We 
should study and solve new party- building tasks; boldly carry 
out practical work and explorations; sum up the ingenious 
efforts of people and grass-roots units on a timely basis; 
strengthen all facets of party building ideologically, 
organizationally, and in terms of the work style; further 
increase the rallying power, appeal, and fighting capacity of 
party organizations at all levels; and give greater scope to the 
party's role as a leadership core. 
  Hu Jintao expressed the hope that all comrades at the office 
in charge of party building under the CPC Central Committee's 
Organization Department and at the DANGJIAN YANJIU publishing 
house would carry on their efforts, sum up their experiences, 
build upon their achievements, uphold the goal of publishing the 
magazine, maintain the magazine's distinctive features, and make 
fresh contributions to further strengthening research and 
publicity regarding party building theory. 
  At the forum, Zhao Zongnai, deputy director of the CPC 
Central Committee's Organization Department, urged people 
engaged in party building to gain a profound understanding of 
the guidelines of the party Central Committee's directive on 
strengthening party building, strive to integrate theory with 
practice, serve the party's basic line, and make DANGJIAN YANJIU 
magazine an even greater success. 
  Comrades in charge of relevant departments present at the 
forum included Xu Weicheng, Zhang Quanjing, Zheng Keyang, Zhang 
Yunsheng, and You Lin. Veteran comrades invited to the forum 
included Chen Yeping, Guo Feng, Gao Yang, Li Lian, Zeng Zhi, and 
Zhou Yi.

  [Text] Beijing yesterday released a major address by 
President Jiang Zemin on the imperative of political stability 
and the vital role propaganda plays. Chinese sources said the 
speech, made on January 24 at a national meeting on propaganda 
work, provided the theoretical underpinning for a series of 
measures the administration would take to ward off 
socio-political instability. 
  Mr Jiang, who is also party chief, disclosed that in the 
training of cadres, more emphasis would be put on raising their 
ideological purity as well as their total obedience to the 
edicts of patriarch Deng Xiaoping. The President said the 
national goal this year was "safeguarding political stability" 
and "maintaining the sustained, high-speed and healthy 
development of the national economy. All comrades in the party 
must clearly recognize this national situation, and obey and 
provide service to this national situation," Mr Jiang said. 
  Reiterating a point of view that remnant Maoists had used 
against Mr Deng, Mr Jiang said the leadership must guard against 
"one hand being relatively strong, and the other hand being 
relatively weak". This is a reference to the fact that radical 
reformists such as ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang had 
concentrated on developing the economy while neglecting 
ideological indoctrination and "the dictatorship of the 
proletariat". 
  Mr Jiang urged the propaganda and media workers to "provide 
a 
correct guidance to public opinion. They [propaganda and media 
cadres] must insist on making good propaganda about the line, 
goals, and policies of the party," he said. "In political 
matters they must remain in unison with the Party Centre." 
  A large segment of the address was devoted to the 
propagation 
of a new generation of cadres who would be loyal to the party 
and to Marxism. He called upon central and provincial leaders 
to ensure that their officials would be "armed with the 
theoretical weapon" called Deng Thought. He also called upon 
regional leaders to use two to three years to provide training 
in Deng Thought to lower- level cadres. Special attention 
should be paid to the education of staff in the ideological, 
propaganda and media fields, Mr Jiang said. He urged leaders 
of various levels to show concernto these staffers "from the 
point of view of politics, ideology, work and lifestyle". 
  A Chinese source said in terms of its stress on Marxist 
orthodoxy, Mr Jiang's address was on a par with speeches made by 
the leadership soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre. They 
said Beijing had worked out plans to combat "de-stabilising 
factors" in the sensitive period that stretches from the opening 
of the National People's Congress this week to the fifth 
anniversary of the June 4 crisis. More state-security agents 
have been deployed to keep surveillance not only on dissidents 
but on "trouble-makers" in state factories, many of which are 
not paying full salaries. The media has been told to avoid 
reporting on "negative" news.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>
  [Text] Differences between conservative central planners 
and reformist officials within China's leadership have widened 
over the pace of controversial tax reforms in the runup to a 
full meeting of the national legislature later this week. 
Chinese sources said the issue was expected to be a major 
subject of debate among 3,000 deputies to the second plenary 
session of the 8th National People's Congress (NPC), to open on 
Thursday. The sources in the economic sector said yesterday the 
disagreement focused on whether the ongoing tax reforms would 
spark a new round of price spirals and whether anti-inflation 
measures or tax reforms should be given priority in policy. 
  Central planners, headed by Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier 
and former planning minister Zou Jiahua, have gained the upper 
hand in the in-fighting by taking advantage of disputes in the 
reformist camp and widespread discontent in the regions over the 
new taxation package initiated by reformist officials led by 
economic czar Zhu Rongji. Executive Vice-Premier Zhu argued 
that it was good timing to push ahead with the tax restructuring 
which, if proven successful in implementation, could build an 
effective mechanism for micro- control. And the mechanism in 
turn would help government efforts to combat inflation. Mr Zhu, 
also governor of China's central bank, said he preferred 
tightening monetary controls in order to ease inflationary 
pressures rather than using administrative means to reimpose 
price capping across the board or slap ping bans on investment. 
  But central planners believe that the ongoing package would 
inevitably spur a new round of price hikes and that the policy 
should be implemented cautiously and step by step. They said 
market stability and price control should be the priority in 
implementing reform policies. Beijing sources said that with 
wider support both in the central and regional authorities 
central planners had launched a series of measures to block the 
current reform package. Their latest and toughest move was a 
central circular that for the first time stated clearly that any 
tax reform measures should take second place to guaranteeing 
stable market prices. 
  On Friday, the State Planning Commission, the State Price 
Administration and the State Taxation Administration said in the 
circular to the regions that local governments must ensure 
stable market prices before they could implement the taxation 
package. The document, worked out by central planners led by Mr 
Zou, also gives local governments and regional planning and 
price departments extensive power to reimpose price capping on 
various commodities and services, many of which had been dropped 
in recent years following swift reforms to liberalise the 
economy. It also says that the central government would 
consider some regions' applications to suspend or stretch the 
time table for implementing tax reforms if inflation had got out 
of hand in their regions following too-rapid restructuring. 
  The State Planning Com mission is also set to call a 
national 
telephone conference on price inspection to day to be attended 
by senior regional economics and price administration officials. 
The meeting is to review the market situation two months after 
the implement tation of the first tax reform package in more 
than four decades. 
  Chinese economists said moves in the past few weeks had 
apparently set back the reform packages worked out by liberal 
officials led by Mr Zhu. They said the debate between the 
factions would escalate at the NPC meeting.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Tackle the Most Difficult Problems in Poverty </F>
Relief Efforts"] 
  [Text] From now until the end of the century, our country 
will be implementing a large-scale poverty relief scheme -- the 
"Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult Problems in the Eighth 
Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan." That is, we plan to work hard 
to basically solve the problem of food and clothes for the 80 
million poor people in seven years. This is a significant 
decision by the party Central Committee and State Council based 
on our country's tremendous achievements in the poverty relief 
scheme and development efforts. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Poverty is not socialism 
and socialism wants to eliminate poverty. In the 40-odd years 
since the founding of the PRC, led by the party and government, 
people in our country of all nationalities have made arduous 
efforts and scored world-renowned achievements in eliminating 
poverty and winning national prosperity, wealth, and power. In 
particular, following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, a range of rural reform polices, consisting 
mainly of the contract responsibility system on a household 
basis with remuneration linked to output, launched the rural 
economy on unprecedented development. Peasants' income rose 
sharply. In some areas, peasants led the way toward a 
comparatively well-off status, and most of the peasants now have 
enough to eat and wear. The problem of poverty, one that has 
long plagued rural areas, has been solved to a significant 
extent. 
  The party and government have always been concerned about 
production and living in poor areas and have viewed and pursued 
poverty-relief work as a key task. Following reform and opening 
up, they have adopted various measures to strengthen 
poverty-relief work. They have increased capital inputs and 
adjusted and reformed the traditional poverty-relief methods, 
linking relief to developmental projects instead of keeping them 
as pure welfare programs. As a result, extensive areas of 
chronic poverty changed their outlook and poverty was reduced 
significantly. This was an achievement of a historic nature, 
one scored against the persistently high percentages of poor 
populations and deteriorating poverty in the 1980's and fully 
revealing the superiority of the socialist system. 
  However, ours is a big country where situations differ and 
development varies in level. While the problem of having enough 
to eat and wear is no longer a national problem, there are still 
some areas where development remains slow and part of the 
population still do not have enough to eat and wear. People in 
a few extremely poor areas still lead a very hard life. The 
implementation of the "Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult 
Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan" carries 
great realistic and profound historical significance. Solving 
the problem of having enough to eat and wear for 80 million 
people by the end of this century means the solution of the 
subsistence problem for one quarter of the world's population. 
This will be a great event forever written on Chinese history 
as well as a great act in the development of mankind. Poor 
people account for only a minority of the country's rural 
population, however most of them live in hilly areas, rocky 
mountains, deserts, high-altitude mountains, loess plateaus, 
areas of high epidemics, and reservoir areas in the mid-west. 
Remoteness, inaccessibility, imbalanced ecology, slow economic 
development, and backward culture and education mean harsh 
living conditions. Therefore, seven years will be required to 
solve the problem of having enough to eat and wear for 
populations in these poor areas. The task is much more difficult 
than the poverty-relief work in the early phase. 
  We are determined, confident, and capable of winning this 
poverty-fighting battle. First, the party Central Committee and 
the State Council are taking this task very seriously. The 14th 
Party Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee convened last year, and the central rural work 
conference and related documents all stressed the significance 
of poverty relief and development work and put forward 
objectives and requirements. The leading comrade of the party 
Central Committee and State Council made many visits to poor 
areas to conduct investigations and studies and organized 
leadership there. These are the important guarantees for 
winning the battle of tackling key problems in poverty-relief 
work. Secondly, the vast number of cadres and people in poor 
areas have a strong wish to rid themselves of poverty and 
backwardness. There is enormous motivation among them to shed 
poverty and attain wealth. This is the inner dynamism for 
fighting this decisive battle against poverty. The fact that a 
large number of models who rid themselves of poverty and 
attained wealth with essential state help and their own 
independent effort have emerged from previous poverty relief and 
development, fully proves the point. Thirdly, further deepening 
reforms, especially the gradual establishment of the socialist 
market economic system, has brought unprecedented opportunity 
and wide prospects for economic development in poor areas. For 
instance, as a result of comprehensive opening up, large numbers 
of remote borders and backward, quiet, and inland poor areas are 
becoming outposts for opening up and key ports for border trade. 
High-speed growth in coastal economically advanced areas have 
created massive labor service markets and job opportunities for 
the abundant labor supply in poor areas. As reforms in the 
circulation sector gradually unfold and prices are deregulated, 
poor areas may look forward to a real possibility of exchanging 
their rich natural resources for goods and services of coastal, 
economically advanced areas on parity and increases in their 
income. Fourth, the state will increase, as it has done before, 
inputs in poor areas and the effort at poverty relief and 
development. The State Council has decided to, from now until 
2000, annually increase 1 billion yuan worth of work-relief 
programs and special interest-inclusive loans. Provinces, 
cities, and autonomous regions will also increase input in 
poverty relief and development. These are the material 
guarantees for the effort to take on the most difficult problems 
in poverty relief. 
  Strengthening leadership at all levels in poor areas is an 
important condition for the battle to fight poverty. Policies, 
capital, and projects are naturally important, but they require 
a strong and combative leadership in order to be useful. Such a 
strong leadership must have sustained and unflinching courage, 
an enterprising spirit, readiness for long-term struggle, 
concern for the masses, and a good, pragmatic, and down-to-earth 
work style. Such leadership will unify party members, cadres, 
and the masses to change poverty. 
  Tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief is 
not 
only an affair for poor areas, but also a common responsibility 
for the whole society, and requires the effort of all members in 
society. All professions, trades, departments, democratic 
parties, and people's associations must look at poverty relief 
as part of their duties, practice traditional Chinese ethics, 
and give their hearts and contribute their efforts to the 
poverty-fighting battle. 
  The implementation of the "Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult 
Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan" marks the 
last decisive stage of poverty relief and development, which is 
aimed at solving the problem of having enough to eat and wear in 
rural areas. The realization of the scheme marks a new 
historical stage in the economic and social development of poor 
areas. Leading cadres must have a great sense of responsibility 
and mission, and fight well the historically significant battle 
of tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief. If 
our ancient ancestors could feel "ashamed of getting pay while 
there are beggars in town," should we not feel the same today? 
We believe that, led by the Central Committee and State 
Council, the people of all nationalities throughout the country 
will be united in heart and mind, join in concerted effort, win 
this hard battle, and march into the 21st century triumphantly.

"Reforming Medical Insurance Is Imperative -- A Newsletter on 
Public-Funded Medicare"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Feb (XINHUA] -- "Progressing with 
unsteady pace" might be apt wording to describe China's efforts 
to reform its medical system reform. Some regions in recent 
years did try to carry out partial reforms of the public-funded 
and labor insurance medical systems, with the aim of controlling 
rising medical expenses within a reasonable limit and of better 
and effectively utilizing the limited public health resources 
under the premise of ensuring basic medical care for staff 
members and workers. 
  Reform has already begun, and its direction has been 
determined. Only by accelerating the pace to reform the current 
medical care system, by establishing diverse forms and different 
levels of the medical care system which is adapted to China's 
actual conditions, and by gradually increasing the percentage of 
people covered under the medical insurance, will it be possible 
to allow all members of society to receive basic medical 
guarantees and raise the health level of the entire nation. 
  An authority from public health circles pointed out that the 
purpose of reforming the current medical system is to 
fundamentally safeguard the citizens' basic rights for medical 
treatment and to ensure against the lowering of their level and 
quality of medical treatment. 
  China's public-funded medical system was established in 
1952, 
initially covering personnel in all levels of government organs; 
political parties; people's organizations; educational, 
scientific, cultural, and public health institutions; and some 
disabled military servicemen. That system was later expanded to 
cover students at higher institutes of learning. Presently 
there are some 29 million people throughout the nation enjoying 
the benefits of public-funded medical care. Government budgets 
finance the costs of medical care. 
  China's labor medical insurance began in 1951. Staff members 
and workers, as well as their dependents at collective-owned 
enterprises, enjoy the benefits of the labor medical insurance 
system. Both the publicly-funded medical system and the labor 
medical insurance system provide the same kind of medical 
services. Enterprises pay for the costs of medical treatment 
incurred by their employees. Presently some 144 million people 
throughout the nation are under labor insurance medical coverage. 
  Undoubtedly, public-funded and labor insurance medical care 
systems have played important roles in safeguarding the health 
of staff members and workers, have promoted economic 
development, and have helped maintain social stability in their 
40 years of implementation in China. However, the defects of 
those systems are also apparent. As state and enterprises pay 
for medical expenses, and as individuals do not have to pay for 
medical expenses, there is a lack of an effective system to stop 
abuse. Some of the abuses include: a person who is covered 
under the public-funded medical system receives medical 
treatment for the rest of his family; some pass themselves off 
as eligible for free public medical service; patients make 
unreasonable demands for certain medicines; doctors prescribe 
medicines to show personal favors; doctors prescribe expensive 
medicines; and doctors conduct unnecessary medical examinations. 
These abuses have caused a serious waste of public health 
resources 
  With the increase costs of medicine and medical equipment, 
the renewal and replacement of medical equipment, the graying of 
the population, and the changes in the nature of illness in 
recent years, annual expenditures in public-funded and labor 
insurance medical costs have increased rapidly, far exceeding 
state revenue growth and forcing the state and enterprises to 
shoulder a heavier financial burden. An expert pointed out that 
the level of China's social and economic development at this 
stage cannot support the current medical care systems. 
  The economic development and constant deepening of the 
reform of the economic system in the 1990s presented 
public-funded and labor insurance medical care systems with new 
problems. As there is a lack of rational mechanisms to pool 
funds for medical care and to stabilize the financial sources 
for medical expenses, staff members and workers will be unable 
to enjoy their rightful and basic medical treatment when the 
operation of their enterprises become difficult. 
  The present medical care system does not provide medical 
guarantees for staff members and workers employed at some small 
enterprises; at privately-run enterprises; and at Sino-foreign 
joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises. In addition, some eight million 
people in urban and rural areas who are employed in the private 
industrial and commercial sectors are also excluded from the 
current medical coverage. The current system, with a small 
percentage of people under its medical insurance coverage, and 
with its poor management and service and low degree of 
socialization, is not only unable to adapt to the requirements 
for building a socialist market economy in China, but is also 
finding it increasingly difficult to continue operating. 
  Is there a way out? Reform is the only way out. In March 
1989 the State Council formally approved four cities--Siping in 
Jilin, Dandong in Liaoning, Huangshhi in Hubei, and Zhuzhou in 
Hunan--to conduct a pilot program to reform the medical 
insurance system. A pilot program to reform the social medical 
insurance system was also conducted in Shenzhen and Hainan. 
  Many regions have begun practicing a medical-cost-sharing 
system. According to this system, staff members and workers are 
required to pay a small amount of their medical costs when 
receiving treatment. About 90 percent of the people who receive 
public-funded medical care have now joined the 
medical-cost-sharing system. About 80 percent of small and 
medium enterprises under the labor insurance medical care system 
also practice the cost-sharing method. When seeking medical 
treatment, an individual is generally required to pay for 10 to 
15 percent of the cost. The highest amount which a staff member 
or worker pays for their medical costs during a year does not 
exceed the average level of their monthly wages. 
  The same expert cited above claims this cost-sharing system 
will have some effect in helping staff members and workers 
become cost-conscientious and in helping control excessive 
medical costs. Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang stressed: 
"The purpose of reforming the social medical safeguard system 
is to increase efficiency in using the limited public health 
resources, and to raise the awareness of the individual and the 
family to invest in health." It has been learned that relevant 
departments of the State Council have drafted opinions on 
carrying out a pilot program on the establishment of a medical 
insurance system for staff members and workers. As the reform 
of the medical safeguard system for staff members and workers is 
a major reform involving the personal interests of staff members 
and workers, and as there is no sufficient and good experience 
as yet for such reform, the State Council has decided to select 
two cities to carry out the experiment in order to ensure a 
stable transition. 
  This reporter has learned the basic thinking for reform is 
to 
divide into two portions the medical costs of the public-funded 
and labor insurance medical care systems, which is now being 
jointly financed by state budgets and enterprises. Some of the 
funds will go to the establishment of a social insurance fund, 
which will be used to cover expenditures for treatment of major 
illnesses of staff members and workers; other portions will be 
used to establish a medical account for individuals. Staff 
members and workers shall regularly contribute appropriate funds 
from their wages to replenish individual medical accounts for 
general medical treatment expenses. Localities must work out 
measures to suit local conditions and avoid uniformity. All in 
all, reforming the medical insurance system has become 
imperative.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to 
information gathered by this reporter from a national forum on 
the development of small towns held by the Ministry of Civil 
Affairs today, the development of small towns in our country has 
proceeded by leaps and bounds since the program of reform and 
opening up was initiated. By the end of 1992, there were 55,000 
small towns in rural China, of which 14,500 were organized along 
administrative lines, compared with 2,200 in the early eighties. 
  Comrades attending the forum were of the opinion that the 
development of small towns is an inevitable consequence and 
objective demand of rural reform, as well as the inevitable 
direction in which urbanization with Chinese characteristics 
must proceed. The proliferation of small towns has resulted in 
the transfer of large numbers of surplus workers in rural China 
to secondary and tertiary industries, thereby promoting an 
industrial restructuring within the farming sector. The 
development of small towns has stimulated the exchange of 
commodities in rural areas, promoted market development, and 
facilitated the formation of socialized service networks in the 
countryside. Moreover, the urbanization mode adopted for the 
development of small towns, in which "people leave their 
farmland but not their hometowns," has substantially bucked the 
tide of migrants from rural areas into large and medium cities 
in the course of modernization. 
  The Ministry of Civil Affairs held the forum with the aim of 
further implementing the important strategic ideas of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council regarding small towns, 
and of making preparations for revising the standards for 
administratively organized towns to facilitate the process of 
integrating urban and rural areas. In his speech, Minister of 
Civil Affairs Doje Cering pointed out: During the current 
development of small towns, we must ensure that the geographical 
distribution of such towns is rational and achieve better 
results by virtue of the proper size of such towns. Also, we 
should establish a multilevel and multifunctional social 
security system, bearing the distinctive features of small towns 
in mind, so as to gradually advance the process of introducing 
community-wide social security in small towns. 
  More than 30 people attended today's forum. They included 
specialists from the Geography Institute of the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Chinese 
Urban Planning Research Institute, Beijing University, and other 
research institutes and educational institutions, as well as 
comrades in charge of relevant State Council departments.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 5 (XINHUA) -- China has stepped up 
efforts to recycle used and waste materials so as to stem the 
worsening resources shortage and environmental pollution. 
  According to information from the Ministry of Internal 
Trade, 
a comprehensive waste-recycling system has taken shape across 
the country, generating considerable profit. 
  In certain departments, such as metallurgy and light 
industry, more than 70 percent of waste has been reused, say 
officials in charge of waste-recycling. 
  China, the most populated country in the world, is also a 
large waste producer. 
  It is estimated that each year, China discharges at least 
800 
million tons of industrial waste, ore tailings and garbage, most 
of which can be reclaimed. 
  Getting useful materials from waste has long been placed 
high 
on the government's agenda. 
  To date, some 4,700 large waste-recycling companies and over 
120,000 collection points spread across the country have been 
established, recovering annually 35 million tons of waste 
materials, saving up to 20 billion yuan (2.3 billion U.S. 
Dollars) a year. 
  The recycling rate has seen remarkable growth in big 
consumers of materials and energy. 
  In the country's major iron and steel companies in Beijing, 
Shanghai, Anshan and Tangshan, 90 percent of their effluents has 
been recycled. 
  The Chengdu Seamless Steel Tubing Mill in southwest China's 
Sichuan Province has recycled all its waste water, leaving 
virtually no harmful discharge. 
  Sixteen companies in the country have started to recycle 
coal 
gas and residues discharged from their boilers. 
  In addition, according to inspection of more than 130 firms 
in the trades of papermaking, consumer chemicals, sugar 
producing and so on, measures have been taken to reuse their 
waste. 
  The sugarcane chemical works in Jiangmen, Guangdong 
Province, 
has taken the lead in making paper from the residue of sugarcane 
while producing alcohol, yeast, aldehyde and fertilizer with 
waste generated during the process of papermaking. 
  Chinese scientists have also successfully recovered silver 
from used films. Techniques to recycle waste rubber and iron 
scrap have also been worked out.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Gao Jun: "Contest Plan to Make </F>
China Green"] 
  [Text] The government is launching an annual contest to 
reward the nation's greenest cities, counties, townships and 
villages. 
  The move is a new initiative to boost the country's 
tree-planning drive. 
  Cities will be in the running to become one of the country's 
"top ten" if at least 85 percent of the local residents have 
voluntarily planted trees, said a circular issued by the 
Forestry Ministry and the National Afforestation Committee. 
  At least 30 percent of each city must be covered with trees, 
grass and flowers. Each resident should have at least 5 square 
metres of green space. 
  In addition, every construction project must include green 
areas. 
  The judges will also consider no candidate in whose area 
there has been a serious natural or man-made forestry accident 
in the past five years, said the circular. 
  As well as the green cities, the judges will select 100 
counties and 100 townships and 1,000 villages each year, the 
circular said. 
  The winners will receive medals and certificates, but their 
titles will be revoked if their standards fall, the circular 
added. 
  The green contest aims to boost the drive to control soil 
erosion and to relieve the damage caused by storms and sand. 
  It is also designed to encourage local farmers to make more 
profits by planting trees and developing forests. 
  Forestry officials said the prize winners should also 
perform 
a leading role in improving the farmers' living standards and 
helping them escape poverty. 
  Meanwhile, China's top forestry official vowed yesterday to 
work full time to improve procedures to prevent forest fires. 
  The news came during a national telephone work conference, 
chaired in Beijing, during which it emerged that forest fires 
decreased remarkably last year, thanks to the persistent efforts 
of local governments and forestry staff. Forestry Minister Xu 
Youfang told the conference that the area of forest hit by fires 
nationwide last year tumbled 54.3 percent from 1992. 
  The number of individual fires fell by 34.7 percent, he 
said. 
  And the figures are respectively 41 and 42.3 percent lower 
than the average level of the previous five years, he added. 
  However, he went on to call for better equipment and 
training 
for the country's forest firefighters to enable them to cope 
with all emergencies. 
  Xu also stressed that regulations or fire prevention should 
be improved and more strictly enforced. 
  A professional network to prevent forest fires should be 
established to analyze and research the causes an spread of 
fires, he said. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng called on local governments 
to 
remain vigilant saying they must do all they could to avoid 
anything that might cause similar damage as suffered by other 
countries in recent forest fires.

  [Text] China's new securities law has been shelved by 
ideological debates within the leadership revolving around 
upstart millionaires and the future of socialism. A news 
blackout has been imposed on the controversy over the law, which 
was to have been approved by the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress in April. "It is now doubtful 
whether the law can be passed before 1995," a member of the 
drafting team said. "This has turned into a deeply political 
problem." 
  A draft handed over to the National People's Congress legal 
work committee in January contained provisions which would allow 
shares in state-owned firms to trade freely on stock exchanges. 
Backed by securities authorities, the head of the drafting 
team, Professor Li Yining of Beijing University, argued that 
"state shares should be tradable, otherwise they are dead". 
  Some senior leaders, notably Chen Qingtai, a vice minister 
of 
the State Economic and Trade Commission in charge of reform of 
state enterprises, said enterprise reforms should first be given 
a chance to work before the door is opened for state firms to be 
privatised. "It's a debate about when this approach should be 
taken," the drafting team member said. "Some people feel the 
central government should take measures to make sure this does 
not happen too fast." 
  While the public ownership issue has been looming since 
drafting work began last year, a new ideological conflict has 
arisen on winners and losers in the country's volatile stock 
markets which has further complicated passage of the proposed 
securities law, the member said. Beijing is afraid that the 
rapid worsening of fortunes among China's relatively well 
educated and informed new stock investors may set off protests 
as more cases of insider trading and corruption are revealed, 
the member said. A survey by the State Commission for Economic 
Reform at the end of last year found that 43.2 per cent of 
China's shareholders lost money, while only 23.8 per cent made 
money and 32.4 per cent broke even. 
  The poor overall returns were explained by the fact that 
more 
than half of China's 25 million-plus shareholders bought shares 
for the first time in 1993, when profits from share trading 
suddenly became thin. "They have realised that the upstart 
millionaires are usually of low cultural quality, but are 
well-connected, while the bulk of those who lose money are 
well-educated," the member said. "The central government has 
become more cautious since secondary markets have been less 
profitable," the source said. "The situation is different from 
(the riots) in Shenzhen in 1992, when workers and peasants 
protested because of corruption. Now it's a question of 
middle-class people losing money." 
  More than 58 per cent in the survey felt the operation of 
markets was not fair, with 86 per cent identifying 
administrative interference, incomplete laws or insider trading 
as the biggest problem. Beijing intends to sit on the new 
securities law for most of this year while asking the Shanghai 
and Shenzhen markets to continue improving trading, listing and 
disclosure systems, the source said. 
  Big cases of corruption will also be rooted out to "pacify 
the worries of the shareholders". Beijing last week sentenced 
to death Shen Taifu, chairman of the Great Wall Electrical 
Machinery Company, which illegally raised more than a billion 
renminbi [RMB] (HK$888m) [Hong Kong dollars] from investors last 
year, of which Shen embezzled more than RMB4m and handed out 
RMB250,000 in bribes. 
  Last month a brokerage affiliated to the Agricultural Bank 
of 
China was heavily fined for making RMB6.72m on insider trading. 
"The government feels the need to stabilise the worries of the 
majority of shareholders before allowing any more development of 
the stock markets," the member said.

  Beijing Central Television Program One Network in Mandarin 
at 1310 GMT on 6 February broadcasts the first of a 10-part 
series consisting of nine lectures, and one question and answer 
session, entitled: "TV Lecture Series on Several Current Major 
Programs for Reforming the Economic System." 
  The first lecture, entitled: "The Great Significance and 
Main Points of the 'Decision' adopted by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee," is given by Zeng 
Peiyan, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission. 
  Zeng begins by briefly introducing the 10-part series, which 
is cosponsored by the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda 
Department and State Council's General Office, and is aimed at 
helping viewers "accurately grasp the contents of the several 
major reform programs currently going on in the finance and 
taxation, banking, foreign trade, investment, and enterprise 
systems." According to Zeng, the titles of the remaining eight 
lectures are: The Industry and Business Tax System, The Foreign 
Exchange Control System, Separated Financial and Taxation 
System, The Banking System, Mechanisms for Price Formulation, 
The Financial Investment System, The Foreign Trade System, and 
The Modern Enterprise System. The final part in the series is a 
question and answer session on the lectures. 
  As he turns to the subject of first lecture -- the decision 
on establishment a socialist market economic structure -- the 
vice minister underscores the "profound, practical, and 
far-reaching historical significance" of the decision, hailing 
the major CPC document as "a concrete expression of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics" and "program of action for building a socialist 
market economy." He cites the decision at length to explain the 
development of productive forces as the basic task of socialism, 
saying: "The socialist market economic structure is linked with 
the basic system of socialism, and the establishment of this 
structure is aimed at enabling the market to play the 
fundamental role in resource allocations under macro- economic 
control by the state." Hence, in the course of reform, he 
stresses that we must "decide on the various steps of reform and 
judge their success or failure by always adhering to the basic 
criterion of whether they help develop the productive forces of 
socialist society, enhance the overall strength of the socialist 
state, and improve the people's living standards." He outlines 
the contents of the decision, which consists of 50 sections in 
10 parts involving reforms in various aspects of Chinese 
economic life, as well as stresses the need for the CPC to 
strengthen leadership in striving to initiate the socialist 
market economy by the end of this century. Describing the 
"basic features" of the decision, he notes its consistency in 
summarizing experiences in socialist construction since the 
PRC's founding and its emphasis on coordination between various 
reform programs. 
  At 1350 GMT the vice minister concludes the lecture by 
saying: The establishment of socialist market economy is a 
pioneering undertaking unprecedented in history and it requires 
tackling many extremely complicated problems. However, so long 
as the Chinese people unswervingly adhere to Deng's theory and 
the party's basic line, they can stand all kinds of tests and 
successfully achieve the great goals of reform, opening to the 
outside world, and modernization.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 1305 GMT on 7 February broadcasts the 
54-minute second of a 10-part series consisting of nine 
lectures, and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV 
Lecture Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming 
the Economic System." 
  The second lecture, entitled: "The Industry and Business Tax 
System," is given by Jin Xin, deputy director of the State 
Administration of Taxation. 
  Jin Xin begins by noting that tax reform is one of a series 
of reforms for building a socialist market economy drafted in 
the decision on establishing a socialist market economy adopted 
by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
He goes on to discuss five issues concerning China's reform of 
the industry and business tax system: 
  1. The purpose of tax reform: Jin says: "Tax reform is 
conducted to meet the needs of developing a market economy." He 
explains the reasons why it is necessary and imperative to 
reform the tax system on a large scale and supports his 
arguments by pointing out that shortcomings in the tax system 
already implemented have hindered the development of a market 
economy. 
  2. The guiding ideology for tax reform: Jin says: "Tax 
reform should follow the guiding principles of unifying tax 
laws, imposing taxes fairly, streamlining the tax system, 
dividing power rationally, rationalizing distribution relations, 
standardizing distribution methods, ensuring revenue, and 
establishing a tax system in conformity with a socialist market 
economy." He goes on to expound the guiding ideology and 
outline of the draft for tax system reform. He also names seven 
major categories of taxes which have come into force in the tax 
reform package: Value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, 
institutional income tax, individual income tax, resource tax, 
and increment tax on land value. 
  3. The main points of tax reform: Jin says the scope of the 
current tax reform includes the reform in the turnover tax 
system, enterprise income tax system, individual income tax 
system, and most local taxes. Jin defines turnover tax as "a 
general designation of all taxes imposed on the production and 
circulation of commodities and on the sale or operation of labor 
services," and emphasizes: "The reform of the turnover tax 
system is the crux of this tax reform, because turnover tax has 
been the main category in the structure of the tax system since 
China's founding." He also elaborates on the reform of 
value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax, which are 
included in turnover tax, as well as other taxes; and gives 
examples for each one. 
  4. Tax reform, and the policies and principles for solving 
some important problems: Problems arising from tax reform are 
reflected mainly in the burden of taxes and the enforcement of a 
preferential tax policy. Explaining the turnover tax imposed on 
foreign-invested enterprises after the new tax system comes into 
force, Jin notes: "In order to maintain the continuity and 
stability of the tax policy for foreign investors as well as 
China's reform and open policy, proper measures should be taken 
to solve the problem that taxes have actually increased for some 
foreign-invested enterprises." To solve such problems, policies 
and measures will be adopted to make sure nobody suffers a sharp 
increase in taxes and the state does not lose sources of revenue. 
  5. The reform of tax collection and management: To ensure 
effective tax collection and management, and enforcement of tax 
laws, Jin puts forward six proposals, including establishing the 
system of declaring taxes, promoting the system of taxation 
agencies (such as accounting firms and law offices), stepping up 
the computerization of tax collection and management, 
establishing a strict taxation auditing system, establishing 
separated central and local taxation systems in line with the 
tax assignment system, and stepping up taxation legislation. 
  At 1359 GMT Jin concludes by saying that tax reform will 
play 
a positive role in strengthening and improving macroeconomic 
regulation and control, in stepping up taxation legislation, 
advancing reform and opening, and promoting sustained, healthy, 
and rapid economic growth as all relevant measures are unfolded.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 16 February broadcasts the 
54-minute third of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures, 
and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture 
Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the 
Economic System" 
  The third lecture, entitled: "The Foreign Exchange Control 
System," is given by Zhu Xiaohua, vice governor of the People's 
Bank of China and concurrently director of the State 
Administration of Exchange Control. 
  Zhu begins by saying: The resolution of the CPC Central 
Committee on certain issues concerning the establishment of a 
socialist market economy adopted on 14 October 1993, 
specifically requires reform of the exchange control system and 
establishment of a floating exchange rate system on the basis of 
market supply and demand, and under proper control; as well as a 
unitary and standardized foreign exchange market to make the 
Renminbi gradually become a convertible currency. To further 
implement the requirements raised by the resolution, the State 
Council and People's Bank of China issued circulars on 
accelerating reform of the exchange control system. The reform 
measure will have a great impact on China's economic opening up 
and development in the future. 
  He continues: The coexistence of dual exchange rates 
resulted in two calculating standards and two prices for the 
Renminbi in the past. Zhu says: "It was not conducive to the 
transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, to the 
utilization of foreign funds, to international economic 
exchanges, or to the development of the market system as a 
whole." Furthermore, Zhu notes: "Deepening reform of the 
exchange system is an objective requirement for economic 
development under the situation of accelerating development, 
reform, and opening up." He then goes on to outline the main 
points of the reform measure: 
  1. Beginning from 1 January 1994, two different exchange 
rates were merged and a unitary floating exchange rate system on 
the basis of market supply and demand, and under proper control 
has been implemented. Zhu says: "Implementation of the new 
exchange rate system has important significance for China in 
opening up its doors wider to the outside world and developing 
economic cooperation, trade, and contacts with all the other 
countries in the world; and meanwhile, complies with the 
exchange rate requirements of the IMF and GATT on their members 
and signatories." He continues: "The new exchange rate system 
will lay a foundation in terms of a monetary system for the 
Renminbi to become a convertible currency in the future." 
  2. The system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange has 
been abolished. It is no longer necessary to turn over a 
portion of foreign exchange to the higher authorities. 
Meanwhile, banks are authorized to settle and sell foreign 
exchange. Zhu explains: "This means enterprises may gain the 
full amount of their receipts from exports." 
  3. Mandatory plans for foreign exchange receipt and 
disbursement have been canceled. The state will mainly employ 
economic and legal means to achieve macroeconomic regulation and 
control over the balance of international payments of foreign 
exchange. 
  4. Foreign exchange certificates will no longer be issued. 
Foreign exchange certificates which have already been issued and 
are in circulation may continue to be used; they will be 
gradually recovered through conversion. Foreigners, Overseas 
Chinese, and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots traveling 
in China may continue to use foreign exchange certificates in 
their possession. They may also use their passports and relevant 
identification documents to convert them into foreign exchange 
at the official exchange rate announced on 31 December 1993. 
  5. An interbank market for the trade of foreign exchange 
will be established to improve the mechanism for formation of 
exchange rates. 
  Zhu says the reform has been implemented to make the 
Renminbi 
on current account conditionally convertible. It means the 
state will rely on its industrial, trade, investment, and 
banking policies to guide and regulate enterprises' foreign 
exchange receipts and disbursement; and will adopt an exchange 
rate policy that reflects market supply and demand to maintain a 
balance of international payments. Because a system for banks 
to sell foreign exchange has not yet been established, and 
because a unified national foreign exchange market has yet to 
take shape, the foreign exchange regulatory market will continue 
to operate in accordance with original procedures. All the 
Renminbi funds needed during the current transition period shall 
be paid by the People's Bank of China. 
  Touching on the importance of exchange rate stability, Zhu 
says: "Stabilizing the exchange rate is an important condition 
for guaranteeing the success of reform. Stabilizing the 
exchange rate will create a favorable environment for reform 
and, as such, it is an important task for us to guarantee the 
success of the foreign exchange system reform." We must be 
aware of not only its difficulties but also its possibilities, 
and we must have confidence. In this connection, he further 
points out: 
  1. Exchange rate stability is dependent on our macroeconomic 
situation. The macroeconomic environment is the foundation on 
which we can maintain exchange rate stability. The 16-character 
policy -- "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, promote 
development, and maintain stability" -- decided upon by the 
central authorities this year will enable us to properly handle 
the relationship between reform and development, and between 
development and stability. Zhu stresses: We will have the 
prerequisite for maintaining exchange rate stability so long as 
we conscientiously implement this policy. 
  2. China has a relatively adequate foreign exchange reserve 
and, as such, it is capable of intervening in the market and 
handling risks that may be encountered. 
  3. Market supply and demand are the factors that determine 
the exchange rate. China has maintained a basic balance between 
the supply of and demand for foreign exchange due to proper 
measures taken to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control 
since the second half of last year. Zhu says: Our consistent 
policy is to maintain a balance between foreign exchange 
receipts and disbursement, and to maintain a little surplus. 
When we pay attention to achieving a basic balance between the 
supply of and demand for foreign exchange, we will be able to 
maintain basic exchange rate stability. Zhu stresses that it 
also poses an issue that requires concerted efforts by all 
departments concerned. 
  4. The impact of the merger of exchange rates on price hikes 
is not great. Zhu says: First of all, in the past few years, 
the government has tried to apply the official exchange rate to 
as small a scope of business activities as possible. As of the 
end of 1993, more than 80 percent of import and export-related 
foreign exchange was actually calculated on the basis of the 
rate on the foreign exchange regulatory market. The official 
exchange rate -- 5.8 yuan Renminbi against $1 -- was rarely 
applied in actual operation. Most import commodities were 
purchased at the prevailing foreign exchange regulatory prices. 
Furthermore, beginning from 31 December 1993, China lowered its 
customs duties for some import commodities, thereby reducing the 
import costs for enterprises. As hotels for foreign tourists 
and airlines also use U.S. dollars to calculate costs, their 
price adjustments do not affect most of our residents at home. 
Though the pressure from inflation does exist, it is not 
necessarily related to the merger of exchange rates. To prevent 
problems that may crop up and to reduce the risks of reform, we 
must rely on close and timely coordination among all departments 
concerned, and must also have a favorable macroeconomic 
environment. Only when we have maintained a balance between 
total supply and total demand on the whole by adopting such 
macroeconomic measures as industrial, monetary, and financial 
policies can we minimize the pressure from inflation. 
  At 0659 GMT Zhu concludes: China is likely to encounter some 
specific difficulties and contradictions in the course of 
implementing various reform measures. It requires us to keep 
summing up experiences, readjust some specific policies in a 
timely manner, and continuously improve various measures.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 17 February broadcasts the 
80-minute fourth of a 10-part series consisting of nine 
lectures, and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV 
Lecture Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming 
the Economic System." 
  The fourth lecture, entitled: "Separated Financial and 
Taxation System," is given by Vice Minister of Finance Xiang 
Huaicheng. 
  Xiang Huaicheng begins by noting that according to a State 
Council's decision, the tax assignment system -- a new system 
for financial management -- came into force beginning 1 January. 
Xiang says this marks an important reform in China's financial 
and taxation system, and goes on to explain: 
  1. The background and significance of conducting reform of 
the tax assignment system: Since the founding of New China, the 
state has basically practiced unified state control over revenue 
and expenditure; the financial management system has been 
reformed many times since the reform and opening up policy was 
adopted; and finally, various forms of contracted financial 
responsibility systems have been adopted in various localities. 
However, as the market gradually plays a bigger role in 
distributing resources, the shortcomings of this system are 
becoming more apparent. Therefore, based on Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided 
to establish a socialist market economy and strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control; to achieve this goal, the 
tax assignment system has been introduced. 
  Xiang defines the tax assignment system as "a financial 
management measure for assigning various categories of taxes 
into central and local revenue as based on the division of power 
between central and local authorities." According to this 
principle, all categories of taxes are put under three main 
taxes: Central tax, central-local sharing tax, and local tax. 
"While dividing power and assigning taxes," Xiang stresses: 
"It is also necessary to establish separate central and local 
taxation organs and systems." Having described the basic 
framework of the tax assignment system, Xiang states some 
advantages of the system, mainly: Rationalizing the 
distribution relations between the central and local 
authorities, gradually increasing central government's revenues, 
and gradually establishing a unified market around the country. 
  2. The specific contents in the reform of tax assignment 
system: To start with the reform, the power between central and 
local authorities must be divided clearly first, then comes the 
division of taxes. Xiang says the general principles for 
dividing taxes are, as clarified in the "Decision" adopted by 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee: 
"The categories of taxes required for safeguarding national 
rights and interests, and the exercise of macroeconomic 
regulation and control are assigned as central taxes; the main 
categories of taxes directly related to economic development are 
assigned as sharing taxes; and categories of taxes that can be 
properly collected and managed by local authorities and are 
conducive to inspiring the enthusiasm of local authorities are 
assigned as local taxes." Xiang then goes on to explain why 
value-added tax, stamp tax (imposing on stock transactions), and 
resource tax are assigned as sharing taxes. As a result of the 
reform, the proportion of the national revenue taken by the 
central authorities has risen from 38.6 percent to about 57 
percent as a whole. However, Xiang says this does not mean that 
the central authorities have greatly increased their tax income 
or transferred their financial deficits to local authorities, 
because, he explains: "One of the principles for this reform is 
to maintain local authorities' vested financial resources." In 
compliance with this principle, the central fiscal organ will 
first collect sharing taxes, and then return and transfer the 
part belonging to local authorities every year. Xiang stresses: 
"A very distinct Chinese characteristic in this practice is 
that the central authorities do not instruct how to use the 
funds returned; the local governments have full rights to decide 
how they should be used." 
  Having expounded the principles for this reform, Xiang 
immediately explains why the central authorities must take 
nearly 60 percent of national revenue, why the tax assignment 
system affects localities only slightly, and why the central 
fiscal organ does not greatly increase its revenue income 
through this reform (because of the aforementioned practice of 
returning funds to localities). 
  3. Key features in tax assignment system reform: Xiang sums 
up the basic features of this reform as "a mild and step-by-step 
reform" and gives some facts to support this point; for example, 
the original distribution setup remains unchanged temporarily, 
the central government takes more only from the increased amount 
in the value-added tax, and local interests are taken care of. 
  4. Some problems to be attended to in the course of reform: 
To effectively carry out tax assignment system reform, Xiang 
calls for implementing other supporting reforms properly, namely 
the reform of business tax system and reform in the distribution 
of profits between the state and state-owned enterprises. He 
says it is also important that reforms in other systems 
(investment system, enterprise management system, foreign trade 
system, financial and foreign exchange system), which are 
launched together with this reform, be carried out properly, 
because they are closely correlated. 
  At 0715 GMT Xiang concludes: The most important matter is: 
"We must unify our thinking and action in carrying out all 
reforms, including tax assignment system reform." Xiang 
stresses the need to help cadres and people understand the 
contents of these reforms, and relations among reform, 
development, and stability, so as to gain their support.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 18 February broadcasts the 
66-minute fifth of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures, 
and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture 
Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the 
Economic System." 
  The fifth lecture, entitled: "The Banking System," is given 
by Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China. 
  Zhou begins by introducing the three aspects of banking 
reform he is going to discuss: 1) A brief review of reform of 
the banking system over the past 15 years; 2) The main aspects 
of and the major measures for the current reform; 3) Several 
issues that merit attention in the course of implementing 
banking reform. 
  In reviewing banking reform over the past 15 years, Zhou 
describes five aspects of banking reform carried out in China 
over the past 15 years: 1) establishing diverse banking 
institutions; 2) establishing a central bank system and 
gradually implementing an overall banking regulation and control 
system combining direct and indirect regulation and control; 3) 
developing various banking instruments and forms of credit; 4) 
greatly expanding the banking market; and 5) reforming the 
foreign exchange control system. 
  Turning to the main aspects of and the major measures for 
the 
current banking reform, Zhou summarizes them as: "1) Instituting 
an overall regulatory and control system through the central 
bank, which will independently implement a monetary policy under 
the State Council's leadership; 2) establishing a banking 
organizational system under which policy-related banks and 
commercial banks are separated, and various banking institutions 
exist side by side with state-owned commercial banks serving as 
the mainstay; 3) building a unified and open banking market 
system based on orderly competition under strict control; 4) 
turning the People's Bank of China into a genuine central bank; 
and 5) developing the current specialized banks into genuine 
commercial banks." Elaborating on these five aspects of banking 
reform, Zhou discusses plans to convert the People's Bank of 
China into a genuine central bank, to establish three 
policy-related banks, to convert the current specialized banks 
into commercial banks, to establish rural and urban cooperative 
banks, to further expand and improve the banking market, to 
correctly guide the healthy development of non-bank financial 
institutions, and to reform the foreign exchange control system. 
  Zhou goes on to discusses several issues that merit 
attention 
in the course of implementing banking reform. According to him, 
these issues concern the need to control the total credit volume 
during the transition from the old system to a new one in order 
to prevent serious inflation, the impact on loans for 
enterprises of the lengthy process of converting state 
specialized banks into genuine commercial banks, and the need to 
institute a legal system to ensure healthy and orderly progress 
in banking reform. 
  At 0710 GMT Zhou concludes by highlighting the need to 
implement the above-mentioned five aspects of banking reform so 
that "all banking tasks will better serve the purpose of 
establishing and improving the socialist market economic system, 
and will make due contributions to promoting sustained, rapid, 
and healthy national economic development."

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 21 February broadcasts the 
35-minute sixth of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures, 
and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture 
Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the 
Economic System." 
  The sixth lecture, entitled: "Mechanisms for Price 
Formulation," is presented by Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the 
State Planning Commission. 
  After recalling how the irrational system of 
state-controlled 
prices hindered economic growth in the pre-reform years, Luo 
discusses three issues regarding the establishment of mainly 
market- based, price-forming mechanisms: 1) A review of the 
basic situation in price reform over the past 15 years. Luo 
recalls the following "fundamental" changes in China's price 
mechanisms as a result of 15 years of reform: The highly 
centralized system of government-set prices has been dismantled 
in favor of the market-based formation of most commodity prices 
through the gradual decentralization of government price-setting 
power. Market supply and demand is becoming increasingly 
influential in determining prices, causing the irrational price 
structure to become rational. A new system for monitoring and 
controlling prices in keeping with the demands of the socialist 
market economy has been initiated. 2) The necessity of 
continuing to deepen price reform. Luo notes that although 15 
years of price reform have produced "notable" results, many 
problems have yet to be solved. One of the problems, he says, 
is the failure to decontrol prices on a handful of potentially 
competitive goods and services. Another is the unduly low 
government-set prices for a few basic products and 
infrastructure. A third is the lack of effective economic and 
legal means by which the government regulates and controls 
market prices. Luo then goes on to outline three main tasks for 
continuing to deepen price reform, which are: "1. Seizing the 
opportune moment to decontrol government-set prices on 
individual commodities and to further expand the scope of market 
regulation and control. 2. Gradually raising the unduly low 
prices of a few basic products and infrastructure to enhance the 
national economy's potential for continued development. 3. 
Establishing a sound system of price regulation and control by 
the government, as well as sound laws and regulations concerning 
prices, in order to regulate the order of market prices." 3) 
The basic principles for carrying out price reform. In 
explaining these basic principles, Luo says: "Price reform must 
promote the development of social productive forces," "the 
general level of prices should be kept relatively stable," and 
"the interests of the state, enterprises, and individuals should 
be taken into account." 
  The lecture concludes at 0640 GMT.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 23 February broadcasts the 
70-minute 7th of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures, 
and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture 
Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the 
Economic System." 
  The 7th lecture, entitled "(Reform of the) Investment and 
Loan Accommodation System," is presented by Guo Shuyan, vice 
minister of the State Planning Commission. 
  Guo begins by explaining why it is necessary to reform the 
investment and loan accommodation system. He says: Though it 
should be pointed out that profound changes have taken place in 
the system after 14 years of reform and opening up, the 
requirement raised by the 14th national party congress to 
establish a socialist market economy set an even higher demand 
on us. Three conspicuous problems exist in the system at 
present. They are: 
  (1) The scale of investment and loan accommodation has 
expanded too rapidly. For instance, the scale of investment in 
fixed assets in 1993 increased nearly 49 percent from that of 
1992; state enterprises carried out nearly 78,000 technical 
transformation projects costing a total investment amount of 450 
billion yuan in 1993, up 51.8 percent from that of 1992. They 
caused more inflationary pressure. 
  (2) The investment structure is irrational. Most funds were 
committed to low-level construction projects which produced low 
economic returns, to real estate development, and to development 
zones. 
  (3) Investments produced low economic returns and resulted 
in 
tremendous waste. 
  Preliminary analysis shows the above problems were caused by 
the following four reasons. 
  (1) An effective investment risks supervision and 
restrictive 
mechanism has yet to be established and the system of giving 
equal treatment to enterprises and individuals regardless of 
their performances has not been really abolished. This made 
"some enterprises and localities blindly carry out new projects 
to pursue unrealistic, excessively high growth rate regardless 
of the availability of funds and materials." It may be said 
that this is a fundamental reason leading to the current 
expansion of our investment scale. 
  (2) As the authority for examining and approving investment 
projects was delegated to localities, a system for appropriate 
macroeconomic regulation and control of investment still has not 
been established. As a result, it is hard to bring the total 
investment scale under effective control. 
  (3) The market system serving investment and construction is 
still imperfect; protectionism barriers exists in localities and 
different departments. 
  (4) Formulation of laws and regulations cannot catch up with 
the pace of economic development. As we are in the process of 
shifting from a planned economy to a socialist market economy, 
many old measures for management of investment are no longer 
applicable, while new measures have yet to be drawn up. If the 
above problems are to be solved once and for all, we must carry 
out reform to establish an investment and loan accommodation 
system suited to a socialist market economy. 
  Guo then discusses the seven main points of reform of the 
investment and loan accommodation system. They are: 
  (1) Reform the methods of investment and loan accommodation 
system for different investment projects. Guo generally divides 
investment projects into the following three categories: 
competitive projects which include mainly those investment 
projects that produce higher returns and are more responsive to 
market regulation and more competitive on the market, such as 
textile mills, processing industries, and so forth; basic 
industries and infrastructure projects which require longer 
construction period and bigger investments but produce lower 
economic returns than competitive projects; and public welfare 
projects which include scientific and technological, 
educational, cultural, public health, sports, and environmental 
protection projects, office buildings for government and mass 
organizations, and national defense facilities. Guo discusses 
appropriate management systems for investment and loan 
accommodations for the above three categories of projects. He 
says the establishment of these three categories constitutes a 
main aspect of current reform and is suited to the need of 
establishing a socialist market economy. He stresses: Current 
reform of the investment and loan accommodation system has 
decided that enterprises will gradually replace the governments 
as the major investors in the future. 
  (2) Improve a restrictive mechanism for investment risks by 
accelerating the implementation of a legal person responsibility 
system among enterprises. Construction projects will not be 
approved until after the legal persons mainly responsible for 
them are organized. The implementation of a legal person 
responsibility system "converges with the PRC Company Law, which 
was recently promulgated." "It will expedite enterprises' 
transformation of operating mechanisms and accelerate the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system." 
  (3) Establish and improve a macroeconomic regulation and 
control system for investments. The central government will be 
responsible for deciding on the scale of total investment in 
fixed assets, the total amount of shares issued nationwide, and 
so forth; the targets, laws, and regulations governing 
macroeconomic regulation and control of investments nationwide 
shall be decided by the State Council. The provincial people's 
governments will be responsible for regulation and control of 
the structure and total amount of investments in their 
respective regions, for ensuring the smooth progress of key 
state projects in their respective regions, and for creating a 
favorable investment environment. Guo also discusses measures 
for regulating and controlling total investment amount and for 
readjusting investment structure through price and taxation 
reforms. In this connection, efforts will be made to improve a 
system for examining and approving investment projects and to 
establish a system for the feedback of investment information. 
  (4) The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee decided to establish a national development bank to 
raise and guide funds from society to ensure key state projects 
and to facilitate loans for basic industries and infrastructure 
projects. "It will be conducive to readjusting our overall 
investment structure, to increasing investment returns, and to 
promoting rapid and healthy national economic development." 
  (5) Concentrate financial and material resources on key 
construction projects to ensure their smooth progress. Guo says 
successfully carrying out the job will directly expedite rapid 
national economic development. 
  (6) Expedite development of a system that serves the 
investment market. 
  (7) Improve the formulation of relevant laws and 
regulations. 
  The lecture concludes at 0715 GMT.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 24 February broadcasts the 
33-minute 8th of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures, 
and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture 
Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the 
Economic System." 
  The 8th lecture entitled "(Reform of the) Foreign Trade 
System" is presented by Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of foreign 
trade and economic cooperation. 
  Shi Begins by saying: Profound changes have taken place in 
China's foreign trade system after 15 years of reform. Reform 
of the foreign trade system effectively promotes the development 
of China's foreign trade. In 1978, China's total import and 
export volume ranked 32d in the world; it rose to take the 11th 
rank in 1992. The ratio represented by China's total import and 
export volume in its gross national product has increased by 
nearly 40 percent. 
  After enumerating various shortcomings of the old foreign 
trade system, Shi points out that reform of the foreign trade 
system became imperative especially in the face of keen 
international competition after China implemented reform and 
opened its doors to the outside world. The State Council 
carried out two major reforms after 1984: first, the 
implementation of the contract management responsibility system 
among enterprises specializing in foreign trade from 1988 to 
1990; and, second, beginning from 1 January 1991, the 
readjustment of the exchange rate mechanism to create an 
environment for competition on equal terms and the cancellation 
of export subsidies for foreign trade enterprises. However, Shi 
notes, certain undesirable aspects still exist in China's 
foreign trade system which must be improved to meet the needs of 
the drive to establish a socialist market economy. 
  "The resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee determined the orientation for reform 
of the foreign trade system, namely, seek unity of policies, 
delegate management power to enterprises and institutions, 
compete on equal terms, integrate industry and trade, and 
implement agency systems," states Shi. The objective of China's 
reform of its foreign trade system is to establish a new foreign 
trade system that conforms to the international economic norms 
and meets the requirements of a socialist market economy. Major 
points of the reform are as follows: 
  1. The exchange rate control system will be reformed to 
bring into full play the important role of exchange rates in 
regulating and controlling foreign trade. The State Council 
decided to merge the dual exchange rates used in the past and to 
implement a controlled, unitary floating exchange rate system 
for the renminbi on the basis of market supply and demand, 
starting 1 January 1994. Shi stresses: "We really grasp the key 
issue by reforming exchange rates under the circumstances. It 
will surely promote development of China's foreign trade. 
Reform of the foreign exchange system will create a favorable 
environment for competition on equal terms among various export 
enterprises; is conducive to reasonably compensating 
enterprises' export cost and to enhancing the competitiveness of 
China's export commodities; will greatly accelerate 
transformation of export enterprises' operating mechanisms; will 
effectively bring into full play the function of exchange rates 
as an economic lever in regulating foreign trade; will make 
China's foreign exchange and foreign trade system meet the 
requirements of a socialist market economy and conform to the 
international economic norms; and, therefore, will play a 
positive role in promoting the process of China's entry into 
GATT and its participation in the international economic 
activities. In addition, the reform enables the renminbi to 
take an important step forward to gradually becoming a 
convertible currency." 
  2. Legal and economic means will be employed to improve 
management of foreign trade. These means, such as expediting 
the legislation of a foreign trade law, regulations on control 
of import and export commodities, anti-dumping provisions, and 
so forth, will be supplemented by necessary administrative 
means. Shi urges all departments in charge of foreign trade to 
enhance consciousness of legal system and to exercise control 
strictly in accordance with the laws. Efforts will be made to 
establish a relatively complete system of laws on foreign trade 
in about three years. The state will implement a quota system 
to control huge quantity of important import and export 
commodities that have a bearing on the national economy and on 
the people's livelihood. The state will adopt policies on duty 
drawback and export loans to encourage export and to stimulate 
its growth. Foreign trade management power will be delegated to 
state-owned manufacturing enterprises and scientific research 
institutions. Shi urges enterprises to make the growth of 
exports their conscious action. Control over imports will also 
be reformed through economic means, such as gradually reducing 
administrative intervention to give play to the role of import 
in promoting national economic development, adopting 
anti-dumping measures, and so forth. In addition, it is 
necessary to establish a relatively good system for management 
of enterprises' overseas branches to increase economic returns 
and to achieve healthy development of foreign trade. 
  3. The following measures will be taken to enable foreign 
trade enterprises to accelerate the transformation of operating 
mechanisms. First, state-owned foreign trade enterprises will 
be reorganized in accordance with the modern enterprise system 
to turn them into business entities really responsible for their 
own decisions about their operations and expansion and for their 
own profits and losses, to bring into full play the initiative 
of such enterprises and their employees, to keep expanding 
imports and exports, and to ensure that the value of state-owned 
property is maintained and increased. The import and export 
agency system will be vigorously implemented. Second, foreign 
trade enterprises whose conditions are ripe will be gradually 
reorganized into limited liability companies or liability stock 
companies. Foreign trade enterprises, manufacturers, and 
scientific research institutions are encouraged to cooperate 
with each other and to form large enterprise conglomerates on 
the basis of equality and mutual benefit. All areas and 
departments must not interfere in voluntary associations and 
mergers among enterprises. As the pace of the formation of 
regional economic blocs has quickened and as trade protectionism 
is on the rise in the world today, the merger among enterprises 
and the formation of large enterprise conglomerates is necessary 
for China to cope with international competition. Third, 
supervising bodies will be set up at all large and medium-sized 
foreign trade enterprises owned by the state to supervise their 
business operations and the increment of the value of 
state-owned property. They will not interfere in enterprises' 
normal operations or decisionmaking. Fourth, we must bring into 
full play the role of chambers of commerce of importers and 
exporters in providing coordination, guidance, and services for 
foreign trade. All enterprises authorized to conduct foreign 
trade are required to participate in a chamber of commerce and 
to comply with its coordination activities. Arbitration bodies, 
information service networks, and necessary lawyer, accountant, 
and auditing offices will be set up across the country to 
provide foreign trade-related services for enterprises. All 
administrative departments must strive to create a favorable 
environment for fair competition among enterprises. And, fifth, 
we must maintain unity among varous foreign trade policies. 
Implementation of unified policies, rules, and regulations on 
foreign trade across the country is a necessity for the 
establishment of an integrated big market nationwide, and 
conforms to one of the norms of international trade. "Aside 
from those that must be promulgated by the National People's 
Congress and State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation is authorized by the State Council to 
announce all laws, rules, and regulations on foreign trade in a 
unified way and to organize their implementation." "During the 
negotiations on restoring China's status as a signatory to the 
GATT, some signatories doubted if China is able to maintain 
unity in its foreign trade policies and management system." It 
presents an issue that merits our close attention, Shi stresses. 
"All laws, regulations, and policies on foreign trade and 
economic relations as well as all relevant provisions on 
services for foreign firms shall be promulgated so long as they 
do not involve national security and industrial secrets," Shi 
says. 
  Finally, Shi calls for joint efforts to promote development 
of foreign trade and solicits supervision over and assistance 
for the work of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation. 
  The lecture concludes at 0638 GMT.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 25 February broadcasts the 
56-minute ninth installment of a 10-part series consisting of 
nine lectures and one question-and-answer session, entitled "TV 
Lecture Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming 
the Economic System." The ninth installment, entitled "A Modern 
Enterprise System," is presented by Chen Qingtai, vice minister 
of the State Economic and Trade Commission. 
  Chen begins by saying that the installment is about changing 
the operating mechanisms of enterprises to establish a modern 
enterprise system. He discusses four issues in this respect: 
"1) Improving state-owned enterprises as the centerpiece of 
reforming the economic system; 2) The need to solve some 
deep-seated problems if state- owned enterprises are to enter 
the market; 3) Changing operating mechanisms to establish a 
modern enterprise system; 4) The need to accumulate experience, 
create conditions, and advance gradually in establishing a 
modern enterprise system." 
  In discussing the first issue, Chen enumerates the 
weaknesses 
of state-owned enterprises under the planned economy and goes on 
to note that the 14th CPC National Congress called for 
establishing a socialist market economic system. Chen notes 
that there are three conditions for establishing such a system: 
"To create a unified socialist market to provide a forum of 
fair competition for enterprises," "to establish market economic 
administrative and legal systems to create an environment 
favorable to market competition for enterprises," and "to deepen 
enterprise reform to foster principal competitors in the market." 
  Turning to the second issue, Chen outlines several solutions 
for the deep-seated problems arising in the course of economic 
reform: "1) Achieving the separation of government 
administration from enterprise management to turn state-owned 
enterprises into independent entities"; "2) Smoothing the 
relations of property rights and improving the system of 
enterprise-type legal entities"; and "3) Changing operating 
mechanisms and effecting the transformation of the enterprise 
system." 
  Chen then goes on to discuss the third issue. After 
discussing the importance of changing operating mechanisms in 
establishing a modern enterprise system, Chen explains that "a 
modern enterprise system is characterized by clearly defined 
property rights, clearly delineated duties and rights, separate 
government and enterprise functions, and scientific management." 
Elaborating on the modern enterprise system, Chen discusses the 
meaning of enterprise-type legal entities, the limited liability 
system, and the forms of incorporation under a modern enterprise 
system. The promotion of a modern enterprise system, Chen says, 
is significant for improving state-owned large and medium 
enterprises because it separates government administration from 
enterprise management, standardizes the behavior of business 
operators, expands the leading role of the state economic 
sector, preserves and increases the value of state assets, and 
promotes a convergence with international practice. 
  Turning to the fourth issue, Chen underscores the need to 
create conditions and lay the foundation for converting 
state-owned enterprises to the modern enterprise system, to 
carry out experiments in selected enterprises and accumulate 
experience, to promote changes in the enterprise system in 
accordance with the law and in a standardized manner, to carry 
out reform gradually according to different categories and in 
different stages and groups, and to prevent formalism and 
headlong mass action. 
  In closing, Chen says: "Establishing a modern enterprise 
system will provide the microeconomic basis for the socialist 
market economy and will effectively combine the public ownership 
system with the market economy."

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0600 GMT on 28 February broadcasts the 
70-minute 10th and last installment of a 10-part series 
consisting of nine lectures and one question-and-answer session, 
entitled "TV Lecture Series on Several Current Major Programs 
for Reforming the Economic System." The 10th installment is a 
question-and-answer session in which Jin Xin, deputy director of 
the State General Administration of Taxation; Luo Zhiling, vice 
minister of the State Planning Commission; and Zhu Xiaohua, vice 
president of the People's Bank of China and deputy director of 
the State Foreign Exchange Administration, answer questions 
posed by an unidentified female moderator. According to the 
moderator, the three officials have been invited to answer 
questions in light of the "enthusiastic" response from viewers 
to the lecture series. The officials take turns fielding 
questions from the moderator that fall under their respective 
specialties. 
  Jin Xin discusses the value-added tax [VAT] issue. He 
explains that VAT is not repeatedly levied in each of the 
production stages, saying that deductions are allowed for in 
successive stages. When asked to comment on the scope of 
taxation, he notes that the tax encompasses "all industries, 
trades, and products ranging from production to distribution." 
According to Jin, the tax rate for most products is 17 percent, 
whereas a 13-percent rate will apply to basic goods and 
agricultural means of production. Next, Jin uses a chart to 
explain the formula for calculating VAT. He goes on to 
distinguish between ordinary and small-scale VAT payers. He 
also touches on state regulations regarding special VAT 
invoices, saying that malpractices, such as producing 
counterfeit invoices or using those invoices to cheat on taxes, 
will be "dealt with sternly in accordance with state laws." 
  Luo Zhiling addresses issues relating to commodity prices. 
He begins by underscoring the government's role in regulating 
prices despite the fact that most prices are now being set by 
market forces. He asserts: "Decontrolling prices does not mean 
that the government will no longer exercise control, and 
price-setting by the market does not mean that the state will no 
longer interfere." When asked to comment on the status of 
commodity prices, Luo observes that commodity prices are 
"relatively stable" because of government measures to stabilize 
prices following a 13.2-percent increase in last year's retail 
price index. Turning to the question of price mechanisms, Luo 
explains that a price mechanism consists of three components: 
"One for setting prices, another for determining the way prices 
function, and the third for regulating and controlling prices." 
  Zhu Xiaohua fields questions regarding foreign exchange 
control. He begins by describing the central features of reform 
of the foreign exchange control system: the merger of foreign 
exchange rates and the abolition of the foreign exchange 
retention system. While highlighting the need for the merger of 
foreign exchange rates, Zhu notes: "The state will adjust 
foreign exchange rates in light of the overall situation in 
macroeconomic development and of the actual state of revenue and 
expenditure." Turning to the foreign exchange retention system, 
he says that the abolition of this system means "nationally, 
foreign exchange supply and demand will be balanced through the 
market." Next, he discusses the central bank's currency 
stabilization measures, dwelling on the computerized linkup of 
foreign exchange trading centers spread throughout the country. 
He also elucidates the method for computing median foreign 
exchange rates which are quoted by the central bank. The next 
issue he addresses concerns renminbi bank accounts for 
foreigners. He explains that foreigners are permitted to open 
special renminbi bank accounts, and they can convert their 
legally earned renminbi proceeds into foreign currencies and 
remit them abroad. 
  The session ends at 0710 GMT.

5762): "Views of Taiwan Commercial, Academic Circles on Impact 
of Breakdown of Sino-British Talks Over Hong Kong's Political 
Reform"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 25 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the 
Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political reform broke down, 
Taiwan academic and commercial circles have been concerned about 
its impact on the across-strait and Taiwan-Hong Kong 
relationships but most people believe that the relationships 
will not be affected too much from a long-term point of view. 
  Huang Li, a law professor at Taiwan National Chengchi 
University, who has been involved in drafting the "Regulations 
on Taiwan Relations with Hong Kong and Macao," believes that 
though the Hong Kong Legislative Council yesterday passed the 
partial political reform package tabled by Hong Kong Governor 
Chris Patten, Hong Kong's basic political setup will not undergo 
great changes when it returns to Beijing rule. Unless Beijing 
plans to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of schedule, 
the passage of the partial bill will not produce too great an 
impact on the Taiwan-Hong Kong relationship, he said. However, 
he maintained that the Chinese side is unlikely to recover 
sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of time. 
  Yeh Ming-te, a researcher at Taiwan National Chengchi 
University International Relations Research Center, said that 
the dispute between China and Britain does not mean Hong Kong 
will be in a precarious state and the principle of "one country, 
two systems" will go down the drain. Beijing will not give in 
on political matters and political principles because this is 
where the essentials of "one country" lie, he said, adding that 
on economic matters, including the mode of production, it will 
adopt a flexible attitude to give expression to the "two 
systems." 
  Commenting on the possible change in Hong Kong and on the 
establishment of new "Taiwan-Hong Kong relations" after 1997, 
Yeh maintained that Chinese in Taiwan should expand their 
cooperation and exchanges with Hong Kong in social and economic 
fields with the purpose of deriving Hong Kong's experience in 
"internationalizing management" and bringing benefit to the 
Chinese nation. 
  According to Wu Hsin-hsing, an associate professor at 
National Cheng Kung University Political and Economic Research 
Institute and a member of the Mainland Committee Consultative 
Committee, the strained Sino-British relations will have direct 
and indirect influences on the following: The negotiations on 
the renewal of the agreement on navigation rights between Hong 
Kong and Taiwan, which expires in 1995, because Taiwan may not 
be able to find its counterpart for entering into the 
negotiations at that time; over 3,000 Taiwan companies which are 
registered in Hong Kong but do business on the mainland; the 
entrepot trade between Taiwan and the mainland via Hong Kong; 
and Taiwan's economy, because Hong Kong and Taiwan have 
established close economic and trade relations and Hong Kong 
businessmen have invested heavily in Taiwan's stock market. Wu 
said that how great the impact will be remains to be seen. 
  Chen Fei-lung, convener of the Committee for Development of 
Economic and Trade Relations between Taipei and Hong Kong under 
the Taiwan Federation for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, 
and Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the Foundation for Development 
of Across-Strait Commercial Affairs, believes that Hong Kong's 
political situation will affect Taiwan business in Hong Kong and 
on the mainland for a short time. However, they are optimistic 
about Hong Kong's long-term situation. Chen stressed that since 
the focus of the world's economic development has been shifted 
to Asia, many people throughout the world are upbeat about the 
outlook for economic development on the mainland. When Hong 
Kong returns to Chinese rule in future, he said, China will 
continue to export its commodities through Hong Kong. Taiwan 
will have more close contacts with Hong Kong because of progress 
in cross-strait economic relations and trade, he added. 
  Chang believed that though Hong Kong's current political row 
has led to conflicts between the Chinese and British Hong Kong 
Governments, it has had limited impact on Taiwan businessmen 
because, though Taiwan businessmen are developing economic 
relations and trade with the mainland through Hong Kong, they 
only go through the necessary procedures for the entrepot trade 
in Hong Kong rather than relying on the Chinese and Hong Kong 
Government to do business. In addition, Beijing will try its 
best to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he added. 
  However, Chang did not deny that Hong Kong's political row 
will affect the stock market and property development, both of 
which are very sensitive to political changes.

  [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- China's lawmakers 
today called for the legislature to pass a draft law on the 
protection of investments of Taiwan compatriots. 
  The revised version of the draft law is ready to be 
promulgated, said members of the Standing Committee of the 
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) at its Sixth Session, 
which started on Tuesday. 
  They suggested that it be passed during this session, which 
ends this Saturday [5 March]. 
  To safeguard the interests of investors from Taiwan by law 
will be conducive to encourage more companies, enterprises, 
organizations or individuals there to invest in China's 
mainland, said Li Yining, vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee. 
  "It has been aimed to further promote the economic exchanges 
across the Taiwan Straits," said Li, who is a renowned economist 
in China. 
  The draft law stipulates that the state will not nationalize 
or requisition the investments; but under special circumstances 
and for the need of the public good, the state could purchase 
the investments through legal procedures, with the investors 
being reimbursed. 
  Two vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, Ni Zhifu 
and 
Li Peiyao, said the draft law should make it clear that the 
Taiwan investors should observe China's laws just as they will 
be protected by the law. 
  The draft law on the protection of investments of Taiwan 
compatriots was submitted to the legislature for deliberation 
for the first time on December 10 last year. 
  It was submitted to the lawmakers for another review 
yesterday after being revised according to opinions both from 
the members of the NPC Standing Committee and feedback from the 
NPC Finance Committee, localities and departments.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Wang Weifu, director of Liaoning </F>
Province Taiwan Affairs Office, by reporter Jin Guolin (6855 
0948 2651) in the director's office; date not given: 
"`Mainland's New Strategy of Attracting Taiwan Funds'--Economic 
and Trade Cooperation Between Liaoning and Taiwan Is Promising"] 
  [Text] Shenyang, 18 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wang Weifu, 
new director of Liaoning Province's Taiwan Affairs Office, 
granted this reporter a special interview in his office 
immediately after the Spring Festival. 
  This straightforward official told this reporter immediately 
after we met: There is a Chinese saying that "on festive 
occasions we think of our dear ones far away more than ever." 
We and our compatriots in Taiwan have the same blood ties. As 
a person specially engaging in Taiwan affairs, I would like to 
extend, through ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE, Spring Festival greetings 
from fellow- townsfolk in the northeast to our compatriots in 
Taiwan, wishing them a still brighter New Year. 
  The northeast is China's heavy industry base and Liaoning is 
a big industrial province. In recent years, Liaoning has become 
a popular province in which Taiwanese businessmen and 
industrialists invest and the province attracts the greatest 
amount of funds from Taiwan. Director Wang Weifu was all smiles 
when talking about this matter. 
  He told this reporter: In 1993, there were more than 400 new 
projects started by Taiwanese investors in Liaoning Province. 
The contracted amount of Taiwanese investment exceeded $320 
million, which was greater than the total in the previous 
decade. At present, there are a total of over 800 
Taiwanese-invested projects in the province and the contracted 
amount of Taiwanese investment exceeds $600 million, including 
over 10 projects with more than $10 million of investment and 
three projects with more than $200 million of investment. We 
can say that economic cooperation between Liaoning and Taiwan is 
showing a tendency to make giant strides. 
  The development of economic cooperation and trade will 
definitely bring about frequent exchanges of personnel. 
Director Wang Weifu gave this reporter the following figures: 
Last year, more than 33,000 people from all circles in Taiwan 
visited Liaoning, an increase of 16 percent over the previous 
year, nearly half of whom were businessmen and industrialists. 
Last year, Liaoning also received more than 170 delegations and 
exchange groups from Taiwan. Meanwhile, more than 240 people 
from Liaoning went to Taiwan for private reasons last year, the 
highest figure ever. In addition, a total of 55 people from 16 
delegations and exchange groups from Liaoning went to Taiwan, 
including athletes, college lecturers, poets, painters, juvenile 
actors, doctors, and artists. 
  Director Wang Weifu once worked in the Liaoning Province 
Department of Engineering Industry, so he has a good 
understanding of Liaoning's basic industrial strength. He said: 
Liaoning has its own superiority. It has a coastline, a 
foreign border, and it has a vast hinterland, rich industrial 
strength, a large amount of scientific and technological talent, 
and a developed communications network. At present, Liaoning is 
"starting its business for the second time" and is vigorously 
trying to reinvigorate this old industrial base through opening 
up wider to the outside world. This will definitely give 
Taiwanese businessmen and industrialists a very rare opportunity 
for development. 
  The 56-year-old director ambitiously predicted that economic 
cooperation and trade between Liaoning and Taiwan will remain 
very promising, proved by the fact that a large amount of 
Taiwanese funds are pouring into Liaoning. A large number of 
men of insight from Taiwan's industrial and business circles 
have taken the lead and a large number of Taiwanese investors 
are itching to have a try. In 1994, greater cooperation and 
exchanges between Liaoning and Taiwan are expected, there will 
be more than 1,000 Taiwanese-invested projects, and the 
prospects are very good.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 21 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According 
to news from Taipei, Kuo Chin-mao, secretary general of the 
Taiwan Area Steel Federation, disclosed that the federation will 
formally send a delegation to the mainland for the first time 
this spring to seek opportunities for exchange of information on 
iron and steel and supplementing each other's needs for 
products; the two sides will enter a period of close exchange in 
steel industry. 
  The mainland imported 25 million metric tons of iron and 
steel in 1993, ranking first in the world in terms of iron and 
steel imports; whereas Taiwan imported 15 million metric tons of 
iron and steel last year, ranking third in world, Kuo Chin-mao 
said, adding that the two sides' iron and steel imports 
accounted for more than one-third of the world's iron and steel 
trade last year; for this reason, it is necessary for the two 
sides to strengthen exchange of information on iron and steel, 
as this will benefit iron and steel businessmen on both sides. 
  In addition, Kuo Chin-mao said: In recent years, more and 
more Taiwan bicycle and hand tool investors are investing on the 
mainland; if people in the steel industry still remain 
conservative and do not have a good idea of the mainland's 
market trends, their business will be affected. Although the 
government is energetically introducing a "southward-bound 
policy" to reduce industrialists' fever in investing on the 
mainland, the federation will still lead iron and steel 
manufacturers and businessmen to the mainland to seek 
cooperation, out of consideration of practical needs.

  [Text] United Nations, March 8 (XINHUA) -- By the year 2000 
the world should remove all sex-related differences in adult 
literacy, eliminate sex-biased presentations in text books, and 
eradicate legal illiteracy, a Chinese delegate to the 38th 
session of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, said 
today. 
  Wang Shuxian, the Chinese delegate, said particular 
attention 
should be given to the situation of women in rural areas around 
the world. 
  "The U.N. platform for action should show special concern 
for 
them, because they are the most numerous, have bad living and 
medical conditions, low social status and heavy household 
burdens," she said. 
  Wang referred to the fact that there are now 650 million 
rural women living in poverty, which almost doubles the figure 
of 20 years ago. She warned that more women living in rural 
areas would join this group if effective measures are not taken 
soon. 
  She also said that young women should also be given special 
consideration. "They will shoulder the historic responsibility 
of achieving equality between men and women by the 21st 
century," she added. 
  "It is our view that the essence of women's human rights 
lies 
in the right to equality and the removal of discrimination, 
which characterizes the human rights of men," Wang said. 
  The U.N. Commission on the Status of Women is having a 
two-week session which began on March 7. 
  Most participants are discussing recommendations for a 
platform for action to be drafted by the U.N. Secretariat. 
  The platform is expected to be the major outcome of the 
fourth world women's conference to be held next year in Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng today met with visiting Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev, urging common efforts to step up bilateral economic 
cooperation and trade. 
  Reviewing the bilateral trade and cooperation, Li Peng said 
that the bilateral trade is still at a comparatively low level 
due to problems in transportation, trade form and areas of 
cooperation. 
  "The two sides should make concerted efforts to expand areas 
of cooperation and promote the development of economic 
cooperation and trade," the Chinese premier said. 
  Aliyev appreciated China's successes in its economic reform 
over the past decade, saying that it is wise to work out 
principles and policies in light of the actual conditions and 
characteristics. 
  Aliyev promised to further its cooperation with China in 
every field. 
  Li Tieying, State Councillor and minister in charge of the 
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, called at Aliyev 
at the state guesthouse here this afternoon and exchanged views 
with him on economic reforms. 
  Aliyev spoke highly of tremendous achievements China has 
made 
in its reform and opening to the outside world. Azerbaijan is 
ready to study China's successful experience in reform, he said.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 4 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province, the country's vanguard of reform and 
opening-up, registered record expansion in foreign trade and 
economic relations in 1993. 
  The province's two-way trade volume in that year hit 46.9 
billion U.S. dollars-worth, which breaks down to 19.9 billion 
U.S. dollars-worth of import and 27 billion U.S. dollars-worth 
of exports, up 71 percent and 46 percent, respectively, over 
1992. 
  The export volume ranked first for the eighth consecutive 
year among China's mainland provinces, municipalities and 
regions, and the figure raised the province's percentage of the 
national total export volume from 24.3 percent in 1992 to 29.4 
percent last year. 
  Last year Guangdong signed 19,012 cooperation contracts with 
overseas investors, involving contractual foreign investment 
exceeding 34.89 billion U.S. dollars, rises of 47.2 percent and 
75.7 percent over 1992, respectively. 
  The province actually used more than 9.65 billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign investment in 1993, up 98.6 percent over a 
year earlier. The figure is about 26.25 percent of the year's 
actually utilized foreign investment in China. 
  Provincial officials said that the growth rates were all 
unprecedented. 
  Various foreign trade enterprises now number more than 1,000 
in this prosperous southern Chinese province. Moreover, many 
large foreign trade enterprises have joined hands to form 
foreign trade groups, and 56 foreign trade enterprises have been 
singled out to experiment with reform policies for transforming 
their operating mechanism. 
  In recent years Guangdong has been engaged in rationalizing 
its import and export pattern. As a result, exports of primary 
products have dropped, while exports of machinery, and 
electrical and textile products have increased. The province 
has also increased its imports of infrastructural products, raw 
materials and high-tech items. 
  The officials said that, so far, Guangdong has established 
close trade and economic relations with more than 50 countries 
and regions all over the world and the province's exports have 
become more diversified than ever. 
  Following the expansion of the reform and opening-up 
efforts, 
Guangdong has for more than a decade remained a favored area for 
foreign investment, which now pours in from over 70 countries 
and regions worldwide. 
  While investment from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan keeps 
increasing, some developed countries like Japan, Sweden, Canada, 
Australia and Britain have also increased their investments by 
large margins. 
  Overseas investors are showing more interest in the 
province's telecommunications, energy, transportation, real 
estate, commerce, trade and tourism sectors. The number of 
large and technology-intensive investment projects has increased. 
  Some transnational corporations and financial groups have 
invested heavily in Guangdong's power projects as well as bridge 
and road building. 
  Sources said that the mountainous areas of Guangdong have 
also accelerated the pace of attracting and utilizing foreign 
investment. The amount that they used in 1993 was 115 percent 
more than in 1992. 
  Overall, Guangdong had licensed a total of 44,705 
foreign-invested enterprises by the end of last year. 
  According to incomplete statistics, some 12,000 of the 
foreign- invested ventures generated a total of 160 billion yuan 
(about 18.4 billion U.S. dollars) in output value in 1993, 
earning more than 10.3 billion U.S. dollars from exports.

  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (AFP) -- China's crackdown on 
political dissidents continued Tuesday, as public security 
officials picked up 1989 student pro-democracy leader Wang Dan 
for the second time in a week. Wang was pulled in for 
questioning at 7:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), friends said, adding that 
he was released several hours later. 
  His interrogation followed the broadcast Monday of an 
interview Wang gave to the American ABC television network 
regarding last week's police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and 
Shanghai. "If the government continues their widespread arrests 
then we will at least have to engage in collective protest," 
Wang said in the interview. 
  Wang had been picked up last Wednesday and held for 24 
hours, 
during which time he was told to leave Beijing ahead of the 
annual session of the Chinese parliament which opens Thursday. 
Wang was released from prison on parole in February last year 
after serving two years of a four-year jail term for his leading 
role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement. 
  His latest interrogation came as tension between Washington 
and Beijing over the dissident crackdown intensified, with harsh 
words flying between the two governments just days before the 
visit here of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. China 
indicated once again that it would not tolerate external 
pressure on the issue of human rights, slamming U.S. 
condemnation of its ongoing police sweep and accusing Washington 
of interference in its internal affairs. 
  China has detained at least eight activists in the past 
week, 
including the country's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng. 
Some dissidents, including Wei, have been released while others 
are thought to have been escorted from the capital to their 
hometowns.

  [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Not as normal, when she 
has to rush to work at her hospital, nurse Xiao Jin slept late 
into the morning today and then got up and went window-shopping 
with her husband and two-year-old daughter. 
  This Saturday is the first one for years for urban people in 
China to take as a rest-day. 
  It results from the country's new working-hours system: from 
March 1 workers and government employees work five and half days 
a week (44 hours) rather than six days (48 hours). For many 
employees it means that every second weekend they get two days 
off, and in the intervening week just the Sunday -- in other 
words, an 11-day fortnight. 
  "I often could not sleep well as I had to take care of my 
baby and did the housework as well," said nurse Xiao. "But since 
I can rest for two continuous days now, I feel my burden eased. 
I can put off some things to do until tomorrow." 
  Lin Yi, who works in a print company in Beijing, summoned 
her 
boyfriend early this morning. She said they were going to spend 
this day in Beijing Botanic Garden and Beijing Zoo. 
  "It was really not easy for me to get a date with my 
boyfriend since I am usually very busy," she said. 
  Many people chose to spend today in stores and parks. 
Managers of major stores in Xidan Shopping Center and staff at 
the Summer Palace reported more people coming than usual. They 
said the new system provided a new business opportunity for them. 
  "The new working-hour system will be good for our business," 
said an executive of the Summer Palace. "We were thinking of new 
ways to attract more people. And now the opportunity has come." 
  In Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province, tens 
of 
thousand people, four to five times the usual number, flocked to 
see plums on a hill in an eastern suburb of the city. The 
number of visitors to many other scenic spots in the city 
evidently increased and department stores were overfilled. 
  "I seldom have a chance to tour the city," said Cao Rong, 
who 
works in Dachang town, about two hours from urban Nanjing. 
"Although I had been to the plum mountain before, I feel more 
relaxed today." 
  The new system also provides a chance for some people to 
take 
a second job. 
  Chen Yong, a computer operator in a Beijing hotel, opened 
his 
own company. He used to worry because he could not find enough 
time for his private business, but today he went to his own 
company early in the morning. 
  However, not all urban residents spent today as a rest day. 
In Nanjing University, Zhang Rong and his colleagues were still 
doing their scientific research on semi-conductors. 
  "It does not mean much for us who engage in scientific 
research although the rest days increased," said a teacher, who 
identified herself only as Gao, at the Beijing Polytechnical 
University. "The real rest day is after our success (in our 
research)." 
  In Beijing, hospitals, public bus companies and stores still 
operate as normally. Officials said it was guaranteed that 
workers of these businesses will work only 44 hours a week and 
take their rest-time by changing working shifts.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Xu Yaozhong (1776 
5069 0022)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- A four-day national forum 
on foreign investment ended here today. The forum, held by the 
State Council, was intended to comprehensively sum up the 
experience in the use of foreign capital during the 15 years of 
reform and opening up, study future guidelines and policies in 
the use of foreign capital, and promote sustained, rapid, and 
healthy progress of the work of using foreign capital. While 
the forum was in progress, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the 
CPC Central Committee and president of the state, met with all 
the participants. Li Peng, State Council premier, attended the 
forum, heard the speeches by some of the participants, and gave 
a speech at the meeting. 
  China's success in the use of foreign capital during the 15 
years of reform and opening up to the outside world has 
attracted worldwide attention. Progress in the past two years 
has been especially fast. The country's approved contracted 
foreign investment volume in 1992 equaled the total for the 
preceding 13 years while 1993's volume was twice as much as that 
of 1992. The amount of foreign capital actually invested in 
China in 1993 accounted for a considerable portion of the 
country's total investment in fixed assets, and the volume of 
import and export resulting from foreign investment also 
represented a sizable proportion of China's total import and 
export volume. These facts show that the use of foreign capital 
has played an increasingly greater role in promoting China's 
economic development and accelerating the transition to a market 
and internationalized economy. 
  The forum was held under a new situation in which China, 
having achieved remarkable successes in using foreign capital, 
faces new opportunities and challenges. The party Central 
Committee and the State Council attached great importance to the 
forum. 
  Jiang Zemin, CPC Central Committee general secretary and 
state president, met with all the participants on 7 March. 
During the meeting, Jiang Zemin fully affirmed the 
accomplishments made in using foreign capital during the last 15 
years. He pointed out that the use of foreign capital has 
played a positive role in China's economic development. He 
urged everyone to earnestly sum up the experience, study ways to 
resolve new developments and problems that have emerged in the 
new situation, and to do an even better job of using foreign 
capital. 
  Premier Li Peng attended the forum on 4 March. After 
listening to the speeches by responsible persons from Shanghai, 
Tianjin, Fujian, Guangdong, Chongqing, and other provinces and 
cities, he emphatically pointed out: Using foreign capital is 
an important aspect of China's economic work. Under the current 
favorable situation of reform and opening up, we must study ways 
to do the work even better. 
  In his speech, Premier Li Peng first analyzed and explained 
in general why it was essential for China to further increase 
the use of foreign capital, the possibility of doing so, and the 
new situation and environment at home and abroad in this regard. 
He then focused his discussion on the several issues that 
needed to be studied and addressed to further carry out the work 
of using foreign capital. 
  On how to maintain and develop the strong momentum in using 
foreign capital, Li Peng said: We must seize the current 
favorable opportunity to use more foreign capital in a more 
efficient way to promote China's economic development. To 
attract more foreign investment, it is extremely important for 
us to further improve the investment environment, establish a 
comprehensive legal system, perfect the market mechanism, 
improve the work efficiency of the government, and enhance the 
professional quality of the personnel. In attracting foreign 
capital, China has such advantages as a fairly cheap labor force 
and a galaxy of fairly outstanding technical personnel. The 
biggest advantage, however, is its vast market. From now on, we 
must rely on these advantages to attract foreign investment, 
which will also enable foreign investors to obtain legitimate 
profits in the Chinese market. However, China will not attract 
foreign investment at the expense of its socialist spiritual 
civilization. We must not go for pornographic, vulgar, or 
things of bad-taste, which are incompatible with our socialist 
spiritual civilization. Our next step is to attract more 
international financial consortiums and multinational 
corporations that have strong resources to invest in China and 
to engage in economic cooperation with us. 
  Speaking on ways to realize mutual benefits in using 
foreign capital, Li Peng pointed out: A basic requirement for 
using foreign capital is to ensure mutual benefits under the 
conditions of a market economy. We should protect foreign 
investors' legitimate rights and interests on the one hand while 
guaranteeing our own interests on the other. We should 
strengthen management of foreign- funded enterprises according 
to law which transfer their profits illegally. We should make a 
great effort to attract foreign capital and, at the same time, 
earnestly strengthen management. We should carefully compare 
the terms of foreign investments and select the most favorable 
ones. 
  On how to guide foreign investment in the right direction, 
Li 
Peng stressed: We must formulate sound industrial policies to 
guide the distribution of foreign investment. In addition to a 
national industrial policy, we must also formulate development 
strategies and specific policies for each trade. While 
providing guidance to foreign-funded projects in general, we 
must make overall planning for major foreign-funded projects to 
avoid blind or redundant investments. 
  Speaking on the question of using foreign capital to 
transform old enterprises, Li Peng said: Appropriately using 
foreign capital to transform old enterprises will help 
ameliorate fund shortages among enterprises, bring in advanced 
technologies and managerial expertise, and transform enterprise 
management mechanism. However, we must strengthen property 
assessment to avoid under-evaluation of state-owned properties 
and losses of state assets. Chinese and foreign investors 
should share the risk and undertake joint development. The 
burden on old enterprises in using foreign investment to 
transform them should be rationally distributed. The state 
should maintain controlling shares of key industries and 
backbone enterprises which are vital to the national economy and 
the people's livelihood. 
  On the question of China's ability to pay foreign debts, Li 
Peng pointed out: The size of China's foreign debts is no 
longer small. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and control 
the size and structure of foreign debts and the efficiency in 
the use of foreign capital to ensure our ability to repay the 
principal and interest. Economic efficiency is the key to 
repaying foreign debts. As long as foreign investment produces 
higher economic efficiency, there should be no problem in 
repayment. We should also consider the overall balance of 
foreign exchange reserves when we use foreign capital. 
  Speaking on protecting the legitimate rights and interests 
of 
Chinese workers at foreign-funded enterprises, Li Peng said: 
Several serious safety incidents happened at foreign-funded 
enterprises. This demonstrated the poor labor safety conditions 
in some foreign-funded enterprises. Some of them have even 
encroached on the workers' rights and interests. Protecting the 
legitimate rights and interests of workers at foreign-funded 
enterprises should be placed on the agenda of governments and 
trade unions at different levels. 
  Leading comrades who attended the forum with Comrade Li Peng 
were Zou Jiahua, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Li Guixian, Ismail 
Amat, and Peng Peiyun. 
  Vice Premier Li Lanqing and State Councillor Luo Gan 
addressed the forum separately when it opened on 4 March. Vice 
Premier Li Lanqing summed up the forum on 7 March. 
  Wu Yi, foreign economic relations and trade minister, gave a 
speech during the meeting, providing a systematic introduction 
to China's accomplishments in using foreign capital, the new 
developments and problems it is encountering, and the strategic 
policy decisions and major policy measures in using foreign 
capital. 
  Responsible persons in charge of foreign investment from 
departments under the State Council, provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities attended the forum.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Any legislation 
deliberated and adopted by the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 
the 1994/95 elections and any institution created accordingly 
will cease to be valid on June 30, 1997, a Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman reiterated here today. 
  The spokesman made the statement when asked to comment on a 
report that on March 9, the Hong Kong Government submitted the 
second part of the constitutional package to the Legislative 
Council for deliberation. 
  He pointed out that the Chinese side has stated on many 
occasions that "in the absence of an agreement between the 
Chinese and British sides, any legislation deliberated and 
adopted by the Hong Kong Legislative Council on the 1994/95 
elections and any institution created accordingly will cease to 
be valid on June 30, 1997."

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Defeat of an 
anti-China draft resolution at a U.N. commission meeting is a 
victory for China as well as for the forces of justice in the 
international community, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said here today. 
  On March 9, the 50th session of the United Nations 
Commission 
on Human Rights decided, by a vote of 20 to 16, not to take 
action on the draft resolution tabled by some Western countries 
on the so-called "situation of human rights in China", thus 
frustrating the attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs 
under the pretext of human rights issues. 
  "This is not only a victory for China, but more important, 
it 
is a victory of the united struggle of the forces of justice in 
the international community," the spokesman said. 
  In recent years, the spokesman noted, China has made 
remarkable achievements in its reform and opening drive. A 
situation unprecedented in its history has prevailed throughout 
the country, featuring political stability, economic growth and 
a life of peace and contentment. 
  However, he said, in total disregard of these facts, a few 
Western countries once again tabled an anti-China draft 
resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. 
  The spokesman pointed out: "This only shows that they are 
not happy with the achievements the Chinese people have made. 
In fact, by feigning concern about the human rights situation 
in China, they harbor the true intention to exert political 
pressure on China and interfere in its internal affairs." 
  This act of politicizing the human rights issues and 
practice 
of hegemony undoubtedly met with the opposition of the majority 
members of the U.N. commission, he added. 
  The spokesman noted that the anti-China draft resolutions 
tabled successively in 1990, 1992 and 1993 by some Western 
countries all failed to be put to vote. This year, they 
suffered yet another defeat. 
  He stated: "A just cause enjoys abundant support while an 
unjust cause finds little support. The attempt by a small 
number of countries to manipulate U.N. activities in the field 
of human rights by way of power politics is unpopular and bond 
to fail." 
  "Gone are the days when China was subjected to willful 
bullying, humiliation and outside interference. And no one can 
stop the Chinese people from marching victoriously along the 
correct path of their own choosing," he stressed. 
  He expressed the admiration and thanks of the Chinese 
Government to all countries that have upheld justice and 
supported China and its appreciation for those that withheld 
their support for the anti-China draft resolution. 
  "The Chinese Government wishes to reiterate its willingness 
to work with the international community on the basis of 
equality and mutual respect and under the guidance of the 
principles of the U.N. Charter in a common effort to promote and 
protect human rights," the spokesman concluded.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Shaoping (0719 1421 1627)] </F>
  [Text] On 9 March, the 50th meeting of the UN Human Rights 
Commission adopted a motion proposed by China, deciding not to 
proceed with a draft bill on "China's so-called human rights 
condition," which was proposed by some Western countries; thus, 
the attempt by Western countries to use the human rights issue 
as an excuse to exert pressure on China suffered another setback. 
  At three previous meetings, Western countries also proposed 
similar bills, which all came to early ends. At this round of 
meetings, these countries once again proposed the bill on 
"China's so-called human rights condition," asking the 
Commission to vote on it. Regarding this, Jin Yongjian, head of 
the Chinese delegation, proposed a motion asking members not to 
proceed with the bill. His motion won strong support from the 
developing countries and was passed by 20 votes in favor, 16 
against, and 17 abstentions. 
  Jin Yongjian pointed out in his speech before the motion was 
voted on that some Western countries ignored the three refusals 
by the Human Rights Commission; ignored the actual situation in 
which China enjoys political and social stability, sustained and 
rapid economic development, and great improvement of living 
standards among its people; they insisted on proposing the draft 
bill which was against China, and their purpose was to exert 
political pressure on China, hinder China's economic 
development, and force the Chinese people to change the road of 
development which is chosen by themselves and which suits 
China's conditions. 
  He pointed out that one of the important reasons for China's 
comparative backwardness today is because China suffered 
invasion and looting by imperialism for a long time. In this 
regard, among the countries which proposed the draft bill, some 
had played a very disgraceful role, and today they once again 
want to instruct China to do this and that and willfully 
criticize it. How can this not cause grievances among the 
Chinese people? 
  He said that China is willing to begin international 
cooperation in the human rights domain on the premise of mutual 
respect and equality and based on the purpose and principle on 
the UN Charter, but China is firmly opposed to any country or 
group which slanders it in the name of "protection of human 
rights." 
  Before the vote, representatives from countries such as 
Cuba, 
Mauritius, Syria, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Iran 
expressed support for China. They stressed that the 
international community must look at China's great achievements 
in the areas of politics, economy, and society. They said that 
China is a big country and its population accounts for 
one-fourth of the world's total, and that the Chinese Government 
has endured the challenge of managing such a big country, 
enabled various ethnic groups to live harmoniously, and let the 
people upgrade their living standard continuously. Regarding 
these achievements, the international community should give 
commendation and encouragement. They pointed out that Western 
countries are accustomed to imposing their own thinking and 
ideologies on others, and that the bill on "China's so-called 
human rights conditions" has a clear political motive.

  [Text] Washington, March 9 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank said 
here today that it had approved a loan of 160 million U.S. 
dollars to help with Shanghai's environmental cleanup. 
  Shanghai, China's largest city, lacks safe water supply and 
its main source of water, the tidal Huangpu river, is at 
high-risk, World Bank officials said. 
  This is China's fourth freestanding environmental project 
supported by the bank. The bank is also involved in eight 
projects in water supply and sanitation in China. 
  Of the loans to China last year, which totaled 2.5 billion 
dollars, nine percent is on environmental protection, the bank 
said. 
  The bank's task manager for the project, Geoffrey Read 
called 
Shanghai "an economic engine of growth for China", which could 
help fuel the highest increase in gross domestic product in the 
world.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Kuan Wen-liang (7070 2429 5328): "The </F>
Purpose of Clinton's `Human Rights Diplomacy'"] 
  [Text] Since the Clinton administration took office a year 
ago, it has incessantly practiced "human rights diplomacy" 
toward China. Beijing calls this "interfering in its internal 
affairs" and claims that "it will not yield to the United 
States." Some people overseas suspect that Washington is trying 
to "foster opposition forces" in China.... What was the Chinese 
reaction to "U.S. human rights pressure" exerted over the past 
year? Do a few people think Washington has achieved the 
expected results in practicing the U.S. human rights concept? 
<H5>  United States Ignores China's Judicial Sovereignty </H5>
  On Clinton and his administration's position concerning the 
summoning of a parolee, a professor at Beijing university who is 
also a telecommunications expert, said in Shenzhen: "The United 
States has its judicial system, under which the police can 
arrest and detain law breakers according to its laws. Why is it 
that Chinese judicial authorities cannot summon a parolee who 
has broken his parole?" He accused U.S. politicians of being 
"arrogant and conceited," of "bullying others too much," and of 
"applying dual standards." He added that in everything the 
United States has done in recent years, it has very seldom 
respected China as an independent country: this was 
"unacceptable" to any Chinese with national dignity. 
  U.S. politicians asserted that the two people "were arrested 
because of involvement in freedom of speech," but Beijing claims 
that this was "summoning according to the law." The professor 
said: "Every country with complete sovereignty has its own 
judicial system. Although China's legal system is being 
improved, this does not mean that there is no judicature in 
China. If the United States regards China as an equal 
independent country, it has no right to meddle in this affair!" 
<H5>  Chinese Despise U.S. Human Rights Concept </H5>
  The professor from Beijing asked: There are more than 140 
countries in the world, but only the U.S. President "talks 
glibly about human rights." Is it that all other countries "do 
not respect human rights" and only the United States does? 
  An intellectual who lived in New York for four years 
criticized the United States by saying that "it is not entitled" 
to teach China how to respect human rights. His reason is that 
the United States itself is a country which "simply does not 
have" human rights, adding: From 1979 to 1991, almost 50,000 
children were shot dead in the United States, an average of more 
than 4,000 each year, and more children have died in recent 
years. This ranks first in the world. "Now 13 children die 
through guns every day, and 30 others are wounded...." "Is 
there anything else more valuable than the lives of innocent 
children? Are there human rights in the United States?" He 
advised that "Asia Watch" "who specialize in fabricating" "human 
rights violations" in the Third World should change to "U.S. 
watch," who should "look into the human rights record of the 
United States itself." 
  From Beijing to Guangzhou, it is not difficult to notice 
that 
the Chinese using public U.S. information and data to criticize 
U.S. society for "having no human rights." Cadres and 
intellectuals who are concerned with state affairs generally 
despise the U.S. human rights concept and even ridicule the 
Clinton administration's "human rights diplomacy." 
<H5>  Human Rights Diplomacy Serves as Negative Example </H5>
  The Chinese are generally of the opinion that the U.S. 
"human 
rights theory" is hypocritical; therefore, the more the Clinton 
administration presses China on "human rights improvement," the 
more the Chinese become repugnant to what the United States says 
and does, and the more they are doubtful about the U.S. human 
rights record. This circuitous response has appeared in Chinese 
society. 
  The Chinese believe that this "circuitous response" emerged 
from a "bad thing" and has become a "good thing" which "helps 
the younger generation to understand deeply the hypocritical 
nature of U.S. human rights and hegemonism." Some Chinese 
regard the Clinton administration's pressure as a "negative 
example." A retired Chinese diplomat said: "Some young people 
in China cherish unrealistic illusions about the outside world; 
we frequently teach them to view the United States from a 
rational angle. Having rational knowledge alone is not 
adequate, they should also have perceptual feelings." 
  The Human Rights Baton Awakens Younger Generation 
  This deep "perceptual feeling" occurred last year, during 
which U.S. politicians and the mainstream media tried every 
possible means to stop China from hosting the 2000 Olympics, 
under the pretext that "there are no human rights" in China. At 
that time, Chinese in foreign countries condemned U.S. 
politicians for their "ugly politics" and "mean" tricks. In the 
meantime, people north and south of the Chang Jiang, 
particularly workers and young intellectuals in the cities, 
responded most strongly to this. Even a 10-year-old primary 
school pupil in Beijing sadly asked his father: "Why did the 
United States not allow us to host the Olympics?...." 
  Some friends who had previously "worshipped" the United 
States also admitted that they had "awakened." What did they 
awaken to? The awakened to the fact that "there is indeed 
hegemonism in the world and this hegemonism is targeted at 
China." In December last year, a researcher in the Beijing 
Academy of Social Sciences said privately: Problems should be 
viewed from a dialectical angle. Unquestionably, Washington's 
"human rights diplomacy" has caused "much trouble" to 
Chinese-U.S. relations, but at the same time it has also 
"taught" the Chinese to clearly understand hegemonism and 
"unified" this understanding. 
<H3>  If a Country Refuses to Become a Puppet, that Country Will 
Be Accused of "Having No Human Rights" </H3>
  In recent years, the United States has accused Beijing of 
selling "long-range" missiles to Pakistan. It has created 
rumors that the Yin He was carrying materials for chemical 
weapons; it has framed China by saying that it exported 
prison-made products; it has closed down a Chinese firm in the 
United States; it has imposed a discriminatory embargo on trade; 
it has threatened to ban imports of Chinese products into the 
United States.... Moreover, every day it accuses China of 
"having no human rights" and threatens to revoke China's 
most-favored-nation status. Since assuming office a year ago, 
the Clinton administration has noisily made anti-Chinese remarks 
and exerted pressure on China. This has made the following 
impression on the world: The Clinton administration has never 
respected China as an independent country and has never 
considered that the Chinese people are entitled to national 
dignity. 
  On a plane from Beijing to Guangzhou, the manager of a 
state-owned enterprise said in jest: "If you are willing to 
become a U.S. puppet, the United States will say you have human 
rights and will make you a pro-democracy hero. Otherwise, they 
say you have no human rights. Do the Chinese not understand 
this simple theory? Do you know why so many Chinese 
spontaneously commemorated Mao Zedong's centenary? Because Mao 
Zedong was the symbol of the Chinese spirit and national 
self-respect!"

<F P=106> [Third of an unknown number of installments: "Special </F>
article" by special correspondent in Washington Tsu Hsing-fu 
(2612 1630 4395): "China Will Not Beg for MFN Treatment -- 
Written on the Eve of Christopher's Visit to China"; first and 
second installments published in the 9 March China Daily Report] 
  [Text] Washington, 9 Mar -- A Senior U.S. Official 
Meets With Wei Jingsheng on the Sly 
  Over the past week and more, China and the United States 
have 
again engaged in a battle of words over the human rights issue. 
During a recent visit to Beijing, a senior official of the U.S. 
Government arranged a meeting with Wei Jingsheng behind the back 
of the Chinese Government. The Chinese side has lodged a 
protest with the U.S. Government on this issue. In response to 
the recent moves made by the Chinese public security authorities 
to hold people like Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan in temporary 
custody, the U.S. Government has again threatened to cancel 
China's MFN trading status. The purpose of the Chinese police 
in summoning people like Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan is to convey 
a message to the United States and the U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, who is scheduled to arrive in Beijing for a 
visit on 11 March: Do not take China for a weak country which 
can be easily bullied; do not take for granted that China will 
kowtow to the United States on the human rights issue in order 
to retain its MFN trading status. 
  To the common citizens of China, the present period is one 
in 
which they are enjoying the greatest freedom ever in traveling 
and expressing views for the past several decades. As a matter 
of fact, the political practice whereby people inform against 
each other has already been wiped out in China and people are no 
longer warned or put into prison for grumbling or raising 
well-intentioned criticism against the Chinese leadership. So 
long as the common citizens refrain from violating the law, from 
translating their anti- government remarks into action, or from 
being hell-bent on ingratiating themselves with foreigners, the 
Chinese police will not take the trouble to find fault with them. 
  In the past, the Chinese people's freedom of travel was 
considerably restricted. Without residential registration, 
people would find it very hard to have a long stay in another 
place, let alone find a job in another city. Today, all these 
restrictions have been abolished and people do not need 
residential registration to find a job or do business across the 
country. Neither did the Chinese people enjoy any freedom in 
choosing jobs in the past. Today, people can quit and change 
their jobs if they feel dissatisfied with their present jobs or 
units. In earlier days, people had to go through strict 
examination and approval formalities if they wanted to study 
aboard or emigrate to another country; yet nowadays, the 
relevant authorities will not place any obstacles in front of 
such people provided that they are eligible to apply and have 
sufficient financial backing. 
<H5>  China's Crime Rate Is Lower Than That of the United States </H5>
  Some Americans who know China well said emotionally that the 
social progress China has attained recently actually has a more 
extensive and farreaching significance than the release of a few 
dissidents. As a matter of fact, China has done better than the 
United States in certain human rights fields. If it has 
self-knowledge, the United States really needs to be 
introspective about what it has done in the past. Compared with 
the United States, China has fewer homeless people; enjoys a 
lower crime rate in murder, rape, and robbery; and has a smaller 
proportion of prisoners. China has many good qualities in terms 
of human rights. 
  Democracy seems to be the development trend for the whole 
world and is irresistible from a long-term point of view. 
However, the form and speed of a country's democratic process 
should be determined by the country's cultural traditions and 
concrete national conditions. China must not indiscriminately 
copy the forms of democracy currently in practice in the United 
States and the West. 
  To the vast numbers of the Chinese common citizens who have 
just resolved the problem of having sufficient food and clothing 
and are heading for a fairly comfortable life, human rights and 
democracy are just like decorative ornaments. Totally different 
from the handful of dissidents in China to whom American 
journalists, human rights organizations, and a few U.S. Senators 
have paid much of their attention, the overwhelming majority of 
the Chinese people are most concerned about the economic 
prosperity of the country, a clean and industrious 
administration, stable commodity prices and social order, and 
better private lives. 
  The United States Attempts To Facilitate the 
Emergence of an Opposition Party in China 
  Facing the demands of the United States on the human rights 
issue, the Chinese side has tried hard to accomplish all it can, 
yet will never do anything which is not attainable at the 
present stage. China's reluctance to make major moves on U.S. 
human rights concerns stems from two worries. Firstly, China is 
worried that the U.S. human rights demands will turn out to be a 
bottomless pit. For example, the United States may ask China 
today to release a couple of people and China sets them free 
according to realistic conditions; yet tomorrow, the United 
States may again demand the release of more and later start 
urging China not to arrest anyone while releasing prisoners. As 
a matter of fact, the real intention of the United States in 
imposing human rights pressure on the Chinese Government is to 
facilitate the emergence of an opposition party in China which 
will put on a rival show against the government. Not that the 
leaders of the Chinese Government do not want to expedite the 
pace of political reform because China's modernization drive can 
only succeed when political and economic reforms are carried out 
at the same pace; they are just worried about the possible 
emergence of major social turmoil inside China. China is a 
multinational country which has a big population and a weak 
economic foundation; moreover, because of their generally low 
cultural quality, many people still cling to the deep-rooted 
remains of the feudal ideology. As a result, China has found 
its political reform far more difficult than economic reform. 
Under such circumstances, if anyone pursues quick results in 
political reform, major turmoil is bound to break out in China. 
The Chinese Government and people shiver with fear when looking 
back at the anarchist state brought by the full "democracy" 
during the "Great Cultural Revolution" as well as at the thought 
of the present chaotic situation and tragedies in the former 
Soviet Union, Russia, and Eastern European countries. 
<H5>  Political Reform Takes Time </H5>
  The U.S. Government also admits that a strong, stable, and 
democratic China is beneficial to the interests of the United 
States. If it really wishes to see a strong, stable, and 
democratic China, the United States ought not to impose an 
unduly heavy pressure on China at a premature time. Imposing an 
unduly heavy pressure is tantamount to trying to make people do 
something which they do not wish to do. Since democracy can 
only be built on the basis of social stability and economic 
development, the Chinese Government has regarded it as an urgent 
task to dilute ideological awareness and firmly seize favorable 
international opportunities to bring about further development 
to its economy. This is a wise decision and the Chinese people 
all show their approval with their hands up. A high-degree 
economic reform will inevitably bring about political reform; 
however, political reform in China takes some time and one 
should not expect to reach the sky in a single bound. 
  So long as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher aims 
his China visit at seeking common ground on major issues while 
reserving differences on minor ones, at building up mutual 
trust, and at expanding the foundation of cooperation between 
the two countries, I believe that his visit to China will be a 
success. Therefore, there is no need for the United States to 
give up eating (granting MFN status to China) for fear of 
choking (human rights).

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Korea Is Exerting Great Efforts To </F>
Develop Its Agriculture"] 
  [Text] Korea [choson] gives priority to agricultural 
development over any other activity, and agriculture is an issue 
to which Korean people pay overwhelming attention. 
  The 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Workers Party of Korea 
Central Committee, which opened toward the end of 1993, decided 
that the following three years [as heard] would be a period of 
adjustment in economic construction, clearly presented a need to 
implement a new economic strategy of directing primary efforts 
to agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade, and 
decided to increase state investment in agriculture and pursue 
agricultural development. 
  The Korean National Agriculture Meeting, which was convened 
this 25 February, summed up experiences and presented tasks and 
measures to develop agriculture based on those experiences. 
  An important task in developing agriculture in Korea is to 
increase rice and corn production per chongbo [one chongbo 
equals 2.45 acres] to eight or 10 tonnes and, thus, reap 15 
million tonnes of grain a year in a few years. To fulfill this 
goal, the Korean National Agriculture Meeting presented various 
measures, and a noteworthy measure, among them, is to improve 
the peasants' cultural and technological standards and 
vigorously carry out a technological revolution in the rural 
areas. 
  The meeting noted that constantly improving the peasants' 
standards of agricultural technology is a key task to develop 
agriculture. The meeting demands that the higher education 
system be strengthened in rural areas, that many farm 
universities and agricultural colleges where students work and 
study open, that technical personnel necessary for agricultural 
production be trained en masse, that various technical study 
teams and special training courses be established to ensure that 
peasants learn latest agricultural science and technology. 
  Another important task in the Korean technological 
revolution 
in agriculture is to build irrigation systems, use electric 
equipment in farming, mechanize farm work, and use chemical 
fertilizers in farming. 
  The Korean National Agriculture Meeting noted that Korea had 
brought about great achievements in its efforts to build 
irrigation systems and use electric equipment in farming and 
that it must give priority to mechanizing farm work and applying 
scientific knowledge to farming. 
  Therefore, the meeting demanded that the industrial sector 
strengthen its assistance to agriculture and produce more 
agricultural equipment of various sorts to ensure that 
cooperative farms in various areas do farming in a timely manner 
without receiving assistance from the city labor. 
  The meeting demanded that chemical fertilizer plants in 
various areas produce efficient chemical fertilizers in 
abundance. It also encouraged those plants to produce 
biochemical fertilizers [saengmul hwahak piryo] and plant growth 
control materials [singmul songjang chojolchil] in abundance to 
supply them to rural areas.

China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met 
with a delegation from the Foreign Affairs and Unification 
Committee of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea 
(ROK) led by its Chairman Chong Chae-mun here this afternoon. 
  Qiao expressed satisfaction with the rapid development in

the two countries established diplomatic relations and hoped 
that such a relationship would be further boosted on the basis 
of mutual benefit through concerted efforts by the two sides.

surely benefit the contacts between the Chinese NPC and the 
National Assembly of the ROK and further bilateral ties as well. 
  Chong said bilateral economic ties and trade are growing 
continuously and the contacts between the two peoples have 
increased. 
  He expressed the hope that the bilateral ties will grow in a 
sustainable manner. 
  Earlier this afternoon, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen exchanged views with Chong on bilateral 
relations and issues of common concern. 
  Qian said China and the ROK are close neighbors and China is 
committed to developing the good-neighborly relations and 
friendship with the ROK. 
  Furthering bilateral economic relations and trade will not 
only benefit both countries, but also play an important role in 
safeguarding peace, prosperity and development in the whole 
region. 
  The delegation arrived here on Tuesday [7 March] for a 
goodwill visit to China as guests of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the NPC.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing Asia 
TV-City Co. Ltd. of China and the Unicorn Company from the 
Republic of Korea signed an agreement today to build an 
international park in Beijing. 
  The Korean company is investing 150 million U.S. dollars in 
the super-park, which will be situated in Beijing's eastern 
outskirts at Xiangshan. 
  "It is the first major project for Korean companies to 
invest 
in China's Culture and Tourism Industry," said Jin Shuzeng, 
chairman of the Beijing Asia TV-City Co. 
  It is claimed that it will be the largest international park 
in the world. In it will be an audio-visual town, recreation 
centers, gymnasiums, holiday villas, and scenic spots featuring 
different nationality customs across the world. 
  The park will also have office buildings, financial 
buildings 
and conference buildings. 
  The project is expected to be finished in three years, said 
Yim Chul-kyu, publisher of the weekly SISA JOURNAL, a T.V. 
journal, and general adviser of the Unicorn Company. 
  "It's a high-level experiment between (The Republic Of) 
Korea 
and China in the field of cultural and economic exchange," Yim 
said. "More cooperation is expected between them in the future."

likely to achieve a breakthrough soon in ending 
eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between the two armies at the

  [Text] New Delhi, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Bilateral trade 
between China and India is expected to reach the 1-billion U.S. 
dollar mark over the next three years, according to Chinese 
Ambassador to India Cheng Ruisheng. 
  As the Sino-Indian trade was already 670 million U.S. 
dollars 
last year, it can grow to the level of 1 billion U.S. dollars, 
cheng said at a function here Tuesday [8 March]. 
  At present China imports about 4 million tons of iron ore 
from India. 
  "The import bill could be much higher as our steel sector is 
growing by leaps and bounds. We will also need substantial 
quantities of coal in the near future," the Chinese ambassador 
said. 
  The main impediments in the way of a high growth rate in 
bilateral trade are the dearth of national shipping lines and 
banking clearance.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "EU Reform Meets New Problems as Broader Talks </F>
Go"] 
  [Text] Brussels, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Negotiations on 
admitting new members to an enlarged European Union (EU) 
continue even as norway refuses to make any more concessions on 
its fishery policies. 
  Meanwhile, EU policy-making bodies are working on a plan to 
keep such a union operating efficiently after accepting new 
members. 
  Foreign ministers of the existing 12 EU nations gathered in 
brussels on Tuesday to discuss for the first time technical 
details on how to restructure the enlarged union. However, 
following major disagreements over a voting mechanism, the 
meeting closed without reaching any conclusions on Wednesday 
morning. 
  While negotiations between the EU and Norway about its entry 
are undergoing some difficulties, it is believed in Brussels 
that an agreement could eventually be reached. 
  Further talks were held from Sunday through to Tuesday 
between the EU and Norway but, once again, they broke down with 
the two sides agreeing to reopen them on March 15. 
  The rights of fishing have been a thorny issue in the 
enlargement talks between Norway and the EU. 
  Norway says it can not make any more concessions to meet 
demands that EU fishing fleets from Spain and Portugal be 
granted more fishing rights in Norway's North Sea waters. 
  But spain, which has the EU's largest fishing fleet, insists 
that it must be able to fish more in Norwegian waters and 
threatens to block Norway's membership bid if more fishing 
rights are not given. 
  Observers here believe that even if Norway refuses to comply 
with the concessions demanded by the EU, the enlargement 
program, which involves admitting Sweden, Finland and Austria, 
will not be effected. 
  However, they do stress that if the eu's reform of its 
internal structure, especially the vital voting mechanism, is 
not completed smoothly, all efforts to progress an enlarged 
union will have been wasted. 
  When the European Community (EC), the EU's predecessor, 
began 
talks to lay a foundation for enlargement by admitting Sweden, 
Finland, Austria and Norway in February 1992, it made it clear 
that the plan was to energize the grouping instead of weakening 
it or restricting the limits of its authority. 
  The European parliament has also made it clear that if the 
enlargement has a negative effect on the operation of the 
community, it will not approve the admission of new members. 
  When it was founded in 1957, the EC only had six member 
nations. But over the past 30 years, the number has doubled. 
However, it's policies have remained basically unchanged. 
  If everything goes to plan, by January 1995 the number of 
members will have jumped to 16. This, though, means that its 
original practices and principles will no longer be suitable and 
institutional reform will become a major priority affecting its 
ability to accept new members. 
  The council of foreign ministers is the EC's highest policy- 
making body and enjoys legislative power. It consists of 12 
ministers respectively from the 12 member nations. However, 
each minister's voting rights differ, depending on each 
country's population. The number of votes allocated to each 
minister can vary from 2 to 10. 
  At present, the council's tally of votes is 70: Germany, 
Italy, Britain and France each with 10; Spain 8; The 
Netherlands, Greece, Belgium and Portugal each with 5 votes; and 
Luxembourg 2. 
  According to reports, if the 12 nations fail to conclude an 
agreement on a voting mechanism or "iron out" their other 
difficulties for an enlarged union in the next two weeks, it 
will be impossible for the European parliament to give its 
approval for whatever has been decided before June 1, thus 
delaying the process even further.

<F P=106> [Article by Caroline Straathof: "Kooijmans Asks China For </F>
Dialogue"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans 
talked with Chinese leaders on Tuesday about the need for a 
dialogue on human rights issues. 
  While Kooijmans met with Prime Minister Li Peng and his 
counterpart Qian Qichen, the confrontation between Beijing and 
Washington over human rights escalated. Yesterday student 
leader Wang Dan was arrested for the second time in a week for 
further questioning. 
  Kooijmans's U.S. counterpart, Warren Christopher, who is in 
Australia and will arrive in Beijing on Friday, said that the 
dozens of arrests last weekend "could have a negative impact" on 
his visit and on the assessment of Beijing's human rights 
policies. President Clinton wants to first see a significant 
improvement in human rights before extending China's 
most-favored nation trading status another year. 
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry has accused Clinton of 
"irresponsible interference in China's internal affairs." A few 
days ago Clinton criticized the arrests in Beijing and Shanghai. 
Kooijmans received a similar reaction when he questioned Li and 
Qian about the recent arrests. 
  The Netherlands is avoiding a confrontation to be able to 
exercise maximum pressure on Beijing, a civil servant in the 
Netherlands delegation said. Nevertheless, Kooijmans spoke of 
"difficult discussions." "The Chinese leadership still has very 
little sympathy for human rights," he said. "They see foreign 
concern in the context of an ideological controversy and believe 
that human rights are being used as a political weapon." 
  Kooijmans said that the Netherlands Government's room for 
maneuver should not be compared with that of the U.S. 
Government. The U.S. approach "is felt here to be particularly 
offensive. This emerged clearly from the reactions," he said. 
"We have our own approach. I find it important each time to 
inspire confidence by not using human rights as a political 
weapon. To show that concern about human rights is real and not 
something which you raise for other motives." 
  The minister said he had "no reason at all" to think that 
his 
contribution was leading to any change in China's policies. 
"But I have been active in human rights long enough to know 
that you should never expect results overnight, that it is a 
very gradual process," he said. 
  In addition to the arrests of the dissidents, Kooijmans 
discussed with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng 
the Tibet question and China's harder approach to religious 
activities. Kooijmans said that in the last year little progress 
had been made in China's contacts with the dalai lama, the 
exiled Tibetan god-king, or with his representatives. 
  As for the religious decrees announced last month, the 
Chinese Government gave the impression that they were intended 
to protect the religious freedom of the recognized religious 
communities or to oppose Islamic fundamentalism, Kooijimans said. 
  Kooijmans said he had the impression that the decrees were 
also directed against a number of Christian communities. He 
expressed his displeasure about this and advised the Chinese to 
contact the World Council of Churches and the Vatican. 
  Kooijmans also gave his Chinese hosts a new list of names of 
people about whom the Netherlands Government is asking for 
information. Most of the people mentioned are in prison after 
being sentenced in court. A number of them are in 
"administrative detention," which comes down to being held for 
three to four years without trial.

Network in Mandarin at 0055 GMT on 10 March begins live coverage 
of the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] from the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. 
  Video opens with a close shot of a red-and-gold NPC emblem 
hanging in front of backstage curtains on the rostrum; the

female announcer introduces the broadcast as live coverage of 
the opening of the NPC session. While she reviews the 
achievements scored by the Chinese people over the past year 
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the 
CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, the camera 
pans the spacious hall, where several thousand seats on the 
first, second, and third floors are already filled. According to 
the announcer, the executive chairmen of today's session are the 
permanent members of the presidium. They are: Qiao Shi, Tian

  At 0101 GMT, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, 
Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren appear on the rostrum. 
  At 0103 GMT, Qiao Shi, dressed in a dark Western business 
suit and tie, announces: "Fellow deputies, of the 2,980 deputies 
to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC, 2,808 are present today 
and 172 are absent because of illness or previous engagement. 
We have a quorum. I now declare the Second Session of the 
Eighth NPC of the People's Republic of China open." All present 
then stand to attention during the playing of the national 
anthem. 
  At 0105 GMT, Qiao Shi invites Premier Li Peng to deliver a 
report on the work of the government. 
  Li Peng, in a dark Western business suit and tie, reads the 
report from a prepared text. As he reads the report, the camera 
shows close shots of leaders seated on the rostrum. Qiao Shi, 
in the middle of the first row, is flanked, on his left, by Tian 
Jiyun, Ni Zhifu, Fei Xiaotong, Lei Jieqiong, Li Ximing, Pagbalha 
Geleg Namgyai, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, and Li Peiyao; and, on his 
right, by Wang Hanbin, Chen Muhua, Sun Qimeng, Qin Jiwei, Wang 
Bingqian, Wang Guangying, Lu Jiaxi, Tomur Dawamat, Wu Jieping, 
and Cao Zhi. All are attired in Western business suits, except 
for Li Ximing, who is in a gray Chinese tunic suit. The second 
row is divided by an aisle into two sections. Jiang Zemin is 
seen seated near the aisle on the left section facing the 
audience. On his left are Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, 
Rong Yiren, Ding Guangen, Yang Baibing, Wu Bangguo, Chen Xitong,

Chen Xitong, Ren Jianxin, and Zhang Siqing, who are wearing dark 
Chinese tunic suits; and Liu Huaqing, Chi Haotian, and Zhang 
Zhen, who are dressed in military uniform. 
  While Li Peng continues to read the government work report, 
the camera pans delegations from provinces, municipalities, 
autonomous regions, and the Liberation Army; as well as 
non-voting delegations from ministries, commissions, and 
departments under the State Council. They are seen listening 
attentively to or taking notes on the copy of the report in 
hand. Some of the ethnic deputies are wearing brightly colored 
national costumes. 
  At 0230 GMT, Li Peng concludes his government work report 
amidst warm applause by the deputies in attendance. Qiao Shi 
then announces: "Fellow deputies, the session is over for this 
morning and will reconvene tomorrow [11 March] morning. Now the 
session is in recess." 
  At 0233 GMT, live coverage ends with a shot of the deputies 
leaving the hall.

<F P=106> [Text of Government Work Report Delivered by Chinese Premier </F>
Li Peng at the Opening of the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in 
Beijing on 10 March 1994 -- live] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  On behalf of the State Council I would now like to deliver 
the government work report at this session. Please examine it. 
I also request members of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee and other 
observers to present your views. 
  I. A Review of Domestic Affairs in 1993 and Basic Principles 
for the Work in 1994. 
  The past year was a year in which the nation implemented in 
all sectors the guidelines laid down by the 14th National CPC 
Committee in all sectors and proceeded victoriously along the 
course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and 
in which major achievements were made in reform, opening up, and 
modernization, and a new situation appeared in the work in all 
quarters. In an international environment marked by unrest, 
changes, and economic recession, our great socialist motherland 
stands tall in the east of the world with fast economic growth, 
political stability, national solidarity, and social progress! 
[applause] 
  Our national economy maintained rapid growth. On the basis 
of the fast growth in 1992, our national economy continued its 
vigorous development in 1993. The gross domestic product [GDP] 
exceeded three trillion yuan, topping that of the preceding year 
by 13.4 percent. Agriculturally it was a year of bumper 
harvests. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line 
production, and fishery developed steadily. The added value of 
agricultural output increased 4 percent. The output of major 
agricultural products increased substantially, with the 
exception of cotton and sugar-bearing crops, the production of 
which declined. Grain output reached 456.4 billion kilograms, 
which was a record high. Village and town enterprises continued 
to develop rapidly. The added value of the nation's industrial 
output increased by 21.1 percent. The output of certain major 
goods increased by big margins. Steel output reached 88.68 
million tonnes. The pace of enterprises' technological 
transformation and product-mix restructuring quickened. 
Economic returns were higher. The domestic market thrived. 
The total volume of consumer goods increased 11.6 percent. The 
investment pattern was improved. Major construction projects 
were intensified. Remarkable results were achieved in energy, 
communications, and telecommunications construction. The 
capacity of generators was expanded by 14.38 million kw. The 
construction of the Beijing-Jiujiang, Nanning-Kunming, and other 
main railways was progressing smoothly; and the construction of 
high-grade highways and key seaports quickened. The development 
of postal and telecommunications services was particularly fast. 
The number of telephones in urban and rural areas increased by 
3.67 million units. 
  To deal with conspicuous contradictions and problems during 
the rapid economic development, the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council took timely macroeconomic regulatory and 
control measures, made great efforts to rectify financial order 
and stabilize the economic situation, and maintained the good 
momentum of economic development, thus providing the necessary 
conditions for sustained economic development, and smooth 
progress of reforms this year. In addition, we have accumulated 
valuable experience in exercising macroeconomic regulation and 
control under the socialist market economic conditions. 
  While new progress has been made in reform and opening up, 
we 
have continued to promote reforms in all fields according to the 
requirements of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure. The reform, with emphasis on changing operational 
mechanisms, continued to deepen. Enterprises were given 
decision-making power step by step. The main role of the market 
was strengthened. While developing the state-owned and 
collective economy, the individual, private, and foreign-funded 
sectors of the economy continued to grow. Prices were further 
rationalized, and both the buying and selling prices of grain 
were basically decontrolled. The pace of development of markets 
for production factors, including capital, land, labor force, 
technology and information, was accelerated. 
  On the basis of conducting thorough investigation and study 
and seeking opinions from all quarters, we formulated plans for 
reforming the fiscal and taxation, financial, investment, and 
foreign trade systems. These reform plans now have in the main 
been promulgated, and are proceeding quite smoothly. This 
indicates an important step taken by China in establishing a 
socialist market economic structure. 
  In the past year, the country was opened to the outside 
world 
wider and wider, foreign investment remarkably increased, the 
area of investment was expanded, and the investment structure 
improved. Direct investment totaled $25.8 billion, the largest 
for one year since the start of reform and opening up. Foreign 
trade enjoyed an all-round development, with total volume of 
import-export trade amounting to $195.8 billion, up 18.2 percent 
from 1992. Of the export goods, the proportion of manufactured 
goods increased and the degree of processing was enhanced. 
  Scientific and technological cooperation and cultural 
exchanges with foreign countries further expanded. 
International tourism made rapid development. Contracting of 
projects and provision of labor services abroad became more 
brisk. Various social undertakings made further development. 
New progress was made in scientific and technological 
undertakings while deepening reform. Implementation of the plans 
for technological research and applied technology research, and 
for tackling key problems in science and technology proceeded 
smoothly, and over 30,000 major scientific and technological 
results were achieved. A number of scientific results including 
the Galaxy II supercomputer and the Dawn I robot reached 
advanced world levels. Construction of the new and high 
technology industrial development zones made new development, 
thus playing an obvious role in commercialization and 
industrialization of scientific results. Educational 
undertakings advanced amid reform. Basic education, vocational 
education, adult education, and higher education continued to 
develop and improve. 
  China successfully held the Seventh National Games and 
hosted 
the first East Asian Games. Chinese athletes won 103 world 
championships in major international sports meets. The mass 
sports activities continued to develop. New achievements were 
scored in the fields of literature and arts, the press and 
publishing, radio, film and television, the social sciences, 
public health, pharmaceutical production, family planning, 
environmental protection, disaster prevention, and disaster 
reduction. Celebration of Chairman Mao's birth centennial and 
the showing of 100 patriotic films produced excellent social 
effects. Work on the comprehensive management of social order 
was further promoted. New achievements were scored in national 
defense undertakings. The development of socialist spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and the legal system was stepped up. 
The livelihood of the urban and rural people continued to 
improve. After allowing for price rises, last year the average 
amount of per capita income that urban and rural dwellers used 
for living expenses increased 10.2 percent, and per- capita net 
income of rural residents went up by 3.2 percent. Bank savings 
deposits of urban and rural residents increased by a big margin, 
with the yearend balance of bank savings deposits reaching 
1,476.4 billion yuan, up 28 percent. In 1993, housing floor 
space totalling 270 million square meters was added for urban 
residents, and 570 million square meters were built in rural 
areas. Consumption levels of urban and rural citizens went up 
steadily, and their spiritual and cultural life was constantly 
enriched. 
  Deputies: Over the last year, under the leadership of the 
CPC and through struggle in unity by people of various 
nationalities across the country, we have in the main completed 
various tasks for 1993 set by the First Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress. 
  On behalf of the State Council, I wish to express my 
heartfelt gratitude to people of various nationalities of the 
whole country for their trust in the work of the government and 
their support. [applause] 
  I also wish to express my sincere thanks to compatriots in 
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao; Overseas Chinese; and all foreign 
friends who have shown concern for and supported our country's 
modernization drive. [applause] 
  While affirming our achievements, we have soberly seen that 
there are still some deficiencies and shortcomings in the 
government's work. In the course of advancing, there are still 
some prominent contradictions and difficulties, principally, the 
scale of investment in fixed assets was overextended; increases 
in commodity prices were relatively large; the problem of the 
irrational economic structure remained fairly salient; some 
state-owned large and medium enterprises still had considerable 
difficulties in production and management; public order in some 
localities was bad; the fight against social ills was not 
forceful enough; corrupt practices such as embezzlement, 
bribery, favoritism, and fraud existed among a small number of 
government functionaries; and formalism and bureaucratism among 
government departments affected the government's ties with the 
people. The party Central Committee and the State Council have 
paid great attention to these problems and have been taking 
measures to solve these problems in an effective manner. 
  Fellow deputies, after having comprehensively analyzed the 
situations at home and abroad, the CPC Central Committee clearly 
put forward the basic principles for the work of the whole party 
and the whole nation, namely, to implement the guidelines of the 
14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee in an all-round way; accelerate 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang di 
fa zhan]; maintain political stability; and promote sweeping 
social progress under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
the party's basic line. The CPC Central Committee emphatically 
pointed out that seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability represent the overall interests of the work for the 
whole party and the whole nation. We must subordinate ourselves 
to and serve these overall interests in carrying out all our 
tasks. We must conscientiously and properly handle the 
relationships among reform, development, and stability in real 
earnest. Economic development is the center of all our work, 
reform and opening up are the motive force of development, and 
development and reform are the foundation of long-term social 
and political stability; and social stability, in turn, is a 
prerequisite for economic development and the smooth progress of 
reform. Judging from the conditions at home and abroad, we can 
see that China faces a rare historical opportunity now. So long 
as we conscientiously do a good job in all fields of endeavor, 
timely discover new situations existing in reform and 
development and solve new problems, and maintain coordination 
among reform, development, and stability, and enable them to 
promote one another, our cause of socialist modernization will 
surely be able to march from one victory to another. [applause] 
  II. Maintain Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy Development of 
the National Economy. 
  Nineteen ninety-four is a year in which the national economy 
has continued to maintain its growth momentum and is also an 
important year for us to press ahead with reform. In our 
economic work this year, we will deepen reform, open wider to 
the outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic 
structure, promote technological progress, actively open up 
markets, heighten economic efficiency, and control inflation to 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development. In line 
with these requirements, the gross domestic product is projected 
to increase 9 percent this year. It is fairly appropriate that 
this growth rate has been arranged on the basis of 13 percent 
annual growth for two consecutive years. It will be a 
tremendous achievement if we can maintain a growth of between 8 
percent and 9 percent for a successive number of years. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: New ideas are needed to 
promote development. It is necessary to truly switch onto the 
track which focuses on heightening economic performance. We 
must not blindly take the old road of blindly going after output 
value, growth rate, and expanding the scale of investment. The 
current conditions for economic growth are somewhat tight, and 
the effects of bottleneck restrictions and inflationary 
pressures are expanding. Reform requires a fairly relaxed 
circumstance. We must correctly analyze and grasp the 
situation. We must not only see favorable conditions but also 
pay attention to unfavorable factors in an effort to maintain a 
vigorous but also steady and proper growth rate. In line with 
their respective actual conditions, various localities should 
determine a rational growth rate for themselves. They should 
avoid competing with each other and recklessly going after 
output value. 
  We must strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation 
of the national economy, and develop all sectors of the rural 
economy. Agriculture concerns the overall situation. As the 
majority of China's population resides in the countryside, at no 
time should we neglect the farmers' interests and rural economic 
development. The supply of farm products has a direct bearing 
on the stability of prices, and the improvement of people's 
living conditions in urban and rural areas. Moreover, increases 
in farmers' incomes also has a direct bearing on the expansion 
of markets. 
  Governments at all levels must conscientiously implement the 
guidelines of the central conference on rural work held last 
year, stabilize all basic party policies for rural areas, 
further deepen reform in rural areas, and appropriately resolve 
the outstanding contradictions and problems emerging in the 
course of economic development in rural areas. On the basis of 
ensuring the steady growth of grain and cotton production, it is 
necessary to promote an all-round development of agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline undertakings and fishery, 
bring about the sustained growth of town and village 
enterprises, and do everything possible to increase farmers' 
incomes. 
  The main measures are as follows: 
  To appropriately increase the purchase prices of grain and 
the prices of contract purchase of cotton; to support the 
development of the industry for agricultural use; to strengthen 
the management of the prices of agricultural capital goods; to 
increase the central and local governments' agricultural 
investment; to encourage and guide collectives and peasants to 
increase investment; to step up agricultural capital 
construction and comprehensive agricultural development; to 
refine the state's grain storage system and to establish grain 
risk funds; to strengthen the regulation and control of the 
grain market and stabilize grain price; on the basis of 
stabilizing the area of grain and cotton crops and increasing 
per-unit area output, to adjust the agricultural production 
structure and develop a diversified economy. 
  The state will give support to 500 selected key commodity 
grain production counties and 150 counties producing 
good-quality cotton, and will build a number of high-yield, 
good-quality, and highly efficient model agricultural zones each 
of which with its own characteristics. 
  Developing village and town enterprises is the way we must 
go 
to enable the rural population to live a relatively comfortable 
life. We should continue to support village and town enterprise 
development, especially in the middle and western parts of the 
country. 
  We will continue to advance agriculture through the 
application of science and technology and promotion of 
education. We will cultivate a large number of useful and 
dedicated agricultural technicians, make agricultural technology 
promotion organs more stable, take positive measures to prevent 
plant diseases and insect pests, and promote fine strains and 
the use of advanced and applicable technologies. 
  The measures on easing farmers' burdens have enjoyed popular 
support, and we should continue to carry them out. We should 
earnestly carry out the plan to help the poor. This plan is, 
over the next 7 years from now to the end of this century, to 
help the 80 million people in poor areas, especially in the old 
revolutionary base areas, minority nationality areas, and 
frontier areas, to have enough to eat and wear, and to help them 
free themselves from poverty and live a better life. This is an 
unshirkable responsibility of governments at all levels. We 
believe this plan will definitely win warm support from people 
across the country. [applause] 
  We must dearly cherish and protect cultivated land, 
continually promote the building of a socialized service 
network, further develop and perfect farm produce markets, push 
forward reform of the supply and marketing systems and the 
household registration administration system of small towns. 
The transfer of surplus rural labor to nonagricultural sectors 
and its rational flow between regions are the objective 
requirements of economic development and an inevitable trend. 
We must actively guide and strengthen the management of this 
work and carry it out step by step in a well-organized way. 
  We should improve management and do a good job of production 
on the industrial and communications front. Successfully 
carrying out industrial production and communications, 
especially the production and operation of state-owned large and 
medium enterprises, is of extremely great significance to 
maintaining the national economy's sustained development. 
Generally speaking, reform measures announced this year will 
have a positive impact on the enterprises' production and 
operations. However, they are also likely to bring temporarily 
unfavorable elements to some enterprises. Currently, some 
state-owned large and medium enterprises are still in a 
difficult situation and suffer from poor economic efficiency. 
The causes of this are in their operating mechanisms as well as 
in their heavy social burdens, numerous historical loads, and 
poor internal management. We must actively work from many 
aspects to resolve this. Given that our finances are still 
fairly difficult, the State Council has nevertheless decided to 
exempt state-owned enterprises from the energy and transport 
funds and budget regulatory funds, beginning this year. In 
addition, a special fund is appropriated to consolidate bankrupt 
enterprises and resettle their workers. All localities and 
departments should place the task of making state-owned large 
and medium enterprises successful at the head of their agenda, 
adopt feasible measures to create a favorable external 
environment for enterprises to carry out management and 
operations, and help them halt losses and increase profits. 
However, fundamentally speaking, state-owned enterprises must 
rely on their own efforts to overcome their difficult 
situations. While actively pressing ahead with reform, 
enterprises must actively adjust their product mix in light of 
market demands at home and abroad, strive to produce readily 
salable goods, and constantly develop new products to enhance 
their market adaptability and competitiveness. 
  Governments at all levels should attach importance to 
commercial work and unclog the channels of rural and urban 
markets in order to further enliven commodity circulation and 
smooth the flow of goods. Technical transformation of 
enterprises should be conducted by focusing on optimization of 
the product mix, improving the quality of products, reducing 
consumption, and lowering costs. Basic industries should upgrade 
their production capacity through technical transformation; and 
processing industries should seek advancement through technical 
transformation. We should attach importance to and support the 
transformation of the old industrial bases in order to enable 
them to continue playing an important role in the national 
economy. 
  The condition of production safety in some enterprises is 
not 
good, and serious accidents causing deaths and injuries have 
occurred quite frequently. Bad management is the main cause. 
Therefore, we must pay a high degree of attention to this 
situation. We should adopt effective measures to strengthen 
management on production safety and make sure that our efforts 
in this respect yield obvious results as soon as possible. 
  We must maintain a rational scale of investment and optimize 
the investment structure. A rational investment scale is an 
important condition for maintaining economic stability and 
enhancing the capacity to advance future economic development. 
Currently, the number of projects under construction throughout 
the country is already large, and the number of construction 
projects arranged for the new year is not insignificant. We can 
no longer permit the continued expansion of construction 
projects. Even in the construction of basic industries and 
infrastructural facilities, we should also undertake them in 
line with our financial capacity. In order to realize a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy, all localities and departments must draw up their plans 
rationally by bearing in mind the overall situation and 
following an order of importance and urgency. They must give 
priority to devoting their financial and material resources to 
projects under construction involving the transport, 
telecommunications, energy, and important raw and semifinished 
material industries, as well as to other key construction 
projects involving the harnessing of large rivers and lakes. 
The coastal areas should be encouraged to invest in central and 
western regions in China and to jointly exploit local resources 
by making use of the advantages of the labor force there. 
  This year, we will no longer approve the establishment of 
new 
development zones in the country. In the future, new capital 
construction projects must not start before necessary funds are 
available; it is necessary to have a certain proportion of 
capital to start new projects. Making investments by diverting 
circulating funds or by borrowing money will not be permitted. 
The banks should tighten supervision and management to ensure 
the sufficient amount of circulating funds needed when projects 
are put into production. 
  Deepening the reform of the investment system is a 
fundamental guarantee for maintaining a rational scale of 
investment, optimizing the investment structure, and heightening 
investment returns. The reform of the investment system this 
year mainly involves the establishment of the National 
Development Bank. The aim is to provide a steady source of 
funds for key capital construction projects, and at the same 
time to check inflation and investment expansion through the 
balancing of capital. In order to establish a mechanism for 
restricting investment, both investors and the banks which 
provide loans must undertake responsibility for investment 
risks. We must improve macroeconomic regulation and control 
over the scale of investment and investment structure and 
standardize the procedures of making policy decisions on 
investment in order to reduce recklessness in investment. 
  We will open up wider to the outside world and develop 
cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries. On the whole, 
the current international situation is favorable to our country. 
We must seize this opportunity and continue to do a good job in 
opening up our special economic zones, the Shanghai Pudong New 
District, coastal open cities and belts, and technological and 
economic development zones, as well as key cities located in 
border areas, along rivers, and in the interior; and continue to 
raise the level of opening up. To maintain and develop the good 
momentum of foreign investment in China, we should further 
improve the investment environment, improve our economic laws 
and regulations concerning foreign businesses, make earnest 
efforts to protect foreign-funded enterprises' legitimate rights 
and interests, guide foreign investment with our state 
industrial policy, and encourage foreign investors to 
participate in building our country's basic industries and 
infrastructures. Foreign-funded enterprises should also abide 
by China's laws and regulations and operate their businesses 
according to law. We should pay attention to maintaining a 
proper amount of foreign debts and a rational mix of debts. 
Maintaining a basic balance of international receipts and 
payments is an important condition for achieving a sustained and 
healthy economic development. China's economy is developing 
rapidly and the prospects of its market are very bright. Our 
imports last year increased quite considerably and the growth of 
our exports was relatively slow, causing a rather substantial 
deficit in our foreign trade. To ensure our needs of imported 
goods, we must actively expand our exports. We must follow the 
strategy of winning with quality and diversifying our markets, 
increase the intensity of processing, increase the technology of 
our goods, improve after-sale service, and actively explore new 
markets while consolidating and developing existing markets. We 
must continue to improve the tax refund system for exports, 
decontrol the import-export businesses in an orderly manner, and 
authorize more enterprises with the needed resources to trade 
with foreign countries. 
  Foreign trade enterprises must earnestly change their 
operating mechanisms, thinking, and styles, and develop in the 
direction of turning themselves into industrialized, 
internationalized, and group-type trade enterprises. We must 
strengthen the approval and management of investments outside 
the country, strengthen the supervision over enterprises 
established outside the country, strive to develop international 
tourism, and expand the business of contracting foreign projects 
and cooperation in labor service. Making continual and constant 
efforts to improve the people's living standards and the 
standards of their material and cultural lives on the basis of 
economic development is the basic purpose of developing our 
economy. It is also the basic objective of government work. We 
must firmly uphold the mass view and be concerned with the 
masses' plight at all times. 
  Though we reaped bumper agricultural harvests in recent 
years, the comparative grain and cotton returns dropped. The 
increase in peasants' income was relatively slow. Governments 
at all levels must attach a high degree of importance to the 
problem; they must strengthen leadership over and give more 
support to rural economic development; they must increase 
peasants' income by developing the rural economy and by 
appropriately increasing purchase prices for grain and cotton; 
and they must vigorously develop the tertiary industry to 
provide more job opportunities in urban and rural areas. State 
enterprises must increase the incomes of staff and workers by 
improving economic returns. A new wage system has been 
implemented for state functionaries, and it must be gradually 
improved. Housing construction must be sped up in a planned way 
in conjunction with the housing system reform in urban areas; 
the focal point of the work is to build a group of residences at 
medium or low prices for the people in an attempt to improve 
their housing conditions. Now, the masses in some impoverished 
and some disaster-hit areas and the staff and workers of 
enterprises with poor economic efficiency that have partially or 
completely halted production are still leading relatively 
difficult lives; and retired people's actual incomes have 
decreased somewhat. Governments at all levels must show special 
concern for them, and take positive measures to help them solve 
difficulties. We must uphold the policy of encouraging some 
areas and people to become prosperous ahead of others through 
honest labor and lawful business, and encourage those who have 
become prosperous ahead of others to bring along and help those 
who have lagged behind so as to gradually achieve common 
prosperity. Meanwhile, we must regulate excessive income gaps 
through a policy of rational distribution and the regulatory 
role of taxes. 
  Fellow deputies, family planning and environmental 
protection 
are basic national policies. Though we have scored great 
achievements in carrying out the family planning task, its 
development is uneven and some achievements are not adequately 
consolidated. It is still necessary for us to make continued, 
vigorous efforts to successfully handle the task; we must not 
slacken our efforts in the slightest degree. We must further 
improve the system of responsibility for attaining given 
objectives and strictly implement family planning policies, 
laws, and regulations. We must practically step up propaganda 
and education among grass-roots units and particularly at the 
village level, and improve services for them; and we must 
conscientiously study and solve new problems cropping up under 
the new situation. In conducting family planning work, we must 
put the stress on the rural areas and the floating population 
and we must satisfactorily integrate family planning work with 
economic development, universal education, and the efforts to 
shake off poverty and achieve prosperity. 
  Governments at all levels must include environmental 
protection in economic and social development programs; they 
must persist in mapping out plans for economic, urban and rural, 
and environmental construction; in carrying out the plans; and 
in achieving development in these fields of endeavor at the same 
time. They must carry out comprehensive treatment of urban and 
rural environments, they must strengthen supervision and 
inspection in accordance with laws, they must rationally exploit 
and protect natural resources, and they must make vigorous 
afforestation efforts to improve China's ecology. 
  III. Speeding Up the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure. 
  The general blueprint formulated by the Third Plenary 
Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee for the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure is the program for action in 
further deepening reform. This year, we should combine package 
reform with breakthroughs in key areas to achieve substantive 
progress in reform of the economic structure. We should 
conscientiously implement the plan for fiscal and taxation 
reform and rationalize the distribution of revenues between the 
central and local authorities and between the state and 
enterprises. The main contents of the fiscal and taxation 
systems reform are to change the current local fiscal 
contractual responsibility system to a tax assignment system 
[fen shui zhi] on the basis of a rational division of power 
between central and local authorities. We will divide the 
revenue between the central and local authorities according to 
different categories of taxes and establish a separate taxation 
system for the central and local authorities. In the taxation 
system reform, we should establish a turnover tax [liu zhuan 
shui] based mainly on a value added tax. We will unify the 
taxes on domestic-funded enterprises and the individual income 
tax. Meanwhile, we will reform the system of distributing 
state-owned enterprises' profits. The reform plan takes into 
full account both the need of a gradual increase in the central 
authorities' financial resources and, at the same time, the 
interests of local authorities and the enterprises' current 
operational situation, which is conducive to bringing the 
initiative of both the central and local authorities into full 
play. This is a practical and feasible plan. Governments at 
various levels should take the overall situation into 
consideration and ensure the reform plan's smooth implementation. 
  At present, state finances are faced with some difficulties. 
With the economy's development and the fiscal and taxation 
systems reform, state revenues will increase steadily. However, 
it will take some time to alleviate the financial difficulties. 
This year, due to the fact that the government has to spend a 
relatively large amount of money to repay both capital and 
interest on domestic and external debts, lighten financial 
burdens on enterprises, carry out commodity prices reform and 
increase wages, there will be more factors of decreasing 
revenues and increasing expenditures. The central government 
deficit will be fairly large. The fiscal and taxation 
departments are required to strictly enforce the levying and 
management of taxes and to strive to increase financial 
revenues. In expenditures, we should adhere to the principle of 
belt tightening and strengthening budget control. Various 
localities should strive to achieve a balance in their revenues 
and expenditures and avoid deficits. The central government 
will solve its deficit by issuing state bonds this year and will 
no longer make overdrafts from banks. The state plans to give 
favorable treatment to those who purchase state bonds. This is 
a good thing that will benefit the country and the people. It 
is hoped that people across the country will enthusiastically 
purchase state bonds to support national construction. 
  We will steadily carry out the banking system reform and 
realize the unification of foreign exchange rates smoothly. 
With the socialist market economy's development, banking will 
play an increasingly important role in the national economy. We 
should steadily promote the banking system's reform and 
establish an effective system of macroeconomic regulation and 
control by the central bank, so that the People's Bank of China 
can effectively control the currency supply and stabilize the 
currency's value. We should actively and properly separate the 
functions of policy-lending banks from those of commercial 
banks. In addition to the establishment of a National 
Construction Bank, we will establish the China Import-Export 
Bank to support the import and export of whole sets of 
equipment. We will also establish the China Agricultural 
Development Bank, which will be responsible for the state's 
grain and oil reserve, the contractual procurement of 
agricultural and sideline products, and agricultural 
development. The existing state-owned specialized banks should 
gradually change themselves into state-owned commercial banks. 
Governments at various levels should support bank work and make 
it possible for banks to independently perform their functions 
and duties. Banks should consciously implement the state policy 
of macroeconomic regulations and control and establish 
self-regulating mechanisms 
  China's economy is in a period of rapid growth; therefore, 
a shortage of funds will exist for a long time to come. Over the 
last two years, the total amount of currency and credit has 
increased sharply. However, because the economy has developed 
rapidly and the scale of construction has been excessively 
large, the contradiction between the supply of and demand for 
funds is still very prominent. This year we should strive to 
maintain an appropriate scale of currency issuance and credit, 
and prevent investment from swelling. At the same time, we 
should continue to improve the investment structure, rectify the 
financial order, tighten account settling discipline, take 
positive measures to break debt chains between enterprises, and 
improve the effectiveness of fund utilization. 
  Linking the quoted price of renminbi to the foreign exchange 
regulation market is a reform measure of great significance. 
This will play an important role in linking the domestic and 
overseas markets, and in broadening the scope of opening to the 
outside world. We should strictly implement the management 
system for settling both import and export charges with full 
payment in foreign exchange, and tighten the management of 
revenue and expenditure of (?capital-related) foreign exchange 
to prevent losses of foreign exchange. We should further 
develop and improve the foreign exchange market. The People's 
Bank of China should strengthen its foreign exchange market 
management, provide services to both the supply and demand 
sides, regulate supply and demand, and stabilize foreign 
exchange rates. 
  We should transform the operating mechanisms of state-owned 
enterprises and search for effective ways to establish a modern 
enterprise system. Large- and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises are the mainstay of the national economy; the reform 
of state-owned enterprises is both the focus and difficult part 
of the economic reform. The fundamental way to increase the 
vitality of large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is 
to deepen reform; transform enterprise operating mechanisms; and 
establish a modern enterprise system under which the property 
rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises 
are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise 
management are separated, and scientitic management is 
established. Establishing a modern enterprise system is 
definitely a requisite for developing socialized mass production 
and a market economy. This is difficult and complicated work. 
This year, the state will organize a number of large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, according to the Company 
Law, to experiment with establishing a modern enterprise system 
in order to accumulate experiences, and popularize them step by 
step. 
  We should continue to actively advance the reform of the 
social security system to ease the burden of enterprises in 
undertaking social welfare projects and to create conditions for 
enterprises to participate in market competition on an equal 
footing. 
  In the face of enterprise reform, we should continue to 
transform enterprises' operating mechanisms; truly give 
enterprises all their rights and responsibilities; continue to 
deepen the reform of enterprises' labor, personnel, and 
distribution systems; refine their internal mechanisms; and 
increase their vitality. We should truly strengthen the 
management of state-owned assets, do a good job in appraising 
fixed assets and circulating funds, and ensure that state-owned 
assets maintain and increase their value. We should strictly 
prohibit state-owned assets from being used at a low price as 
company shares, being sold at low prices, or even being given to 
individuals as gifts. 
  We should further straighten out price relationships and 
develop and foster a market system. Over the last decade and 
more, with little social shock, we have basically decontrolled 
commodity prices. Our reform has been successful. This year we 
will also appropriately adjust the prices of grain, cotton, and 
energy in order to rally peasants' production enthusiasm, to 
support the development of the energy industry, and to promote 
the conservation of energy. 
  In carrying out price reform, we should consider 
enterprises' 
and the masses' ability to cope with the consequences. We 
should work positively to make an overall arrangement and 
conduct the work in a positive and steady manner. Governments 
at all levels and relevant social sectors should make joint 
efforts to keep the increase of this year's retail prices within 
10 percent. 
  We should pay special attention to controlling the increase 
in the prices of basic consumer products and in the fees for 
services that are closely related to the masses' daily lives. 
We should continue to implement the major responsibility system 
and ensure the success of the vegetable basket project to 
stabilize non-staple food prices in urban and rural areas. 
  We must deepen the restructuring of the circulatory [liu 
tong] system and expedite the consolidation and development of 
the domestic markets. While continuing to develop and improve 
the commodity markets, we must actively develop the domestic 
production-factors markets, perfect market regulations, improve 
market order, strengthen market management and supervision, and 
protect consumers' legitimate rights and interests by punishing 
according to law all acts of producing or selling counterfeit 
and inferior goods. 
  We must continue to do a good job in restructuring 
government 
institutions and earnestly change government functions. Over 
the past year, the State Council's institutional restructuring 
proceeded quite smoothly. All departments have basically 
completed their assignments of designating responsibilities of 
specific organs and staffing them according to authorized sizes. 
This year, we will continue to work hard to change the 
functions of government departments and improve their working 
efficiency; provincial-level governments should basically 
complete restructuring their organs, and the governments of some 
cities and counties should also start restructuring their 
organs. We must persist in separating the government functions 
from enterprise management, let enterprises handle all the 
affairs within their operating autonomy, and let the market 
solve those problems which it should solve itself. We should 
give full play to the services of intermediary market 
organizations, such as trade associations and chambers of 
commerce, and improve the statistical work and administrative 
and auditing supervision. The government should primarily play 
the role of providing proper macroeconomic regulation and 
control, overall coordination, and social management [she hui 
guan li]. Cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, must 
strive to study market economics and keep abreast with major 
reform projects, policies, laws, and regulations so that they 
can improve their leadership, and take greater initiative and be 
less reckless while doing their work. The State Council has 
decided to set up a state institute of administration to 
intensify the training of medium- and high-ranking public 
functionaries. 
  This year, major strides of reform have been made in 
establishing a socialist market economic structure. To make 
sure that the reform can proceed smoothly, governments at all 
levels must place greater efforts on reform, organize various 
projects meticulously, provide overall coordination, and provide 
reform with guidance through the media as well as by means of 
publicity and education. 
  Fellow deputies: Making greater efforts to build an 
efficient and clean government and fighting all phenomena of 
corruption is a basic task in building our political power and 
an important guarantee for the smooth progress of reform and 
development. Since last year, successes to varying degrees have 
been achieved in fighting corruption and promoting clean 
government with respect to disciplinary actions taken by cadres 
themselves to promote honesty, the major cases that have been 
investigated and handled, and efforts made by various 
professions and trade to stop unhealthy tendencies. During the 
new year, governments at all levels must not in the least 
slacken their efforts in this regard. We must understand the 
urgency, formidability, and complexity of the anticorruption 
struggle; fully depend on the masses; deal with the root causes 
as well as the symptoms; and strive to achieve new success. 
Government functionaries, especially leading cadres at various 
levels, must keep firmly in mind that the power in our hands is 
from the people. Seeking personal benefits by abusing power is 
totally against the objective of the people's government, and it 
is totally incongruous with China's socialist system. 
Introducing the principles for commodity exchange into state 
organs and government activities and trading power for money are 
absolutely not permissible because it is an act which has 
seriously distorted the principles governing socialist market 
economy. 
  We must continue to intensify the crackdown on such serious 
cases as abusing power for personal benefit, corruption, 
bribery, dereliction of duty, and malfeasance, as well as 
smuggling; and we must punish those lawless, undisciplined, and 
corrupt elements according to law. By no means must we tolerate 
them, otherwise we would have abetted them. We must oppose 
extravagance and waste, fraud, formalism, and bureaucratism; and 
firmly stop the unhealthy tendencies in various trades and 
professions. Through deepening reform, we must improve our 
legal system and establish effective supervisory and restraining 
mechanisms so that we can guard against and eliminate corruption 
institutionally. Cadres at all levels must uphold the thinking 
of serving the people wholeheartedly; do their work honestly, 
diligently, and conscientiously with self-discipline; strive to 
improve efficiency, maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the 
masses, and, under the leadership of party committees at all 
levels, carry out this anticorruption struggle, which has a 
close bearing on the state's survival, in a deep-going and 
sustained manner. [applause] 
  IV. Developing Scientific, Technological, Educational, and 
Cultural Undertakings 
  Developing scientific and technological, educational, and 
cultural undertakings and strengthening the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization are important aspects of 
modernization as well as important guarantees for the smooth 
progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
While concentrating on economic construction, we should also 
attach great importance to reform and development in these 
spheres. It is necessary to promote the close integration of 
science and technology with the economy. Science and technology 
is a primary productive force. Economic construction must rely 
on science and technology. Scientific and technological work 
must be geared to the needs of economic construction. This 
year, we will comprehensively implement the Scientific and 
Technological Advancement Law; increase investment in science 
and technology; manage well new- and high-technology industrial 
development zones; transform scientific and technological 
results into practical productive forces; implement the 
principle of holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field 
open; give vigorous support to basic, applied, and new- and 
high-technology research; encourage cooperation between 
scientific and technological development institutes and 
enterprises so that they will compete aggressively on the market 
and enhance their own development vitality. Scientific 
development and application should be focused on equipping all 
sectors of the national economy with advanced technology. In 
particular, we should address such urgent scientific and 
technological problems as developing a high-yield, high-quality, 
and high-efficiency agriculture; bringing about enterprises' 
technical transformation; converting military industrial 
enterprises to civilian production; and assimilating and 
renovating advanced technologies from abroad. Activities in 
ecological innovation and offering rationalization suggestions 
should be extensively conducted among the people. Great efforts 
should be made to foster a technology market, to set up 
intermediate organizations for technological development, and to 
effectively protect intellectual property rights. We should 
concentrate our efforts on managing well the existing state new- 
and high-technology industrial development zones so that they 
will play an exemplary role and create a radiating effect in 
promoting technological progress, transforming traditional 
industries, and developing new industries. 
  This year, in basic, new, and high-technology research, we 
should continue to select and tackle a number of key scientific 
and technological problems that have a profound and far-reaching 
influence on the scientific and technological development of the 
next century. To promote the development of engineering science 
and technology in our country, the State Council has decided to 
establish the China Engineering College, and preparations are 
under way in this respect. We should do a good job of 
educational reform and development. Modernization depends on 
the improvement of people's quality and the training of 
qualified personnel. Governments at all levels should show 
foresight and a sense of urgency, earnestly implement China's 
program for educational reform and development, and give 
strategic consideration to developing education on a priority 
basis. They should quicken the pace of educational reform, 
earnestly increase input in education, strengthen the management 
of educational funds, and promote the development of educational 
services. Governments at all levels should economize in other 
areas and perform some practical deeds for education in every 
possible way. In educational reform, we should focus on 
revamping the educational structure and on improving the quality 
of instruction and the efficiency of running schools. Schools of 
all types should implement the principle of promoting 
development in an all-round way -- morally, intellectually, and 
physically. They should strengthen and improve moral education; 
pay attention to education in national conditions, in the 
prevailing situation, and in our fine traditions; and nurture a 
new type of citizen who has high ideals, moral integrity, better 
education, and a strong sense of discipline. 
  Primary and middle-school education is the basis of 
universal 
education. Basically universalizing nine-year compulsory 
education and basically eradicating illiteracy among young and 
middle-aged people are important tasks for the nineties, which 
must be carried out conscientiously and effectively. We should 
pay attention to admitting into school rural school-age 
children, strive to reduce the school dropout rate, mobilize 
resources in society to carry forward Project Hope, take 
practical measures to lighten students' excessive burdens, and 
change the way students engage in studies for the sole purpose 
of coping with examinations. We should fully inspire the 
initiative of all social sectors to use modern means of 
transmission, such as radio and television, to vigorously 
develop vocational education, adult education, and all types of 
social education; gradually accomplish the goal of providing 
training to people before they are employed and report to duty; 
and train large numbers of professionally trained people and 
skilled workers. In some localities, we should appropriately 
increase the proportion of vocational education in compulsory 
education. In higher education, we should change the system of 
running schools; actively but steadily and properly reform the 
systems of school admissions, fee collection, and employment for 
graduates; readjust the academic disciplines structure; and 
strengthen internal management. Moreover, we should establish a 
number of key institutions of higher education and academic 
disciplines. We should seriously implement the Teachers' Law, 
give full scope to the teacher's role, make great efforts to 
improve teachers' salaries, and foster the good custom of 
respecting teachers and stressing education in all of society. 
  We should actively create an environment and conditions 
favorable to fully exploiting people's talent and to bringing 
out large numbers of qualified people. We should gradually form 
a mechanism to facilitate the rational flow of qualified people; 
integrate the active training of qualified people with the 
rational employment of such people; continue to improve the 
working and living conditions of intellectuals; pay attention to 
training and employing young and middle-aged intellectuals; 
continue the principles of supporting overseas studies, 
encouraging students studying abroad to return to their home 
country, and allowing them to come and go freely; and encourage 
qualified overseas people to serve the motherland through 
various means. 
  We should promote the flourishing of socialist culture. We 
should adhere to the orientation of serving the people and 
socialism and the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom 
and a hundred schools of thought contend; vigorously enhance our 
fine national culture; advance socialist culture with Chinese 
characteristics; and further develop literature, arts, the 
press, publishing, radio, film, television, and other 
undertakings to enrich people's spiritual lives and arouse their 
initiative to plunge themselves into socialist modernization. 
We must actively press ahead with reform of the culture 
management structure, enhance the vitality of cultural 
undertakings to advance, perfect economic policies related to 
culture, and correctly handle the relationship between social 
and economic benefits of spiritual works, placing social 
benefits at the top. Governments at all levels should support 
and help, with due emphasis, those fine literature and art 
creations and public-minded cultural undertakings that need 
support. We must step up the protection of cultural relics; 
attach importance to building libraries, cultural galleries, 
museums, science and technology centers, and archives; 
popularize putonghua [Mandarin]; promote the standardization of 
the written and spoken language; strengthen grass-roots cultural 
work; and do a good job of promoting cultural activities in 
enterprises, campuses, communities, and the vast countryside to 
enliven the cultural life of both urban and rural people. We 
must strengthen the management of cultural markets in accordance 
with the law and use rich, colorful, and healthy spiritual works 
to enliven cultural markets. 
  Develop cultural cooperation and exchanges with the outside 
world. While absorbing the fruits of civilization of all 
countries in the world, we must actively introduce to the world 
the Chinese nation's fine culture. Cultural workers shoulder 
the glorious mission of advancing socialist culture. They 
should go deep among the masses and into reality to publicize in 
a big way the main theme, eulogize advanced figures who work 
hard and keep forging ahead in a pioneering spirit and with 
selfless dedication, and strive to create outstanding works 
which are positive in content; which reflect socialist 
modernization, reform, and opening up; and which are worthy of 
our great times. 
  We will promote public health and physical culture. In 
public health work we should persistently put prevention first. 
This year, we will continue to carry out experiments in the 
reform of the medical insurance system in selected urban areas; 
expand rural cooperative medical services by adopting the method 
of integrating voluntary participation by peasants with mutual 
aid among them; establish a sound three-level health care 
network embracing counties, townships, and villages; stabilize 
the number of medical personnel in rural areas; and realize, 
step by step, the goal of enabling everyone to enjoy primary 
health care. We will attach importance to prevention and 
control of endemic diseases, occupational diseases, and 
infectious diseases which seriously jeopardize people's health; 
and give full play to the advantages of traditional medicine and 
tighten control over the production and sale of pharmaceuticals. 
The masses of medical personnel should provide good-quality 
service by carrying forward the lofty professional ethics of 
healing the wounded and rescuing the dying. 
  We will actively explore ways to reform the management 
system 
of physical culture in the new period and launch extensive mass 
sports activities to improve the people's physical fitness. 
Athletes must work hard to achieve good results at the 12th 
Asian Games and at other international competitions. 
  Deputies, here I want to specially emphasize the necessity 
of 
adhering to the principle of fostering both material progress 
and cultural and ideological progress and of attaching 
importance to both in the entire process of reform, opening to 
the outside world, and the modernization drive, and to 
strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization. 
The building of a socialist spiritual civilization includes 
improvements in the fields of education, science, culture, 
ideology, and ethics, and is embodied in the economic, 
political, and cultural spheres and in social life. It is the 
common duty of all fronts and all departments to strengthen the 
building of a spiritual civilization. In ideological 
construction, we should focus on arming the people of the 
country with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. The publication of 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was 
an important event in the political life in China. We must 
study them conscientiously and implement them in line with 
actual conditions. Comrade Jiang Zemin said: It is necessary 
to arm people with a scientific theory, to guide people with 
correct mass media, to influence people with a noble spirit, and 
to encourage people with outstanding works of literature and 
art. It is necessary to strengthen research in philosophy and 
the social sciences under the guidance of Marxism and Mao Zedong 
Thought; attach importance to the role of philosophy and the 
social sciences; and unremittingly carry out education on 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism. The power of examples 
is inexhaustible. We should vigorously commend heroes and 
models on all fronts, learn from Xu Hongguang's noble spirit of 
daring to take up the cudgels for a just cause and of fearing no 
brute force, as well as his heroic behavior, and publicize this 
Lei Feng spirit in the new period. [applause] We should take 
advantage of political-ideological work to guide people, 
especially the young people, in fostering correct ideals, a 
correct outlook on life, and correct values; strengthen 
education on professional and social ethics; and oppose money 
worship, extreme individualism, and a decadent lifestyle, so as 
to foster good social practice. 
  V. Strengthening the Building of Socialist Democracy and 
the Legal System. 
  Developing socialist democracy and perfecting the socialist 
legal system are important components in building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. This year we will achieve new 
progress, ensure the smooth progress of reform and development, 
and promote all-round social progress. 
  We should continue to strengthen the building of socialist 
democracy. Reform, opening up, and modernization are the 
undertakings of hundreds of millions of people. We must rely 
wholeheartedly on the working class and the broad masses of 
people, fully develop democracy, and bring the initiative of the 
masses into play and successfully protect and guide it. We must 
bring democracy into full play. Governments at all levels must 
establish a sound democratic, scientific, decisionmaking system, 
listen with an open mind to views from all quarters, draw on 
collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas, and constantly 
raise our decisionmaking standards. We must consciously accept 
supervision of the people's congress and its standing committee 
at the corresponding level and supervision by the broad masses 
of people. We must further bring into play the roles of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, democratic 
parties, and nonparty people in political consultation and 
democratic supervision. We must attach importance to the roles 
of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's 
federations, and other mass organizations as bridges and links. 
We must give play to the supervisory role of public opinion, 
attach importance to letters and visits by the masses, and learn 
about grasping people's feelings by opening and unclogging a 
multitude of channels. We must continue to strengthen the 
building of political power at the grass-roots level, perfect 
the democratic management system in enterprises and the urban 
neighborhood and village self- management system, perfect the 
democratic supervision system, and ensure that citizens' 
legitimate rights and interests are not encroached upon. 
  We must attach great importance to building the socialist 
legal system. The establishment and perfection of a socialist 
market economic structure relies on a comprehensive legal system 
to provide a safeguard. Since the start of reform and opening 
up, the NPC and its Standing Committee have speeded up the pace 
of legislation. A large number of important laws have, one 
after another, been promulgated for enforcement to provide a 
legal basis for work in all fields. Governments at all levels 
must learn to use legal means to manage the economy and society. 
All government personnel must conduct official business in 
accordance with the law and resolutely rectify the phenomena 
that laws are ignored or not strictly enforced and that 
law-breaking is not dealt with, so as to safeguard the dignity 
of the law. 
  This year, we will step up the enactment of a number of 
administrative laws, strengthen the building of a 
law-enforcement contingent, raise law enforcement standards, 
strengthen and improve law enforcement supervision, establish 
and develop legal service organizations, and train a large 
number of qualified legal personnel to meet the needs of 
building the legal system. We must continue to conduct in-depth 
education about the legal system and disseminate legal knowledge 
among the entire citizenry, especially among cadres at all 
levels, to improve the sense of the legal system throughout 
society. 
  Conscientiously improving all facets of public security 
represents a strong desire of the people and a major 
responsibility of governments at all levels. It is the 
top-priority task of all law-enforcement departments to maintain 
stable public order this year. We must do our work in four 
areas: 1) Combating various criminal activities that jeopardize 
people's lives, property, and safety, and that disrupt 
modernization, in accordance with the law; 2) investigating and 
sternly dealing with major and important cases, punishing 
economic criminals in accordance with the law, and continuing 
the struggle against smuggling; 3) waging a deep-going struggle 
to ban prostitution, the practice of patronizing prostitutes, 
the abduction and sale of women and children, and drug abuse and 
smuggling; and eliminating the six vices and pornography; 4) 
strengthening the ranks of public security and judicial 
personnel, improving the quality of such personnel, and 
bolstering public security forces. Government at all levels 
should make comprehensive improvement of public order a major, 
regular task and strictly enforce a system of leadership 
responsibility. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on 
dealing with or to launch specific crackdowns on those criminal 
offenses and repulsive social phenomena about which the people 
have complained bitterly. We should properly handle the 
contradictions within the people and mediate civil disputes in a 
timely manner in order to provide against possible trouble. We 
should uphold the principle of integrating specialized 
departments with mass work and enlist the participation of all 
to ensure that measures for comprehensive improvement of public 
order are implemented at the grass-roots level and to create a 
fine social environment conducive to economic construction in 
which the people can live and work in peace and contentment. 
  Fellow depties: China is a unified, multinational country. 
Strengthening national unity is in the interests of people of 
all nationalities in the country, and it is our common 
aspiration. Chairman Mao Zedong once said: The unification of 
our country, the unity of our people, and the unity of our 
various nationalities -- these are the basic guarantees of the 
sure triumph of our cause. Reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive have created a situation never before seen 
in our country for consolidating and developing our socialist 
national relationships in a spirit of equality, unity, and 
mutual assistance, as well as for promoting common prosperity. 
Primarily for historical, geographical, and social reasons, 
certain minority regions are still quite economically 
undeveloped today. It will take more time before we can change 
this situation once and for all. It is the responsibility of 
governments at all levels to expedite the minority regions' 
economic development and social progress, as well as the common 
mission of people of all nationalities in the country. Through 
carrying out reforms and opening up and with state support and 
assistance from economically developed regions, minority regions 
certainly can bring their own strengths into play, become more 
vital in developing their economies, and gradually reduce the 
difference with economically developed regions and achieve 
prosperity with them together. 
  We must comprehensively carry out policies for minority 
nationalities, uphold and improve the system for regional 
national autonomy, safeguard autonomous regions' rights to 
autonomy and national equality, safeguard national unity and our 
motherland's unification, and oppose national division [fan dui 
min zu fen lie]. We must comprehensively and correctly 
implement the policy governing religions, strengthen the 
management of religious affairs according to law, actively guide 
religions to adapt to socialist society, and lead people with 
and without religious beliefs and people of different religious 
denominations to respect each other, get along harmoniously with 
each other, and work hard in unity for the modernization of our 
great socialist motherland. 
  To safeguard our country's security, we must intensify the 
modernization of our national defense. China follows a strategy 
of active defense [ji ji fang yu di zhan lue]. Guided by Mao 
Zedong's Military Thought and Deng Xiaoping Thought for army 
building in the new period [deng xiao ping xin shi qi jun dui 
jian she si xiang], the Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
has strived to make a success of all military construction and 
reform projects and follow the path with Chinese characteristics 
of building crack troops, in light of the general requirement 
put forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin that the PLA must be 
politically qualified, militarily toughened, remarkable in work 
style, strict in discipline, and assured of adequate logistical 
support. The PLA must vigorously carry forward the fine 
traditions of the People's Army, intensify its ideological and 
political work, and firmly attend to military training so as to 
strengthen its capacity for fighting battles and defending the 
country in modern warfare. The PLA must also actively support 
reform, opening up, and local economic construction. 
Governments at all levels must be concerned with national 
defense construction and give the military the support it needs 
to accomplish its missions. We must persistently educate the 
people on national defense so as to heighten the whole nation's 
awareness of national defense. It is necessary to extensively 
carry out activities of supporting the government and cherishing 
the people and of supporting the Army, giving preferential 
treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, and 
safeguard soldiers' legitimate rights and interests in order to 
consolidate and develop army-government and army-people unity. 
Earnest efforts must be made to improve the militia and reserve 
service, build stronger reserve forces, and build a stronger 
people's armed police and public security forces so as to 
safeguard national security and social stability. 
  VI. Actively Promote the Motherland's Peaceful 
Reunification. 
  In the new year, we should continue to follow unswervingly 
the policy of peaceful reunification and "one country, two 
systems," and work actively to promote the great cause of 
reunifying the motherland. 
  The day is drawing near when China will resume its exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. The Chinese Government 
will, as always, go on preparing for a smooth transfer of 
government and a smooth transition in both places, in accordance 
with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [HKSAR], the Basic Law of the Macao Special 
Administrative Region, and relevant resolutions of the NPC and 
its Standing Committee. China and Portugal have cooperated well 
on the question of Macao. However, the talks between the 
representatives of the Chinese Government and the British 
Government on arrangements for 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong 
have terminated, the responsibility of which rests completely 
with the British side. 
  In accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the 
decision of the NPC Standing Committee, the Preliminary Working 
Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region has begun its work. The PWC's 
work is demanding and its responsibility heavy. It is hoped 
that the PWC will live up to the expectations and trust of the 
whole nation by uniting with Hong Kong compatriots on the 
broadest possible basis and doing good preparatory work for the 
first government and legislature of the HKSAR. [applause] 
  The Chinese Government and people have the determination and 
ability to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 
schedule and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and 
prosperity. British colonial rule in Hong Kong will soon come 
to an end, and cannot be stopped by any forces. [applause] 
  As a result of the coordinated efforts of people on both 
sides of the strait, cross-strait economic cooperation and trade 
grew continuously and personnel exchanges and exchanges in the 
fields of culture, science, technology, sports, and so forth 
further increased last year. A preliminary understanding was 
reached in talks of a functional nature. We maintain that, 
under the principle of one China, differences between the two 
sides of the strait should be settled through increased 
contacts and consultations. It is the common aspiration of all 
Chinese people to realize the peaceful reunification of the 
motherland, and any act or attempt of secession, no matter in 
what form, runs counter to the fundamental interests of the 
Chinese nation and will be in vain. We place high hopes on the 
Taiwan authorities and still higher hopes on the people of 
Taiwan. We hope the Taiwan side will attach great importance to 
the overall interests of the nation and join us in developing 
relations across the strait and working for the peaceful 
reunification of the motherland. 
  VII. On Diplomatic Work. 
  The world today is in the process of complicated and 
profound 
changes. The world is moving noticeably toward multipolarity. 
In general, the international situation is becoming more 
relaxed, and development is now a more prominent issue. 
Economics is becoming a dominant factor in the development of 
international relations. Peoples around the world share a common 
aspiration for the relaxation of tensions, cooperation, 
development, and progress. However, the world is far from 
tranquil. Many regions are in turmoil or suffering from endless 
war and chaos. Hegemonism and power politics remain. The major 
tasks for the international community are still to maintain 
world peace and promote economic development. In this 
complicated and changing international situation, China has 
unswervingly pursued an independent foreign policy of peace and 
has made fresh progress in its diplomatic work. It has 
continuously expanded its friendly relations and cooperation 
with other countries, and its international prestige has 
steadily grown. It has played an important role in maintaining 
world peace and promoting economic development. We have friends 
all over the globe. 
  China has further strengthened good-neighborly and friendly 
relations with surrounding countries. China's relations with 
the ROK and the DPRK have continued to grow. China's mutually 
beneficial and cooperative relations with Japan, Russia, and the 
ROK have expanded continuously. Meanwhile, our friendly 
relations and cooperation with other Asian nations, as well as 
developing countries in Africa, Latin America, and the South 
Pacific region have also developed further. Relations between 
China and the West European countries and the European Community 
have further improved. Sino-German relations have entered a new 
stage of development and a new chapter has been opened in 
Sino-French relations. There are broad prospects for economic 
cooperation and trade between China and the West European 
countries, and so long as the two sides work hard together, 
bilateral relations between China and each of the West European 
countries will continue to be consolidated and to grow. The 
maintenance of normal and stable Sino-U.S. relations not only 
accords with the vital interests of the two people but also 
benefits the stability and development of the Asia-Pacific 
region and the world as a whole. We should consider Sino-U.S. 
relations from a global perspective, looking beyond this 
century. We stand for resolving differences on the basis of 
mutual respect and through dialogue. Sino-U.S. relations will 
be improved and expanded continually so long as the various 
principles laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques 
are strictly observed to increase trust, reduce trouble, develop 
cooperation, and avoid confrontation. 
  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has 
actively participated in international affairs and played a 
positive role in such matters as settling international disputes 
through peaceful means, protecting the environment, and 
promoting social progress. 
  The Fourth World Women's Congress will be convened in 
Beijing 
in 1995. The Chinese Government and people are preparing for 
this event. China stands for expanded economic cooperation and 
trade among nations and for enhanced south-south cooperation and 
north-south dialogue. It advocates the complete prohibition and 
destruction of all weapons of mass destruction, including 
nuclear weapons, proposes that all nuclear powers conclude a 
treaty undertaking not to be the first to use nuclear weapons 
and, supports the effort to conclude a comprehensive nuclear 
test ban treaty through negotiations. China does not engage in 
the arms race, nor does it participate in any military bloc or 
seek a sphere of influence. It supports the idea of conducting 
dialogues on matters of security and cooperation in Asia and the 
Pacific and has made contributions to that end. 
  No matter how the world situation changes, China will not 
swerve from its position of upholding the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence, nor will it change its policy of 
developing friendly relations and cooperation with countries of 
the world and strengthening solidarity and cooperation with the 
vast number of developing countries. Ours is a diversified 
world. It is essential to recognize the differences among 
nations in their social systems, ideologies, cultures, 
traditions, national characteristics, and religious beliefs, to 
respect each other, cooperate with each other for their mutual 
benefit, and develop state-to-state relations on the basis of 
the universally recognized norms of international relations. 
  China attaches importance to human rights and is willing to 
participate, on an equal footing, in discussions on the human 
rights issue in the international community. However, we will 
by no means allow anyone to interfere in China's internal 
affairs under any pretense. [applause] 
  The Chinese Government supports a resolution recently 
adopted 
by the UN Commission on Human Rights denouncing certain 
countries for putting pressure on developing countries in this 
regard. 
  Deputies, I would like to tell you a news dispatch we have 
just received. In a vote yesterday evening by the UN Commission 
on Human Rights, an anti-China motion raised by some countries 
met with failure once again. [applause] 
  This fully demonstrates how unpopular it is to use the human 
rights issue to oppose China. Here, on behalf of the Chinese 
Government and people, I would like to express my heartfelt 
thanks to all countries which upheld justice and supported 
China. [applause] 
  China is against hegemonism in any form. China is not 
seeking hegemony now, and it will not seek hegemony in the 
future when its economy is developed. China will never be a 
threat to any country or region and will always be a reliable 
force for the preservation of regional and world peace. The 
Chinese people will continue to work hard together with all 
other peoples around the world to establish a new international 
political and economic order that is just and reasonable, to 
maintain world peace, and to promote common development. 
[applause] 
  Deputies, to build a strong China and bring prosperity to 
the 
people is the common aspiration of people of all nationalities 
across the country. The current situation is excellent and we 
have a rare opportunity. In the new year, we should, under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, 
unswervingly carry out the party's basic line, strengthen the 
great unity of people of all nationalities across the country, 
and work hard together with one heart and one mind to win a 
fresh victory in the reform, opening up, and modernization 
drive. [applause]

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- China enjoyed economic 
growth, political stability, unity among the nationalities and 
social progress in a turbulent and volatile international 
environment and amid a worldwide economic recession in 1993, 
Premier Li Peng said here today. 
  In his report on government work delivered to the current 
session of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li Peng 
reviewed China's achievements in reform, opening to the outside 
world and modernization drive last year. 
  In 1993 China's economy continued to expand vigorously. The 
gross domestic product exceeded three trillion yuan, 
representing an increase of 13.4 percent over the 1992 figure. 
Good harvests were reaped and the added value of agricultural 
output increased by four percent. Except for a drop in the 
output of cotton and sugar-yielding crops, the output of major 
farm products increased considerably. The added value of 
industrial output increased by 21.1 percent, and the output of 
major industrial products rose enormously. 
  He said the domestic market was brisk, the pattern of 
investment improved, more funds were used on key projects and 
the construction of projects in energy, transport and 
telecommunications advanced apace. 
  In view of the conspicuous contradictions and problems that 
cropped up in the course of rapid economic growth, the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council took 
prompt macro-control measures to restore financial order, 
stabilize the economy and maintain sound development. This 
created the necessary conditions for sustained development and 
smooth progress of the reform in the present year and also 
helped accumulate valuable experience in exercising 
macro-control under conditions of a socialist market economy. 
  Referring to the progress of economic restructuring last 
year, Li said China deepened the reform of enterprises, 
continuing to concentrate on changing the way they operate and 
gradually giving them more decision-making power. The 
state-owned and collectively owned economic sectors developed, 
and so did the privately owned sector and the sector with 
foreign investment, Li Peng noted. 
  China rationalized price relations and for the most part, 
lifted controls over the purchasing and selling prices of grain. 
China accelerated the development of markets for the basic 
means of production, including capital, labor, land, technology 
and information. China has also drawn up plans for reform of 
finance, taxation, banking, investment and foreign trade and 
began to implement them smoothly. 
  Over the last year the country continued to open wider to 
the 
outside world. Foreign trade expanded in all fields, with the 
volume of imports and exports increased by 18.2 per cent over 
the 1992 figure. 
  Achievements were scored in the fields of science and 
technology, education, sports, literature and art, the press and 
publishing, radio, film and television, social sciences, public 
health, pharmaceutical production, family planning, 
environmental protection and the prevention and control of 
natural disasters. Further efforts were made to improve the 
comprehensive management of public security. Achievements were 
also scored in national defense. Socialist cultural and 
ideological progress were promoted and socialist democracy and 
the legal system improved. 
  He pointed out the living standards of urban and rural 
people 
continued to improve after allowing for price rises. Last year 
the average income of city dwellers per capita increased by 10.2 
percent over the 1992 figure. The average per capita income of 
people in the countryside increased by 3.2 percent. Consumption 
level of both city and country people rose steadily, and their 
cultural life was continually enriched. 
  In his report, Li Peng also mentioned the major 
contradictions and problems in the midst of progress, such as 
excessive investment in fixed assets, a fairly sharp rise in 
prices, irrational economic structure, and some state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises having difficulties with 
production and operation. 
  In some areas public order is poor, and not enough has been 
done to combat social evils. The corrupt practices of a few 
government functionaries, such as embezzlement, fraud, accepting 
bribes and bending the law for personal gains, and formalism and 
bureaucratism in government organs have impaired the close ties 
between the government and the people. The party central 
committee and the State Council regard these as serious problems 
and are making every effort to solve them, Li said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng stressed today the importance of correctly handling 
relations among reform, economic development and social 
stability. 
  "Economic development is the center of all our work, reform 
and opening up are the motive force of development, and 
development and reform are the foundation of long-term social 
and political stability in China; and social stability, in turn, 
is a prerequisite for economic development and smooth progress 
in reform," the premier said. 
  Li expounded the relationship in his report on government 
work which he delivered at the first meeting of the Second 
Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). 
  The premier said that China is now presented with a rare 
historical opportunity and that the work of governments at all 
levels should be subordinate to and serve the endeavor of 
seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening China wider to 
the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining social 
stability. 
  Li called on governments at all levels "to do a good job in 
every field of endeavor, identify and solve problems promptly 
and ensure that reform, development and stability are 
coordinated and promote each other." Only by so doing, he said, 
can China win one victory after another in its drive for 
socialist modernization.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
has set the growth rate of China's GDP for 1994 at nine per 
cent, Premier Li Peng said here today. 
  "It is an appropriate speed after the country's GDP has 
increased by 13 per cent for two consecutive years," he said. 
"It would be an outstanding achievement if we can keep the GDP 
growing at eight or nine per cent for a few more years." 
  Delivering a government work report at the National People's 
Congress today, Premier Li stressed China will make its best to 
maintain a vigorous and steady growth rate. Local authorities 
should set reasonable growth rates for their respective 
economies in accordance with their own conditions and not vie 
with each other or concentrate exclusively on raising output 
value. 
  On principles for economic work this year, Li Peng said, 
China will carry out reform in depth.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- China will try to 
achieve substantial progress in restructuring the economy in 
1994 by making some breakthroughs in some areas while pressing 
ahead with the whole project of establishing a socialist market 
economy. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng made this remark today in his 
government work report to the second session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress, which opened here today. 
  According to the premier, the economic restructuring this 
year mainly covers the reform of finance and taxation systems, 
banking system, the changing of the operating mechanism for 
state-owned enterprises with a view to establishing a modern 
enterprise system, and the pricing system. 
  The implementation of the plan for the reform of finance and 
taxation system is aiming at rationalizing the distribution of 
revenues between the central and local authorities and between 
the state and enterprises, Li Peng said. Li defined the plan as 
feasible because it provides for a gradual increase in the 
financial resources of the central authorities and at the same 
time takes into full consideration the interests of local 
authorities and enterprises, thus encouraging both central and 
local initiative. 
  Governments at all levels should take the interests of the 
whole into account and ensure that the plan for reform is 
carried out smoothly. 
  The steady reform of the banking system aims to establish a 
strong macro-control system under which the central bank 
regulates the supply of currency and stabilizes its value. In 
addition, Li added, the functions of commercial banks should be 
separated from those of non-commercial ones. In this aspect, 
the government is to establish the National Development Bank, 
the Import-Export Bank of China and the Agricultural Development 
Bank of China. The special state banks should be changed 
gradually into commercial state banks. 
  Early this year China unified its official rate of exchange 
of RMB with the market rate. Li Peng called for strict control 
over total income for exports and outgo for imports and over 
international repayments of capital to prevent loss of foreign 
exchange. The People's Bank of China should tighten its control 
over the market, facilitating buying and selling, regulating the 
supply of foreign exchange when necessary and preventing drastic 
fluctuations in the rates. 
  According to Li Peng, the government is currently in 
financial straits and it will take a certain amount of time to 
alleviate the difficulties. This year there is still a fairly 
large deficit in the central budget as the government has to 
repay both capital and interest on many domestic and external 
debts, lighten financial burden on state enterprises, carry out 
price reform and increase wages. However, he noted, the deficit 
of the central government would be made up by issuing bonds 
instead of overdrawing on the bank again. "This year we will 
try not to issue too much currency and credit, so as to prevent 
investment from swelling," Li added. 
  Referring to the pricing reform, Li Peng said that this year 
the prices of grain, cotton and energy will be adjusted to 
rationalize price relations. In reforming the pricing system, 
the government should take into full consideration the tolerance 
capacities of the state, enterprises and the masses, make an 
overall plan and carry it out steadily. 
  He stated that governments at all levels and relevant 
sectors 
of society should make joint efforts to keep retail prices from 
rising more than 10 percent; in particular, they should try to 
control the rise of prices for basic consumer goods and services 
that are closely related to the well-being of the people. 
  The reform of state-owned enterprises is the central and 
most 
difficult task in the reform of the economic structure, Li Peng 
said. The fundamental way to reinvigorate state enterprises is 
to deepen the reform, change the way they operate and establish 
a modern enterprise system, under which the property rights and 
responsibilities of the enterprises are clearly defined, the 
functions of the government are separated from those of the 
enterprises and the enterprises are managed in a scientific way. 
  On reforming the structure of government institutions and 
changing their functions, Li Peng said the State Council this 
year will introduce the system of public service, further alter 
the functions of government institutions and raise their 
efficiency. At the same time, institutional restructuring will 
be completed in most provincial governments and started in a 
number of county governments. 
  To carry on the struggle against corruption for a long time 
to come is a matter of life and death for the nation and an 
important means of guaranteeing the smooth advance of reform and 
economic development, Li Peng said. 
  Government functionaries should bear in mind that the abuse 
of the power in their hands for personal gains is diametrically 
opposed, Li concluded.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng today emphasized the importance of reforming and developing 
undertakings for science and technology, education and culture. 
  Delivering a government work report to the Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress here today, Li Peng said 
that while closely integrating science and technology with the 
economy, this year it is imperative to fully enforce the 
scientific and technological advances law and increase 
investment in this field, make a success of the areas that set 
aside for developing industries that use high and new 
technologies, and turn research results into commercial products 
as soon as possible. 
  "We should energetically support researches on both basic 
and 
applied sciences and researches on high and new technologies, 
and encourage institutes of science and technology to associate 
with enterprises," Li said. 
  "In our effort to develop science and technology and apply 
research results, we should focus on equipping all sectors of 
the economy with advanced technologies. In particular, we 
should address such urgent problems as developing a highly 
efficient agriculture that provides greater and better yields, 
updating enterprises, converting defense industries to civilian 
production, and assimilating and improving upon advanced 
technologies from abroad," he added. 
  Great efforts should be made to foster markets for 
technology, to set up intermediate organizations for 
technological development and to protect intellectual property 
rights. 
  In researches on basic science and on high and new 
technologies, this year the country will select a number of key 
projects that can exert a far-reaching influence on advances in 
the next century and organize people to undertake them. The 
State Council has decided to establish the Chinese Academy of 
Engineering. 
  On educational reform, the premier said that emphasis should 
be placed on adjusting the educational structure, improving 
instruction and raising the overall efficiency of schools. 
  An important task that must be successfully accomplished in 
the 1990s is to make nine-year compulsory education universal 
and to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. 
  Li Peng also elaborated on primary and secondary education, 
vocational education, adult education and higher education. 
  In his report, the premier reiterated that continued efforts 
should be made to improve the working and living conditions of 
intellectuals, to train and employ young and middle-aged 
intellectuals and to implement the policy of permitting people 
to study abroad, encouraging them to return home and allowing 
them to come and go freely, and encouraging capable Chinese 
living abroad to serve the motherland in various ways. 
  Speaking on development of cultural undertakings, Li Peng 
said that more attention should be paid to the social benefits 
and consequences of cultural products than to their economic 
returns. 
  "We should tighten control over markets for cultural 
products, in accordance with the law, and provide them with 
varied and healthy cultural products," Li said. 
  Li emphasized that throughout the whole process of reform, 
the opening up and the modernization drive, it is necessary to 
give equal importance to economic development and development of 
socialist culture and ideology. 
  In his report the premier also stressed the promotion of 
public health and sports.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- No matter what 
happens, the Chinese Government and people are determined and 
able to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as 
scheduled and to ensure long-term stability and prosperity 
there, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today. 
  Delivering his government work report at the second session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li said that British 
colonial rule in Hong Kong is coming to an end and that no force 
can stop that. 
  The day is drawing near when China will resume its exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, he said. As it has 
been doing all along, the Chinese Government will go on 
preparing for a smooth transition and smooth transfer of 
government in both places, in accordance with the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Basic Law of 
the Macao Special Administrative Region and relevant resolutions 
of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, 
the premier said. 
  Li noted China and Portugal have cooperated well on the 
question of Macao. However, talks between the representatives 
of the Chinese Government and the British Government on 
arrangements for 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong have 
terminated, a consequence for which the British side must bear 
full responsibility. 
  In accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and the decision of the Standing Committee 
of the National People's Congress, he said, the preliminary 
working committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region has begun its work. Li urged the 
preliminary working committee to unite with Hong Kong 
compatriots on the broadest basis and do good preparatory work 
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its first 
government and legislature. 
  In the part of his report subtitled "Promoting the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Motherland," Li said China shall follow 
unswervingly the principle of "peaceful reunification and one 
country, two systems." 
  After reviewing the progress of relations between the two 
sides across the Taiwan Straits, Li Peng said, "we maintain that 
differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits should 
be settled through increased contacts and consultations." 
  "It is the common aspiration of all the Chinese people to 
achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland, any act or 
attempted act of secession, no matter in what form, will be in 
vain," he said. 
  Li Peng said, "we place high hopes on the Taiwan authorities 
and still higher hopes on the people of Taiwan. We hope the 
Taiwan side will attach great importance to the overall 
interests of the nation and join us in developing relations 
across the straits and working for peaceful reunification."

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said today that no matter how the international arena 
changes, China will uphold the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence and develop friendly relations and cooperation with 
the rest of the world. 
  Li Peng made the remark here while delivering a government 
work report to the annual session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress. 
  China will always be a reliable force for the preservation 
of 
regional and world peace and will never seek hegemony, Li added. 
  In his report, the premier elaborated on the current 
international situation, the relationship between China and 
other countries and China's principled stands on many major 
international issues. 
  On the international situation, Li Peng said that the world 
is moving increasingly towards multipolarity. In general, the 
international situation is becoming more relaxed, and 
development is now a more prominent issue. Economic interest is 
becoming a primary consideration in international relations. 
Peoples around the world share a common aspiration for the 
relaxation of tensions, cooperation, development and progress. 
  However, the world is far from tranquil. The major tasks for 
the international community are still to maintain world peace 
and promote economic development, Li added. 
  He said, "in this complicated and changing international 
situation, China has unswervingly pursued an independent foreign 
policy of peace and has made fresh progress in its diplomatic 
work. It has continuously expanded its friendly relations and 
cooperation with other countries, and its prestige has steadily 
grown. It has played an important role in maintaining world 
peace and promoting economic development." 
  Recalling the further strengthened good-neighborly relations 
with surrounding countries, the premier said the friendship 
between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has 
grown. The mutually beneficial cooperation with Japan, Russia 
and the Republic of Korea has been steadily expanded. China has 
also made new progress in its relations with countries in 
Southeast, South and Central Asia. 
  At the same time, Li said, China's friendly relations and 
cooperation with other Asian countries and with the great number 
of developing countries in Africa, Latin America and the South 
Pacific have developed further. 
  Li Peng said that relations between China and the West 
European countries and the European Community have again been 
improved. Sino-German relations have entered a new stage of 
development and a new chapter has been opened in Sino-French 
relations. There are broad prospects for economic cooperation 
and trade between China and the west European countries, and so 
long as the two sides work together, bilateral relations between 
China and each of those countries will continue to grow. 
  Normal and stable relations between China and the United 
States not only serve the fundamental interests of the two 
peoples but also contribute to peace and stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large, Li Peng said. 
  He said, "we should consider these relations from a global 
perspective, looking beyond this century. We maintain that 
differences should be settled through dialogue on the basis of 
mutual respect. So long as the principles stipulated in the 
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques are strictly abided by and 
efforts are made to enhance confidence, reduce trouble, expand 
cooperation and avoid confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will 
continue to improve and expand." 
  As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Li Peng 
said, China has actively participated in international affairs 
and played a positive role in such matters as settling 
international disputes through peaceful means, protecting the 
environment and promoting social progress. 
  China stands for expanded economic cooperation and trade, 
enhanced South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue. It 
advocates the complete prohibition and destruction of all 
weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, proposes 
that all nuclear powers conclude a treaty undertaking not to be 
the first to use such weapons and supports the effort to 
conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty through negotiations, 
Li Peng said. 
  China does not engage in the arms race, nor does it 
participate in any military bloc or seek a sphere of influence. 
It supports the idea of conducting dialogues on matters of 
security and cooperation in Asia and the Pacific and has made 
contributions to that end. 
  Li Peng pointed out that no matter how the international 
arena changes, China will not swerve from its position of 
upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence, nor will 
it change its policy of developing friendly relations and 
cooperation with other developing countries. 
  "Ours is a diversified world. It is essential for countries 
to recognize the differences in their social systems, 
ideologies, cultures, traditions, national characteristics and 
religious beliefs, to respect each other, cooperate with each 
other for their mutual benefit and develop state-to-state 
relations on the basis of the universally recognized norms. 
  On human rights issue, Li said China values human rights and 
is willing to discuss the matter with other members of the 
international community on the basis of mutual equality. 
However, it will never allow anyone to interfere in its 
internal affairs under any pretext. The Chinese Government 
supports the latest resolution adopted by the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights denouncing certain countries for 
putting pressure on the developing countries in this regard. 
  He said the Chinese people will continue to work together 
with all other peoples around the world to establish a new 
international political order and a new international economic 
order that are just and equitable, to maintain world peace and 
to promote common development.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Delivering his 
government work report at a plenary session of the National 
People's Congress (NPC) here this morning, Chinese Premier Li 
Peng announced that the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights has just rejected an anti- China motion. 
  "This shows that to attack China by using the human rights 
issue is unpopular," he said, to a thunderous applause from the 
NPC deputies. 
  The premier said, "deputies, I would like to tell you a 
just- 
received news dispatch. In a vote yesterday evening by the U.N. 
Human Rights Commission, an anti-China motion raised by some 
countries met with failure once again. This shows convincingly 
that it is unpopular to attack China by using the human rights 
issue. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all 
justice- upholding countries for their support to China on 
behalf of the Chinese Government and people." 
  The premier said, "China values human rights and is willing 
to discuss the matter with other members of the international 
community on the basis of mutual equality." 
  "However, it will never allow anyone to interfere in its 
internal affairs under any pretext," he said. 
  The Chinese Government supports a latest resolution adopted 
by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights denouncing certain 
countries for putting pressure on developing countries in this

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said that China will maintain its economic growth momentum 
in 1994, a crucial year for the country's economic reforms. 
  The central government has set the growth rate of China's 
national economy in 1994 at nine percent, he said. 
  In his 16,000-word report on government work he delivered 
today at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress (NPC), the premier called for a good handling of 
relations among reform, economic development and social 
stability. 
  Li's government work report consists of seven parts. They 
are: a review of 1993 domestic work and basic principles for 
work in 1994; maintaining a steady, rapid and sound development 
of the national economy; speeding up the establishment of a 
socialist market economy; expanding scientific and technological 
undertakings and promoting education and culture; strengthening 
socialist democracy and the legal system; actively promoting the 
peaceful reunification of China; and diplomatic work. 
  The government work report devotes two-fifths of its length 
to economic work and reform in 1994. 
  On economic work in 1994, according to Li Peng, the 
government will: deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic controls, restructure the 
economy, promote technological progress, explore new markets, 
improve economic efficiency, keep inflation under control, and 
maintain a sustainable, rapid and [word indistinct] of the 
economy. 
  Li Peng said that the planned 1994 growth rate of nine 
percent for the national economy is realistic given the fact 
that the country has seen a growth rate of 13 percent in the 
past two consecutive years. 
  The premier reiterated the fundamental status of agriculture 
in the economy. He called for continued implementation of 
existing rural policies, deepening rural reform, solving 
problems that arise in the process of rural economic 
development, and trying every means possible to boost the income 
of farmers. 
  Li emphasized the importance of improving transport and 
manufacturing industries, especially in terms of the management 
and production of large- and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises, saying this is of vital importance for a sustained 
development of the national economy. 
  Noting that some large- and medium-sized state enterprises 
have a rough time nowadays, Li called for all social quarters to 
take positive measures to help them solve their problems. 
  Li stressed that investment should be maintained at a 
rational scale, urging all localities and government departments 
to devote their funds and materials preferentially to key 
projects now under construction in the sectors of 
transportation, telecommunications, energy, essential raw 
materials and the harnessing of large rivers and lakes. He said 
that the government encourages coastal areas to invest in 
central and western parts of the country. To rein in the 
investment scale, the premier said, the central government will 
not approve the establishment of any new economic development 
zones in 1994. 
  On the country's open policy, Li said that attention should 
be paid to making existing open areas perform better, which 
include special economic zones, Shanghai's Pudong, open coastal 
cities and regions, and economic and technological development 
zones. Major cities along the country's borders, along the 
Chang Jiang River and in the country's hinterland should be 
opened wider to the rest of the world, he said. 
  The premier in his report expounded China's reform measures 
in 1994, which have attracted wide attention at home and abroad. 
Li called the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) "a 
common program of action for continued in-depth reforms," which 
he said has served as an overall blueprint for the establishment 
of a socialist market economy in China. 
  This year's reform, which will combine breakthroughs in key 
areas with overall progress, is expected to score substantial 
progress in restructuring the economy, he said. 
  The government report dwells on taxation and finance reform, 
establishment of a modern enterprise system, rationalization of 
price relations and reform of the government structure. 
  Talking about financial difficulties faced by the 
government, 
Li said that deficit of the central government will be made up 
by issuing bonds instead of overdrawing on the bank again; the 
central bank will regulate money supply and stabilize the value 
of the yuan; and the government will keep inflation for the 
whole of 1994 under ten percent. 
  Li said that science and technology should be integrated 
closely with the economy and that reform of the education system 
should be accelerated with more fund to be put into education. 
He urged people to develop socialist culture and pay more 
attention to the social benefits and consequences of cultural 
products than to their economic returns. 
  New achievements should be made in developing socialist 
democracy and strengthening the legal system so as to ensure a 
smooth progression of economic reform, a healthy economic 
development and an all-round social progress, he said. 
  Li said that the most important task for public security, 
procuratorial and judicial organs this year is to maintain 
public order. He said that the government will continue to 
crack down on crimes and social evils. Fights against special 
types of crime will be combined with anti-crime campaigns, he 
said. 
  The last two parts of Li's government work report deal with 
the principles of peaceful reunification of China and "one 
country, two systems," and China's independent diplomatic policy 
of peace.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
has set the growth rate of China's GDP [gross domestic product] 
for 1994 at nine per cent, Premier Li Peng said here today. 
  "It is an appropriate speed after the country's GDP has 
increased by 13 per cent for two consecutive years," he said. 
"It would be an outstanding achievement if we can keep the GDP 
growing at eight or nine per cent for a few more years." 
  Delivering a government work report at the National People's 
Congress today, Premier Li stressed China will make its best to 
maintain a vigorous and steady growth rate. Local authorities 
should set reasonable growth rates for their respective 
economies in accordance with their own conditions and not vie 
with each other or concentrate exclusively on raising output 
value. 
  On principles for economic work this year, Li Peng said, 
China will carry out reform in depth and width, open wider, 
strengthen macroeconomic controls, vigorously readjust its 
economic structure, promote technological progress, open more 
markets, improve economic performance, curb inflation, and 
maintain a steady, rapid and sound development of its national 
economy. 
  He called for strengthening agriculture as the economic 
base, 
developing the rural economy in an all-round way, encouraging 
further development of rural enterprises, and increasing 
peasants' income. 
  The central government, Li Peng said, will adopt the 
following measures to support agricultural development and 
protect peasant's interests: to raise the purchasing prices of 
grain and cotton; increase investment in agriculture by both the 
central and local governments; stabilize grain prices; assist 
500 counties that are large producers of commercial grain, 150 
counties that are large producers of quality cotton, and a 
number of demonstration areas that are engaged in developing a 
highly efficient type of farming that provides greater and 
better yields; and continue to support the development of 
township and village enterprises, especially in central and 
western regions. 
  Li Peng said it is an objective requirement and inevitable 
trend of economic development for surplus labor to shift from 
farming to non-agricultural occupations and to move from one 
place to another in a rational manner. "We should provide 
guidance for such shifts, strengthen their management and 
organize them in a systematic way." 
  To ensure a sustained development of the national economy, 
Li 
said, it is important to improve transportation and 
manufacturing industries with priority given to large and 
medium-sized state enterprises. 
  The State Council has decided that, starting from this year, 
state enterprises will be exempt from payment of energy and 
transportation development funds and from payment of budget 
regulatory funds, and that special funds will be allocated for 
the reorganization of bankrupt enterprises and the resettlement 
of their workers and administrative staff, he said. 
  He noted that an important condition for maintaining 
economic 
stability and continued development is that investment must be 
controlled at a rational scale. Since enough construction 
projects are under way and considerable investment is planned 
for this year, no further expansion will be permitted. "With 
regard even to basic industries and infrastructural projects, we 
should not undertake more than we can afford," he said. 
  All local authorities and departments should make rational 
arrangements for the use of financial and material resources. 
Projects to be supported should be selected on the basis of 
overall national interest. First should come projects already 
under construction in transportation, telecommunications, energy 
and important raw materials sectors, and key projects for 
harnessing big rivers and lakes. 
  No approval will be given this year to the establishment of 
any new development areas. Henceforth no capital construction 
projects will be launched unless they meet certain conditions. 
  On open policy implementation, Premier Li Peng said 
attention 
should be paid to improving the performance of existing open 
areas -- special economic zones, Shanghai's Pudong, open coastal 
cities and regions, and economic and technological development 
zones. "At the same time, we should open wider major cities 
along borders, along the Chang Jiang River and in the interior, 
and improve our work in these places," he said. 
  "To maintain and expand foreign investment influx, we should 
further better the environment for such investment and improve 
related laws and regulations. We should protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of enterprises with exclusive foreign 
investment and use the government's industrial policies to 
channel such investment into basic industries and 
infrastructure," he said. 
  Li said China will continue to raise the people's living 
standards and improve housing conditions on the basis of 
economic [passage missing] 
  He said it is necessary to keep to the policy of encouraging 
some areas and individuals to prosper first through honest work 
and encouraging them to help others do so, in order to gradually 
achieve common prosperity. "At the same time, we should 
exercise necessary regulations over extremely sharp income 
disparities by way of rational wealth distribution and taxation 
policies," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, shook hands 
with Vice President Rong Yiren as soon as he entered a lounge in 
the Great Hall of the People shortly before the current session 
of the National People's Congress opened this morning. 
  Qiao sat down beside Mr. Ann Tse-kai, a vice chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He asked whether Mr. Ann is 
used to living in Beijing after coming from Hong Kong. 
  Qiao began talking with Ann about the issue of resuming 
China's sovereignty over Hong Kong. "Our stand has been 
consistent on the Hong Kong question," he said. 
  "The British side should be held entirely responsible for 
the 
breakdown of the Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong question," 
Qiao said. 
  "We shall never waver in our determination to resume China's 
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997," he said. 
  Speaking of the current NPC session, Qiao Shi pledged to 
speed up legislation, tighten supervision over government work 
and standardize a socialist market economic structure. 
  At 8:50 A.M., President Jiang Zemin entered the lounge and 
sat down beside Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee. The two leaders talked about how to promote 
ideological and cultural progress in China. 
  They were soon joined by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen, who told president Jiang: "The United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights has voted down an anti-China motion 
raised by some countries." 
  Jiang said, "It is unpopular to attack China by using the 
human rights issue. We should justly and forcefully refute such 
attacks." 
  Premier Li Peng, who had just come in, said, "I'm going to 
state our stand on this matter in the government work report." 
  President Jiang said: "Right!" Speaking of the current NPC 
session, Jiang said, "At present the overall situation in China 
is excellent. All major policies and principles have been 
formulated. The key to success lies in earnest, concerted 
endeavors by people of all nationalities." 
  Shortly before leaving for the rostrum to deliver his 
government work report, premier Li Peng told reporters that Deng 
Xiaoping has always advocated concise, pragmatic reports. 
  "This year's government work report highlights reform, 
economic development and social stability," he said. 
  "I hope that, during the current session, NPC deputies and 
CPPCC National Committee members will speak their minds and air 
their views on how to revise my report," he said. 
  The premier was joined by Li Ruihuan, who said: "Reform 
serves as the motive force, development is our goal and 
stability is a prerequisite." 
  "So long as we correctly handle relations between reform, 
development and stability, and work hard and in unity, we will 
be invincible," he added.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Li Anding (2621 1344 1353) and Wu Ming </F>
(0702 2494)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhou Jue, spokesman for 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC], held the first news briefing at the Great Hall of the 
People today during which time he briefed approximately 1,000 
Chinese and foreign correspondents on the Second Session of the 
Eighth NPC scheduled to open tomorrow. 
  Zhou Jue first welcomed the Chinese and foreign 
correspondents to cover the session. He stated: Although the 
current session is a regular meeting, it is very important. It 
is being held during an important period when our country is 
proceeding on all fronts in reforming its economic structure 
with breakthroughs in key areas, and when it is accelerating the 
pace of establishing a socialist market economic system. 
  In response to a question on how to quicken legislative work 
and promote the operation of the market economic system, Zhou 
Jue answered: As empowered by the Constitution, the NPC and its 
Standing Committee have always made legislative work, especially 
economic-related legislative work, a priority. Since the First 
Session of the Eighth NPC, the NPC and its Standing Committee 
have enacted 21 laws, of which 12 concern the establishment of a 
socialist market economic system. 
  Zhou Jue added: During its eighth term, the NPC will fully 
implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; 
will quicken the legislative process; and will endeavor to 
complete the better part of the legal framework for the 
socialist market economy under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and on the basis of the Constitution. Moreover, 
it will basically improve the legal systems in other areas. 
These are important and glorious tasks. 
  A correspondent asked: Legislative work is now being 
accelerated, but some departments have failed to strictly 
enforce the law. How will the NPC tighten supervision in this 
regard? 
  Zhou Jue replied: Supervising law enforcement and government 
work is an important duty entrusted to the NPC and its Standing 
Committee by the Constitution. Over the past year, the eighth 
NPC Standing Committee exercised close supervision over law 
enforcement and government work, bearing in mind the state's 
priority tasks and the issues of concern to the people. The NPC 
Standing Committee sent 10 inspection teams to 15 provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the 
central government to assess work in comprehensively improving 
public order and in punishing those who produced and sold 
counterfeit and substandard commodities. The NPC's special 
committees also sent 27 inspection teams to assess progress in 
implementing 15 laws. 
  Zhou Jue stated: The NPC Standing Committee also heard 
reports by relevant departments of the State Council and by the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate [SPP] on banking, foreign trade, 
education, the promotion of a clean and honest government, and 
civil aviation work. While listening to work reports by the SPP 
and relevant departments, the NPC Standing Committee affirmed 
and supported the work done by various government departments 
and the SPP in investigating major cases of importance and in 
fighting corruption. After having heard a report on civil 
aviation work, the NPC Standing Committee required departments 
of the Civil Aviation Administration to earnestly strengthen 
control, to improve the quality of their personnel and services, 
and to improve civil aviation work as quickly as possible. 
  Zhou Jue added: In the future, the NPC and its Standing 
Committee will continue to strengthen supervision over and 
examination of law enforcement and government work so as to 
exercise in a better manner the authority vested in them by the 
Constitution. 
  A correspondent asked: What significance does the 
promulgation of the "Law on the Protection of Investments by 
Taiwan Compatriots" have on expanding cross-Strait economic 
exchanges and trade? 
  Zhou Jue replied: The Sixth Meeting of the Eighth NPC 
Standing Committee just examined and approved the "Law on the 
Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots." Cross-Strait 
economic relations and trade have now become even closer, and 
investments by Taiwanese businessmen on the mainland have 
increased by a large margin. However, "three direct links" have 
not been established yet. Under the circumstances, it is 
necessary to formulate a law on the protection of investments by 
Taiwan compatriots in order to provide adequate legal protection 
for their investments on the mainland. 
  Zhou Jue stated: The main contents of the law on the 
protection of investments by Taiwan compatriots include the 
personal safety of Taiwan compatriots who have invested in the 
mainland, and the protection of their investments and their 
investment returns; the protection of Taiwan-invested 
enterprises from being requisitioned; the need to adopt 
compensational measures to protect their legitimate rights and 
interests in case such requisitions are necessitated on account 
of public interests according to law; and the 
government-stipulated preferential treatment to which Taiwan 
investors are entitled. 
  Zhou Jue stressed: The formulation of the law fully shows a 
high degree of importance attached by us to Taiwan compatriots' 
investment-related rights and interests. It also shows our 
sincerity for developing cross-Strait economic contacts and 
trade. He expressed the belief that the law will surely be 
welcomed by the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots, and will 
play a very important role in promoting cross-Strait economic 
exchanges, trade, and cooperation. 
  A correspondent asked whether Taiwan has suggested that an 
"agreement on the protection of investments" be signed, and does 
this have anything to do with the "Law on the Protection of 
Investments by Taiwan Compatriots." 
  Zhou Jue answered: Investments on the mainland by Taiwan 
compatriots are a special kind of domestic investment. 
Therefore, investments by Taiwanese compatriots can only be 
protected by a domestic law. Taiwan is an inseparable part of 
Chinese territory. Relations between the central government and 
Taiwan are relations between a central government and a 
locality. It is out of the question that the two sides may sign 
any "agreement." Speaking about Hong Kong, Zhou Jue stated: 
It is entirely because of the uncooperative attitude taken by 
the British in sabotaging the talks that such talks between the 
Chinese and British Governments regarding arrangements for 
elections in Hong Kong in 1994/1995 have broken down. The 
responsibility is entirely on the British. In accordance with 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese Government will 
resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 
1997. Therefore, the three-tier political structure for Hong 
Kong will be terminated with the end of British rule. Beginning 
1 July 1997, the political framework of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region will be formed according to the decision 
of the NPC and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law. 
  Zhou Jue reiterated that Hong Kong will soon return to the 
embrace of the motherland. No force whatsoever can stop this. 
The Chinese Government and people have full confidence and 
ability to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong 
Kong on time; to implement the principle of "one country, two 
systems"; and to carry out the Basic Law in order to realize a 
smooth transition and to maintain long-term prosperity and 
stability in Hong Kong. 
  Asked about whether Deng Xiaoping will attend tomorrow's 
session, Zhou Jue said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the chief 
architect of China's reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization drive; as well as the founder of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the 
Marxism in contemporary China. He enjoys the love and esteem of 
the Chinese people of all nationalities. You will know whether 
he will attend the session when it opens tomorrow.

<F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 10 March editorial: "Discussing Matters of </F>
Vital Importance With National Interests in Mind--Congratulating 
the Opening of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Plenary 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] opened in 
Beijing today. 
  This meeting is convened at a crucial time in China's 
reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization drive. Since the First 
Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, people 
of all nationalities across the country, under the leadership of 
the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
nucleus, and persistently taking as their guidance Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as well as the basic line of the party, have 
implemented the guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress in a 
comprehensive manner; they have seized the opportunity to 
intensify reform and speed up development. The CPC Central 
Committee and State Council took the major step of macroeconomic 
regulation and control to solve the contradictions and problems 
in the march forward with noticeable success. The national 
economy has seen sustained, rapid, and healthy growth [chi xu 
kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 
1455]; heartening progress has been made in all undertakings of 
socialist construction with Chinese characteristics. With the 
adoption at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee of "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some 
Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure" as the hallmark, the reform of China's 
economic structure has entered a crucial phase of combining 
package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. Several major 
reform measures were simultaneously announced earlier this year, 
and efforts have been increased over the past two months or so 
to implement these reform plans. Ensuring the faithful 
implementation of these reform plans with all manner of support 
represents a gigantic and formidable task. The government work 
report, as well as other reports to be examined at the current 
session, will contain specific plans for attaining this year's 
tasks. Therefore, the success of this session is of great 
significance for reform and development in 1994 and thereafter. 
  Over the past year, China has made remarkable progress in 
promoting socialist democracy and legality. New progress has 
been made in the work of the NPC and local people's congresses 
at all levels. Taking the theory of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line as its guidance, and 
the reinforcement of socialist democracy and the socialist legal 
system as its fundamental tasks, the NPC Standing Committee has 
focused on the central task of economic development and has 
conscientiously performed the functions vested in it by the 
Constitution. It has done a great deal of fruitful work in 
strengthening legislative work, in improving the supervisory 
mechanism, in promoting reform and development, in safeguarding 
social stability, and so forth. It was a year in which more 
laws were adopted by the NPC Standing Committee than any other 
year. Especially noteworthy is the fact that economic 
legislation has been given top priority in the legislative 
agenda. A slew of major laws designed to standardize market 
practices, safeguard order in the marketplace, and increase 
macroeconomic regulation and control have been promulgated in 
good time; these laws include the Company Law, the Law Against 
Unethical Competition, and the Law on Protecting the Rights and 
Interests of Consumers. These laws have played, and will 
continue to play, an important function in pushing forward and 
safeguarding the healthy development of a socialist market 
economy. A market economy cries for development of the legal 
system; the legal system safeguards the market economy. As the 
reform of China's economic structure enters a new stage, 
development of a socialist democracy and the socialist legal 
system will also usher in a new phase. 
  The people's congress system is China's fundamental 
political system. From the first session of the first NPC in 
1954 up until now, China has practiced this system for exactly 
40 years. During those 40 years, the NPC has undertaken an 
unforgettable journey. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, the NPC--the supreme organ of state 
power--has been playing an increasingly important role on the 
political scene of the state. Practice has shown that the 
people's congress system was established in line with China's 
reality; it is a system rooted deeply in China's reality with a 
long life-force and is a vital component of the socialist 
political system with Chinese characteristics. In the 
transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economic 
structure, the people's congress will play a still greater role 
as the organ for people to exercise the power of state. 
  Seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to 
the outside world, expediting development, and ensuring 
stability are requirements of overall importance for 1994 set by 
the entire party and the entire country by the CPC Central 
Committee. We are faced with formidable tasks of reform and 
development this year; meanwhile, preserving social and 
political stability requires us to bring into fuller play under 
the CPC leadership the role of people's congresses, government, 
and CPPCC committees at all levels, and to mobilize, unite, and 
coordinate the efforts of hundreds upon millions of people to 
ensure the smooth accomplishment of the various tasks. The NPC 
and people's congresses at all levels will certainly play an 
important role in properly handling the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability. 
  Our forefathers said: "A right moment is hard to come by but 
easy to let slip. A right moment quickly seized is an 
opportunity. For this reason, the sage moves at the right 
moment, and the wise man springs into action at the opportune 
time." Today, China's socialist modernization drive is faced by 
a rare, excellent opportunity. Seizing the opportunity, "moving 
at the right moment," and "springing into action at the 
opportune time" are crucial to the accomplishment of our goals 
of struggle. By conscientiously exercising the power entrusted 
them by the people during the current session, and by speaking 
their minds freely in discussing matters of vital importance at 
the current session, the deputies will certainly make important 
contributions to the accomplishment of the session's agenda. 
  We wish the NPC session complete success.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Leading newspapers in 
the Chinese capital have begun giving prominent coverage to the 
convening of the plenary session of the National People's 
Congress (NPC) by carrying editorials and opening special 
columns. 
  In its editorial today entitled "to bear the great 
undertaking in mind and engage in collective discussions on 
programs of great importance," the PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO] 
says that China is in a transitional period from central 
planning to a socialist market economy and that the NPC, as the 
country's supreme organ of state power, should play a greater 
role in accelerating national economic development, ensuring 
social stability and pushing ahead with the reform program now 
entering a crucial period. 
  The front page of the daily also carries today a signed 
article, which calls for nationwide efforts to successfully 
carry out newly- introduced, more difficult reforms, which it 
says have a direct bearing on the future of the country. 
  The LIBERATION ARMY DAILY [JIEFANGJUN RIBAO] editorial, 
entitled "Strive To Scale Another Peak," says the rank and file 
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have noticed with 
excitement achievements made by China in reform, economic 
development and open policy implementation over the past year, 
which have also helped invigorate army building. Deputies from 
the army will join their fellow deputies in making the ongoing 
NPC session "a pragmatic, confidence-boosting conference." 
  The GUANGMING DAILY [GUANGMING RIBAO], in its editorial 
entitled "for a still brighter tomorrow," expresses the hope 
that the NPC would speed up legislation to ensure a smooth 
progression of reform and open policy implementation. 
  An editorial of the WORKERS DAILY [GONGREN RIBAO] calls on 
workers of the country to have a better understanding of 
relations between reform, economic development and social 
stability and make still greater contributions to the country's 
modernization program. 
  CHINA YOUTH DAILY [ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO] has opened a 
special column on the NPC session. The daily has also set up a 
special hotline for NPC deputies and members of the national 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- The National Committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC] and the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central 
Committee held a banquet this evening at the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse in honor of National People's Congress [NPC] deputies 
and CPPCC National Committee members from Hong Kong and Macao 
who came to Beijing to attend the Second Session of the Eighth 
NPC and the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee. 
  Those attending the banquet included Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the CPPCC National Committee; Wang Guangying and Cheng Siyuan, 
both vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee; and Wu 
Xueqian, Yang Ruidai, Qian Weichang, Sun Fuling, and Henry Fok 
Ying-tung, all vice chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee. 
  Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
spoke at the banquet. He said: We again gather in Beijing to 
attend the annual NPC and CPPCC National Committee meetings to 
discuss the state's affairs and policies, to consult with each 
other, and to exercise supervision over the government's work. 
This year's NPC and CPPCC National Committee meetings will be 
held at a time when the country's reform and opening up are 
entering a crucial stage. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee last year laid down the objective of 
quickening the step of building a socialist market economic 
system; against this background, I hope you would speak freely 
to make more contributions toward ensuring rapid economic 
development in a sustained and healthy manner, to preserving 
political stability, and ensuring Hong Kong's prosperity, 
stability, and stable transition. Whatever problems Hong Kong 
may encounter in the future, we have confidence that we can 
properly handle Hong Kong's affairs. 
  Ann Tse Kai, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee; 
and He Houhua, a NPC deputy from Macao, also spoke at the 
banquet. They said in the new year they will closely cooperate 
with the mainland and will continue to work for the prosperity 
and stability of Hong Kong and Macao. 
  The banquet was presided over by Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman 
of the CPPCC National Committee.

(3088 5725 0393)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- Tian Jiyun, vice 
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress (NPC), this afternoon went to Hongxiang Building to 
visit NPC deputies of Guizhou and Jiangxi delegations and hold 
cordial talks with them. 
  Tian Jiyun had worked in Guizhou Province for 20 years. When 
he saw old comrades who worked with him before, he intimately 
chatted with them and asked them to extend his regards to his 
former colleagues. He said with deep feelings: It seems 
people's congresses at various levels will need more comrades in 
their prime in the future to suit the new situation. Now we are 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, and it is 
all the more necessary to strengthen the work of legislation and 
implementation of laws. Therefore, the work of people's 
congresses will be more and more important and the comrades of 
people's congresses will have a heavy burden. Tian Jiyun also 
held that young comrades can temper themselves in legislative 
work at people's congresses and later work on the frontline of 
economic work. He said that in this way they could greatly help 
economic development. 
  In meeting with deputies of the Jiangxi delegation, Tian 
Jiyun was very glad after hearing news on the steady development 
of agricultural production in Jiangxi. He said: Agriculture is 
the foundation for the overall national economic development. 
If we stabilize agricultural production, we can have stability 
in the rural areas; and if we have stability in the rural areas, 
we can provide a guarantee for the steady development of reform. 
Touching on Jiangxi's village and town enterprises, Tian Jiyun 
said: Village and town enterprises started relatively late in 
Jiangxi, so it is necessary to catch up with other localities. 
To get rid of poverty and promote development, agricultural 
provinces and poor areas must develop village and town 
enterprises and rely on economic benefits of village and town 
enterprises. 
  NPC deputies from Jiangxi also made a report to Tian Jiyun 
on 
Jiangxi's progress in adjusting the structure of agricultural 
production and in promoting agricultural production. Tian Jiyun 
satisfactorily said: I hope Jiangxi can achieve success in 
agricultural development.

4135 0193] 
  [Text] When interviewed by reporters, delegates from Hong 
Kong attending the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress (NPC) said that during the session they would 
largely be speaking about and discussing the smooth transition 
of Hong Kong, its prosperity, and its stability, along with 
reform and development in China, and clean-administration 
building in the hinterland. 
  A total of 28 delegates from Hong Kong will attend the NPC 
meeting. Zeng Xianzi, Wu Kangmin, Liao Yaozhu, all members of 
the Preliminary Work Organ for the Preparatory Committee of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Hong Kong affairs 
advisers to the State Council, and Zheng Yaotang, a Hong Kong 
affairs adviser, were among the delegates who spoke to 
reporters. As NPC delegates from Hong Kong, each said the 
territory was their main issue of concern. 
  Delegate Liao Yaozhu said the heart of the dispute between 
China and Britain over the Hong Kong political system lay in 
fulfilling international agreements, in linking up with the Hong 
Kong Basic Law, and in realizing a smooth transition for Hong 
Kong. Complete insincerity on the matter of cooperation and 
deliberate sabotage by Britain had led to the breakdown of 
Sino-British negotiations over arrangements for the 1994-1995 
elections in Hong Kong. 
  Delegate Zeng Xianzi said Hong Kong people should not harbor 
illusions and should become united. With strong backing from 
the motherland, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability would be 
ensured. 
  Other delegates also expressed the hope that the Preliminary 
Work Organ for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region would increase its work, 
vigorously prepare for China's resumption of sovereignty over 
Hong Kong, and help ensure a smooth transition of Hong Kong. 
  On the issue of reform and construction, delegates Zeng 
Xianzi and Wang Mingang said another major topic they would 
address at the NPC meeting was good handling of the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability. Zeng Xianzi said it 
was necessary to emphasize the Chinese character "jian kang" 
(healthy)," namely to stress increasing economic efficiency, if 
the people wanted to maintain sustained, stable, and healthy 
development of the economy. Carrying out reform well would lead 
to healthy development of the economy and a developed economy 
would lead to social stability. Many delegates also described as 
astounding China's economic development over 15 years of reform 
and opening up. As China was a big country with a huge 
population, development was still uneven. To achieve common 
development, it was hoped that the economically- developed 
regions would enhance cooperation with less-developed areas. 
  On the issue of clean-administration building, delegates Wu 
Kangmin and Zheng Yaotang said the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council had attached great importance to it, adopted many 
effective measures on anticorruption work, and achieved certain 
results. They hoped more efforts would be taken in this regard 
to establish anticorruption supervision and restraint mechanisms.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by correspondent Lou Wanghao (2869 2598 4110) and </F>
reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639): "Jiakexi! (Good) 
Yakudu! (Good) -- An Account of a Midnight Meeting Among 
Minority People's Deputies"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar (XINHUA) -- This was a spontaneous 
gathering. This is a vivid portrayal of great national unity. 
  At 2300 [1400 GMT] on 7 March, a happy atmosphere filled the 
hall on the first floor of the Jingxi Hotel. A dozen people's 
deputies dressed in minority costumes gathered in the hall, 
singing happily, laughing heartily, and exchanging views on the 
old days and new happenings. Although they were of different 
nationalities and had language problems, they shook hands 
warmly; they shared the same views; their smiles were full of 
warmth; they exchanged greetings.... 
  After arriving in Beijing, the minority deputies of the 
delegation representing the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region 
were very happy to learn that the delegation from Tibet 
Autonomous Region was also staying in the same hotel. Someone 
contacted the Tibet delegation. By now the Tibet delegation, 
which had just arrived in Beijing after a tiring journey, was 
well rested. Upon learning that the fraternal deputies from the 
Xinjiang delegation wished to meet them, members of the Tibet 
delegation joyfully jumped out of bed, dressed in their best 
national costumes, and rushed downstairs to meet the deputies of 
the Xinjiang delegation. 
  Some deputies of the Tibet and Xinjiang delegations knew 
each 
other while some met for the first time. However, when the 
deputies of Uygur and Kirgiz nationalities from Xinjiang, who 
were wearing little flower hats and white felt hats, met with 
the Tibetan deputies wearing Tibetan costumes, it was especially 
warm like relatives meeting one another. 
  "Zhaxidele!" (Tibetan for may your wishes come true) 
  "Jiakexi!" (Kirgiz for how are you) 
  Laughter, greetings, and chats continued, and the deputies 
were very excited. The atmosphere was very warm. In groups of 
three or five, they talked about the past, discussing reform and 
changes. 
  Speaking most enthusiastically were [Ashanbaike Tuerdi], 
head 
of the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, and 
[Luosangjiangchun], head of the Nagu Prefectural Administrative 
Office. As they came from a pastoral area, they talked 
ceaselessly about reform and economic development in their 
respective areas. 
  Deputy [Luosangjiangchun] said: "In the past few years, as a 
result of carrying out reform in Tibet's pastoral areas, animal 
husbandry has developed rapidly, thus raising herdsmen's living 
standard by a big margin. In 1993, per-capita income of Tibet's 
herdsmen topped 700 yuan, and each herdsman owned an average of 
50 head of livestock. This situation means the people feel 
secure; there is social stability; there is national unity; and 
there is economic development." 
  After hearing this story, Deputy [Ashanbaike Tuerdi] said: 
"Good! Good!" Continuing speaking, he said: "There are more 
than 100,000 Kirgiz people in our prefecture. Although our 
development is not as rapid as yours, the people's living 
conditions have improved tremendously in recent years. Taking 
advantage of geographical position, we have increased our income 
considerably by developing border trade and enlivening the 
market." 
  [Luosangjiangchun] said happily: "All of us have witnessed 
changes. It is really good!" 
  They continued talking, but no words could describe their 
joy 
and happiness. They agreed they should learn from each other, 
advance together, strengthen unity, and prosper together. 
  These words by Amudun Niyaz, Uygur nationality deputy from 
Xinjiang, reflected the common desire of the deputies of various 
nationalities: "National unity, social stability, and economic 
development -- this constitutes the foundation for the 
prosperity of the Chinese nation. If we can do this, the living 
conditions of minority nationalities will, like the rest of the 
country, improve year by year, and the days ahead will become 
sweeter and sweeter!"

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Economic development 
and reform are the most important issues attracting attention 
from deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), 
according to a brief survey made by XINHUA just before the 
opening of the current NPC session today. 
  The 2,800-plus deputies from all corners of China converged 
in the Great Hall of the People a half hour before the opening. 
When XINHUA reporters made a survey among 50 deputies, 30 
considered economic development and reform the most important 
issue. 
  In a government work report delivered today, Premier Li Peng 
devoted the longest parts to the principles governing China's 
economic work and arrangements to ensure substantial progress of 
the economic restructuring. Therefore, what the deputies are 
concerned about coincides with the priority of the government 
work. 
  Other issues the deputies are interested in include the 
reform of the state-owned enterprises, protection of peasants' 
interests, development of ethnic minority areas, prices and 
social order. 
  Though they touch upon many issues of common concern, 
deputies from different regions, industries and circles pay 
attention to different specific issues. For instance, 
entrepreneur deputies, without exception, focus on establishment 
of a modern enterprise system -- an important part of the 
economic reform this year; and peasant deputies generally stress 
development of rural economy and protection of peasants' 
interests. 
  Four mayors surveyed said that they will try their best to 
handle well relations among reform, development and stability. 
This shows that the local executives pay more attention to the 
overall situation. 
  Yue Qifeng, governor of Liaoning Province, said what he is 
concerned most is to invigorate the state-owned enterprises. 
Liaoning is China's leading heavy-industrial center with 1,200 
big and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
  Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan provincial committee of 
the Chinese Communist Party, said he concentrates his attention 
to boosting peasants' income, as Sichuan is the biggest 
agricultural province in China. 
  Li Yukun, deputy director of the Rugao Silk Carpet Factory 
in 
Jiangsu Province, said he is interested in reform of the foreign 
trade system because his factory manufactures carpets for export. 
  Gesang Quje, a Tibetan and living Buddha from Qinghai 
Province, voiced his hope for prosperity of ethnic minority 
areas and stable state religious policy. 
  Zhang Shan, the Barcelona Olympic skeet champion, and Song 
Shixiong, a noted Chinese sports commentator, concentrate their 
attention on development of China's sports and physical culture. 
  As China will carry out an all-round economic reform and 
make 
breakthroughs in key fields this year, the interests structure 
will be further readjusted. Therefore, people are concerned 
with various major reform measures raised by the Chinese 
Government, from different perspectives. The deputies will 
earnestly deliberate the government work report, air their views 
and put forward suggestions at the current session.

<F P=106> [From the "Special Program on the NPC and CPPCC Sessions"] </F>
  [Text] As a frontier province in China's reform and 
opening up, Guangdong has achieved remarkable progress over the 
past 15 years. However, as the Central Committee's policy of 
reform and opening up is being implemented in depth throughout 
the country, overseas investment is gradually moving inland. 
Moreover, other coastal provinces and cities have also opened 
up in an all-round way. Consequently, Guangdong has been 
steadily losing many of its former advantages. In these 
circumstances, what can Guangdong do to create new advantages 
and advance its economy to a new level? 
  In an interview with station reporter Zhao Yihong, Xie Fei, 
NPC deputy and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC 
Committee, spoke about Guangdong's plans for the future and its 
strategic goals. 
  [Begin recording] The general idea is to lay a foundation. 
There are three aspects to this foundation. For short we call 
them three mountains -- all for the purpose of laying a 
foundation. 
  First, the institution of three mechanisms. The first is the 
mechanism of the socialist market economy, a mechanism of broad 
significance. The second is the legislative mechanism, and the 
third that of democratic supervision. These three mechanisms, 
we believe, will be crucial to the accomplishment of our future 
goals. They are economic as well as political mechanisms. In 
other words, we will simultaneously promote reform of two types 
of mechanisms that promote one another. 
  Third [as heard], making improvements in three areas: 1. 
Optimizing the industrial structure. Guangdong is developing 
industries based on high and new technology; there should be a 
reasonable ratio between the primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries; and industry should change in a way that lays 
greater emphasis on economic efficiency. 2. Improving the 
environment. In achieving modernization, we should try to 
avoid the problems that developed countries have encountered 
before -- that is, pollution of society and the environment 
brought about by modernization. We are studying ways to avert 
these problems. Our goal is to achieve modernization and 
industrialization without polluting the environment. 3. 
Improving the quality of the population. It has a two-fold 
meaning. One is family planning, the second is related to 
education. It is important to improve the quality. [end

<F P=106> [News briefing by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the Second Session </F>
of the Eighth National People's Congress, with foreign and 
domestic correspondents at the Great Hall of the People on 9 
March; moderator identified by indistinct caption -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Moderator] The news briefing has begun. Let us 
ask Comrade Zhou Jue, our spokesman for the National People's 
Congress [NPC] session, to make some remarks. 
  [Zhou] The Second Session of the Eighth NPC will open 
tomorrow. Although the current session is a regular meeting, it 
is very important. It is being held during an important period 
when our country is proceeding on all fronts in reforming its 
economic structure with breakthroughs in key areas, and when it 
is accelerating the pace of establishing a socialist market 
economic system. You are welcome to cover this session. I wish 
you success in your coverage. Now, I am willing to answer your 
questions that have something to do with the agenda of the 
current session. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO correspondent] I am a correspondent from 
RENMIN 
RIBAO. I would like to ask the spokesman the following 
question: The just-concluded sixth meeting of the NPC Standing 
Committee examined and approved the Law of the People's Republic 
of China on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots. 
This has caused great concern on both sides of the Taiwan 
Strait. What effect will the implementation of the law have on 
the expansion of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade? 
  [Zhou] The NPC Standing Committee meeting recently approved 
the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of 
Investments by Taiwan Compatriots. This is because cross-strait 
economic contacts have become closer, and Taiwan's investments 
in the mainland's economy have increased by a large margin. 
Despite this situation, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have 
not yet established direct postal links, direct air and shipping 
services, and direct trade contacts. Therefore, it is essential 
to enact the law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' investments. 
The law mainly protects Taiwan compatriots' personal safety, 
investments, and investment returns; it also protects 
enterprises funded by them in China against being requisitioned, 
and if these enterprises are requisitioned for public services, 
the method of compensation should be adopted. Moreover, the law 
allows enterprises funded by Taiwan compatriots here to organize 
business associations to protect their legitimate rights and 
interests. The formulation and adoption of this law fully 
demonstrates that we attach great importance to Taiwan 
compatriots' investment-related rights and interests, and also 
give full expression to our sincerity in developing cross-strait 
economic contacts and trade. I believe that the enactment of 
the law will surely be welcomed by the broad masses of Taiwan 
compatriots, and it will play a very important role in promoting 
economic development on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The 
enactment of this law provides us the most authoritative and 
fullest legal guarantee for protecting investments by Taiwan 
compatriots on the mainland. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Some NPC deputies from the 
Hong Kong region are going to put forward a motion during the 
NPC session, requiring the NPC to announce the dissolution and 
reorganization of the Hong Kong British Government's three-tier 
parliament after 1997. Will NPC spokesman support the motion? 
  [Zhou] Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994/1995 elections 
have broken down due to an uncooperative and sabotaging attitude 
taken by Britain. The responsibility is entirely on the British 
side. In accordance with the stipulations of the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration, Britain's administration over Hong Kong will 
end on 30 June 1997, with China resuming the exercise of its 
sovereignty over Hong Kong thereafter. The three-tier political 
structure which serves the British administration in Hong Kong 
will also inevitably end with the expiry of the term of British 
rule. The political framework for the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region will be formed according to the resolution 
of China's NPC and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law. 
Here, I would like to reiterate: Hong Kong will soon return to 
the embrace of the motherland. No force whatsoever can stop 
this. The Chinese Government and people have full confidence 
and ability to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over 
Hong Kong on time; to implement the principle of "one country, 
two systems"; to carry out the Basic Law; and to maintain Hong 
Kong's smooth transition as well as its long-term stability. 
  [CCTV correspondent] The NPC and its Standing Committee 
noticeably sped up the pace of legislation over the past year, 
but failure to abide by the laws and lax enforcement of laws 
occurred in some areas from time to time. How will the NPC 
Standing Committee strengthen examination of and supervision 
over law enforcement so as to improve the situation? 
  [Zhou] Supervising law enforcement and government judicial 
organs' work is an important duty entrusted to the NPC and its 
standing committee by the Constitution. Over the past year, the 
NPC Standing Committee conducted close examination of 
legislation of laws, their enforcement, and government work, 
bearing in mind the state's priority tasks and the issues of 
greatest concern to the people; it successively sent 10 
inspection teams to 15 provinces, municipalities, and regions to 
assess work in comprehensive management of public security and 
in dealing with the production and sales of counterfeit and 
substandard commodities. Various special committees also sent 
27 inspection teams to assess progress in implementing 15 laws. 
The Standing Committee also heard reports by relevant State 
Council departments and the Supreme People's Procuratorate [SPP] 
on education, banking, foreign trade, the building of a clean 
and honest government, and civil aviation. For instance, after 
hearing a work report by the department of the Civil Aviation 
Administration, the Standing Committee required the department 
of the Civil Aviation Administration and its affiliated 
organizations to conscientiously strengthen control, to improve 
the quality of their work and personnel as well as attitude 
toward service, and to improve civil aviation as quickly as 
possible. After hearing work reports by the SPP and relevant 
State Council departments, the Standing Committee fully affirmed 
their work, in particular their work on investigating extensive, 
important cases, and gave them maximum support. In the future, 
the NPC and its Standing Committee will continue to strengthen 
supervision and to exercise the authority of supervision vested 
in it by the Constitution in a better way. 
  [SWEDISH DAILY NEWS correspondent, in English fading into 
Mandarin translation] I have heard that the Chinese Government 
is considering abolishing the provision on counterrevolutionary 
crime in its Criminal Law and replacing it with some definitions 
of various crimes. Could you verify such a change? In addition, 
do your legislators have plans to discuss this matter? 
  [Zhou] The counterrevolutionary crime stipulated in China's 
Criminal Law refers to crimes endangering state security. In 
any country in the world, crimes that endanger state security 
have to be punished. 
  [XINHUA correspondent] How will quickening legislative work 
advance China's market economy? 
  [Zhou] In accordance with China's Constitution, in the past 
year, the NPC Standing Committee has made legislative work, 
especially economic-related legislative work, a priority. 
Excluding the Constitutional amendment bill and the Basic Law 
of the Macao Special Administrative Region, adopted at the First 
Session of the Eighth NPC, the NPC Standing Committee has 
enacted or revised 19 laws, of which 12 concern the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system. These laws 
include the Corporate Law, Agriculture Law, Individual Income 
Tax Law, the Law Against Unfair Competition, the Quality Law, 
the Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Consumers, and 
so on. Last year, the number of laws passed by the NPC Standing 
Committee broke all previous records. I can tell you all that 
the Standing Committee has initially examined two important 
laws, the Budget Law and the Securities Law. During its eighth 
term, the NPC Standing Committee will fully implement the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, will quicken 
the legislative process, and will endeavor to complete the 
better part of the legal framework for the socialist market 
economy under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, under the 
guidance of the party's basic line and on the basis of the 
Constitution. Moreover, it will continue to establish and 
improve the legal systems in other areas. During its eighth 
term, the NPC Standing Committee plans to pass 152 laws, 53 of 
which deal with the socialist market economy. I can tell you 
all that from 1949 to 1992, the NPC and its Standing Committees 
passed a total of 170 laws. Enacting 152 laws during the eighth 
term of the NPC Standing Committee -- this is indeed an 
important and glorious task. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The NPC has just passed the 
"Law on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots." 
At present, many Taiwan businessmen believe that this law is 
insufficient. Therefore, they have been voicing their hope that 
the two sides will sign an investment protection agreement. 
What is the view of the NPC regarding this issue? 
  [Zhou] Investments on the mainland by Taiwan compatriots are 
a special kind of domestic investment. Therefore, protection of 
the investment rights and interests of Taiwanese compatriots can 
only be realized through a domestic law. [words indistinct] the 
issue of investment protection agreement. Taiwan is an 
inalienable part of Chinese territory. The relationship between 
the central government and the Taiwan authorities is one between 
the central government and a local authority. It is out of the 
question that the two sides may sign any agreement. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] NPC deputies from the Hong Kong 
region and those from the Guangdong region have jointly 
submitted a motion demanding that a special clean government 
work committee be set up under the NPC Standing Committee. They 
feel that such a committee under the NPC Standing Committee will 
strengthen the Chinese Government's work against corruption. 
Moreover, it will enhance the NPC's status. What is the view 
of the NPC on this motion? 
  [Zhou] You have just mentioned that some Hong Kong deputies 
have suggested that a clean government work committee be set up 
under the NPC Standing Committee. According to the provisions 
of relevant laws, any people's deputies are entitled to make 
suggestions and submit motions, but examinations and approval 
must be done in accordance with legal procedures. As for the 
struggle against corruption, we will continue it on a long-term 
basis and will strive to achieve still greater results. 
Therefore, as the Hong Kong deputies have submitted some good 
suggestions or motions, they will certainly be welcomed. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] This year China will 
introduce more measures to reform enterprises. The workers have 
become more concerned about their work prospects this year. 
Does the NPC have any plan to make laws to protect workers' 
rights and interests this year? 
  [Zhou] Regarding the law on the protection of the working 
class's rights and interests, China has enacted the Trade Union 
Law. In this law there are explicit provisions on protecting 
workers' rights and interests. We have also passed the Labor 
Law. This is an important law to protect workers' rights and 
interests. 
  [Moderator] Today's news briefing is now concluded. Thank 
you.

<F P=106> [By Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Comrade Peng Zhen Wishes </F>
Beijing People A Happy New Year"] 
  [Text] Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, and Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, visited Comrade Peng 
Zhen at his home on the eve of the Spring Festival. They 
extended new year greetings on behalf of the people and 
communist party members of Beijing, to the former secretary and 
mayor and wished him long life and a happy Spring Festival. 
Comrade Peng Zhen was very pleased, and also wished Beijing's 
people and the communist party members a happy new year. 
  Comrade Peng Zhen, who is 91 years old, cordially talked 
with 
the municipal leaders with a high spirit and clear mind. 
  Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan said: Under the leadership of the 
party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, 
Beijing improved all of its 1993 work over work in 1992 and 
achieved sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
The per capita income of urban staff members and workers 
registered a substantial increase last year thanks to economic 
development. However, we still have some poverty-stricken, 
mountainous areas and low-income plants, shops, schools, and 
households that are experiencing difficulties. We will make 
efforts to solve this problem as a priority in our endeavors to 
achieve a fairly comfortable life in the next few years and make 
it a success. 
  Comrade Peng Zhen said happily that healthy development was 
genuine development. He emphasized that great efforts in 
improving state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises and 
agriculture, were key to this development. 
  Chen Xitong said: This year's tasks for reform and 
development are very arduous. Great efforts should be made to 
maintain political and social stability in the capital. 
Meanwhile, we should further emancipate our minds, seize the 
opportunity, conduct investigation and study, make breakthroughs 
in key areas, and resolutely implement the arrangements of the 
party Central Committee and the State Council to win still 
greater achievements in the capital's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. 
  Comrade Peng Zhen said: Stability is a major task concerning 
the entire country, and the capital should take the lead in 
maintaining it. Without a stable environment, nothing can be 
developed. 
  Chen Xitong said that to continuously promote the cause of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as advocated by 
Comrade Xiaoping, we should strengthen party building and, in 
particular, achieve ideological and theoretical progress and 
improve leading bodies. He reported to Peng Zhen that the 
end-of-term reshuffles of district and county leading bodies 
improved the age structure to add impetus to the orderly 
succession of cadres. Comrade Peng Zhen said: A good age 
structure is good. Without the combination of old, middle-aged, 
and young comrades, the party's line will lack continuity. The 
basic issue is to uphold socialism and communist ideals. 
Communist party members should intensify study of Marxist 
theory, persistently seek truth from facts, uphold truth, and 
correct mistakes that may arise. In this way, they will have 
bright prospects and make progress endlessly. 
  Chen Xitong said to Peng Zhen: Eleven years ago when I first 
served as the mayor, I asked you for instructions. You gave me 
four: 1) say less and do more, and say nothing about completed 
work; 2) a mayor needs money at his disposal, thus meaning that 
production needed to be developed to increase financial 
resources; 3) set the highest possible demands on all work and 
advance continuously; and 4) "measure several times before 
cutting" by conducting more investigation and study. I have 
benefited greatly from these four instructions. When Comrade Li 
Qiyan became the mayor, I passed on the instructions to him. Li 
Qiyan said: I kept your four instructions in mind constantly. 
In your introduction remarks to the "Frontline" magazine, you 
urged us to adhere to the thinking of seeking truth from facts, 
and we have always used it to guide our work. Comrade Peng Zhen 
smiled. 
  Li Zhijian and Chen Guangwen, deputy secretaries, and Duan 
Bingren, secretary general of the municipal party committee; and 
Fan Yuanmou, secretary general of the municipal government; also 
visited Comrade Peng Zhen together.

  [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will construct 
more flats in the coming four years to meet the growing demand 
of the citizens, Deputy Mayor Zhang Baifa told a municipal 
residential housing working conference. 
  He revealed that by 1997 the living space in Beijing is to 
reach 14 sq m per capita, 5.7 sq m more than the figure at the 
end of 1993. 
  Over the past 15 years of reform, Zhang said, Beijing has 
poured about 26 billion yuan (some three billion U.S. dollars) 
into house-building, erecting 1.3 million flats with a total 
area of nearly 80 million sq m. 
  By 1993 the living space increased to 8.3 sq m per capita, 
almost double that in 1978. 
  However, house construction still cannot keep up with the 
demand, the mayor said. 
  According to the plan, from now to 1997 the city intends to 
build 2.5 million sq m of improved living quarters. 
  In a departure from the present monotonous layout of blocks, 
the appearance and style of buildings will be diversified. The 
surrounding environment will also be improved, Zhang said. 
  Complementary facilities for education, medical care and 
recreation as well as commercial, financial, telecommunications 
and postal services will be set up at the same time, he added.

  [Text] Xian, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Shaanxi provincial 
government recently decided to set up a share-holding company to 
construct an express highway from its Lintong County to Weinan 
city. 
  It is the fourth province in China to experiment in 
construction of express highways with shares to raise funds. 
  The other three provinces are Hainan, Guangdong and 
Zhejiang. 
  The 40.7-kilometer express highway will link up with another 
Shaanxi express highway from Xian to Lintong. 
  Work on the project is due to start in June. The 
share-holding company will complete its fund-raising through 
issuing stocks by the end of May. 
  Total investment for the project will be 500 million yuan. 
  Apart from the management, construction and maintenance of 
the expressway, the company will also be responsible for 
construction of the service facilities, real estate development, 
tourism programs, advertising and entertainment facilities.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 6 (XINHUA) -- North China's port city 
of Tianjin is stepping up the development and opening of a new 
seaside zone as part of the city's persistent efforts to open to 
the outside world, said the city mayor. 
  Mayor Zhang Lichang told the municipal people's congress 
that 
a blueprint for the building of the seaside economic zone has 
been completed after a long time of preparation and deliberation 
and his government will redouble efforts to implement it. 
  He revealed the basic framework of the emerging economic 
zone, which includes the Tianjin Port, the free trade area, and 
the economic and technology development zone along the seaside. 
  The zone, featuring the export-oriented economy and booming 
industries such as the metallurgy and chemical industry, 
commerce, finance, and tourism, will be developed into a free 
port area with complete infrastructural facilities and 
multi-functional services. 
  In addition, the zone's gross domestic product (GDP) and 
gross export value are expected to account for over 40 percent 
of the city's total in the coming decade, Zhang said. 
  Describing the future of the seaside zone, Zhang said that 
emphasis will be placed on the construction of the Tianjin Port, 
the development zone, the free trade zone, the chemical 
industrial area, and infrastructural facilities. 
  The Tianjin Port will be made one of the country's 
first-class ports, capable of handling over 40 million tons of 
goods and over 500,000 standard containers. 
  The development area will enlarge Tianjin's foreign 
investment and expand its foreign economic trade. The total 
industrial output value is targeted for 11 billion yuan. 
  Meanwhile, the construction pace of the free trade zone will 
also be quickened. A good service system for storing, 
transporting, and processing will be built in order to bring 
them into line with the requirements of the world market. 
  The official said that more funds will be pooled for 
infrastructural projects, such as expressways, highways, water 
works, and thermal-power plant.

  [Text] The provincial meeting of leading bodies to exchange 
experiences in the improvement of thinking and work style was 
held in Harbin on 28 February. 
  The meeting studied and arranged the issues on how to 
further 
strengthen the improvement of leading bodies' thinking and work 
style and to ensure the elevation of the economic construction 
to a new height under the socialist market economic conditions. 
  Sun Weiben, Shao Qihui, Zhou Wenhua, Ma Guoliang, Tian 
Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Meng Qingxiang, and Qi Guiyuan attended 
the meeting. 
  At the meeting, Sun Weiben made a speech entitled: Leading 
Cadres Should Take the Lead in Waging an Arduous Struggle. 
  He said: In 1994, there are many difficulties that we should 
overcome and there are many new contradictions and problems that 
we should solve. So, the leading cadres at various levels are 
required to take the lead in waging an arduous struggle in an 
effort to create a situation of waging an arduous struggle and 
cooperatively pioneering the great undertaking. 
  He pointed out: In the new stage of reform, opening up, and 
modernization, the spirit of arduous struggle means unswervingly 
implementing the basic line of the party and organically 
combining hard labor with creative labor. We should strive to 
create concrete work achievements. We should concentrate energy 
on economic construction, try every possible means to overcome 
the difficulties cropping up in the course of development, and 
strive for a faster development speed. We should persist in the 
mass line, share weal and woe with the masses, do more concrete 
deeds for the masses, and establish close contacts between the 
party and the masses. It is necessary to resolutely resist the 
influence of the corrosive ideas of the capitalist class, to be 
diligent and honest in performing official duties, to encourage 
frugality, and to promote a social practice of healthy progress 
and opening up in a civilized way. 
  Sun Weiben stressed: Setting up the new socialist market 
economic system is a completely new and arduous task. Thus, the 
leading cadres at various levels are required to bravely blaze 
new trails, keep forging ahead, and fundamentally persist in the 
three-conducive standards. Instead of simple and indiscriminate 
imitation, we should creatively implement the higher-level 
arrangements according to our actual conditions. We must not 
adopt the attitude of dodging or shifting responsibility onto 
others when coming across [words indistinct] problems in our 
work. On the contrary, we should carry forward the spirit of 
having the daring to do pioneering work, trying and risking; and 
advancing despite difficulties. 
  Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, made an arrangement for further strengthening the 
improvement of leading bodies' thinking and work style. 
  He said: We should regard that whether or not the basic line 
of the party is successfully implemented and whether or not the 
role as the core in conducting reform and developing the economy 
is better played as the fundamental standards for assessing the 
leading bodies' performances so as to noticeably strengthen the 
improvement of their thinking and work style. The leading 
bodies at various levels should undertake the heavy task for 
reform, become powerful collectives to guide the people of the 
province to develop the economy, arm the thinking with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, strictly implement democratic centralism, bring 
into play their overall functions, strengthen the improvement of 
administrative honesty, foster a good image, work solidly, and 
[words indistinct].
