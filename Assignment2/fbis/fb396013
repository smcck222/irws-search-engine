<F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Ambitious Plans Drawn To Expand Textile </F>
Exports"] 
  [Text] The China National Textile Import &amp; Export Corp 
(China Tex) intends to expand its export and import volume this 
year and set up more enterprises overseas. 
  China Tex is the country's leading overseas trader of 
textile 
goods. 
  It also manages exports of the country's finished and 
unfinished cotton products, including cotton yarn, cotton grey, 
cotton polyester yarn and cotton polyester grey. 
  Last year, the corporation's overseas trade amounted to 
$18.9 
billion, of which exports accounted for $15 billion and imports 
$3.9 billion. 
  This year China Tex plans to expand its overseas enterprises 
and envisions a multinational textile trading group, according 
to its president, Wang Ruixiang. The corporation has 34 
overseas branches in more than 20 countries and regions. 
  China Tex will also set up a large-scale production base for 
export-oriented goods, Wang said. The base would contain 
technology-intensive enterprises making famous-brand products. 
  Wang added that the company will also expand the production 
capacity of existing enterprises. 
  China Tex has invested more than 200 million yuan ($23 
million) in more than 80 industrial projects around the country. 
This investment has taken the form of shareholding and economic 
cooperation. 
  Last year it also established 13 business branches around 
the 
country. 
  Wang said that this year China Tex will try to develop new 
markets that depend less on the quota system. 
  And exports of unfinished cotton products are expected to 
rise this year, Wang said. 
  To improve administration, China Tex, the China Textile 
Commercial Association and the country's various cotton-trading 
corporations in port cities established the China Cotton Trading 
Centre last year. 
  In addition, the government approved the establishment of 
the 
China Yarn Import &amp; Export Corp. 
  This year the world market for unfinished textile products 
is 
promising, which bodes well for Chinese exports, Wang said. 
  On the other hand, Wang said, China should continue 
improving 
its management of exports since the country may face a shortage 
of raw materials, as well as financing for foreign trade 
companies. 
  Finished and unfinished cotton products are among the 
central 
government's list of 16 key goods controlled by a quota system. 
  In 1993, China's textile exports totalled $26 billion, or 
28.4 per cent of all exports. Textile imports amounted to $9.67 
billion, leaving a record trade balance of $16.33 billion. 
  China's textile industry maintains trade and technological 
relations with more than 140 countries and regions. 
  Hong Kong has the largest share of China's textile exports, 
31.99 per cent, and Japan the second largest, 19.62 per cent. 
  The United States and the European Union are also major 
markets for Chinese textiles.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO correspondent Yin Pinduan (1438 0756 4551) </F>
and XINHUA correspondent Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052)] 
  [Text] Nanjing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- A national meeting of 
organization departments under provincial, autonomous regional, 
and municipal party committees was held in Wuxi, Jiangsu 
Province, from 22 to 25 February. The meeting, sponsored by the 
CPC Central Committee Organization Department [CPCCCOD], focused 
on how to explore new ways to improve organizational work 
through investigation and study under the conditions of 
developing a socialist market economy. CPCCCOD Director Lu Feng 
and Deputy Director Zhao Zongnai spoke at the meeting. 
Principal leading comrades of Jiangsu Province, the Wuxi Party 
Committee, and the Wuxi Government attended the meeting. 
  As reform is deepening in all fields of endeavor, and as a 
socialist market economic system is being gradually established, 
a large number of new situations and problems have arisen in 
organizational work. Appropriate measures desperately need to 
be adopted through investigations and studies so as to further 
usher in a new situation of organizational work and to provide 
organizational guarantees for the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system as well as for reform, development, and 
stability. To this end, the CPCCCOD convoked the meeting to 
specially study how to further improve organization departments' 
investigations and studies as well as their macroeconomic 
guidance. 
  At the meeting, Comrade Lu Feng delivered a speech on how to 
energetically encourage the practice of conducting 
investigations and studies, how to provide better macroeconomic 
guidance, and how to practically improve organizational work 
under the new situation. First, he pointed out: Organization 
departments at all levels must have a clear understanding of the 
situation; must familiarize themselves with the overall 
situation of the work of the entire party; must proceed from the 
overall situation of the work to consider how to improve 
organizational work; and must deepen reform of the 
organizational and cadre systems through further emancipation of 
their minds and changes of their concepts. Energetically 
increasing efforts to conduct investigations and studies and to 
provide better macroeconomic guidance by organization 
departments at all levels is a fundamental measure for the 
improvement of organizational work as well as a basic method for 
the improvement of work style and for the enhancement of the 
level of organizational work. 
  Lu Feng stressed: While conducting investigations and 
studies, and while endeavoring to provide better macroeconomic 
guidance, organization departments must always firmly bear in 
mind the theme of strengthening and improving party building as 
well as party leadership. They must succeed in integrating the 
emancipation of the mind by seeking truth from facts under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; must discuss and handle important 
affairs by taking into consideration the overall situation; must 
spend time on gaining an in-depth understanding of the real 
situation so as to familiarize themselves with the situation, 
find out exactly where the problems exist, and come up with 
practical measures for improvement; must display initiativeness 
and creativeness; and must pay attention to grasping a few 
conspicuous problems and dealing with them until they are solved 
so as to create new experiences. Leading comrades of 
organization departments at all levels must take the lead in 
conducting investigations and studies so as to gain the 
initiative in carrying out their work. 
  Lu Feng urged comrades of organization departments to have a 
strong sense of responsibility and a strong sense of having 
undertaken a mission; to boldly explore, work industriously, 
increase efforts to conduct investigations and studies, and 
provide better economic guidance; and to usher in a new 
situation of organizational work. 
  At the meeting, Zhao Zongnai delivered a speech entitled 
"Study New Situations and Solve New Problems With the Spirit of 
Reform in Order To Provide Organizational Guarantees for the 
Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System." He 
pointed out: An important historical mission of our 
organizational work is to provide organizational guarantees for 
the establishment of a socialist market economic system. If the 
organization front wants to shoulder this historical mission and 
continuously usher in new situations, it must make efforts in 
many areas. A very important one among them is to increase 
efforts to conduct investigations and studies as well as to 
provide better macroeconomic guidance. He urged organization 
departments at all levels to energetically encourage the 
practice of conducting investigations and studies; to integrate 
such investigations and studies with the establishment of rules 
and regulations; and to turn the achievements scored from 
conducting investigations and studies into measures, methods, 
rules, and regulations for reform. 
  At the meeting, 10 provinces and municipalities--including 
Shanghai, Beijing, Jiangsu, and Shandong--gave briefings on 
their experiences in conducting investigations and studies; they 
also conducted extensive exchanges at group meetings. As a 
result, comrades attending the meeting gained a further 
understanding of the necessity and importance for organization 
fronts to increase efforts to conduct investigations and studies 
and to provide better macroeconomic guidance; they also decided 
on the tasks for their respective studies with full confidence. 
  Among those who participated in the meeting were comrades in 
charge of organization departments of the party committees of 
all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly 
under the central government across the country; directors of 
research offices under the party committees mentioned above; 
comrades in charge of or research office directors of 
organization departments of party committees of 10 cities; and 
comrades in charge of the organization, personnel, or research 
departments of the State Planning Commission, the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission, the State Economic and Trade 
Commission, the Ministry of Personnel, and the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions.

  [Excerpts] The Second Session of the Eighth Jiangxi 
Provincial People's Congress concluded successfully this 
afternoon after fulfilling various items on its agenda. With a 
feeling of great joy, people's deputies walked into Nanchang's 1 
August Auditorium at 1430 to attend the closing ceremony of the 
second session of the eighth provincial people's congress to 
exercise again the sacred right conferred on them by the people 
of the whole province. 
  The executive chairmen of the presidium -- Mao Zhiyong, Zhu 
Zhohong, Lu Xiuzhen, Wang Zhaorong, Chen Guizun, Wang Guoben, 
Wang Zhongfa, and Hu Dongtai -- were executive chairmen of the 
session, and were seated on the front row of the rostrum. Those

  The session maintained: In 1993, the whole province further 
emancipated its minds, sought truth from facts, seized the fine 
opportunity, and accelerated development. Marked achievements 
were made in our province's economic construction, reform, 
opening up, and various undertakings in society. In the course 
of organizing economic work of the whole province, our 
provincial government gained a clear understanding of the 
situation very early, took prompt action, and grasped its work 
expeditiously. Governments at all levels did much effective 
work. 
  The session pointed out: The guiding thought, tasks, 
targets, policies, and measures defined by our government work 
report for our national economic and social development in 1994 
conform with reality, and can be achieved through our hard work. 
  The session stressed: This year is a crucial one for the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system. It is 
also an important year in which we will concentrate our efforts 
on speeding up infrastructure projects and pushing Jiangxi's 
economy to a new height. We must correctly handle the 
relationship among reform, development and stability; seize the 
favorable opportunity; deepen reform; expand opening up; promote 
development; and safeguard stability. We must accelerate the 
pace of establishing our socialist market economy system, and 
must strengthen and improve macroscopic regulation and control 
so as to maintain the sustained, rapid and healthy development 
of our national economy. We must promote the building of our 
socialist spiritual civilization, and the all-round progress of 
the society. 
  The session called on people of the whole province to arm 
their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the leadership of 
the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, 
they must unite as one, be of one heart and one mind, explore 
their way forward, and make still greater contributions to 
invigorating Jiangxi. 
  Participants in the session unanimously voted for six 
resolutions by a show of hands. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Station Commentary: "Mobilize the Enthusiasm of Cotton </F>
Peasants, and Work Hard to Bring About an Upsurge in Cotton 
Production"] 
  [Text] This year, the province has set forth the fighting 
goal of growing 18 million mu of cotton and producing 18 million 
dan of cotton. The key to fulfilling this goal is to make 
peasants more enthusiastic in growing cotton. Now, some cadres 
and peasants have a lopsided view of cotton production. Some 
maintain that cotton is a low-efficiency crop and thus readust 
the agricultural production structure to lopsidedly reduce 
cotton growing acreage. Others only catch sight of a few minor 
projects whose efficiency is higher than that of cotton, and 
then put undue emphasis on diversified management to neglect and 
give up cotton production. Still others unreasonably compare 
the disaster-afflicted cotton fields with bumper-harvest grain 
fields and then draw the conclusion that growing cotton is less 
profitable than growing grain. All these ideas are extremely 
lopsided and harmful and negatively influence cotton production. 
  To make peasants more enthusiastic about growing cotton, we 
must clear up these lopsided ideas, widely propagate the 
important role played by the development of cotton production in 
developing high-yield and fine-quality agriculture, in 
invigorating rural economy, and in increasing peasants' income. 
By working out accounts and making comparisons, we should 
enable peasants to understand that developing cotton production 
is conducive to becoming prosperous. At the same time, all 
pertinent departments should set forth feasible measures to 
provide good service for peasants in growing cotton and help 
peasants solve practical problems in cotton production so that 
peasants will be more conscious in growing more cotton, in a 
better manner, with a view to bringing about an upsurge in 
cotton production.

  [Text] On 11 March, at the group discussion of Shandong 
deputation to the second session of the eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC], Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shandong 
Provincial Party Committee, said: The tasks we face this year 
are extremely heavy and arduous. We must have a good command of 
the overall situation, give prominence to focal points, and 
actually grasp well the three major events of reform, 
development, and stability to consolidate and develop the 
excellent situation. 
  Shandong deputation to the second session of the eighth NPC 
discussed and examined in eight groups the government work 
report made by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the State Council. 
They unanimously expressed agreement and support to the report. 
  In his speech to the group discussion, Jiang Chunyun 
emphatically dwelt on his opinions on the three major events of 
reform, development, and stability in line with Premier Li 
Peng's report and with Shandong's realities. Jiang Chunyun 
pointed out: We should go all out to carry out reform to tide 
over the barrier of reform. This year's reform is unprecedented 
in its scale, scope, depth, and difficulty. We should 
concentrate our energies on studying, promoting, and achieving 
success in reform. The reform of large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises should be regarded as the most important 
task. He said: To ensure the smooth progress of all reform 
measures, we must firmly embrace the overall concept, correctly 
handle the relations between the whole and the part and between 
the immediate interest and the long-term interest, consciously 
safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council, and maintain unanimity with the central 
authorities. We must fully mobilize and exploit the initiative 
and creativity of the broad masses of the people. Also, we must 
seek unity of understanding, clear the people from doubts and 
misgivings, and make concerted efforts to resolve the most 
difficult problems of reform this year. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: In accelerating development, we must 
focus on improving quality and efficiency. In guiding ideology, 
we should define the following several issues: First, we should 
effect an improvement in both quantity and quality. Without the 
improvement in quantity, we will be unable to meet the 
increasingly expanded market demands; and without the 
improvement in quality, the improvement in quantity will be 
restricted. Under the condition of the market economy, we must 
win victory through quality and new products. Second, we should 
not only maintain a relatively high growth rate but also pay 
attention to improving economic efficiency. We should truly 
shift economic work to improving economic efficiency. Third, we 
should not only develop the processing industry but also 
strengthen basic industries. In macroeconomy, we should give 
both guarantee and pressure on the processing industry and 
initiate the deep processing of precision products. At the same 
time, we should exert great efforts in developing agriculture to 
ensure the steady increase in output of grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops. We should pay attention to building such 
basic facilities as traffic and communications facilities and 
building energy resources and major raw materials projects in 
order to lay a solid foundation for increasing the momentum for 
further development. Fourth, we should not only pay attention 
to expanding the scale of production but also pay attention to 
carrying out technological transformation among old enterprises. 
Fifth, we should not only attach importance to the materials 
input but also strengthen scientific and technological input and 
development of intellectual resources. In policy and input, we 
should give special treatment to science, technology, and 
education to promote the great development of scientific, 
technological, and educational undertakings. Sixth, we should 
not only pay attention to production but also strive to expand 
markets, both domestic and international markets. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Reform and development must be 
guaranteed by social and political stability. We should adopt 
powerful and effective measures to maintain social stability in 
order to create a fine environment for reform and development 
and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist modernization 
drive.

  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai authorities 
have decided to restore the original shape of the financial 
street in The Bund in the 1930s in a bid to turn the city into a 
financial center in the Far East, a senior official said here 
today. 
  Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of 
the Chinese Communist Party, said that government offices 
located in The Bund have begun moving out. 
  The office building of the municipal government will be 
leased out through bidding, said Wu, who is here attending the 
annual session of the National People's Congress. He invited 
overseas investors and bankers to tender bids. 
  According to Mayor Huang Ju, all the proceeds from the 
bidding will be used for local infrastructure construction. 
  In the 1930s, Shanghai served as a financial center in the 
Asia-Pacific region. Then some 130 high-rises housed in The 
Bund major Chinese and foreign banks and consortiums. 
  Now, government departments concentrate in The Bund. The 
building of the municipal government used to house the head 
office of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. 
  A new company has been set up in Shanghai to handle matters 
related to moving and bidding. 
  Though the offer for leasing the municipal government 
building will exceed 100 million U.S. dollars, a number of 
investors have expressed their interest. The new site of the 
municipal government building will be in the People's Square in 
downtown Shanghai. 
  The Municipal Bureau of the Space Industry moved out of The 
Bund in December, earlier than any other government agencies. 
The bureau's building now serves as the site of the National 
Foreign Exchange Trading Center. 
  Shanghai now has 30 branches of foreign-funded banks. Last 
week the Citibank of the United States moved its Asian head 
office from Hong Kong to Shanghai.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Waigaoqiao bonded 
zone in Shanghai, the earliest and largest in China, has been 
operating well since the beginning of this year, a local 
official said here recently. 
  Last month 30 projects won approval in the zone, involving 
an 
investment of more than 16.9 million U.S. dollars, according to 
Fan Shuming, spokesman for the zone's management committee. 
Fourteen of the 30 projects are foreign-funded ones. 
  During January and February, the zone imported and exported 
more than 54.3 million U.S. dollars worth of commodities and 
transited 799,000 U.S. dollars worth of goods, Fan said. 
  In addition, more than 117 million U.S. dollars worth of 
products were manufactured and 4.7 million U.S. dollars worth of 
goods were stored in the zone, he added. 
  So far, the bonded zone, which was approved by the Chinese 
Government in June 1990 and went into operation last April, has 
approved 854 projects, involving an investment of more than 2.1 
billion U.S. dollars, handled over 300 million U.S. dollars 
worth of import and export commodities, 160 million U.S. dollars 
worth of transit goods, 12 million U.S. dollars worth of 
manufactured goods and over 200 million U.S. dollars worth of 
stored goods. 
  The bonded zone is planned to develop in an area of 10 sq 
km. 
  The first-phase project covered four sq km and was completed 
a year ahead of time. The second-phase project of six sq km has 
also started ahead of time, Fan said.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The commercial sector 
in east China's Zhejiang Province is stepping up efforts to 
generate more value from existing assets through the annexation 
of loss- making enterprises. 
  Commercial enterprises used to engage only in commodity 
sales. But this kind of resource distribution was often 
inefficient and failed to meet the demand in an increasingly 
competitive market. 
  Since 1992 such enterprises have been experimenting with 
annexing loss-making manufacturers and found that combining 
commerce with industry works to restore profitability. 
  Many commercial establishments with solid financial standing 
have opened their own factories, mostly through annexing 
inefficient industrial operations. 
  The assets flow in the commercial sector helps expansion of 
their businesses, creates a larger market share and brings in 
more business.

  [Text] Harbin, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Among 21 
state-approved border ports in northeast China's Heilongjiang

  Up to now, the ports have handled over 273,000 tons of cargo 
annually and 1.76 million businessmen entering and leaving China. 
  A transportation network has been established in the 
province, including airlines from Harbin, capital of the 
province, to Japan and CWIS, railways to Russia and shipping 
routes to Russia and Japan. 
  In 1993, the province's import and export volume rose to 
over 
2.6 billion Swiss francs.

  [Text] On the evening of 8 March the State Council 
sponsored a telephone conference on safe production. In 
concluding the conference (Zhang Wenzhu), deputy secretary 
general of the provincial people's government, delivered a 
speech in which he put forward demands for the province's work 
of safe production. 
  (Zhang Wenzhu) said: The province's situation in safe 
production in 1993 was as elsewhere in the country and a peak of 
production accidents cropped up again. The number of various 
accidents occurring in 1993 reached more than 28,000, resulting 
in the deaths of 4,800 persons. This is another large-scale 
increase in accidents since the first over-4,000-person 
occurrence of deaths recorded in 1992. The economic losses 
caused by these accidents last year reached more than 160 
million yuan and showed a 45.15 percent increase over 1992. 
Traffic accidents left the largest number of persons dead 
followed by deaths and injuries caused by industrial and mining 
enterprise accidents. 
  (Zhang Wenzhu) pointed out: The province's situation in safe 
production is still unstable though it has been somewhat 
alleviated since the beginning of this year. Important and 
appalling accidents still continue to occur. For this, the 
provincial people's government urges leading personnel at all 
levels and the responsible persons of enterprises to resolutely 
and successfully deal with the relations between security and 
production, between security and economic results, and between 
security and reform. A good job should be done in implementing 
the tasks of handling these relations. 
  (Zhang Wenzhu) stressed: We should seize the emphasis and 
weak link of safe production and do a good job in conducting 
safe production. In particular, we should enhance the security 
supervision and inspection over the key industries, trades, and 
departments of communications and over coal mines. We should 
also do a good job in conducting propaganda and education on 
safe production. As for personnel who will be in special posts, 
we should employ them through training and keep them in line 
with state regulations. 
  (Zhang Wenzhu) said: According to the state unified 
arrangements, we will launch the weekly campaign of safe 
production from 16 to 22 May this year. Through the campaign, 
we should foster a social environment in which everyone shows 
concern for security and pays attention to security in doing 
everything. 
  Listening to the telephone conference at various branch 
halls 
were leading personnel from the provincial people's government, 
from the people's governments of various cities, from the 
relevant departments and bureaus under the provincial level 
organs and various city level organs, and from the supervisory 
and procuratorial departments in charge of security management 
--about 300 persons in all.

  [Text] Shenyang, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The adoption of a 
new rice growing method has caused the water consumption of rice 
farms to drop almost by half and the yield to rise remarkably in 
Dashiqiao city, in northeast Liaoning Province. 
  Wang Chaoyang, the city's top agricultural official, said 
that since the new water-saving method was adopted, the average 
production of the city's 34,700 ha [hectare] of rice farms has 
increased from 7,500 kg to 9,750 kg per ha. 
  The water consumption for each ha of rice farm has dropped 
from some 27,000 to 15,000 cubic meters, the official said. 
  What is specially important about the new method, said the 
official, is that without it, nearly half of the city's 
rice-growing land would have been simply left wild for lack of 
water. 
  He said that each year the city has 2.4 million cubic meters 
of water available for its rice farms, while some four to five 
million cubic meters would be needed if the new method had not 
been adopted. 
  Experiments with the new method started in 1989, after a 
severe drought struck the area in the previous year and caused a 
large decrease in rice production, Wang recalled. 
  The water-saving method begins with the growing of rice 
seedlings. They are grown on dry nursery beds, rather than in 
the water as the old method requires. 
  The official said the new method grows seedlings with 
stronger roots and also saves labor. 
  There is also a change in the method of raking. Instead of 
raking after watering, rice fields are now raked while they are 
dry. 
  The new raking method can save 1,200 cubic meters of water 
on 
each ha of rice field. Besides, this makes the soil loose and 
warm, so that seedlings can grow faster, he said. 
  Another major change is the method of irrigation. Instead of 
keeping the land in water all the time, watering is done every 
six days and only after the land has dried up. 
  While saving water, the new method also saves the 
consumption 
of electricity and fuel, thus making rice growing more 
profitable for farmers, the official added.

<F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 16 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu Wednesday [16 March] ruled out the possibility of 
President Li Teng-hui visiting Russia in April. 
  Commenting on a report in the local press that the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia invited President Li to attend its 
party convention, Chien noted that it would be impossible to 
make arrangements for Li to visit a foreign nation in just two 
weeks. 
  The UNITED DAILY NEWS quoted the Ostankino National TV of 
Russia Tuesday as saying that the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, currently the biggest opposition political 
party in Russia, invited Li to attend a party convention 
scheduled to open April 2. 
  Meanwhile, Chien, speaking during an interpellation session 
at the Legislative Yuan, reiterated the government's policy of 
practicing parallel recognition. 
  Chien noted that Taipei did not ask the 10 foreign 
governments which established formal relations with the Republic 
of China [ROC] in recent years to sever diplomatic ties with 
Beijing in accord with the policy. 
  As Taiwan and Mainland China are two separate political 
entities under different rule, Chien said, Taiwan should also be 
allowed parallel recognition alongside Beijing in major 
international organizations. 
  Chien singled out Vanuatu as an example of the policy. 
  The ROC and Vanuatu signed a communique of mutual 
recognition 
on Sept. 26, 1991, despite Vanuatu's relations with Mainland 
China. 
  The communique specified that the two countries would not 
intervene in the other's foreign relations. 
  Chien explained that while there is a large gap between 
"recognition" and "formal ties," good mutual relations can be 
reached between two nations on the basis on mutual or parallel 
recognition, even without formal diplomatic ties, he said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- Beijing has no right to 
ask the Republic of China [ROC] to change its official 
designation in the Confederation of Asia, Pacific Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (CAPCCI), as a condition of its joining 
the group, said CAPCCI Honorary Chairman Jeffrey Koo Tuesday [15 
March]. 
  Koo said that he personally would not oppose Mainland 
China's 
participation in the civilian organization, which comprises 
chambers of commerce in 18 Asian countries. Mainland China's 
bid to participate in the regional body will be voted on by all 
other CAPCCI members. 
  Additionally, regardless of whether Beijing fails in its bid 
to join the group or not, the CAPCCI should not ignore the ROC's 
contribution to the organization, whose permanent secretariat is 
still based in Taipei, Koo added. 
  The 49th CAPCCI board meeting is scheduled to be held in 
Papua New Guinea on April 28. The CAPCCI is the only 
international organization in which the ROC takes part with its 
official name intact.

  [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- Chang Feng-hsu, president 
of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, will lobby for Taiwan's 
bid to host the 2002 Asian Games while at the executive board 
meeting of the Olympic Council of Asia. 
  The meeting, to be held March 26 and 27 in Bangkok, 
Thailand, 
will focus on reviewing some of the progress the city has made 
since it was chosen to host 1998 Asian Games. 
  The site of the 2002 Asian Games is expected to be decided 
during the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan this October. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee has selected 
the southern port city of Kaohsiung to represent Taiwan in its 
bid to host the 2002 Asian Games. 
  Kaohsiung beat out Taipei 12 to 7 with one absentation 
during 
voting Monday [14 March]. 
  The Olympic Committee' decision will be sent to the Ministry 
of Education and the Executive Yuan to await final approval.

  [Text] Taipei, March 14 (CNA) -- In the face of building 
international pressure to hit Taiwan with sanctions for its 
failure to sufficiently crack down on trade in endangered 
wildlife and wildlife parts, Taiwan on Monday [14 March] 
released the draft of a harsh conservation law. 
  The Council of Agriculture finished the revision of the 
draft 
Wildlife Protection Law, which provides for a jail term of up to 
seven years or a fine of NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 million 
(US$94,700) for those who violate the law. 
  The draft law, which was still being screened at the council 
Sunday afternoon, was sent to the Executive Yuan on Monday and 
will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval on [words 
indistinct]. 
  The rush comes at the same time the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is taking 
a serious look at a boycott proposal against Taiwan for its 
alleged "perfunctory" crackdown on the illegal trade of rhino 
horn and tiger bone. 
  More than 100 conservation representatives from 27 countries 
are gathering in Jerusalem for a four-day meeting at which 
Taiwan's wildlife protection efforts are to be discussed. 
  A nine-member Taiwan delegation is attending the meeting as 
an observer, but will at be allowed to attend any discussions. 
  In Taipei, a local conservation group, Green Consumers 
Foundation, denied accusations that Taiwan is a "black hole of 
smuggled animals." 
  "Even if there were a black hole, it was created by CITES's 
own inappropriate membership requirements," a foundation 
official said. "It is unreasonable not to give Taiwan membership 
while asking it to assume the due responsibility of a member." 
  Jay Fong, secretary-general of the foundation, is a member 
of 
the ROC delegation going to Israel. Fang plans to release an 
investigation report on illegal trade of tiger bone and rhino 
horn on the island.

  [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- Both government officials 
and entrepreneurs on Tuesday [15 march] expressed their concern 
about the negative influence Taiwan's joining the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) might have on domestic 
industries. 
  They did, however, agree that Taiwan's gaining entry into 
the 
Geneva-based world trade regulating body was "a must." 
  The points of view were expressed in a symposium organized 
to 
discuss the impact GATT membership will have on Taiwan and 
countermeasures Taiwan can take to protect itself from the 
opening of its market to foreign competition. 
  Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this 
year. 
  The meeting was cosponsored by Chinatrust Commercial Bank 
and 
the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. 
  Jeffrey Koo, the chairman of both the bank and the 
institute, 
urged the government to make cautious assessments before 
substantially opening the domestic financial sector to 
foreigners. "The government must take into account the scope of 
the domestic market and the financial sector's adjustment 
problems," he said. 
  Hsueh Chi, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Council for 
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), noted that financial 
liberalization has paved the way for Taiwan's economic 
development. 
  Between 2000 and 2005, he forecast, Taiwan's GATT membership 
would help push up annual foreign trade by 15 to 20 percent and 
annual growth of the gross national product by 1 to 2 percent. 
Taiwan's foreign trade totaled about US$160 billion last year, 
while the GNP was NT [New Taiwan] $5.61 trillion (US$212 
billion). 
  Hsueh, however, conceded that the gains would inevitably be 
at the expense of certain industries. 
  Liu Kuo-chao, president of the Taiwan Electric Appliance 
Manufacturers Association, pointed out that the electric 
appliance sector will certainly be affected by the change of 
rules in government procurement caused by Taiwan's accession to 
GATT. 
  As a large part of demand for engineering, computers, and 
telecommunications comes from the government's major 
construction projects, the three sectors will be adversely 
affected, Liu explained. 
  To cope with the possible impact on the domestic food 
industry, Huang Nan-tu, president of the Wei Chuan Group, called 
for coordinated efforts among domestic manufacturers. "We 
should work together in a new effort to tap foreign markets, 
thereby ushering in a new era," he said. 
  Chen Sheng-tien, chairman of the Shampo Group, suggested 
that 
the government take a step-by-step approach to lower tariffs in 
order to minimize the negative impact GATT would have on 
domestic industries.

  [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- In contrast to dull 
trading of machinery on the international market last year, 
Taiwan's machinery exports grew by 19 percent from 1992 to reach 
US$6.62 billion in 1993, the Taiwan Association of Machinery 
Industry reported Tuesday [15 March], citing customs statistics. 
  The increase was the highest in five years, and helped 
machinery exports account for 7.85 percent of Taiwan's total 
exports last year, up 7.2 percent from 1992, the association 
said. It added that the importance of the machinery industry to 
Taiwan's economy has been increasing noticeably thanks to 
continuously growing exports. 
  Market dealers attributed the eye-catching performance by 
the 
industry to the depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar and the 
successful exploitation of the mainland Chinese market by local 
machinery manufacturers. 
  They quoted customs tallies as saying that Taiwan sold 
US$2.43 billion worth of machinery to Hong Kong last year, with 
most of that being transshipped to Mainland China, an increase 
of US$928 million, or 61 percent, from 1992. Excluding exports 
to Mainland China, export volume grew by only US$128.3 million, 
or 3 percent. 
  The mainland market was the top export market for the 
machinery industry last year, absorbing as much as 37 percent of 
Taiwan's machinery exports. The United States took US$1.14 
billion, or 17.2 percent, of Taiwan's machinery exports, and 
Thailand, US$36.6 million. 
  But the growing presence of Taiwan-made machinery in 
Mainland 
China is also a clear indication that the reliance of local 
machinery makers on the mainland market is increasing and that 
the mainland fever among Taiwan business people has not eased 
despite the government's call for market diversification, 
industry sources said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- Taiwan is in a good 
position to become a regional operations base for foreign 
companies with interests in Mainland China, a senior official 
with the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) 
said Tuesday [15 March]. 
  "To reach this goal, Taiwan should allow mainland Chinese to 
receive professional training here," said CEPD Vice Chairman 
Hsueh Chi. 
  Hsueh quoted a survey by the Japanese branch of the US-based 
consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. as finding that many foreign 
companies have faced language barriers and other cultural 
problems while developing mainland markets. 
  As Taiwan and Mainland China share a similar cultural 
background and use same language, hsueh said foreign companies 
can use Taiwan as bridgehead for mainland investment. 
  "Foreign enterprises can employ Taiwan market research 
experts and managers to help collect business information and 
handle investment affairs on the mainland," Hsueh noted. They 
can also send their mainland employees to their Taiwan 
headquarters for professional training, he added. 
  Mainland residents are still not allowed to receive training 
in Taiwan. Hsueh said the government should consider lifting 
the ban as soon as possible in order to improve Taiwan's 
prospects of becoming an Asia-Pacific regional operations center. 
  "Continued growth in economic exchanges across the Taiwan 
Strait is important to our bid to lure more foreign enterprises 
to set up regional operation bases on the island," he stressed.

  [Text] Brisbane, March 16 (CNA) -- Australia and the 
Republic of China [ROC] are scheduled to hold talks in Melbourne 
later this month to discuss expansion of the current air links 
between the two countries, the Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Office (TECO) in Canberra said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  TECO Representative Francias Li said the ROC delegation 
would 
be led by Sun Chao-liang, director-general of the Civil 
Aeronautics Administration, and his Australian counterpart would 
be Australia's representative in Taiwan. 
  Officials from the Australian Transport Department, 
Australian Asia Airlines (AAA), Eva Air and Mandarin Airways 
will take part in the two-day meetings on March 24 and 25. 
  Li said the ROC delegates are expected to arrive in 
Melbourne 
on March 23. 
  "The purpose of the meeting is to discuss bilateral 
expansion 
of the current air links between our two countries," he said. 
  He said the issue was first raised by the officials of AAA, 
a 
subsidiary of Qantas Airways, last year. 
  Australia signed an aviation agreement with the ROC in early 
1991. 
  AAA inaugurated its flights to Taipei from Sydney and 
Brisbane on October 11 the same year. 
  Mandarin Airways followed suit a week later with direct 
flights between Taipei and Sydney. Eva air started flying to 
Sydney and Brisbane from Taipei in September 1993. 
  Under the 1991 agreement, airlines from the two countries 
are 
allowed to provide four weekly flight between Taipei and Sydney 
and Brisbane. Additional flights on this route have to be 
approved first by either Taipei or Canberra. 
  AAA has maximized its services with four weekly flights 
while 
Mandarin and Eva provide two weekly flights each. 
  But a faster-than-expected tourist flow from Taiwan to 
Australia last year has called for more flights and the airlines 
operating the route are very profitable, airlines officials said. 
  Eva Air has been forced to offer an extra flight to meet 
growing demand, company representative in Sydney Peter Kwoh said 
in an interview. 
  "All airlines operating between Taipei and Sydney and 
Brisbane are making profits thanks to a surge in the number of 
tourists from Taiwan," he said. 
  The number of tourist arrivals from Taiwan going to 
Australia 
hit a record high of nearly 109,000 last year, up from 63,500 in 
1992, according to the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC). 
  Tourists from Australia going to Taiwan totalled more than 
20,000, up only slightly from a year earlier. 
  "The Taipei route has been known as the golden route for 
many 
years," Kwoh said, adding "because more and more affluent Taiwan 
residents like to travel overseas." 
  "They are big spenders in Australia," an ATC official said. 
  China Airlines, a parent company of Mandarin, said this 
month 
that its subsidiary would expand its current Taipei-Sydney 
flights to Brisbane later this year. 
  "I believe all the airlines operating between the ROC and 
Australia will cash in on the growing tourist flow to share a 
bigger market pie," TECO's Li said.

<F P=106> [By Greg Torode] </F>
  [Text] Confidential government papers reveal that Chinese 
officials are responsible for half of nearly 100 attacks on 
shipping around the South China Sea in the past 18 months. The 
papers, obtained by the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, have been 
cleared by the Security Branch and are expected to be handed by 
the Marine Department today to a visiting United Nations 
maritime safety official. 
  If there is no late editing of the papers, it will mark the 
first time the Government has released into the international 
arena concerns about Chinese official involvement in the 
attacks. Their release will follow heated exchanges between the 
Marine Department and Security Branch, which is fearful of Hong 
Kong overstepping its jurisdiction and offending China. 
  Admiral Thimio Mitropoulos, chairman of the International 
Maritime Organisation's safety committee arrived from Beijing 
yesterday after what he described as "frank and open" 
discussions with mainland foreign affairs, shipping and Customs 
officials. 
  The admiral's visit is being treated with extreme 
sensitivity 
by the Government. To avoid angering China, sources said, a 
planned press conference at the Government Information 
Department offices in Beaconsfield House had been hastily 
changed to the neutral airport departure lounge just before 
Admiral Mitropoulos leaves tomorrow. 
  The papers list 98 attacks and are compiled only from 
distress messages picked up by the Marine Department's rescue 
co-ordination centre since September 1992, without any input 
from local civil servants. About 47 attacks -- many violent 
with tens of rounds of bullets fired on ships leaving Hong Kong 
-- describe clear Chinese official involvement, identifying 
police, Customs, naval and army officers right down to serial 
numbers of patrol vessels. 
  In one attack listed, the uniformed officers claiming to be 
Chinese naval officers threatened to blow up the Panamanian- 
registered tanker World Bridge after hurling explosives on the 
deck and strafing it with machine-guns. The ship, managed by 
Hong Kong's World-Wide Shipping, did not stop and managed to 
outrun the attackers. Another tanker faced rockets and tracer 
fire in the same area, the report notes Reports from captains 
under fire outline lengthy chases at sea, grenade and rocket 
attacks and gun-point searches of cargo far from Chinese 
territorial waters. 
  Much of the information was deleted from an earlier 
government submission to a meeting in London of Admiral 
Mitropoulos' committee with the Foreign Office and Security 
Branch intervening to ensure the Marine Department did not stray 
from the topic of piracy by mentioning any Chinese involvement. 
Many of the cases are far from Hong Kong with no Hong Kong 
people involved, meaning Admiral Mitropoulos' visit could be the 
only chance for the Government to get the information into the 
international domain. China, like Hong Kong and Britain, is a 
member of the maritime organisation.

  [Text] Hong Kong would face a legal vacuum in the period 
before and after the change of sovereignty in 1997 if a Court of 
Final Appeal was not set up by 1996, the Director of 
Administration Richard Hoare, warned yesterday. Confidence in 
the territory would be seriously affected, with international 
investors thinking twice because of the judicial uncertainty, he 
said. 
  Mr Hoare said the Government planned to secure passage of 
the 
bill authorising the establishment of the court by July 1995. 
He said one of the factors that concerned international 
investors was certainty and Hong Kong was renowned for its 
stable system of law. "Once you start to introduce uncertainty 
into the system you will start to unravel everything," he said. 
Mr Hoare said the situation would get worse as 1997 approached. 
  Legislators and the administration have been locked in a 
dispute over the setting up of the Court of Final Appeal since 
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group reached an agreement on the 
body in autumn 1991. While the diplomatic body agreed that the 
number of overseas judges sitting on the five-member court 
should be confined to one, both liberal and conservative 
legislators maintain that the arrangement went against the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law. Legislative Councillors have 
vowed to vote down any government bill drafted along the line of 
the Sino-British accord and none has indicated they have had 
second thoughts on their original position. 
  Although the Government had earlier indicated that the draft 
on the complex legislation would be available for consultation 
with the legal profession some time this year, Mr Hoare 
yesterday for the first time offered a clear legislative 
timetable. Noting possible pressure from the Legislative 
Council [Legco], Mr Hoare urged the lawmakers to have a second 
look before proposing any amendments. 
  Mr Hoare said the draft bill would be submitted to the 
Executive Council next month, before consultation with China and 
the legal profession. It was planned the bill would be tabled 
in Legco towards the end of the year. 
  Mr Hoare stressed that the Court of Final Appeal must be set 
up in 1996 as it usually took a year for cases to reach the 
Privy Council, so that process had to be terminated before 
mid-1996. The Government therefore wanted to secure the passage 
of the bill by July 1995 or the consequences would be serious, 
he said. Without the bill, he envisaged a legal vacuum of 
two-to-three years on the basis that some time would be expected 
to be taken by the future Special Administrative Region 
legislature to establish such a court. 
  United Democrat legislators have already indicated that they 
would introduce an amendment to the bill if the Government 
insisted on the Sino-British version of restricting the number 
of overseas judges to one. But Mr Hoare warned that if the 
amendment succeeded, the Government might set up the court 
according to Legco's decision, bearing in mind that it would be 
disbanded after the change-over. Or the Government would simply 
withdraw the legislation and notet up the court, he said. "It 
would not in anyway help to resolve the problem," said Mr Hoare. 
He said it was essential for the top level court to be set up 
by the handover to ensure a smooth running and operation before 
then.

<F P=106> [By Rain Ren and Chip Tsao] </F>
  [Text] China yesterday revealed that Beijing could give 
CAAC a big slice of Cathay Pacific's Hong Kong market after 
1997. A Chinese official with responsibility for aviation 
policy said that lack of British cooperation over air service 
agreements between Hong Kong and other governments would lead to 
the termination of any agreement not approved by the Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG). 
  "The natural outcome will be that CAAC (the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China) will get into the market after 1997," 
the official said. "In principle, after Hong Kong reverts to 
Chinese rule, the British companies should retreat from the 
territory and Chinese or Hong Kong companies should take over. 
  "But in practice, taking account of reality, we accept the 
fact that some British companies have been operating quite well 
and have established a reputation among customers. 
  "They deliberately withhold the texts of these agreements to 
try to maintain the status of domination of Cathay Pacific over 
Hong Kong's air services." 
  The official argued that Cathay Pacific by itself could not 
cope with the increasing demands of the market. "It cannot even 
cope with two cities in Germany," he said. "There is no point 
to try to undertake the whole thing. Besides the CAAC will not 
throw it out. We can compete together (against foreign 
airlines)." 
  Cathay Pacific has long been Hong Kong's de facto flag 
carrier, with monopoly rights on most routes. It has been given 
the rights to fly to countries which have air service agreements 
with Hong Kong, while its sister company, Dragonair, covers 
mainly mainland routes. The other registered airline, Air Hong 
Kong, carries only cargo. 
  The Chinese official accused Britain of being reluctant to 
hand over documents and information concerning air services 
which have not yet been initialled by Hong Kong for discussions 
at the JLG. So far only eight out of about 30 air service 
agreements have been officially approved by the JLG. This 
leaves more than 20 at risk, should China fulfil its promise to 
revoke all agreements not approved by the JLG. 
  Phil Burfurd, public relations manager of Cathay Pacific, 
yesterday played down the threat to Cathay. "We anticipate that 
we can keep our normal operation way beyond 1997," he said. 
"The air service agreements are done on a governmental basis. 
We are keen to see the agreement finalised." 
  A British official maintained that the British were showing 
a 
full spirit of co-operation over this issue. "These are rather 
complicated issues involving not only governmental agreements 
but commercial confidences applied to airlines. We have to be 
very careful about how these things are handled," the official 
said. 
  "If Hong Kong is, as provided for under the Joint 
Declaration, to have its own aviation regime and its own 
airlines it does not really matter who the owners of the 
airlines are Cathay has mainland shareholders anyway," he said. 
"We have attached great importance to preserving Hong Kong's 
aviation strength, one of the things which has made Hong Kong so 
successful. I believe Cathay, as a main Hong Kong airline, 
wants to preserve a satisfactory service regime along with all 
its aviation partners."

<F P=106> [By Tad Stoner] </F>
  [Text] TVB has been accused of self-censorship because of 
a decision not to show the anti-Beijing documentary Laogai: 
Inside the Chinese Gulag. Nine days before it was to broadcast 
the programme, the station replaced it in the schedules with a 
BBC Horizon documentary on tuberculosis. The station denies the 
documentary was pulled for political reasons. 
  Last night the chairman of the influential human rights 
organisation Justice, Nihal Jayawickrama, said he may refer TVB 
to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. 
  Laogai sketches a portrait of China's nationwide network of 
so-called "reform through labour" camps -- detention centres 
where dissidents and delinquents are held, frequently without 
trial. The 50-minute documentary was scheduled for TVB's 
English-language Pearl channel on December 4, last year. At 
about the same time, TVB also decided not to screen the 
controversial one-hour BBC documentary Mao Zedong: The Last 
Emperor. The station has not screened the highly critical 
examination of the late Chinese Communist Party chairman saying 
the public was not interested. It broadcast its own production, 
Mao Fever, in December. 
  A range of community leaders, including legislators, urban 
councillors and media commentators, have accused TVB of 
self-censorship, a charge the station denies, although it has no 
plans to screen the BBC programme and Beijing has been vocal in 
its opposition to it. 
  A station spokeswoman Lily Chan, yesterday denied that 
self-censorship had motivated the cancellation of Laogai: 
Inside the Chinese Gulag. "It was purely a programming 
arrangement," she said. Cecilia Tan, the TVB controller of 
programming, said. "It's difficult to explain programming 
decisions. If you think of the number of programmes we run per 
day, during one year, it's more fair to comment on what has been 
scheduled. I would not care to comment on what has not 
appeared," she said. Veronica Chiu, the publicity manager for 
the Pearl channel, said the December 4 schedule was only 
tentative, and the cancellation had been "routine and normal". 
"There were no other political reasons," she said. 
  Jayawickrama, the chairman of Justice, called the refusal to 
show the programme "tragic". Justice is the Hong Kong chapter 
of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists which 
holds an advisory seat at the UN. "The problem with 
self-censorship is that it's a manipulation of information," he 
said. "It's far more dangerous than government censorship 
because nobody knows about it, and here is an institution whose 
sole rationale for existence is the dissemination of 
information. This is one of the matters that the (UN's) Human 
Rights Commission would be quite interested in. We've referred 
TVB to the commission in the past and we would do it again." 
  Another Justice member Hing-lee Wong, said TVB had done a 
disservice to Hong Kong. "I think it's ridiculous. We should 
be attacking the Government's licensing policy, and I plan to do 
something about this myself," Wong said. TVB is facing a 
mid-term review of its licence, although broadcast policymakers 
at the Recreation and Culture Branch have refused to become 
embroiled in self-censorship and scheduling disputes. 
  A Chinese dissident, Lau Shan-ching, who spent 10 years in a 
Guangzhou jail and has organised a series of private Hong Kong 
showings of Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor, said he was appalled 
by the cancellation. "TVB seems to have changed its policy with 
the intention not to make the Chinese angry because (the station 
has) expanding interests in China." A Liberal Party legislator, 
Christine Loh, said self-censorship was a serious denigration of 
Hong Kong's civil liberties.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- A business executive 
from Hong Kong said Hong Kong's future economy will be mainly 
affected by there factors: the China factor, the factor within 
Hong Kong's own economy and the international factor. 
  Liu Chi Keung, chairman of the Flow Chart International 
Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong, said that if effective measures are 
formulated to cope with changes in these factors, "Hong Kong's 
economy will be able to maintain its stability." 
  The China factor is the most important one for maintaining 
Hong Kong's prosperity, said Liu, who is here attending the 
ongoing session of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference. 
  He said, "I think that as long as the Chinese mainland 
continues to implement the policy of reform and opening up and 
maintains the momentum of its robust economic growth, Hong 
Kong's economy will have a powerful backing and its market will 
continue to prosper." 
  The formulation and readjustment of the mainland's economic 
policies will have a significant impact on Hong Kong's economic 
expansion, he noted. 
  To this end, he said, the mainland should maintain the 
continuity of its policies, and take into consideration the 
interests of both big and small businesses in Hong Kong so that 
they will be able to gain good returns on their investment in, 
and trade between, the mainland and Hong Kong. 
  Speaking of the factor within Hong Kong's own economy, he 
said that this is crucial to Hong Kong's continued prosperity 
and stability. 
  Several big projects being undertaken in Hong Kong are, in a 
sense, spurring economic growth there during the present 
transitional period, he said. But, he added, therein also lie a 
number of hidden problems. 
  He said that under the pretext of "returning wealth to the 
people," Hong Kong's budget unveiled recently by its finance 
secretary has caused a sharp rise in the prices of buildings and 
high inflation as well. 
  Consequently, the future government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) might face an economic slide when it 
takes over the management of Hong Kong's economy, he noted. 
  He expressed the hope that relevant mainland government 
departments should beware of man-made chaos in Hong Kong in the 
financial sector during the transitional period. 
  The future Hong Kong SAR Government should tighten control 
over the financial market in Hong Kong to enable the factor 
within Hong Kong's economy to be "sound and orderly." 
  As for the international factor, he said that Hong Kong's 
economy has become a component of the global economy. 
  Therefore, changes in the international economic environment 
will produce a major impact on Hong Kong's smooth transition and 
prosperity, he said. 
  So far as the Hong Kong stock exchange is concerned, 
hundreds 
of millions of investment dollars from Britain, Japan, the 
United States and the rest of the world are often traded there 
daily, resulting in steep ups and downs in stock prices. 
  "Such ups and downs will also have a tremendous impact on 
Hong Kong's economic growth," he pointed out. 
  For this reason, efforts should be made to prevent 
international consortiums from causing man-made fluctuations in 
stock prices, he said. 
  Furthermore, protectionism pursued by some countries, 
China's 
most-favored-nation trading status with the U.S., the resumption 
of China's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, and entrepot trade will also affect Hong Kong's economic 
development, he said. 
  Counter-measures should be taken promptly to reduce the 
adverse effects of these factors to a minimum, he said in 
conclusion.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sino-U.S. Trade Will Continue"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has 
concluded his visit to China. Both sides are still taking a 
forward-looking attitude toward the development of Sino-U.S. 
relations. Both sides maintain that "Sino-U.S. relations are 
very important and are willing to promote the improvement and 
development of relations between the two countries." Warren 
Christopher said: "Bill Clinton is determined to establish 
extensive and more constructive relations with China. Both 
sides should seize the opportunity and take action so that 
bilateral relations can be further developed." 
  China and the United States have crossed swords frankly and 
seriously on the human rights issue, but both sides have taken a 
century-straddling long-term view toward the potential for 
developing the relations between the two countries and 
safeguarding the common interests of maintaining international 
peace and security. This has enabled the two sides to reach 
consensus on five areas, in which cooperation is possible. 
First, both sides have agreed to continue to maintain the 
momentum of high-level exchanges between the two countries. In 
April this year, Song Jian and Wu Yi will attend a meeting of 
the Sino-U.S. Science, Technology, Commerce, and Trade Committee 
in the United States. This indicates that both sides want to 
develop cooperation in science, technology, economy, and trade. 
Second, the U.S. side has reaffirmed its firm support to the 
restoration of China's status as a signatory state to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Third, China and the 
United States have agreed to resume and develop exchanges 
between the armed forces of the two countries, and both sides 
have agreed to establish a committee for using the national 
defense industry to produce products for civilians. Fourth, the 
Chinese side has agreed to allow a U.S group to come to China in 
the near future to carry out on-the-spot investigations on three 
cases of missing U.S. personnel during the war in Vietnam. 
Fifth, China and the United States have signed a statement on 
cooperation in implementing the memorandum on prison products. 
  These results show that both China and the United States are 
calmly aware of the tremendous benefits of bilateral 
cooperation. This is in the interest of both countries. The 
common interest of both sides is not confined to the economy. 
On many hot spot issues of the world, China and the United 
States need coordination and cooperation at the UN Security 
Council. Both China and the United Stated have a tremendous 
influence on international affairs and share some identical 
views. They absolutely are capable of joining hands in settling 
regional security and peace issues. Without China's 
cooperation, the United States will not be able to properly 
resolve many problems. Therefore, if the United States adopts a 
policy of isolating China, it will also be isolated, and this 
does not conform with its interest. 
  The Seattle Conference has laid a framework for the 
development of Sino-U.S. relations. Since Warren Christopher 
has admitted that the United States is not seeking a change in 
China's social system but hopes to establish extensive and 
stable relations with China, the question of how China and the 
United States should get along peacefully has become the key to 
developing relations in the future. 
  It is impossible to have genuine cooperation if one side 
exerts pressure on the other side while talking about 
cooperation and compels the other side to submit to, and act 
according to, its will, treating the other side as a dependent. 
Nor is it possible to develop long-term stable relations if one 
country compels the other country to implement the 
administrative order of its president and its laws. 
  Warren Christopher's diplomatic approach during his recent 
visit to China remained an attempt to take a high-handed policy, 
a practice which has divorced itself from the tide of history. 
The U.S. national strength is less than it was in the past, and 
the United States can no longer impose its will on its Western 
allies in many international issues. The United States met with 
a soft rebuff on the issues of Bosnia and Somali. In dealing 
with its relations with Russia and Japan, the United States 
failed to attain the anticipated results, despite the pressure 
it had exerted. Even in handling its contradictions with Haiti 
and the Philippines, the United States can no longer implement 
the policy of wielding a big stick. 
  There are differences between China and the United States on 
the human rights issue, and such differences do not only exist 
between China and the United States. Similar sharp differences 
also exist between the United States and many Third World 
countries. In order to settle the differences, the United 
States has adopted the policy of the stick and has advocated the 
linkage of human rights with most favored nation trade status. 
It has asserted that there are only a little over two months 
left, and it is quite possible that the United States will not 
give most favored nation trading status to China. This of 
course has evoked the strong opposition of China. China has 
advocated the separation of human rights from the most favored 
nation issue. How can China submit to the United States and 
accept the instructions of the administrative order of the U.S. 
President? Would China not become the 51st state governed by 
the U.S. President if it made such a concession? 
  The Chinese people have struggled over the past century and 
more to make their country independent. Succeeding in making 
the people rich and the country strong means the realization of 
the right to subsistence and the right to development, the most 
important human rights. Through thorough and frank dialogues 
during his recent visit to China in his capacity as secretary of 
state, Warren Christopher has very concretely understood China's 
national policies and principles on the concept of human rights 
and has understood that the three joint declarations remain the 
foundation of Sino-U.S. relations. The spirit of these three 
declarations is mutual noninterference in one another's internal 
affairs. 
  Most favored nation status is not a favor which is bestowed 
but is given mutually. The development of Sino-U.S. trade will 
benefit both sides. Nevertheless, China will never agree to 
become a dependent and lose its sovereignty and independence. 
It will never act according to the order of the U.S. President 
for the sake of most favored nation trading status. 
  Qian Qichen said yesterday: "I believe that Sino-U.S. trade 
will continue." This is China's assessment of the prospects for 
Sino-U.S. trade. 
  The U.S. Secretary of State came to visit China in order to 
solve problems. The pattern was already fixed at the Seattle 
Conference; China and the United States share an understanding; 
and both the American business circles and people favor the 
development of cooperation and diplomatic relations with China. 
The two sides are currently at a difficult stage; however, 
there should be ways to overcome the difficulties. Is it not 
probable that the U.S. President will handle his own 
administrative order after all?

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party (CPC), met here this afternoon with 
Japanese Diet member Susumu Nikaido, adviser to Japan's Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  Jiang welcomed Nikaido and his party, saying that Nikaido, 
an 
old friend of the Chinese people, had made outstanding 
contributions in helping the former Japanese Prime Minister 
Kakuei Tanaka in 1972 realize the normalization of bilateral 
relations and the development of Sino-Japanese friendly 
relations. 
  Jiang said that since the normalization of bilateral 
relations, friendly cooperation between the two countries in all 
fields had made much progress and bilateral relations had 
entered a new stage. 
  He pointed out that China has long paid much attention to 
the 
development of a good-neighborly relationship with Japan, hoping 
that the two countries will continue to enhance understanding 
and strengthen cooperation so as to bring Sino-Japanese 
relations to a new height. 
  Jiang said: "I met with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa last year in seattle and we are expecting Hosokawa to 
visit China." 
  Nikaido said that since relations between the two countries 
returned to normal in 1972, bilateral friendly relations and 
cooperation have been developing. 
  He said that although he was now aged 84, he would try to 
contribute to the further development of bilateral friendly 
relations. 
  President of the China-Japan Friendship Association Sun 
Pinghua and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan took part in the 
meeting. 
  Nikaido and his party came here at the invitation of the 
China-Japan Friendship Association. 
  Before coming to Beijing, Nikaido attended a ceremony on 
March 12 to mark the completion of the Shanghai Baori 
High-Molecular Material Co., which is a joint venture between 
the Shanghai Metallurgical Construction Corporation and the 
Sanken Industry Co. of Japan. The joint venture is expected to 
produce heat-insulating and fire-proof materials.

<F P=106> [From the "National News Hookup" or "Night News" program] </F>
  [Text] The information center of the Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and the Second Session 
of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held a news conference 
at the Great Hall of the People this morning. Qian Qichen, vice 
premier of the State Council and concurrently minister of 
foreign affairs, was invited to answer reporters' questions on 
the international situation and China's foreign policy. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified XINHUA reporter] I am a 
XINHUA reporter. I wish to ask Minister Qian: In Detroit the 
day before yesterday, U.S. President Cinton expressed 
disappointment over the results of Secretary of State 
Christopher's visit to China. What is your view in this regard? 
What is your estimation of the possibility of the U.S. granting 
China most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment? Thanks. 
  [Qian Qichen] Concerning Secretary of State Christopher's 
visit, I am also somewhat disappointed. Because it could have 
made more achievements [cheng guo] as was expected. However, 
now through this visit, we have reached a number of agreements. 
We have still made some achievements, but the achievements are 
not as many as expected. Meanwhile, regarding the MFN treatment 
I think it should be said that if it can be maintained, it will 
be good news to both China and the United States; otherwise, it 
will be bad news for both countries. 
  [Unidentified reporter] My question is that following the 
announcement of the joint communique of the Chinese and French 
Governments, relations between the two countries have been 
normalized. Not long ago, the French parliamentary speaker 
visited China and it was learned that the French premier will 
visit China next month. I wish to ask Vice Premier Qian what do 
you think is the outlook for relations between China and France? 
  [Qian Qichen] In the Sino-French Joint Communique on 
resuming normal relations between the two countries released on 
12 January this year, the French Government promised that in the 
future it will not plan to approve French enterprises' taking 
part in arming Taiwan. The meaning is quite clear. Later, I 
made an official visit to France. An important part of which 
was to make preparations for Premier Balladur's visit to China. 
Therefore, I am convinced that Premier Balladur's visit to 
China is a major event in relations between the two countries. 
It will have an important bearing on promoting bilateral 
relations, including economic and trade relations. The visit 
will take place in early April. [An international reporter 
starts to ask question but is cut off by an unidentified 
moderator] [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also answered reporters' 
questions on Sino-British Relations and relations between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with 
representatives and delegates from Hong Kong and Macao, who are 
participating in sessions of the National People's Congress 
[NPC] and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC], at the Diaoyutai State Guest House yesterday. Minister 
Qian also heads the Preliminary Working Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. 
  In the meeting, the foreign minister said there is no 
question that the policy of having two systems in one nation 
will prove valid for Hong Kong. He predicted all targets 
provided in the Basic Law on the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region will be achieved by all means, and Hong 
Kong after 1997 will be more prosperous and developed than it is 
now. 
  Foreign Minister Qian said the sessions of the NPC and the 
CPPCC this year were held in an amicable atmosphere as a result 
of the fact that China's reform and open-door policy has been 
very effective in boosting the national economy and in 
stabilizing society and the people's lives. The day before the 
opening of the second session of the Eighth NPC, the UK 
authorities in Hong Kong turned over the second part of Governor 
General Patten's so-called Political Reform Bill to the 
Legislative Council for deliberations. This is another UK action 
aimed at breaking up PRC-UK cooperation. The UK likes to mouth 
the word cooperation, but what the country is doing with respect 
to the Hong Kong issue goes completely against what it says. He 
said, therefore, China will not entertain itself with 
unrealistic illusions any more. 
  Minister Qian said that with the PRC-UK talks forthcoming 
China had foreseen this. He recalls when he met with Douglas 
Hurd, UK secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth 
affairs, in New York last October, he told the latter that at 
the PRC-UK talks there can come to only one of the two choices 
-- one is to come up with an agreement at the talks that will 
enable the political structural framework, which is born from 
elections conducted from 1994 to 1995, to continue after 1997; 
and the other is to fail to arrive at an agreement and the 
political structural framework created unilaterally by elections 
conducted by the Hong Kong authorities will be terminated on 30 
June 1997. 
  He added that China should secure the orderly transfer and 
long-lasting prosperity of Hong Kong in cooperation with many 
Hong Kong residents who love the fatherland and Hong Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA)-- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China's defence budget 
for 1994 has not gone up in real terms. 
  Qian made the assessment at a news conference here today. 
  China's military expenditure was 43.2 billion yuan in 1993 
and in 1994, the figure is 52 billion yuan, Qian said. 
  On the surface, there has been an increase, but inflation in 
1993 hit 13 percent. And this year inflation is expected to 
reach 10 percent. An increase in this year's military 
expenditure is to offset inflation, he said. 
  "For the Chinese military, therefore, the actual buying 
power 
has not gone up," the foreign minister said. 
  Military expenditure in 1994 accounts for 11 percent of the 
state budget, a proportion which has remained largely unchanged 
in recent years, he said. 
  And military spending accounts for less than 1.7 percent of 
the country's GNP, which actually represents a slight drop from 
last year's level. 
  In U.S. dollar terms, there is no change in the level of 
China's military spending, Qian said. 
  Compared with the military spendings of the United States 
and 
Japan, China's military spending is "a pittanc," Qian said. 
  China's central budget shows that the Chinese Government is 
concentrating its financial resources on developing its national 
economy instead of seeking to be a military power, he said.

<F P=106> [By Wang Shude (3769 2885 1795), Central People's </F>
Broadcasting Station reporter, and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang 
(0719 1807 2455)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- An all-Army work 
conference on the legal system concluded in Beijing today. Liu 
Huaqing, Standing Committee member [of the Political Bureau] of 
the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the Central 
Military Commission [CMC], as well as CMC Vice Chairman Zhang 
Zhen and CMC members Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyu met 
with the delegates during the meeting. Liu Huaqing said: 
Considerable results have been achieved in work related to 
military laws, but arduous tasks still lie ahead. I hope that 
all of you will continue to work hard. He stressed the work to 
strengthen the enactment and enforcement of military laws to 
bring about the administration of the military by the law. 
  State Councillor Chi Haotian, national defense minister and 
CMC member, attended and addressed the meeting today. He said: 
Administering the military by the law is an important component 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building during the 
new period. We should give the in-depth study and 
implementation of this thought the most prominent place in legal 
construction throughout the military and integrate them with the 
study and implementation of the gists of CMC Chairman Jiang 
Zemin's relevant instructions. The in-depth implementation of 
the CMC policy of administering the military by the law is a 
reliable guarantee for upholding the party's absolute leadership 
over the military under the new circumstances, an objective 
demand of adapting to the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system, a pressing need of strengthening national 
defense and military modernizations during the new period, as 
well as a fundamental measure for safeguarding state interests 
and service members' legitimate rights. Military legal 
construction for the period ahead consists mainly of tasks in 
six areas: We must conscientiously give military legal 
construction a prominent place in the overall perspective of 
national defense and military construction and bring about the 
synchronized development of such construction and the legal 
system by paying simultaneous attention to these two areas; we 
must draw up a complete set of military laws to cover every 
sector, aspect, and link in national defense and Army building; 
we must establish an operating mechanism which can guarantee the 
smooth implementation of military laws to give full play to the 
role of military laws as a guide, driving force, and safeguard 
for national defense and Army building; we must vigorously 
strengthen the supervision and inspection of justice, law 
enforcement, and laws to truly bring about a situation in which 
justice is administered in accordance with the law, all laws are 
enforced stringently, and every violation of the law is 
accounted for; we must carry out throughout the military 
extensive and deep-going propaganda and education on the legal 
system to lift the self-consciousness of the vast contingent of 
officers and men in observing and enforcing the law; and we must 
strengthen the building of legal organs and a contingent of 
cadres to prepare them for the tasks that their shoulders bear. 
Chi Haotian called for the conscientious strengthening of 
leadership to really satisfy the CMC requirements on military 
legal construction, including military legislation in the agenda 
of party committees, and to unite and organize forces, to make 
sure we achieve positive results; and he called for adherence to 
the proper principles of legislation to ensure the quality of 
work in drafting various military laws and regulations, and for 
the strengthening of the supervision and inspection of law 
enforcement to promote the implementation of various military 
laws and regulations. 
  The all-Army work conference on the legal system which 
opened 
in Beijing on 3 March with the CMC's approval is the first-ever 
meeting of its kind. The meeting earnestly implemented the 
demands of the party Central Committee and the National People's 
Congress [NPC] on strengthening legislative work, as well as the 
CMC policy of administering the military by the law; and 
emphatically studied such issues as quickening the pace of 
military legislation and opening up new prospects for military 
legal construction under the circumstances of adapting to the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system and of Army 
building during the new period. Attending the meeting were 
responsible persons from the three general departments and other 
major Beijing-based units of the People's Liberation Army, as 
well as relevant departments under the headquarters of the 
Chinese People's Armed Police Force. Responsible comrades from 
legislative work departments under the CPC Central Committee, 
the NPC, and the State Council also attended the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
intends to tighten controls on prices of basic goods and 
services. 
  The State Council has issued a circular announcing its 
decision to strengthen the supervision and examination of prices 
of people's everyday necessities and services. 
  The aim is to meet the needs of establishing a socialist 
market economic system but to standardize price behavior and to 
ensure stable living conditions for people, the circular said. 
  The goods and services referred to are those basic ones 
whose 
price changes would greatly affect ordinary people's living 
standards. 
  According to the circular, the intention is to supervise 
trends of prices through a price adjustment record system, to 
examine some of the price adjustments and to intervene only when 
necessary. 
  The goods and services whose price adjustment will be 
subject 
to supervision and examination cover 20 varieties, including 
flour, rice, edible vegetable oil, pork, beef and mutton, eggs, 
milk, salt, sugar, soybean sauce, detergents, coal for household 
heating and cooking, gas, rent, running water, tuition and 
assorted fees, nursery charges, health care expenses and urban 
transport fares. 
  Local governments will decide what items to supervise or 
examine in line with local conditions, the circular said. They 
must report any price adjustment to higher administrative 
departments for the record. 
  The circular pointed out that the means of adjustment and 
control must be strengthened and improved. 
  It said that a storage system should be established for 
important goods, including grain, cooking oil and meat. Grain 
risk funds should quickly be established at central and 
provincial levels and the fund system for price adjustments of 
non-staple food should be improved and popularized as soon as 
possible. 
  Price administration departments should set guide prices for 
some major goods to give enterprises a reference in pricing, or 
demand that the enterprises adhere to the prices when necessary, 
according to the circular. 
  Price administration departments may carry out temporary 
price control measures when prices of the basic necessities 
change too much, the circular said. The departments must 
regularly check the prices of the listed commodities and 
services.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Jiangsu Governor Chen Huanyou and Shandong </F>
Governor Zhao Zhihao by unidentified correspondents; from the 
"News and Press Review" program; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Listeners, the CPC Central Committee put forward 
that seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to 
the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability were the general goals for the party and the state. 
These 20 characters precisely show the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability. In recent years economic 
development in Jiangsu and Shandong have greatly attracted the 
people's attention. To know how they interpret and handle these 
relationships, we interviewed Chen Huanyou, deputy to the 
National People's Congress [NPC] as well as governor and party 
secretary of Jiangsu Province, and Zhao Zhihao, NPC deputy and 
governor of Shandong Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Secretary Chen, would you 
please tell us your opinion on how to effectively handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability in view 
of Jiangsu's practical situation? 
  [Chen] Yes, I would be very happy to answer your question. 
Reform, development, and stability are closely related. They 
complement and promote one another. They are three important 
aspects in our overall work, and can be seen as an entirety 
because they dovetail with one another. Reform is the motive 
force of development, and development and reform are the 
foundation of social stability. Maintaining social stability is 
the prerequisite for promoting development and accelerating 
reform. Over the past year, Jiangsu developed its economy, made 
major strides in reform and opening up, enjoyed social 
stability, improved the people's lives, and coordinated and 
promoted reform, development, and stability simultaneously. 
This year is an important year for us to accelerate reform. In 
light of Jiangsu's practical situation, we must first consider 
giving reform a special position, seizing current favorable 
opportunities, and mobilizing the broad masses of cadres and 
people to enthusiastically participate in and support reform. 
We should effectively resolve problems arising in the course of 
economic construction and reform in Jiangsu by deepening reform 
and accelerating development. Second, we should pay attention 
to raising the quality and efficiency of economic development 
and establish the idea in all fields that development is the 
final word. We should proceed from actual conditions. We cannot 
place undue emphasis on output value and blindly vie for the 
growth rate. Third, stability is a major event vital to the 
overall situation. While we should seize the opportunity of 
development, we should also thoroughly estimate and promptly 
discover difficulties and problems during the course of economic 
advance. We should conduct bold analysis, do a good job, and 
effectively deal with various contradictions and problems. 
  [Correspondent] Governor Zhao Zhihao, please tell us how 
Shandong handles the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability. 
  [Zhao] All right. To correctly handle the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability, and to strive to 
make the three promote each other and form a single entity, is 
the general demand set by the CPC Central Committee for this 
year's work. If the relationship among the three is handled 
effectively, they will promote one another and enjoy coordinated 
development. If the relationship is handled poorly, the three 
could impede one another and affect the overall situation. 
Therefore, our provincial party committee and government have 
decided to give top priority to reform this year. Under a 
responsibility system with proper division of work, responsible 
comrades of the provincial party committee and government have 
led groups of cadres in undertaking investigations and studies 
at grass-roots units to find new situations and resolve new 
problems, have popularized the practical experiences of 
grass-roots units, and have provided guidance for reform. 
  [Correspondent] Governor Zhao, if new contradictions and 
problems emerge in Shandong's economy, how do you deal with them? 
  [Zhao] If the economy develops too rapidly, many new 
contradictions will arise and the economic relationship will 
tend to be tense. For this reason, we generally do not demand 
administrations at lower levels to reach certain goals or 
accomplish certain tasks. All we emphasize is reforming the 
economic structure, carrying out technical transformation, and 
improving economic efficiency. In this way, we allow 
lower-level administrations more leeway in avoiding tense 
economic relationships. When making reform plans, we take the 
timing and scale of reform into consideration in order to make 
the plans feasible. Regarding social stability, we stress 
managing society according to law. At the same time, we 
undertake publicity and education campaigns among the broad 
masses of people in various fields to dissolve contradictions 
and arouse their initiative. We are especially concerned about 
those enterprises with difficulties in production and those 
operating at a loss; we would help them. We would also help 
people in disaster and poverty-stricken areas to improve their 
production and living standards. [end recording]

  [Text] Taipei, March 15 (CNA) -- A conference on 
international economic development assistance opened at the 
Taipei International Convention Center Tuesday [15 March] with 
some 50 local and foreign scholars and experts participating. 
  The two-day seminar was jointly sponsored by the 
International Economic Cooperation Development Fund (IECDF) and 
Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research. 
  Participants included officials from the IECDF, Foreign 
Ministry, World Bank and foreign envoys. The foreign guests 
came from the United States, France, Japan and Latin American 
countries. 
  Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said at the opening 
ceremony that the Republic of China [ROC] is dedicated to 
helping friendly foreign nations establish small and medium 
enterprises. 
  Chiang added that foreign aid is a mutually beneficial 
program which develops foreign friendship as well as boosts 
bilateral economic links. 
  Taiwan received foreign aid from the United States and Japan 
during 1970's, and now the two countries are Taiwan's major 
import sources, Chiang said. 
  Therefore, Taiwan's current economic aid to the Southeast 
Asian countries will eventually benefit Taiwan itself, Chiang 
said. 
  Chiang also said he hopes the foreign aid fund, currently 
set 
at NT [New Taiwan] $10.5 billion (US$396 million), can be 
increased to NT$30 billion (US$1.13 billion). 
  Since the government set up the IECDF in 1988 as an 
organization in charge of the ROC's economic assistance to 
friendly developing countries, a total of 17 loans worth over 
US$247 million have been approved. 
  In addition, the fund has given out technical assistance 
worth some US$11.8 million.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) wants to "foster closer 
relations with China and the members of the Asia-Pacific 
region," OPEC's Secretary General Dr. Subroto said here today. 
  Addressing the China petroleum investment conference which 
opened here today, he said China "offers much scope for oil 
exploration and development" and has "bright prospects for 
economic growth and the growth of the oil sector." 
  Therefore, he said, China "has a strong interest in helping 
to maintain a reasonable level of oil prices, which will 
encourage further investment." 
  The China petroleum investment conference, attended by a 
total of 329 delegates from 183 well-known multinational oil 
companies, banks and financial organizations and China's oil 
industry, is the highest-ranking international oil forum ever 
held in the country. 
  The delegates were expected to discuss issues concerning 
joint and cooperative exploration and development of China's oil 
and natural gas resources during the two-day conference. 
  Addressing the opening, Wang Tao, president of the China 
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), spelt out China's 
strategy to develop its oil industry. 
  He said China has opened its petroleum industry to the 
outside world and thus provided more opportunities to foreign 
investors. 
  He added that China welcomes world investors to cooperate in 
China's petroleum industry. 
  Sheng Huaren, president of the China Petrochemical 
Corporation (Sinopec), Wang Yan, president of the China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Zheng Dunxun, president of 
the China Chemical Import and Export Corporation (Sinochem), 
spoke on the development trends in China's oil and petrochemical 
industries. 
  Also present at the meeting were Omani Deputy Minister of 
Petroleum and Minerals Salem Shaban. 
  The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, CNPC, 
Sinopec, CNOOC and Sinochem, is designed to provide a forum for 
oil companies and financial institutions both in and outside 
China to increase understanding and exchange information.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
Nations (U.N.) are considering focusing their educational 
co-operation on helping China's primary education in 
poverty-stricken areas. 
  This was revealed here today by China's State Education 
Commission (SEC). 
  "Such a shift of focus in the next couple of years will be 
conducive for China to reach its goal of spreading nine-year 
compulsory education for all the children in the country by the 
year 2000," an SEC spokesman said. 
  He said the U.N. Children's Fund, Population Fund, 
Development Program and other U.N. organizations have in the 
past ten years provided China with free aid totalling 64 million 
U.S. dollars for ten educational projects. 
  At the same time, the Chinese Government put in five times 
this amount for these projects, he said. 
  The co-operation projects cover fundamental education, 
normal 
education, higher education, textbook compilation and population 
research, the official said, adding that every city and province 
in the Chinese mainland is involved in such projects. 
  The SEC spokesman said that advanced electronic devices have 
been deployed in the projects to train teachers for the 
poverty-stricken countryside. 
  Through training the principals of 1,000 primary schools in 
poor areas, their management personnel and some of the parents, 
95 percent of the eligible children in these areas have been 
enabled to go to school, he said. 
  Other aid projects include training centers for university 
management personnel, heads of primary and high schools and 
primary and secondary school teachers, he said. 
  Educators have been sent to other countries through such 
projects to receive training or attend academic conferences. 
"China's educational exchanges with world bodies and other 
countries have thus been further promoted," the SEC spokesman 
said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 7 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--From late 
February to early March this year, China made breakthrough 
progress in talks with representatives of the United States and 
the EU on China's readmission to the GATT. After Japan, 
Australia, and Canada had done so, the United States and the EU 
expressed their support for China's resuming GATT status. In 
other words, China has broken through important obstacles to 
reenter the GATT. If a basic agreement can be reached at the 
"16th Session of the GATT Working Party on China," which will be 
held in Geneva in mid-March, there will be more hope for China 
to resume GATT status. 
  China was an original GATT signatory in 1948. In 1949, the 
People's Republic of China was founded. Logically, it should 
have been entitled to continue GATT membership. However, the 
Kuomintang authorities, which had retreated to Taiwan, announced 
their withdrawal from GATT in March 1950. Since then, China's 
seat has been vacant. It was not until July 1986 that China 
formally asked to restore its GATT signatory status. But the 
light of China's return to GATT has appeared only after 
eight-odd years of marathon-like negotiations, during which all 
sorts of obstacles have been encountered. 
  The main obstacles to China's readmission to GATT have come 
from the United States. In 1989, the United States set a number 
of conditions on China's resumption of GATT status. These 
include: 1) increasing the transparency of economic information 
and trade regulations; 2) unifying the country's foreign trade 
policy and abolishing export subsidies; 3) formulating social 
insurance clauses and working out a minimum wage system for 
staff members and workers; 4) reducing tariffs on thousands of 
commodity categories; and 5) abolishing nontariff measures, such 
as quota certificates and so on. Last year the United States set 
new conditions on China, demanding that the renminbi correspond 
with free exchange rate standards, prohibiting the use of 
fluctuating exchange rates as a means of trade protection, and 
demanding the abolition of cities with separate listing and 
preferential policies, the uniformity of taxation laws, and the 
opening of its services market to the outside world. The EU has 
basically followed the United States and asked China to abide by 
these conditions. 
  Due to different social and economic systems, China, of 
course, finds it difficult to completely follow these U.S. and 
European economic measures. As a matter of fact, most of the 
100-odd GATT members do not comply with the above conditions, 
and the United States itself has built trade barriers and 
practices a quota system. However, following the in-depth 
development of reform and opening up, many aspects of China's 
economic structure have gradually converged with the 
international economic structure. To expand foreign trade and 
strive for an early resumption of GATT status, the mainland 
twice reduced the import tariffs on some 2,800 categories of 
commodities last year, including raw materials and machinery. 
In addition, it took the initiative to announce a list of 
tariff reductions for agricultural products and a list of tariff 
reductions on service trades. Although tariff reductions on 
nonagricultural products has not reached the required 30 
percent, China has expressed its readiness to meet these before 
reentering GATT. 
  Moreover, to meet the actual needs of GATT reentry, China 
unified its official renminbi exchange rate and the regulatory 
foreign exchange market exchange rate on 1 January this year. 
This year, it will also relax foreign exchange controls over 
trade and allow foreign-funded banks to deal in foreign exchange 
and provide renminbi loans to create adequate conditions for 
completely free renminbi exchange rates in the years to come. 
  Apart from these, this year China will implement a new 
unified taxation system throughout the country, abolish 
preferential policies for eight cities with separate listings 
[in State plans], open its retail market to the outside world, 
and partly open its telecommunications market and civil aviation 
market. In many aspects, China has met the conditions for 
readmission to GATT. 
  Viewing these major concessions by China, we believe that it 
will make every possible effort to resume GATT status this year. 
According to the provisions of the Uruguay Round document of 
December last year, a new GATT agreement will be signed in 
January 1995, during which the old organization will be 
dissolved and a new one--the World Trade 
Organization--established; signatory nations will automatically 
become members. If China cannot reenter GATT before the signing 
of the new agreement, it will spend a lot of effort again in 
applying for admission to the new organization. Therefore, this 
is a crucial year for China to resume its GATT status. 
  During a visit to China in late February, U.S. Assistant 
Trade Representative Dorothy Dwoskin joined the eighth round of 
bilateral talks on China resuming GATT status. After the talks, 
Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, told Dwoskin that China had demonstrated its 
flexibility on conditions for resuming GATT status. Dwoskin 
spoke highly of China's recent economic and trade reform 
measures, particularly the unification of the renminbi exchange 
rates, adding explicitly: "The United States firmly supports 
China's resumption of GATT status." EU Commissioner Leon 
Brittan came to China after Dwoskin's visit. Despite 
differences during a meeting with Minister Wu Yi on whether or 
not the Hong Kong issue will affect Sino-British economic and 
trade relations, Brittan indicated affirmatively after the 
meeting that "China can join GATT this year."

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Valuable Sense of Participation"] </F>
  [Text] Over the past few months, a large number of letters 
have been sent to Beijing from the masses in support of China's 
sponsorship of the United Nations' Fourth World Women 
Conference. This has reflected the sense of participation of the 
Chinese people in the years of reform and opening up. 
  This world conference will be the largest one ever held in 
Beijing since the founding of the PRC. By that time, about 
30,000 friends from over 100 countries will gather in Beijing, 
which will be a contribution made by China to the international 
community for the women's cause. 
  The Chinese Government takes the convocation of the 
conference very seriously. When Premier Li Peng met UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali last December, he made a 
solemn commitment to the international community on behalf of 
the Chinese Government by saying: "We welcome the convocation 
of the conference in Beijing, as this will provide an 
opportunity for the world to understand China and for China to 
understand the world. We will do what we can to make 
appropriate preparations for the conference." 
  At present, the preparatory work undertaken by the China 
Organizational Committee for the Fourth World Women Conference 
is in full swing. The entire Chinese people, the vast number of 
women in particular, have gone into action, and are expressing 
their support to the conference in various ways. 
  Thanks to the support and concern of the party and 
government 
since the founding of New China, particularly over the past 
dozen years of reform and opening up, great advances have been 
made in the cause of women liberation, the position of women has 
been remarkably enhanced, and a lot of excellent females having 
emerged in large multitudes have won universal praise throughout 
the world. 
  Although considerable headway has been made in the cause of 
women's liberation in China, there are still many aspects that 
are not satisfactory owing to traditional concepts. For 
example, compared with men, the proportion of women 
participating in the deliberation and administration of state 
affairs has yet to be raised; a certain number of women are 
illiterate; and women's right and interests have not been fully 
protected in some areas. The current conference will urge the 
entire society to show concern for and resolve these problems. 
  Since reform and opening up, China's achievements in all 
fields of endeavor have attracted worldwide attention. We 
should fully avail ourselves of the conference to propagate 
these achievements, make as many friends as possible with people 
from various countries, and strive to acquire a better 
understanding and greater support from friends all over the 
world. 
  We believe that with September 1995 approaching, the 
people's 
sense of participation will be enhanced with each passing day, 
and the extensive participation by the entire people will be the 
most powerful guarantee for the successful convocation of this 
conference.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (AFP) -- Most of the 106 Tibetan 
prisoners featured on a list recently submitted to China by the 
United States have already been freed, Raidi, president of the 
Tibetan people's assembly said Thursday. "I am not sure of the 
exact number, but there are no more than eight or 10 still in 
jail," Raidi told journalists after a press conference called by 
the Tibetan delegation to the annual session of parliament in 
Beijing. 
  During his recent visit to China, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher asked the Chinese Government to provide 
information on 106 people believed to be jailed in Tibet because 
of their religious or political convictions. During the press 
conference Raidi, who is also deputy secretary of the Tibetan 
Communist Party, said Tibetan authorities had "already received 
several similar lists", adding that "certain people" on them 
"did not even exist". "I do not know how they (Western and 
international organisatons) compiled these lists," he said. 
  The Tibetan delegation told reporters here that human rights 
were respected on the "Roof of the World" and that attempts at 
separatism were doomed to failure.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zou Jiahua met here today with Jacques Bougie, president and 
chief executive of Aluminum Canada (ALCAN). 
  Zou said that China's economy had developed fast since the 
country adopted its opening-up and reform policies in 1978, 
adding that entrepreneurs from Canada are welcome to invest here. 
  China follows two principles in its economic cooperation 
with 
foreign countries, the vice premier said. One is equality and 
mutual benefit. If the cooperation benefits only one side, it 
is doomed to fail. 
  The other is that it is in the long-term interests of both 
sides. Zou noted that the cooperation should take this into 
consideration. 
  He pointed out that China has rich resources and a huge 
market, adding that the future of the economic cooperation with 
China is promising. 
  Bougie briefed Zou on ALCAN's plan of conducting further 
economic cooperation with China, saying that he believed the 
aluminum industry in China would enjoy a bright future.

announced today that it would extend for one more year its 
moratorium on nuclear testing when it expires in September. 
  President Bill Clinton notified congressional leaders of the 
extension on Monday [14 March]. 
  Any resumption of nuclear weapons testing would have to be 
approved by Congress. 
  "The President will decide next year whether to extend the 
moratorium beyond September 1995," White House Spokeswoman Dee 
Dee Myers said. 
  The U.S. Congress has set a September 1996 target for an end 
to nuclear tests.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhao Jian (6392 1017): "Can a Foreigner Beat </F>
People?"] 
  [Text] If someone wants to have a popsicle, but gives only 
40 fen for a 50-fen one, he probably may not take the popsicle 
away. This is something even a kindergartener understands. 
However, if I tell you that someone beat up a popsicle seller 
because he was refused a popsicle for paying only 40 fen, what 
will you think? 
  Not long ago something similar to this happened. Although it 
was not a quarrel about a popsicle, it is similar. 
  According to a Beijing newspaper report, on the night of 20 
October, three people allegedly having nothing wrong with their 
nerves took a taxi to Changcheng Hotel. They should pay 74 yuan 
as the meter read, but they paid only 50 yuan in foreign 
exchange certificates. The driver, of course, refused the 
money, but they threw the money on the ground and began to beat 
up the driver. A hotel security guard stepped forward to 
mediate, but was beaten and kicked too. In the end, five people 
were wounded. Throughout the incident, they shouted abuse and 
kept yelling: "We are Americans!" 
  I was astonished to hear that two of the three were women. 
The report said that the two women "fiercely kicked the 
driver," "turned around and slapped someone else on the face" 
and "rudely grabbed his private parts." This reminds people of 
Detective Hunter's partner McCall, the difference being only 
that those who were beaten were not drug addicts or murderers, 
but law-abiding Chinese civilians. 
  I have not conducted a special study of the United States or 
Americans, but I studied some history when I was at school and 
know that in the past some foreigners, both military and 
nonmilitary, had been to China; now there are also foreigners 
coming to China for visits, sightseeing, business purposes, 
sports competitions, and putting on shows. However, one cannot 
ride roughshod over others because he or she is an "American." 
If this had happened in the past, it would not have been 
surprising; but if someone still behaves in such an overbearing 
or hegemonist way, this probably is something incomprehensible. 
  I suspect that these three Americans have the same organs in 
their bodies as others. Otherwise, why are they so widely 
different from others? People around the world should be like 
brothers and respect each other, but there are some people who 
like to show their arrogance. They say they take much account 
of civilization, equality, and human rights, but what they have 
done is inglorious. 
  According to reports, Chinese being humiliated, abused, and 
beaten frequently happens. This makes me ask another question: 
Is it that some of us have doted on these foreigners too much? 
In the Changcheng Hotel incident, there was a 2.07-meter-tall 
security guard whose "chest was beaten" and "private parts 
kicked," but he did not return a blow, showing utmost endurance. 
Did this awaken those people who dare not stand upright in the 
presence of foreigners or think that the moon in a foreign 
country is rounder than that in China? I cannot answer this 
question. 
  The last part of the report on the Changcheng Hotel incident 
said that the public security department had handled the matter. 
The three Americans "expressed their regret" and said that they 
would "abide by Chinese law" in the future and "were willing to 
accept punishment." However, I would like to know this: What 
were the details of the punishment? How much compensation did 
those who were beaten receive for their "medical expenses," as 
well as "material and spiritual losses"? Were they satisfied 
with the way the incident was handled? Some people may say that 
because the Americans admitted their mistakes, there was no need 
to bring up these "details," but I think the reporter who filed 
the report should not have skirted around this point. Will our 
readers think that I am making a fuss over a trifle?

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "China Wants U.S. Project </F>
Aid"] 
  [Text] China will seek American investment in about 800 
industrial and agricultural projects next month at a Washington 
conference on bilateral trade, coming less than two months 
before a U.S. decision on Chinese trade status. 
  This will be the largest promotion campaign staged by China 
in the United States in the past 15 years, the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) announced 
yesterday. 
  About 60 of the proposed projects will be hydraulic and 
thermal power stations that are expected to relieve China's 
electricity bottleneck, a Moftec spokesman said. 
  Another 100 projects are related to the construction of 
roads, railways, airports and wharfs. The remaining 500 fall 
into machinery, electronics, petrochemical, metallurgical, 
husbandry and forestry. 
  About 200 people from the State Council (China's cabinet), 
China Petrochemical Corporation, China North Industries Group, 
China National Petroleum Corporation and 25 provinces and cities 
will tour the U.S. for investment promotion. 
  The U.S. has become one of the top three foreign investors 
in 
China with promised capital input in more than 1,000 projects 
valued at more than $6 billion. 
  Chinese analysts predict U.S. investors will continue to 
land 
here as the two countries are apparently improving their 
economic relations. 
  And many international trade observers have predicted that 
the U.S. will extend its most-favoured-nation (MFN) status to 
China this year, which provides Chinese goods with the lowest 
tariffs. 
  China has insisted that the cancellation of MFN will 
definitely cast a pall over bilateral relations and business 
communities of both sides will be hurt. 
  President Jiang Zemin reaffirmed on Sunday in his talks with 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that differences in 
social systems and ideologies should not obstruct mutual 
co-operation. 
  "And the impending trade forum in the U.S. will provide a 
better chance for U.S. businesses to locate investment 
opportunities in China," the Moftec spokesman said. 
  The forum is to accompany a high-level conference in 
Washington with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi and U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. 
  The conference and the trade forum are timed before the U.S. 
decision on MFN status in June. 
  China has managed to get the status as mutual means for the 
development of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade.

  [Text] Chongqing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China Southwest 
Airlines based in Chongqing, in southwest China's Sichuan 
Province, recently sold three old Boeing 707 airliners to a 
Pacific Ocean Aviation Support Company from the United States. 
  They were sold for 2.55 million U.S. dollars. 
  The airliners have flown more than 25,000 hours on average 
and were taken out of service in August 1993. 
  The planes will be overhauled by China Southwest Airlines 
and 
be sent to the location appointed by the U.S. company before 
June 20 this year. 
  One of them will be dismantled for spare parts and the 
others 
will be converted for other uses after being repaired in Britain.

<F P=106> [By Simon Beck] </F>
  [Text] As the United States continues the Himalayan task 
of closing its ideological gap with China this weekend, the 
world's cameras are focused on one man. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher is the central figure in the U.S. 
administration's drive to extract just the smallest of 
compromises from Beijing on human rights, trade and security 
matters. 
  But as most attention, grabbed by the reawakening of the 
dissident movement's sense of defiance, is locked into Mr. 
Christopher's talks, a whole other series of negotiations is 
taking place quietly, behind the scenes. 
  The official in charge of those discussions, Under Secretary 
of Defence Frank Wisner, is the most senior military man to 
visit China since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. And although 
his itinerary is not being afforded the same publicity as that 
of Mr. Christopher, what he achieves on this visit may have as 
deep, if not deeper, ramifications for the future security of 
the Pacific Rim. 
  Mr. Wisner's task is to begin putting into place a plan 
hatched only recently in the highest echelons of U.S. foreign 
policy-making: to re-engage China in military cooperation, 
bringing to an end a period of silence and mutual suspicion. 
  In bald terms, what he will try to agree with defence and 
People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials is a dual programme. 
First, to start regular high-level military exchanges, resulting 
in a limited U.S.-Sino peacekeeping and disaster relief force, 
and second, to establish a Joint Commission on Defence 
Conversion -- exchanging knowhow on putting old defence 
technology to use in the commercial sector. 
  Both programmes carry the greatest of risks, as well as the 
highest of rewards, and American thinking is that it can no 
longer stand by while China modernises its military in a 
political cocoon. 
  Assistant Secretary of Defence Charles Freeman, who visited 
China last year, could have been a trifle casual when he said in 
a recent speech in Washington: "We in the Department of Defence 
don't spend a lot of time worrying about China. We don't see it 
as a threat particularly...we see it as an opportunity." 
  There is no doubt, however, that Mr. Freeman knows full well 
Beijing is the cornerstone upon which the peace of East Asia 
stands or falls. According to Barbara Opall, a China specialist 
on Defence News magazine, the U.S. is keener to do business than 
Mr. Freeman suggests. 
  "They have nothing to lose and everything to gain from 
constant engagement with the Chinese. They don't know much 
about what China is doing, have no real details about its 
military modernisation plans or its intentions. 
  "It's a win-win situation if the PLA sits down and talks to 
them." 
  Since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre brought about a ban on all 
important military and technological exchanges with China, the 
U.S. intelligence community's ability to penetrate the PLA's 
activities has been severely limited. It is not clear whether 
even its spending budget is known. 
  But one thing is clear: none of America's allies in 
Southeast Asia take at face value China's contentions that its 
military modernisation is for peaceful purposes only. Partly 
due to continued tensions with China over the South China Sea 
territory disputes, all six members of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are busy modernising their 
forces, and expect to spend some U.S.$2 billion (HK$15.5 
billion) this year on military equipment. 
  Recognising China as the dominant force in the region, the 
U.S. has decided it is time to bring it into the fold. The idea 
of regular military discussions, limited joint training and 
joint peacekeeping may be largely cosmetic, but it is seen as a 
vital first step to keeping tabs on China's expansion. 
  Another spin-off is in controlling Beijing's proliferation 
activities, a continual thorn in the side of U.S.-Sino 
relations. One of Mr. Wisner's tasks this weekend is to get a 
firm pledge from China on sticking to the terms of the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCR). It was China's alleged 
violations of the MTCR -- in selling M-11 missile parts to 
Pakistan -- that earned it the two- year ban on satellite 
technology transfers. 
  But according to the latest issue of Defence News, Pentagon 
insiders say China is still smarting over Washington's decision 
to sell 150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, and is insisting on a 
reversal of the sale in return for its cooperation on 
proliferation. Although the U.S. is adamant it will not go back 
on the deal, with the F-16 deliveries not due to begin until 
1997 there may be some room for a compromise. 
  Beijing is also insisting it be included in the core 
countries that discuss the constantly-changing terms of treaties 
like the MTCR. But while the Pentagon likes the idea in 
principle, that will mean providing Beijing with sensitive data 
on the West's missile programmes. 
  Keeping technological intelligence out of China's nimble 
fingers is also a problem at the core of the other initiative, 
the Defence Conversion Commission. It has already been decided 
the commission will begin meeting later this year. 
  A Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. hoped to learn a lot from 
China, which he described as being "15 years ahead" in the field 
of converting military technology to industrial use. 
  There is no doubt defence conversion has to be expanded in 
the U.S., especially in California, which has been decimated by 
military downsizing. Officials are anxious to exploit the huge 
brain power at establishments like the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, near San Francisco. 
  Now that its 8,000 employees have less work to do in the 
military sphere, the U.S. Government wants to find out how much 
of their expertise can be funnelled into designing, say, cars 
for General Motors. 
  But at what risk? Livermore knows all too well, as it was at 
this very laboratory in the mid-1980s that a scandal erupted 
after a visiting Chinese delegation took advantage of lax 
security to gather secrets on America's neutron bomb -- possibly 
by bribing an employee. Not long after, it had perfected its 
own version. 
  "The Livermore incident was devastating. It changed the 
balance of power in the region. They didn't just get a bomb, 
but all that goes with it," a defence intelligence official said. 
  Nevertheless, as ties reopen, Livermore and two other 
national laboratories are to receive a high-ranking delegation 
of Chinese scientists in the near future. 
  Washington is perhaps now coming to the conclusion that it 
has little power over how, when and where Beijing chooses to 
detain its dissidents. But it yet may come to have more 
influence over how China defends its territory and that is 
surely a goal worth discussing.

education sponsored by the China Medical Board of New York City 
in the United States opened Saturday [5 March] in Lhasa. 
  More than 70 medical workers from all over the Tibet 
Autonomous Region will be briefed on the modern medical 
examination system during the five-day forum. 
  Dr. Sawyer, chairman of the board, attended Saturday's 
opening ceremony. He is on his fifth trip to Lhasa. 
  The chairman said his board would help Tibet improve its 
medical education and examination system and train more medical 
professionals. 
  The board last year reached an agreement with authorities in 
Tibet to expand the regional medical school in Lhasa to a 
medical college. 
  It had already sponsored two medical forums in Lhasa.

  [Text] Washington, March 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today named Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the commander of NATO 
forces in southern Europe as the top officer of the U.S. Navy, 
replacing Admiral Frank Kelso Jr., White House announced today. 
  The White House made the announcement from Detroit where 
President Clinton is hosting a G-7 job summit. 
  Boorda, 55, is currently serving as commander in chief of 
U.S. naval forces in Europe, and commander in chief of allied 
forces in southern Europe, where he is responsible for 
coordinating and planning NATO military actions over 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. 
  Boorda is a former listed man who is considered close to 
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. 
  Boorda, a native of Chicago, Illinois state, joined the U.S. 
Navy in 1956 when he was 18 after he dropped out of high school 
because of problems at home. Within six years, he rose to the 
rank of petty officer first class, serving primarily in naval 
aviation. 
  In 1962, he was selected from officer candidate school under 
the seaman to admiral program, which ended several years later. 
His first sea tour as an officer was off Vietnam. 
  In 1966, he, as a lieutenant, got his first command, the USS 
Parrot, a small coastal minesweeper with a crew of 43 and four 
officers, and it remains his favorite command. 
  In 1971, after attending the U.S. Naval War College and 
obtaining a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Rhode 
Island, he assumed duties as an executive officer. 
  From 1975 to 1977, Boorda commanded the USS Parraut and was 
next assigned as executive assistant to the principal deputy 
assistant secretary of the navy for manpower and reserve affairs 
in Washington, D.C. 
  In 1983-1984, he served as executive assistant to the chief 
of naval personnel, deputy chief of naval operations for 
manpower, personnel and training. In December, 1984, he assumed 
his first flag officer assignment as executive assistant to the 
chief of naval operations, remaining until July, 1986. 
  Kelso, 60, announced last month that he was retiring two 
months ahead of schedule because he had become the "lightning 
rod" for criticism of the Navy's handling over the past two 
years of the Tailhook sexual harassment scandal. 
  Kelso is due to leave as chief of naval operations on April 
30. As the top uniformed position in the navy, he is a member of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

  [Text] United Nations, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today it had 
suspended an inspection of the seven declared nuclear facilities 
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  The IAEA, in a statement available here, said it had 
suspended the investigation because some "important measures 
which had been agreed were refused at the radiochemical 
laboratory in Yongbyon." 
  "As a result of this rejection, the IAEA Secretariat had to 
brief the board that the agency was not in a position to verify 
that there had been no diversion of nuclear material at the 
facility where the relevant measures were rejected," the 
statement said. 
  The IAEA team of inspectors made an inspection visit to the 
DPRK from March 1 to 15, based upon an understanding as to the 
aim and scope of the inspection reached in Vienna on February 15. 
  In an informal briefing in Vienna earlier today the team 
informed the board of governors the detailed results must await 
performance of follow-up analytical and evaluation work in 
Vienna. 
  However, the board members were informed that although many 
of the agreed inspection measures were carried out as envisaged, 
"other important measures" which had been agreed were refused. 
  According to the statement, a meeting of the board of 
governors on this subject will be held on Monday [21 March].

<F P=106> [News conference by Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State </F>
Council and foreign minister, with domestic and foreign 
correspondents in the Great Hall of the People on 16 March] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhou Jue, spokesman for 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC], held a news conference at the Great Hall of the People 
this morning. Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and 
concurrently foreign minister, was invited to answer questions 
raised by Chinese and foreign correspondents on the portion of 
Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" regarding the active 
promotion of the motherland's peaceful reunification and China's 
diplomatic work. 
  [XINHUA correspondent] Two days ago U.S. President Clinton 
expressed disappointment at the outcome of U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher's visit to China. What are your views on 
this? How do you assess the chances of the United States 
extending China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status? 
  [Qian] I am somewhat disappointed at Secretary of State 
Christopher's visit because we were hoping to achieve more 
results. The visit produced some agreements and results, but not 
as many as had been anticipated. In addition, I am of the 
opinion that if China's MFN status is maintained, it would be 
good for both China and the United States; if it is revoked, it 
would be bad for both countries. 
  [EUROPE TIMES correspondent] The French prime minister will 
soon visit China. How do you view the prospects for Sino-French 
relations? 
  [Qian] The Sino-French Joint Communique released on 12 
January of this year proclaimed the normalization of Sino-French 
relations, with the French Government promising not to approve 
participation by French enterprises in arming Taiwan in the 
future; its purpose is plain. Thereafter, I paid an official 
visit to France, one of the purposes of my visit being to 
prepare for Prime Minister Balladur's visit to China. I believe 
Prime Minister Balladur's visit is a major event in Sino-French 
relations and will have an important effect on promoting the 
development of Sino-French relations, including economic 
relations and trade. The visit will take place in early April. 
  [LIEN HO PAO correspondent] You raised the possibility a few 
days ago during a meeting with the Taiwan delegation to the NPC 
of signing a cross-Strait investment protection agreement. What 
kind of an agreement will probably be signed? 
  [Qian] The "Law on Protecting Investments by Taiwan 
Compatriots" formulated by the NPC Standing Committee is 
beneficial to granting legal protection to Taiwan compatriots' 
investments and to promoting cross-Strait economic cooperation; 
it is more comprehensive and authoritative than relevant 
regulations in the past. We cannot exclude the possibility of 
nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait 
signing investment protection agreements in the future. 
However, conditions are not ripe yet. The most important 
reason is that two-way exchanges have yet to be realized. 
  [Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Limited correspondent] The 
U.S. secretary of state said both sides had narrowed their 
differences following his meeting with you. Do you agree? 
Also, when will you meet the British foreign secretary again on 
the Hong Kong issue? 
  [Qian] I think the two sides may not necessarily have 
narrowed their difference in their fundamental viewpoints on the 
human rights issue. However, we did reach some concensus on the 
concrete measures for dealing with this matter, and this can be 
characterized as a narrowing of our difference. 
  As to whether the Chinese and British foreign ministers will 
meet, I do not think it is possible now. Opportunities do exist 
in the future, at least at a time when the UN General Assembly 
meets. 
  [DPA correspondent] Why are you disappointed at the outcome 
of Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China? 
  [Qian] Both sides held the meetings according to the 
invitation I extended during our meeting in Paris on 24 January. 
In mid-February, he wrote me a letter in which he indicated his 
plans to visit China in mid-March. I concurred, hoping the 
visit would produce an agreement that was conductive to further 
developing the relations of the two countries. However, some 
things happened prior to the secretary of state's visit to 
China, and these disappointed us [hen shi wang 1771 1136 2598]. 
The occurrence of these things at least shows that the United 
States is not sincere enough [cheng yi bu gou 6134 1942 0008 
1124] about the visit. 
  [LIANHE ZAOBAO correspondent] In his "Government Work 
Report," Premier Li Peng said China does not seek hegemony at 
present and will not do so when it has become economically 
developed in the future. China's national defense expenditure 
will total 52.04 billion yuan this year. What percentage is 
this of China's gross national product [GNP]? 
  China's military expenditure was 43.2 billion yuan last 
year, and the budget for 1994 is 52 billion yuan. On the 
surface, the figure has somewhat increased; but in real terms, 
the increase is to offset inflation. As is known to all, 
inflation in 1993 hit 13 percent; and this year it is expected 
to reach 10 percent. Hence, the military expenditure actually 
has not gone up. In 1994, military expenditures account for 11 
percent of the state budget, a proportion which has remained 
largely unchanged; and military spending accounts for less than 
1.7 percent of China's GNP, which actually represents a slight 
drop. Converting the defense budget into U.S. dollars, there is 
no change in the level of China's military spending. Compared 
with the military spendings of other countries, China's military 
spending is a pittance, and it is out of proportion with the 
U.S. spending of more than $200 billion and the Japan's more 
than $30 billion. Therefore, China's current defense budget 
explains exactly that China is trying to concentrate its 
financial resources on developing its national economy instead 
of seeking to be a military power. 
  [ANSA] If the United States does not renew the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China, economic relations 
between the two countries will deteriorate. Will this also lead 
to a deterioration of their political relations? 
  [Qian] I think deterioration of economic relations will 
surely affect deterioration of political relations, but efforts 
being made by both sides are just to prevent this kind of 
deterioration from occurring. 
  [CNA] The fourth round of consultations between the Strait 
Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait will be held at the end of this month. How does 
the mainland assess the demand of the people on Taiwan for the 
Taiwan authorities to develop space? 
  [Qian] We stand for frequent consultations between 
nongovernmental organizations from both sides of the Taiwan 
Strait to reach agreements on relevant issues. Such contacts 
will undoubtedly help improve cross-strait relations. However, 
there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of 
China. This is the consensus of both sides of the strait, as 
well as a fact recognized by the international community. 
Therefore, if the move to "develop space" aims to develop 
economic relations, we can understand. But, if it aims to 
create "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan," that will harm 
the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and it will be 
detrimental to the cause of the motherland's reunification. At 
present, the Taiwan authorities are asserting that their 
"holiday-making diplomacy" is aimed at developing economic 
relations. This is somewhat like "no 300 taels of silver 
curried here" [the sign put up by the man in a folk tale over 
the place where he had hidden some money meaning obscuring the 
obvious]. There are political intentions in the "holiday-making 
diplomacy." We understand the wish of some countries to seek to 
develop economic relations with Taiwan. But the Taiwan 
authorities want to take advantage of such economic relations to 
develop the so- called "diplomatic space" in an attempt to 
create "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." This is a move 
that is not in keeping with the trend of the times and goes 
against the aspirations of people on both sides of the Taiwan 
Strait. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
will soon visit China. What are China's expectations of his 
visit? 
  [Qian] China and Japan are close neighbors and the leaders 
of the two countries often exchange visits. Chinese Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan was a great success. 
Now Chinese leaders are looking forward to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's visit. I believe the visit will play an important 
role in further developing Sino-Japanese relations and 
cooperation in economic fields. During the visit, China and 
Japan will sign an agreement on strengthening cooperation in 
environmental protection. 
  [AP] You have just mentioned that efforts are being made 
between China and the United States to avoid deterioration of 
relations. What efforts will China make to this end? Will the 
Chinese foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state meet 
again? 
  [Qian] The two sides did not discuss whether to meet again. 
But both sides agreed to maintain contacts. What China or the 
United States intends to do will be decided by the country 
itself. We have no intention to interfere with internal affairs 
of the United States, and it should also not interfere with 
China's internal affairs. 
  [CHINA DAILY] Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei made a 
trip to South Africa not long ago. What are the prospects of 
diplomatic relations between China and South Africa? 
  [Qian] China and South Africa have had some contacts. They 
have nongovernmental organizations stationed in each other's 
country. South Africa is preparing for an election in April, 
which is to elect a new democratic government that abandons the 
policy of apartheid. Establishment of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries is not possible before that. The 
formal diplomatic links between China and South Africa will 
certainly be put on the agenda after the general election in 
South Africa. 
  [SING PAO DAILY NEWS] The prime ministers and foreign 
ministers of both China and Britain have agreed that the work of 
the Joint Liaison Group [JLP] should be sped up. However, the 
JLP has only made slow progress in its work. What are your 
views of the JLP's work in the future? Will the JLP's work have 
an impact on Hong Kong's stability and prosperity? 
  [Qian] Sino-British talks on the arrangement of Hong Kong 
1994-95 elections have broken down, but this does not mean work 
of the JLP will suspend. The JLP should continue its work and 
negotiations on the new Hong Kong airport are continuing, too. 
In my view, both sides should make efforts to ensure Hong 
Kong's prosperity and stability. Despite a breakdown in 
Sino-British talks on the arrangement of the 1994-95 Hong Kong 
elections, China still cares about Hong Kong's economy and the 
livelihood of its people and will try its best to cooperate with 
the British side. Whether or not cooperation can proceed 
smoothly depends on both the attitude and action of the British 
side. 
  [REUTERS] What are your comments on the current situation in 
regard to the inspection of nuclear facilities in the DPRK? 
  [Qian] China hopes that the situation on the Korean 
peninsula will move towards relaxation and stability and also 
hopes the peninsula be nuclear free. This conforms to China's 
interests as well as to the regional and world interests. China 
supports the DPRK to hold negotiations with the United States, 
the south, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the 
past, the negotiations met some setbacks and achieved some 
progress too. The situation can be perfectly described by this 
verse: "When the mountains and streams come to an end and one 
would think there is no path, the shady willows and bright 
blossoms bring him to yet another village." Now some 
difficulties have cropped up again. We believe that as long as 
all sides are patient in negotiations and do not adopt measures 
to complicate the situation, the negotiations will achieve 
important progress. 
  [China Central Television] Someone said that whether the 
United States renews China's MFN trade status is not just a 
matter between China and the United States. It will have a 
worldwide impact. Do you agree? 
  [Qian] MFN trade status is a reciprocal and mutually 
beneficial arrangement between China and the United States, and 
it is the base for normal trade for the two countries. The 
United States has given the MFN trade status to many other 
countries, and I have never heard it will be removed. If the 
U.S. Government should remove the status for China, trade 
between China and the U.S. can hardly be carried on. If it 
should happen, China and the U.S. would be the first to suffer 
losses, and other countries and regions will also suffer. 
Therefore, I hope that this will not happen. 
  [SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST] Which conditions in President 
Clinton's executive order are acceptable to China, which are not? 
  [Qian] China does not have the obligation to carry out the 
U.S. President's executive orders. Some of the "conditions" 
mentioned in the "executive order" do not constitute a problem. 
Take the export of prison labor products for example. Even the 
United States acknowledges that its prison labor products are 
exported to some countries. However, the United States does not 
want prison labor products from other countries to enter the 
United States. This can be solved easily. China has a big 
market and it is entirely possible for China not to export its 
prison labor products to the United States. Moreover, an 
agreement on this issue was signed and a statement on 
cooperation in implementing it has just been signed. We can say 
that this question has been settled. For another example, the 
"Jackson-Vanik" Amendment requires the United States to remove 
the MFN trade status of any country that does not have 
immigration freedom. This is not a problem as far as the 
Chinese are concerned. The obstacle now is that the United 
States often denies Chinese citizens visas on the ground of 
"intent to immigrate." This and similar matters may be regarded 
as conditions and maybe not. If you want to make a mountain out 
of a molehill, then they become conditions. If approached with 
a realistic attitude, they would not constitute a problem. We 
do not want to see issues played up or played down for political 
needs. So long as the two sides adopt a realistic attitude, 
these issues can be solved without much difficulty. 
  Over 500 Chinese and foreign reporters attended the news 
conference.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The Presidium of the 
ongoing Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC) held its second meeting here today in the Great Hall of 
the People. 
  The meeting passed a draft resolution on the government work 
report made by Premier Li Peng to the legislature. The 
resolution will be sent to NPC deputies for examination before 
being submitted to the NPC general session for a vote. 
  The Presidium meeting also heard and passed examination 
reports made by Liu Suinian, chairman of the NPC Financial and 
Economic Committee, on: implementation of the 1993 plan for 
national economic and social development, a draft 1994 plan for 
national economic and social development, implementation of the 
state budget for 1993 and a draft state budget for 1994. 
  The NPC Financial and Economic Committee, Liu said, believed 
that the guiding idea, principle and key points of the 1994 
national economic and social development plan are correct and 
that measures put forth therein are feasible. In the process of 
carrying out the national plan, he said, any partial adjustment 
of the plan has to be reported to the NPC Standing Committee for 
examination and approval. 
  On this year's budget plan, the committee maintains that its 
guiding principles for budgetary arrangements are correct, Liu 
said. 
  The principles, he said, provide for expenditures on key 
projects and undertakings that will promote national economic 
and social development. At the same time, the budget provides a 
necessary financial guarantee for the smooth progress of major 
reform measures and strengthened macroeconomic controls, he said. 
  The meeting also passed a draft list of candidates for by- 
election of members to the NPC Standing Committee to be handed 
over to the deputies for examination.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (AFP)--China asserted a hardline 
position Thursday [17 March] on the eve of an international 
forum expected to condemn Chinese occupation of Tibet and its 
alleged violations of human rights there. 
  Raidi, chairman of the Tibetan People's Congress, the 
parliament of the Chinese-governed Tibetan Autonomous Region, 
warned that militant Tibetan separatists would be defeated and 
dismissed reports that scores of political prisoners were behind 
bars. 
  According to human rights groups, several anti-Chinese 
demonstrations erupted last year in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, 
and were brutally repressed by the Chinese authorities, who 
carried out hundreds of arrests. Raidi, who is also vice 
secretary of the region's communist party, told a press 
conference here that "recently some separatists have been 
engaged in a lot of activities sabotaging the unity of the 
motherland." "Any attempt to undermine the national unity is 
doomed to fail," he said. 
  The press conference was called by members of the Tibetan 
region's delegation to the annual session of the National 
People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp parliament. 
  Raidi also said that most of the 106 Tibetans, jailed for 
religious or political beliefs, who featured on a list submitted 
to China by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, had 
already been freed. "I am not sure of the exact number, but 
there are no more than eight or 10 still in jail," Raidi said. 
  The Tibetan authorities had "already received several 
similar 
lists", adding that "certain people" on them "did not even 
exist", he said. "I do not know how they (western and 
international organizations) compiled these lists." 
  As in the past, Raidi reiterated an offer for Tibet's exiled 
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to return home, but "as long 
as he renounces Tibetan independence." "The Dalai Lama is 
engaged in activities aimed at splitting China," he said. 
  The Dalai Lama, who heads a government-in-exile in India 
that 
has not been recognised by any country, accuses China of killing 
more than one million Tibetans, arresting and torturing 
thousands of his compatriots and threatening Tibetan identity by 
settling Chinese in the region, overrun by Chinese troops in 
1949. The delegation brushed aside the suggestion that China 
had embarked on "massive migration" to Tibet. 
  Lhasa Mayor Luo Sang Dun Zhu said the capital had a 
population of 400,000, of whom 87.21 percent were Tibetan and 
11.95 percent ethnic Chinese, although there was a "floating 
population" of officials and traders that could reach 200,000. 
  Tibet's economy is showing annual improvement, the 
delegation 
said, adding that a growth target had been set of eight percent 
per annum over the next few years. The officials added that 
Beijing was trying to scale back its military presence in 
Tibet, thanks to improving relations with its "neighbours," a 
reference to India. They they offered no details. 
  A hundred members of parliament from some 30 countries are 
set to gather in New Delhi on Friday for a three-day conference 
to debate China's human rights record in Tibet and its 
militarisation of the region. 
  Dalai Lama recently warned in a statement, issued on the 
35th 
anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, 
that Tibetans were disappointed with his failure to demand 
complete freedom for his homeland. 
  International interest in Tibet has risen in recent years, 
and respect for human rights there has been named by the United 
States as a factor in whether to renew China's 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) status.

"Spring Air in the Grand Meeting"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 8 
March, there were constant cheers and happy laughter at the 
Great Hall of the People. The Second Session of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] would open soon. 
  Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, and other 
comrades left a reception room amid light-hearted music and went 
to the rostrum of the full session. The 10,000-man hall was 
lighted by ceiling lights, wall lights, and correspondents' 
flash bulbs. 
  Facing numerous cameras, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin 
pulled 
Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Li Ruihuan together and happily said: 
"Come, let us have a group photo taken!" 
  Photographic correspondent rushed forward to photograph 
their 
smiling faces. 
  Earlier, a reception room in the rear of the main assembly 
hall was bustling with noise and excitement as a closed circuit 
TV was broadcasting the video recording of Li Ruihuan's visit to 
three countries in Southeast Asia. When Vice Chairman Wang 
Guangying saw Li Ruihuan coming into the room with a smiling 
face, he pointed at the TV and said: "Chairman Li, the TV is 
broadcasting you. You are the first person visiting abroad in 
the position of chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. It 
was very significant to developing foreign contacts by the 
CPPCC!" Li Ruihuan said repeatedly: "The achievements of the 
CPPCC all depend on your joint efforts." 
  At a reception room, Ye Xuanping and Wang Zhaoguo, vice 
chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee, were greeting party 
and state leaders who came to extend their greetings. Ye 
Xuanping held talks with some responsible persons of democratic 
parties, and later extended his greetings to Ann Tse-kai, Henry 
Fok Ying-tung, and Ma Man-kei, vice chairmen of the CPPCC 
National Committee who were elected from Hong Kong and Macao 
regions; Wang Zhaoguo asked for advice from Wang Hanbin, vice 
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress, concerning legal matters in contacts between the two 
sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and other comrades entered 
the reception room to express their congratulations to Li 
Ruihuan on the opening of the CPPCC session. Li Ruihuan 
introduced Zhu Xun, minister of geology and mineral resources 
and first deputy secretary general of the Second Session of the 
Eighth CPPCC National Committee, to comrades Jiang Zemin, Li 
Peng, and Qiao Shi, saying: "This is our newly elected member 
and Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Zhu Xun." Jiang 
Zemin shook hands with him and said: "We knew each other long 
ago." Li Peng said to Zhu Xun: "The CPPCC can do a lot of 
things. You must continue your efforts under the leadership of 
Comrade Li Ruihuan." 
  The preparatory bell sounded, and Zhu Xun requested those 
leading comrades to take their seats at the rostrum. When 
General-Secretary Jiang Zemin saw Ye Xuanping wearing a 
feather-padded coat, he asked the latter: "You will make a 
report at the plenary meeting wearing just this?" Ye Xuanping 
took off the feather-padded coat and said smilingly: "I wear a 
western coat underneath!" Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, and 
other comrades all laughed.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held its third 
plenary meeting on the afternoon of 15 March to hear an 
explanation on the draft budget law; an explanation on the draft 
decision on authorizing the Xiamen City People's Congress, its 
Standing Committee, and the Xiamen city people's government to 
separately enact laws and regulations for implementation in the 
Xiamen Special Economic Zone; and reports on the work of the NPC 
Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate. A few other topics were also discussed 
at today's meeting. 
  The State Council submitted the draft budget law to the NPC 
Standing Committee in October 1993 for examination. Based on 
the examination opinions of members of NPC special committees 
and of its Standing Committee, the State Council made another 
revision to the draft law. Entrusted by the State Council, Liu 
Zhongli gave an explanation at the meeting concerning some major 
issues in the draft law. 
  Liu Zhongli said: Over the years, because China has not had 
legal stipulations governing budgetary management, there have 
been many problems in the preparation, examination, approval, 
implementation, adjustment, final settlement, and supervision of 
budget. For instance, the procedures for budget preparation 
have not been clearly set out, the authority and responsibility 
of budgetary management have not been clearly defined, 
examination and approval of budgets have not been strictly 
carried out, budgets have not been faithfully implemented, and 
supervision over budget implementation has not been effective, 
resulting in the budget's lack of legal effectiveness. The 14th 
CPC National Congress laid down the goal of establishing a 
socialist market economic system, stressing the need to give 
full play to the financial work's macroeconomic regulation and 
control role in establishing a socialist market economic system 
and in refining it. In this situation, it has become a pressing 
need to quicken the pace of financial reform to improve the 
state's macroeconomic management. At the same time, we also 
urgently need to clearly define in legal terms the budget 
management authority of organs of power, government organs, and 
finance departments at all levels, as well as of all departments 
and units; and to improve management and strengthen supervision 
over the preparation, examination, approval, and implementation 
of budget, in order to ensure healthy economic and social 
development. Therefore, enacting the Budget Law is very 
necessary. 
  Liu Zhongli also gave an explanation on the guiding thought 
for enacting the Budget Law and on some major issues in the 
draft Budget Law. 
  Entrusted by the NPC Standing Committee, Xue Ju, chairman of 
the NPC Law Committee, made an explanation on the "NPC Decision 
on Authorizing the Xiamen City People's Congress, Its Standing 
Committee, and the Xiamen City People's Government To Separately 
Enact Laws and Regulations for Implementation in the Xiamen 
Special Economic Zone (Draft)." 
  Xue Ju said: The Xiamen Special Economic Zone [SEZ] is one 
of the country's earliest SEZ's, as well as a SEZ with the State 
Council's approval to implement some free port policies and to 
carry out comprehensive reform of the urban economic system. 
Considering the Xiamen SEZ's development needs, the NPC Law 
Committee suggests that the NPC Standing Committee table a 
motion to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC to authorize the 
Xiamen City People's Congress and its Standing Committee, taking 
into consideration the SEZ's reality and needs, based on the 
Constitution, and according to the basic principle of 
established laws and administrative regulations, to enact laws 
and regulations for implementation in the Xiamen SEZ; and to 
submit the enacted laws and regulations to the NPC Standing 
Committee, the State Council, and the Fujian Provincial People's 
Congress Standing Committee for the record. It is also 
suggested that the Second Session of the Eighth NPC authorize 
the Xiamen city people's government to enact related regulations 
for implementation in the Xiamen SEZ. 
  Entrusted by the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, Vice 
Chairman Tian Jiyun delivered a report on the NPC Standing 
Committee's work over the past year and the main tasks for the 
coming year. 
  In the report, Tian Jiyun said: In the past year, the 
Standing Committee conscientiously carried out the various 
duties prescribed in the Constitution, strengthened economic 
legislation, improved supervisory systems, promoted reform and 
development, and safeguarded socialist stability, thereby making 
headway in all fields: 1. giving economic legislation top 
priority and scoring notable achievements in legislative work; 
2. striving to improve and strengthen supervision and further 
perfecting supervisory mechanisms; 3. earnestly handling 
motions and suggestions of deputies and forging close ties with 
the masses; 4. actively developing exchanges with foreign 
parliaments and creating a favorable international environment 
for China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; and 5. 
intensifying efforts to build up its organizations and bringing 
into play the role of its special committees. 
  Tian Jiyun pointed out: We must be aware of the shortcomings 
and defects in our work. They are reflected mainly in the 
incompatibility of legislative work with the needs of reform, 
opening up, and economic expansion; in the weak links in 
supervisory work, especially inadequate inspection and 
supervision over law enforcement; and in the organizational 
construction of the Standing Committee, which still cannot meet 
the requirements under the new situation. 
  To this end, Tian Jiyun called for efforts in the work of 
four areas: continuing to give economic legislation top priority 
so as to establish a legal system that conforms with a socialist 
market economy; paying close attention to the inspection and 
supervision of law enforcement to facilitate the implementation 
of various reform programs; enhancing the awareness of law in 
all of society to create a sound legal environment for reform 
and construction; and intensifying the Standing Committee's 
organizational construction and training a strong contingent of 
NPC cadres. 
  At the plenary meeting, Ren Jianxin, president of the 
Supreme 
People's Court, and Zhang Siqing, procurator general of the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate, also delivered reports on the 
work of the court and the procuratorate. 
  Ren Jianxin discussed the following aspects of the court's 
work last year: persistently cracking down on crimes to 
safeguard social stability; severely punishing serious economic 
crimes to facilitate the deepening of the anticorruption drive; 
using judicial means to regulate economic relations and promote 
the development of a market economy; conducting trials to 
protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens and 
corporations; and strictly enforcing laws and stepping up 
efforts to improve the quality of court personnel. 
  Ren Jianxin said: In 1994, the guiding ideology for the work 
of courts throughout the country is to be guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line; to earnestly 
implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and 
to adhere to the principle of "grasping two links at the same 
time" in strictly enforcing laws, striving to improve judicial 
quality, and reforming and perfecting the judicial system so as 
to provide a strong judicial guarantee for maintaining social 
stability, for accelerating the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure, and for maintaining a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the economy. 
  Discussing the overall procuratorial work in 1993, Zhang 
Siqing said: In the past year, the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, in the light of the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC, 
carried out various procuratorial activities in line with the 
principle of "strictly enforcing laws and relentlessly handling 
criminal cases." People's procuratorates throughout the country 
and military, railway, and other special tribunals reinforced 
their legal supervision function. They devoted a lot of effort 
to handling major embezzlement and bribery cases, severely 
dealing with criminal cases, and cases involving infringement of 
people's democratic rights and dereliction of duty were also 
handled, thereby making positive contributions to maintaining 
national and social stability, and safeguarding the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the 
smooth progress of modernization construction. 
  Zhang Siqing said: The main tasks of the procuratorial work 
at the present and for some time to come are: persisting in 
taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as the guide, implementing the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, adhering to 
the principle of "grasping two links at the same time," 
strengthening supervision over law enforcement, strictly 
enforcing law and relentlessly handling criminal cases, 
concentrating efforts on investigating and handling major and 
serious cases of embezzlement and bribery, cracking down on 
serious criminal offenses, safeguarding state interests from 
being infringed upon, protecting lawful rights of citizens and 
corporations, and ensuring political and social stability, so as 
to create a sound legal environment for reform, opening up, and 
modernization and to facilitate the establishment and 
development of a socialist market economic structure. 
  The meeting voted to approve a decision to accept Yang 
Yanyin's request to resign as a member of the NPC Standing 
Committee, as well as the election procedures for the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC. According to the election procedures, 
the number of candidates for additional members of the NPC 
Standing Committee to be elected will be the same as that to be 
elected; and they shall be elected through secret ballots. 
  Executive chairmen of today's meeting were Cheng Siyuan, 
Wang 
Hanbin, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Pagbalha Geleg 
Namgyai, Ma Sizhong, Ye Gongqi, Qu Geping, Quan Shuren, Liu 
Huaqing, Li Zhen, Yang Xizhong, Yang Taifang, Zhang Jianmin,

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Zheng Shouyi, leader 
of a democratic party in China, today proposed ways to better 
attract and utilize foreign funds and improve the management of 
foreign-funded enterprises. 
  After reviewing achievements in the introduction of foreign 
funds in recent years, Zheng Shouyi, vice-chairman of the 
Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest 
Party), said in a speech that attention should be paid to the 
solution of problems in the introduction of foreign funds. 
  "Governments at all levels should draw up long-term plans 
for 
the introduction and use of foreign funds in a bid to improve 
their macro-management in this regard," he told a meeting of the 
current session of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference today. 
  They should also formulate policies and principles 
concerning 
the use of foreign funds, in line with specific economic 
conditions of their respective regions, he said. 
  It is also necessary to formulate regulations and policies 
to 
encourage foreign investors, and examine both annual and 
long-term plans for the introduction of foreign funds, he added. 
  He proposed setting up managerial departments to coordinate 
efforts to solve major problems in using such funds. 
  In the future, it is necessary to attract investments from 
multi- national corporations and international consortiums, and 
encourage them to invest in energy, transportation and other 
infrastructure projects, he said. 
  They should also be encouraged to undertake major projects 
to 
upgrade technology in existing large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, he added. 
  "At present, the amount of foreign investment in public 
health, education and culture is very small. I think we should 
make breakthroughs in these areas," he said. 
  Zheng Shouyi called for efforts to perfect China's legal 
system, noting that legislative measures must be compatible with 
internationally accepted practices. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises inside China must be treated as 
Chinese legal entities, he said, adding that both Chinese- and 
foreign-funded enterprises should be treated equally. 
  Furthermore, it is imperative to tighten supervision over 
tax 
payments by foreign-funded companies, accurately evaluate 
foreign assets and protect the legitimate rights and interests 
of workers in these companies, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- After examining the 
"Report on the Implementation of the 1993 State Budget and on 
the Draft 1994 State Budget" presented by Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli on behalf of the State Council, the National People's 
Congress [NPC] Financial and Economic Committee held that, on 
the whole, the 1993 state budget had been properly implemented, 
and the guiding principle underlying the arrangement for the 
1994 state budget is correct. The Financial and Economic 
Committee proposed that the NPC approve the "Report on the 
Implementation of the 1993 State Budget and on the Draft 1994 
State Budget," as well as the 1994 state budget submitted by the 
State Council. At the same time, it proposed that the NPC 
Standing Committee be authorized to examine and approve the 1993 
state final accounts as soon as they are compiled. 
  The Financial and Economic Commission believed that in 1993 
the people of various nationalities across the country 
comprehensively implemented the guidelines set forth in the 
important talks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, as well as those 
of the 14th CPC National Congress; earnestly carried out the 
"Opinions Concerning the Current Economic Situation and 
Strengthening of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control" forwarded 
by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council; and 
significant achievements had been made in economic development 
and reform and opening up to the outside world. During the 
year, on the basis of increasing financial resources, finance 
and taxation departments made positive efforts to strengthen 
revenue collection and management and to strictly levy taxes 
according to the law, resulting in a relatively large growth in 
state revenues, ensuring that expenditures had basically met the 
needs of key construction projects and the needs for reform and 
opening up as well as the development of various undertakings. 
On the whole, the state budget was duly implemented. 
  The report pointed out: The major problems in implementing 
the 1993 budget were: central government revenues and 
expenditures were not in accord with the budgeted amounts, while 
the financial position in various localities was marked by a 
relative increase in revenues and excessive growth in 
expenditures, an overly rapid increase in investment in 
infrastructure in some localities, and defaults in salaries and 
wages for public servants and teaching staff in other 
localities. Steps should be taken to earnestly analyze these 
problems, sum up the experience, draw a lesson and improve work 
conscientiously. 
  The Financial and Economic Committee held that in respect of 
the guiding principles of the 1994 state budget, basically, 
conscious efforts were made to ensure spending on key projects 
and on meeting the needs for promoting national economy and 
social development. At the same time, efforts were also made to 
provide essential financial guarantees to smoothly push forward 
various major economic reforms, and to enhance and improve 
macroeconomic regulations and control. While arranging revenues, 
efforts were made to maintain a fairly rapid growth, and while 
arranging expenditures, attention was paid to increasing 
spending on key sectors including agriculture, education, 
science and technology, and infrastructure. Expenditures for 
defense and political and legal departments maintained essential 
growth, and attention was given to controlling investment in 
fixed assets. 
  The report held that the main problems in arranging the 1994 
state budget were: a relatively slow growth in revenues, a 
relatively rapid growth in expenditures, and an increase in 
deficits. This is due to relatively vigorous attempts to carry 
out economic restructuring in 1994. To facilitate the 
implementation of financial and tax reforms, and to ensure 
transformation of mechanisms, some important measures have been 
introduced; this is bound to increase the factors for reducing 
income and enlarging expenditure. 
  To ensure the smooth implementation of the 1994 state 
budget, 
the report proposed that continuous efforts be made to implement 
the measures forwarded by the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council to enhance macroeconomic regulation and control, 
to further strengthen the collection and management of state 
revenues, duly control expenditures, and reduce the disparity 
between income and expenditures in a bid to create a favorable 
situation for economic development and implementation of various 
reform measures. In light of the opinions of the members 
examining the report, the Financial and Economic Committee 
forwarded the following proposals: (1) Strive to cut down 
deficits by all means. (2) Strive to increase state revenues. 
(3) Strictly control expenditures. And, (4) Inject more funds 
to support development of less economically advanced areas. 
  The Financial and Economic Committee hoped that governments 
at all levels, finance and tax departments, enterprises, and 
units of various undertakings would adopt an overall concept, 
strive to safeguard the national interest as a whole, treat the 
state budget with all seriousness, resolutely implement all laws 
and provisions governing finance and taxation, stringently 
enforce financial and economic discipline, and oppose all 
fraudulent practices and falsified reports. It is necessary to 
carry forward the fine tradition of hard work in building our 
country and in attending to all our undertakings. We must make 
concerted efforts, help each other like people in the same boat, 
and try in every possible way to increase revenues and curtail 
expenses and strive for even better results in our bid to 
fulfill the 1994 state budget.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Tao (0719 3447): "At Panel Discussion, </F>
Military Deputy Chi Haotian Urges Doing a Good Job in National 
Defense Building and Army Work"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--We should 
unwaveringly support the state in speeding up the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure; do a good job of 
stabilizing the situation with all our hearts and all our might 
to provide a stable, reliable, and safe environment for China to 
deepen reform and develop the economy; and, while promoting the 
overall interest of economic construction, we should strive to 
increase national defense capabilities and create more favorable 
conditions for resisting aggression and defending the 
motherland. That is the central topic of a speech by [Defense 
Minister] Chi Haotian, an army deputy to the National People's 
Congress, when the People's Liberation Army delegation held a 
panel discussion this afternoon to deliberate the government 
work report. 
  Chi said that in the government work report, Premier Li Peng 
pointed out: "Reform and opening up is the motive force behind 
the development." Given that the economies of many countries in 
the world develop slowly, stage weak recoveries, and even 
register negative growth, the Chinese economy, full of vigor and 
vitality, has maintained a strong momentum of growth. This is 
thanks to the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to reform 
and opening up. At this crucial juncture, when the state is 
expediting reform of the economic structure, we should bear in 
mind President Jiang Zemin's remark that revolutionary 
servicemen should hold aloft the banners of patriotism and 
socialism, regard the interests of the party and the people as 
their own, and contribute to the deepening of reform and the 
economic prosperity of the state. 
  Chi pointed out: Reform, development, and stability are an 
organically-linked entity in which reform is the motive force, 
development is the fundamental, and stability is the 
prerequisite. Only by accurately grasping and correctly handling 
the relationship between them can we maintain the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 2170 4958, 1816 
6643, 0256 1660] development of the national economy. Stability 
plays a special role in reform, development, and the overall 
interests of accomplishing the work of the whole party. It is 
especially necessary for leading army cadres at all levels to 
bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea that "stability is of 
paramount importance" and conscientiously regard the maintenance 
of stability as an important duty, so that the party and state 
can concentrate their energy on reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. Chi said: All army comrades should, in answer to 
the call of the party Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission, launch activities of learning from Lei Feng and Xu 
Honggang and resist the corrosion of money worship, pleasure- 
seeking, and ultra-individualism using a correct outlook on life 
and correct values. Leaders at all levels should enhance their 
awareness of the masses, direct their eyes downward, show 
solicitude for soldiers, do practical things for grass-roots 
units and help them solve problems, increase the cohesiveness of 
army units, and maintain a high degree of stability and unified 
centralism in the army. 
  Strong national defense is a reliable guarantee for the 
country's long-term political stability. On the issue of 
stepping up national defense modernization while putting the 
overall interests of economic construction first, Chi Haotian 
said: It is necessary to consistently take as our guide Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and his idea on army building in the new period 
and strive to explore the special features and laws of defense 
building under the conditions of socialist market economy and 
modern warfare, so that defense building can be adapted to the 
new situation. It is necessary to perseveringly launch 
education in national defense, the focus of which is on cadres. 
The idea that "there is no security and stability without an 
army" and the ancient teaching that "despite peace in the world, 
it is dangerous to forget about war" should first strike root in 
the minds of cadres at all levels. We should rely on the party, 
the government, the army, and the forces of all social sectors 
in keeping up mass, regular education in national defense and 
play a positive role in exerting a subtle influence. It is 
necessary to step up the building of a legal system for national 
defense, persist in grasping the formulation and enforcement of 
laws while, at the same time, paying equal importance to both. 
With regard to national defense statutes that have been 
adopted, we should firmly uphold them and exercise management in 
accordance with them. While stepping up education in national 
defense and engaging in defense building according to statutes, 
we should adapt the building of reserve forces to the 
development of a socialist market economy through vigorous 
readjustments and reforms. 
  At the panel discussion this afternoon, Zhang Baokang, Zhou 
Yibing, and Zhang Xusan said: The government work report is 
encouraging. The fact that China scored a series of 
achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive 
last year has once again proved that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a 
powerful ideological weapon for guiding reform and construction. 
It shows that the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core, and the new government are firm, strong, and 
highly effective in their leadership. It also shows that, led 
by the new Central Military Commission, the whole army has 
carried forward the fine traditions and played the role as a 
"pillar," a "great wall," and a vital new force in defending 
state security, safeguarding social stability, and supporting 
state economic construction.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Li Yin (2621 0692): "At an NPC Session </F>
Panel Forum, Deputy Zhang Zhen Speaks About `Three 
Modernizations' Army Construction and the Comprehensive 
Enhancement of the Troops' Combat Capability"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Zhang Zhen, Army 
deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC], today stressed 
during a panel discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work 
report that, under the new situation of reform and opening up, 
the People's Liberation Army [PLA] has an important duty in the 
areas of safeguarding the country's security and maintaining 
social stability. He called for strengthening our Army's 
revolutionized, modernized, and regularized construction; for 
the overall improvement of the Army's combat ability; and for 
the provision of a strong and forceful security guarantee for 
reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  In his speech, Zhang Zhen first reflected on the 
world-renowned great achievements in reform, opening up, and 
modernization in our country since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee. With vivid and meticulous facts 
and figures, he detailed the positive situation and vitality in 
which our country enjoys political stability, economic 
development, ethnic unity, and social progress. He thought 
that, regarding the great achievements in reform and opening up 
over the past 15 years, education and propaganda must be carried 
out properly, to further unify thinking, arouse fighting spirit, 
and enhance soldiers' morale. 
  NPC deputy Zhang Zhen said that the most basic reason 
enabling our country to make the great achievements is because 
we have upheld the party's basic line and have followed the road 
of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Practice has proven 
that this is the correct road. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
integrated the basic principle of Marxism with China's actual 
conditions, has established the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and has led us to realize the 
second historical leap. Zhang Zhen also said: There will still 
be various difficulties on the road ahead, but I believe that, 
under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the strong and 
forceful leadership of the CPC Central Committee which has 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and with the strength and 
experience that we have acquired in the course of reform and 
opening up for more than a decade, and by the common effort of 
the people throughout the country, we are fully confident that 
we can win a new victory in reform and construction. 
  In discussing army building, NPC deputy Zhang Zhen happily 
said that, under the new situation of reform and opening up, the 
entire Army has vigorously strengthened ideological and 
political work, and the Army's party spirit building, clean 
government building, and spiritual civilization construction 
have scored good results. A great enthusiasm for military 
drilling has emerged throughout the Army, which has drilled hard 
for the ability to fight, and military exercises have witnessed 
a good situation which has rarely been seen in the past. In the 
area of logistics, comrades throughout the Army have developed 
the good tradition of building the Army diligently and 
economically; the logistics departments of various levels have 
worked hard to increase efficiency in the use of funds; and 
soldiers have enthusiastically engaged in agricultural and 
sideline productions, making new progress. The building of the 
national defense reserve strength has also scored marked 
results, and militia and reserve units have played an important 
role in building the economy and safeguarding social stability. 
After reflecting on the achievements in army building over the 
past year, Zhang Zhen said that this has fully indicated that 
our Army is firm politically, is resolute in listening to the 
party's words, and is completely trustworthy to the party and 
the people. 
  Zhang Zhen stressed that strengthening national defense, 
resisting aggression, protecting the motherland, and 
safeguarding the peaceful environment in which people work is 
the sacred duty entrusted to our Army by the constitution. 
Under the new situation of reform and opening up, the PLA has 
an important duty in the areas of safeguarding the country's 
security and maintaining social stability. Only by building a 
strong Army which is under the absolute leadership of the party 
and is loyal to the country and people can we maintain our 
country's security and stability and ensure a smooth process in 
reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  Zhang Zhen pointed out that, in order to properly build the 
Army, we must first seriously learn from Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and must use Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, as well as his idea of army building in the new 
period, to arm the minds of the officers and men throughout the 
Army. Only by so doing can we further enhance 
self-consciousness for implementing the party's basic line and 
maintain our Army's high degree of stability, centralism, and 
unity. Zhang Zhen also mentioned the need to expedite the 
process of forumulating national defense legislation and use 
legal means to strengthen national defense and army building. 
In this area, we must abide by the laws and regulations 
promulgated by the NPC and the government and must implement 
them resolutely. 
  Finally, Zhang Zhen also discussed with the deputies the 
problems of vigorously enhancing the sense of national defense 
among the whole people, actively supporting economic development 
in the frontier regions inhabited by minority nationalities, and 
giving play to the role of the militia and reserve units in 
maintaining law and order and social stability.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- China's main energy 
supply will depend on Shanxi Province for a considerably long 
period of time, Premier Li Peng said here today. 
  Joining deputies from Shanxi Province in a discussion during 
the current session of the National People's Congress, Li said 
that Shanxi has played and will continue to play an important 
role in the national economic development. 
  He noted that Shanxi supplies over 200 million tons of coal 
to other parts of China each year. 
  Coal mines run by townships and villages produce over half 
of 
the provincial coal output. The small coal mines have made 
contributions to the nation. "It is necessary to support small 
coal mines, accelerate their technical upgrading, strengthen 
their safe production and turn them into modernized or 
semi-modernized enterprises," he said. 
  On difficulties of state-owned enterprises, he said that 
solving problems of major state-owned enterprises is a vital but 
difficult issue in the current reform. The central authorities 
have decided to make continuous investigations in and study on 
this issue, which cannot be solved in one or two years or by 
adopting merely the joint-stock system. The invigoration of 
state-owned enterprises will depend mainly on technical progress 
and the production of marketable goods. 
  He also talked about building water conservancy projects to 
solve water shortages in Shanxi and about assisting the 
province's poor areas to develop their economies.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Text] Beijing is to launch a campaign to clear the 
notorious "triangular debts" problem, senior government 
officials revealed yesterday. Attending the NPC session in 
Beijing, the officials admitted that triangular debts -- debts 
enterprises owe each other -- have again snowballed to unhealthy 
levels. 
  In a discussion with NPC delegates from Liaoning province, 
Vice- Premier Zou Jiahua disclosed that the State Council would 
launch the campaign soon and the coal industry in northeast 
China was likely to be its first target. In his meeting with 
delegates from Hubei, premier Li Peng agreed that the triangular 
debts problem had become serious again and he called for urgent 
action. 
  The China News Service reported that triangular debts in 
Liaoning, where the majority of China's mammoth state-owned 
industry was situated, have grown from 32 billion yuan (HK$28.42 
billion) three years ago to 47 billion yuan. The Anshan Iron 
and Steel Company in Liaoning -- known to be a pillar of China's 
steel industry -- was one of the victims, CNS said. According 
to Liaoning Governor Yue Oilfeng, the company owed other 
enterprises more than six billion yuan but had difficulties in 
collecting eight billion yuan in sales from other firms. 
  The problem was equally serious in remote Inner Mongolia. 
The Communist Party Secretary there, Wang Qun, said triangular 
debts had spilled over into other areas of the economy. The 
secretary disclosed that in Inner Mongolia, government 
departments and enterprises had boycotted each other by holding 
off "coal and electricity". Some "very bad incidents" had 
occurred, he said. Although the secretary did not give details, 
analysts pointed out that there had been reports of "armed 
conflicts" between enterprises. 
  The economic tsar, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, admitted that 
the 
problem had resurfaced but did not offer a solution, according 
to CNS. However, the agency quoted an official of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission as saying that the problem arose 
because of an over-expansion of capital construction projects, 
coupled with a shortage of circulation capital. The 
unidentified official said enterprises had exhausted their 
circulating fund in expanding their fixed assets.

<F P=106> [Feature by reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516): "Li Ruihuan Gives </F>
the Green Light to Reporters"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC], participated in discussions held by Hong 
Kong and Macao CPPCC members at the Guest Hall this afternoon, 
which became the focus of reporters covering the ongoing CPPCC 
session. 
  When Chairman Li Ruihuan left the group of Macao CPPCC 
members for the conference room of the Hong Kong CPPCC members, 
many reporters had been waiting for him outside the door of the 
room for some time. With the snapping of camera shutters, Li 
Ruihuan entered the conference room while reporters from Hong 
Kong and Macao remained outside. 
  Upon taking a seat, Li Ruihuan found no Hong Kong and Macao 
reporters in the room and said to people working there: "How 
come Hong Kong and Macao reporters did not come in. This is a 
discussion held by the group of Hong Kong CPPCC members, and we 
should invite them in." 
  When a person working there went to invite Hong Kong and 
Macao reporters in, Li Ruihuan saw Mr. Xu Simin, member of the 
Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee and director 
of the Hong Kong paper CHING PAO. He then humorously said: 
"Standing Committee Member Xu Simin is a reporter running a 
newspaper. Such an important reporter is let in, why not other 
reporters?" This provoked laughter among the people in the room. 
  Given the green light by Li Ruihuan, the anxiously waiting 
reporters joyfully entered the room. 
  At the group discussion, attendees spoke one after another. 
Li Ruihuan's remarks were humorous yet profound, which were 
punctuated with applause and laughters. Hong Kong and Macao 
reporters recorded the scene with regular and video cameras as 
well as with pens.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Maintaining the 
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao is the common 
responsibility of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and the whole 
nation, a top Chinese leader said here today. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said it is 
necessary to be vigilant against those who, while making 
political troubles in Hong Kong, may create economic disorder 
there and hollow out Hong Kong's economy. 
  When paying a visit to Hong Kong and Macao CPPCC members, 
Li, 
who is also one of the top seven leaders of the Chinese 
Communist Party, said that, in the past decade, Hong Kong and 
Macao compatriots have made important contributions to the 
mainland's reforms, open policy implementation and economic 
development. 
  Social stability and economic development on the mainland 
have provided a reliable guarantee and powerful support for the 
prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao. The stability and prosperity 
of Hong Kong and Macao are linked closely with those on the 
mainland. The relationship has become more and more apparent 
with the approach of the date for sovereignty transfer, he said. 
  Continuously maintaining the stability and prosperity of 
Hong 
Kong and Macao is not only an issue of political principle but 
also an issue of the economic interests of Hong Kong and Macao 
compatriots and of the mainland people. 
  After China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong and Macao, the Chinese Government will adhere to the 
principle of "one country, two systems" and deal with various 
questions of Hong Kong and Macao with a positive and prudent 
attitude, he said. 
  He said that the British side should be held entirely 
responsible for the breakdown of Sino-British talks on the 
arrangement of the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. 
  He alerted Hong Kong people against robbery of Hong Kong 
money in a "modern way." People should pay attention to 
economic issues as well as political ones there, he said. 
  He said that the Hong Kong British authorities, in violation 
of an understanding memorandum, have raised the costs of the new 
airport to such a high level as to be "rarely seen in the 
world." It will impose a huge financial burden on the Government 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its people 
after 1997, he said. 
  Questions should be raised, he said, about who get contracts 
for the airport project and who will get all the money. 
  Backed by an increasingly prosperous motherland, and through 
the concerted efforts of Hong Kong people, Li said, Hong Kong is 
certain to have a bright future.

Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524): "State-Owned Enterprises Have a 
Gold Mountain Under Their Feet"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- When will large and 
medium- sized state-owned enterprises break through the 
"besieged castle"? 
  This has become one of the hottest topics at the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  It is an historical topic. Thanks to the devotion of several 
generations, socialist China has large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises -- a huge "family fortune" worth 1.8 
trillion yuan in total fixed assets. Despite accounting for 
only one third of the total number of enterprises in the 
country, they contribute half of the state's financial revenue 
and make up an all-embracing industrial structure. Joining the 
Shanghai delegation's discussion, General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
said: "Large and medium-sized state- owned enterprises are the 
pillar of the national economy as well as a unique advantage of 
the Chinese economy. Thanks to this advantage, China has been 
spared from many inevitable problems in the economic development 
of many developing nations." Enterprise reform aimed at tapping 
state-owned enterprises' potential has been carried out for 15 
years, beginning with the launching of the "pilot project for 
expanding enterprise powers" in 1978. With the state 
introducing various measures and enterprises bringing all their 
resources into play, the delegation of power, the cut in 
enterprise profits levied by the state, the levy of taxes in 
lieu of profits, and the contract system of managerial 
responsibility were implemented one after another during this 15 
year period to help a number of vitalized enterprises emerge as 
stars in their sectors, and to bring about profound changes in 
the overall outlook of state- owned enterprises. 
  This is also a practical issue. In contrast to the fast 
rising new force of village and town enterprises, it is hard for 
state- owned enterprises to takeoff because of their heavy 
burdens. The deputies summarized the present situation of 
state-owned enterprises as: Low economic returns, slow 
development, being heavily burdened, and wanting in sustaining 
power. Among the problems, various loans to be repaid by 
industrial enterprises covered by the budget already come to 800 
billion yuan, 18 years would be needed to clear the debts even 
if all their profits were used for debt repayment. Jilin deputy 
Quan Zhezhu said: At present the enterprises have several heavy 
burdens: 1. Too many debts; 2. too many retired workers and 
staff members; and 3. intense pressure from social undertakings. 
Whether or not large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
can extricate themselves from this predicament has a direct 
bearing on the success or failure of our reform. We may say, 
invigorating large and medium-sized enterprises is a problem 
that is not only difficult to solve but must be solved. 
  This is also a topic concerning the future. A Henan deputy 
working for the State Council said: The Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee made a decision on several 
issues pertaining to the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system, which is distinguished from the capitalist 
market system by the leading position occupied by large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises symbolizing socialist 
state-owned property. Improving and invigorating large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the central and 
long-term issues in establishing a socialist market economy. 
The deputies said: The "Regulations for Transforming the 
Operating Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the 
Whole People" and the pilot project of "changing operating 
mechanisms and establishing a modern enterprise system" 
promulgated and implemented by the state in the past two years 
have advanced China's enterprise reform to the third step of 
clarifying property rights, following the redistribution of 
powers and profits. From now on, state-owned enterprises will 
have a chance to really shake off administrative trammels, lay 
down the heavy historical burden, recuperate and build up their 
strength, and gradually form a capital fleet to sail into the 
vast ocean of markets. 
  The deputies call 1994 a year for "storming fortifications" 
and "smashing the barriers" in China's shift to a socialist 
market economic system. More than 1,500 Chinese and foreign 
reporters are gathering in Beijing to try to seize information 
at the NPC session and report to the nation or the international 
community on whether or not China can successfully make a major 
leap in this crucial year. While we could at least refer to 
some experience from outside our boundaries in shifting toward a 
market system and in reforming our financial, banking, and 
foreign trade systems, we have no precedence to follow in 
invigorating socialist state-owned enterprises and have to relay 
on our own exploration and creation. 
  In his "Government Work Report," Premier Li Peng put 
forward a new measure to vitalize large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises in 1994: "Change the operating 
mechanism of state-owned enterprises and explore ways to 
establish a modern enterprise system." Premier Li Peng said: 
The reform of state-owned enterprises is the focal as well as 
difficult point in reforming the economic structure. 
Establishing a modern enterprise system with clearly defined 
property rights, unequivocal enterprise rights and 
responsibilities, enterprise functions that are divorced from 
administrative functions, and scientific management is an 
inevitable need of developing socialized macro-production and 
the market economy, as well as an arduous and complicated job. 
This year the state will organize a number of large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises to, in accordance with the 
"Company Law," carry out a pilot project for establishing a 
modern enterprise system, to accumulate experience and gradually 
push on our drive. The continued, vigorous advance of the 
social security system reform and lessening of the burden of 
social undertakings on enterprises have created conditions for 
enterprises to participate in fair market competition. 
  A deputy working for a macroeconomic department said: In 
addition to a macro-environment favorable for state-owned 
enterprises to take big strides toward the market, the 
enterprises have now been handed most of the powers that are 
supposed to be granted under the "Regulations for Transforming 
the Operating Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the 
Whole People." The enterprises must seize this opportunity to 
make good and full use of the various policies introduced by the 
state, accelerate the transformation of operating mechanisms, 
and move to the starting line for fair competition. The state 
has selected 16 cities -- including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, 
and Wuhan -- as the first to carry out a pilot project for 
making a spurt toward such highly difficult enterprise reforms 
as "bankruptcy," "replenishment" [bu chong 5943 0339], and 
"peeling off" [bo li 0475 4418]. It is necessary to strengthen 
the enforcement of the "Bankruptcy Law," rely on cities to 
establish trading markets for property rights, and accelerate 
the readjustment of the enterprises' organizational structure. 
We should replenish the enterprises' capital in cash through 
various channels to solve their serious fund shortages. At the 
same time, efforts should be made to peel the burden of social 
undertakings off state-owned enterprises to make it possible for 
them to compete with fewer burdens. 
  Deputy Ruan Chongwu, governor of Hainan Province, said: 
Government departments should separate government administration 
from enterprise management, "however reluctantly they may go 
about it," letting enterprises handle matters that fall within 
the scope of their authority; allowing the market to deal with 
things that should be solved by market forces; and shifting the 
government's work toward coordinating, integrating, and 
balancing the interests of various social sectors so that they 
will become a single force driving overall social interests 
forward. 
  How did entrepreneurs feel about the deputies going all-out 
to help state-owned enterprises? Liu Benren, a deputy from 
Hubei, said: This year, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company will focus 
on establishing a modern enterprise system and on improving 
economic returns in accelerating the pace of transformation 
through the shareholding system. Deputy Geng Zhaojie, chairman 
of the First Automotive Group, said: In establishing a modern 
enterprise system, the government should turn over the reins to 
enterprises, which should also reform themselves; otherwise, 
nobody can save us. Geng Zhaojie said: There is a gold 
mountain beneath every state-owned enterprise. With the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, each 
enterprise will have a magic shovel with which to excavate the 
mountain. Whether it will strike gold will depend on its 
capability.

Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254): "Candid Advice and Discussion on 
Education -- Li Lanqing Discusses Education With CPPCC Members"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 14 
March, a lively atmosphere prevailed in the conference room on 
the second floor of the Xiangshan Hotel. Members of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National 
Committee from educational circles gathered there and invited Li 
Lanqing, Political Bureau member of the CPC Central Committee 
and State Council vice premier, to jointly discuss major guiding 
principles for education. 
  "I have been assigned to take charge of education for only a 
year; therefore, I am a `freshman.' As a student, I must first 
learn. CPPCC members present here today are experts in 
education. I have come to listen to and learn from you. This is 
an excellent opportunity," said Li Lanqing candidly in his 
opening remarks. At once, the atmosphere was enlivened. 
  Members successively took the floor. 
  Vice Chairman Wang Hu of the Beijing Industry University's 
Administrative Committee called for increased investment in 
education; 
  Vice President Su Dongzhuang of the Beijing Information 
Engineering Institute stressed the need to stabilize the 
contingent of teachers and raise the quality of education; 
  Fudan University Professor Hu Hesheng suggested stepping up 
efforts to improve the basic subjects taught at schools of 
higher learning; 
  Vice Chairman Guo Yanjie of the Liaoning Provincial 
Education 
Commission called for energetic efforts to promote vocational 
and adult education; 
  Vice Principal Liu Sifu of Shunnanjie Primary School in 
Sichuan's Suining city stressed the need to implement the 
"Teachers Law" to the letter; 
  .... [ellipses as published] 
  As he listened and took notes, Li Lanqing often nodded 
approvingly. 
  After hearing the speeches, he said: The issues you have 
just brought up are similar to those I heard during discussions 
over the past year. Practical problems in education can be 
divided into three categories -- investment, teachers' 
remuneration, and their housing conditions. As far as 
educational investment is concerned, the party Central Committee 
and the State Council have attached great importance to this 
issue, and all local governments and relevant departments have 
exerted great efforts and done a tremendous job. Spending in 
this year's budget on educational undertakings has increased 
18.5 percent over last year, including 81.5 billion yuan from 
budgetary funds, which is up 19.1 percent over last year. 
However, it is true that, as you have just mentioned, spending 
on education is offset by inflation. This problem, which exists 
not only in educational spending but also the entire state 
budget, should be studied further. In short, we should 
gradually increase investment in education in accordance with 
the requirements of the "Outline for Reforming and Developing 
Education in China." 
  Speaking on the problem of teachers' remunerations, Li 
Lanqing said: The principle need to increase teachers' 
remunerations is legislation. The "Teachers' Law," which was 
promulgated last year, must be strictly enforced. In view of 
the problem of the wage default to teachers raised by some 
members, Li Lanqing said: Last year the Education, Science, 
Culture, and Public Health Committee under the National People's 
Congress organized the State Education Commission and 
departments concerned to conduct an inspection of law 
enforcement in six provinces. According to their inspection and 
report, past wage defaults have been basically cleared. What is 
important now is to forestall the recurrence of defaults and to 
establish a mechanism to ensure that teachers are paid every 
month according to their teaching hours. He stressed: All 
localities which have not cleared wage defaults to teachers are 
not allowed to construct buildings or purchase automobiles; 
cadres from coastal areas where wage defaults have not been 
cleared are not allowed to go abroad or they will face 
investigation and punishment for violating discipline. In the 
meantime, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and control 
over funds for education and to establish and perfect the 
supervisory mechanism. Except for economically-developed areas, 
the leadership and management of basic education should be, in 
principle, taken charge of by county-level authorities and 
should not be delegated to lower authorities. 
  Speaking on the problem of housing for teachers, Li Lanqing 
said: If leaders at all levels earnestly place education in the 
strategic position of priority development, there will be some 
ways to resolve the problem of housing for teachers. We can 
practice frugality in some areas, but we must run educational 
undertakings well and do some practical things for teachers. Li 
Lanqing also praised leaders from Beijing, Dalian, and other 
places for their attention to educational work and the methods 
of actively resolving teachers' housing problems. He said: I 
asked central and local television stations as well as other 
mass media to cover the principal measures of various localities 
in enforcing the "Teachers' Law." It revealed that all 
localities had some measures to serve teachers in a practical 
way. 
  Li Lanqing continued: China is now a poor country running 
the world's largest educational undertaking. In view of this, 
merely relying on governments at all levels to strive to resolve 
the aforementioned problems is still not enough for the 
development of education in China. The key lies first in reform 
and, second, in encouraging the enthusiasm of all sectors to run 
educational undertakings. 
  Li Lanqing stressed the need to readjust the macrostructure 
of education. First of all, we should make efforts to run basic 
education well and vigorously develop vocational and adult 
education. Basic education should be conducted in rural areas 
in line with local conditions. Vocational and technical 
training should be incorporated into basic education, so as to 
train skilled peasants to promote the application of science in 
farming and developing village and town enterprises. In cities, 
students should be gradually introduced to various specialities 
after junior middle school, and vocational education of various 
levels should be vigorously developed so as to cultivate 
personnel useful to society. This will be the way to become 
useful persons for the overwhelming majority of Chinese youths. 
As for higher education, greater efforts should be made in 
reforming the patterns of running schools, systems, the creation 
of branches of learning and courses, teaching contents, 
enrollment, tuition, and distribution with a view to improving 
teaching quality and the efficiency of running schools as well 
as meeting current and long-term needs for developing a 
socialist market economy. Some reforms should be popularized 
before experimentation, and it is necessary to conduct in-depth 
and meticulous ideological and political work to enhance 
everybody's identification with the reform; thus vigorously and 
steadily promoting educational reform. Meanwhile, we should 
encourage all institutions of higher learning to supplement one 
another with their respective supremacy, share resources, 
advocate a gradual removal of barriers between them, and jointly 
run shools. Li Lanqing also emphasized the need to strengthen 
and improve moral education in schools. 
  Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State Council 
and 
persons in charge of the State Education Commission, Ministry of 
Finance, Ministry of Personnel, and departments concerned 
attended the forum and answered questions the members were 
concerned about.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Three executives of 
China's enterprise giants in petroleum, automobile and iron and 
steel industries regarded the introduction of a new property 
rights system for enterprises as the core in establishing a 
modern enterprise system. 
  And the system should also be managed through various forms 
and by managerial professionals, executives of the Daqing 
Petroleum Administration, the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory 
and the Anshan Iron and Steel Works said. 
  The reform of state-owned enterprises and the establishment 
of a new modern enterprise system are one of the pivotal and 
catchy juncture in China's reform of its economic structure as 
well as a "hot spot" of the ongoing second session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress (NPC). As deputies, executives of 
the three industrial giants are attending the session. 
  NPC deputies from enterprises have unanimously agreed that 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system is the 
fundamental way to invigorate China's large and medium-sized 
enterprises but the process will be "big project" and hard 
efforts are needed. 
  After a dozen years of experiments, China has finally 
charted 
the orientation of establishing such a system for state-owned 
enterprises, featured by a clear definition of property rights, 
explicit responsibility and rights, separation of administration 
and enterprise management and a scientific management. 
  Qian Dihua, mayor of Daqing city and deputy director of the 
Daqing Petroleum Administration, said the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system lies in the introduction of a new 
property rights system or a system of property rights of 
enterprises as legal entities to separate investor rights of the 
owners and property rights of enterprises as legal entities. 
This would help rid the state of its boundless responsibilities 
for enterprises which stems from the dilemma of the status quo. 
In the status quo, operators are not legally liable though they 
are legal persons. 
  As one of the country's mainstay enterprises in the basic 
industry, Daqing is willing to be selected to lead the industry 
in introducing the new system on a trial basis. In line with 
the policies mapped out at the third plenary session of the 14th 
Communist Party Central Committee late last year, mainstay 
enterprises in pillar industries are encouraged to introduce a 
shareholding system with state controlling a lion's share of the 
shares while allowing collective or individual capital to make 
up the rest. The Daqing oilfield has contributed half of the 
country's oil production since 1976 when its production bit the 
50 million-ton mark. 
  Unlike the Daqing oilfield, the Changchun No. 1 Automobile 
Plant has already begun the experiment of the shareholding 
system and has basically completed an inventory and check of the 
stockpiles and capital of the enterprise. This year the plant 
is expected to complete the transition from the current 
structure to a three-tiered corporation structure: parent 
corporation, share-controlling company and subsidiary companies. 
To ensure the smooth transition, Geng Zhaojie, director of the 
plant, is now also the chairman of the board of directors of the 
First Automobile Group Corporation. 
  Geng said, one of the effective approaches to establish the 
modern enterprise system is to decide who represent the state to 
manage the assets. What enterprises are worried about most in 
this regard is the trusting of government departments as 
representatives of the state-owned assets to manage the 
enterprises, Geng said. The outcome of the trusting will make 
it impossible for enterprises as legal entities to hold the 
responsibility for property rights. 
  In his personal view, his parent corporation should be in 
the 
position to represent the state to manage and operate 
state-owned assets. Geng's view seems to be a common 
acknowledgement among entrepreneurs that investor companies, 
share-controlling companies or large enterprise groups using 
state fund as its main source of capital, can serve as 
representatives of state-owned assets, rather than government 
departments, in the form of legal entities. 
  With an annual turnout of 240,000 cars, trucks and other 
vehicles, the No. 1 Automobile Plant is now ranked among the 500 
biggest enterprises in the world. The plant is planning to 
manufacture one million vehicles by the year of 2005. 
  Li Huazhong, general manager of the Anshan Iron and Steel 
Works, calls for diverse forms of modern enterprise system. He 
said the representatives of the state-owned assets should be 
made up by professionals in enterprise management in the 
capacity of "members of the board of directors" or "supervisors". 
  Leading the industry in the country, the Anshan Iron and 
Steel Works produced more than 8.5 million tons of iron and 
steel products last year. The works began experimenting the 
shareholding system as early as 1986 and so far has established 
several subsidiary companies in its efforts to find jobs for 
surplus laborers.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, a top 
Chinese leader, today called on China's northwestern Province of 
Gansu to accelerate its economic growth by using new ideas and 
new concepts compatible with a socialist market economic 
structure. 
  Speaking to Gansu deputies attending the ongoing session of 
the National People's Congress, Hu called on local officials and 
people to further emancipate their minds and seize development 
opportunities. 
  Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of 
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also said that it 
is necessary to proceed from specific conditions in Gansu, and 
promote local economic growth through reforms. 
  "We must attach great importance to agriculture as the 
foundation of the national economy, and improve basic farming 
conditions," he told the deputies examining the government work 
report delivered by Premier Li Peng. 
  Hu said that it is imperative to readjust the rural economic 
structure and develop highly efficient farming that offers 
greater and better yields. 
  He also called for efforts to expand township-run 
enterprises 
in rural areas and increase farmers' income. 
  "We must also further invigorate state-owned large and 
medium- sized enterprises and continue to enable them to play a 
leading role in the national economy," said Hu, who worked in 
Gansu for 14 years. 
  Moreover, it is necessary to promote a social atmosphere of 
respecting knowledge and professionals, further enhance unity 
among people of various nationalities and maintain social 
stability, he said. 
  Hu Jintao expressed the belief that so long as relations 
between reform, development and stability are handled properly, 
all kinds of work will be done better this year. 
  He also stressed the need to perfect the national people's 
congress system in the course of promoting socialist democracy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Enterprises in Hong 
Kong funded by the Chinese mainland have expanded their business 
in recent years, steadily enlarging the "Chinese factor" in Hong 
Kong's economic development and contributing to ensuring smooth 
transition and economic prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  Huang Diyan, vice-chairman of the Bank of China and a deputy 
to the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks at the 
current NPC session. 
  Since 1985 when Hong Kong entered a transition period, 
mainland- funded enterprises have expanded their business and 
many new ones have mushroomed, thanks to the mainland's reform 
and open policies, he said. 
  For instance, he said, such long-established enterprises in 
Hong Kong [H.K.] as China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd., China 
Merchants (Holdings) Ltd., China Travel Service (Holdings) Hong 
Kong Ltd., the Bank of China Group and China Insurance Hong Kong 
(Holdings) Co., Ltd. all have had impressive development, with 
their assets reaching more than one billion, ten billion and 
even 100 billion H.K. dollars each. 
  The Bank of China group has become the second largest 
banking 
group in Hong Kong, with savings deposits of 400 billion H.K. 
dollars and total assets of 700 billion H.K. dollars. 
  Many mainland enterprises such as China International Trust 
and Investment Corporation, Everbright Industrial Company and 
China Overseas Building Development Co. have opened and 
developed their business in Hong Kong in recent years. 
  Huang said mainland enterprises in Hong Kong are playing an 
increasingly important role in Hong Kong's economic activities. 
Many means of livelihood, especially those supplied by the 
mainland, are shipped and marketed by mainland enterprises 
including China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd. 
  Mainland enterprises also manage marine and river transport, 
especially shipping between Hong Kong and mainland ports. 
  Huang said his Bank of China Group in Hong Kong extends most 
of its loans to Hong Kong's industrial and commercial sectors, 
infrastructure and other social sectors. Last year the bank 
extended loans worth 16 billion H.K. dollars to Hong Kong's 
local industry and mortgage loans worth nearly 100 billion H.K. 
dollars for Hong Kong residents to buy housing units. 
  The Bank of China Group has helped local authorities keep 
Hong Kong's financial market stable and ensure a healthy 
operation of Hong Kong's banking and securities sectors, Huang 
said. 
  In the future, he said, mainland-funded enterprises in Hong 
Kong should continue to develop in order to build up an economic 
foundation for Hong Kong's smooth transition. 
  Mainland-funded enterprises should not only play a bigger 
role in economic activities in Hong Kong but also try to have 
their own spokesmen in the political field -- their own 
representatives in the Hong Kong Legislative Council's 
functional constituencies, Huang said.

  [Text] This afternoon, provincial delegation to the second 
session of the eighth National People's Congress held their 
second meeting. The deputies discussed how to make coal 
industry, state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and 
light industrial enterprises extricate themselves from their 
difficult position. 
  State Councillor Li Guixian; Wang Senhao, minister of coal 
industry; and comrades of relevant departments and committees of 
the state attended the meeting. 
  Deputy Suo Changyou, mayor of Harbin city party committee, 
gave a speech on how to accelerate the pace of technological 
transformation and revitalize the old industrial base. He said: 
The current prominent issue of Harbin city which is an old 
industrial base is the issue of state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises. At present, about 85 percent of 
state-owned enterprises in Harbin have historical burdens; their 
debt rate is high; their funds are seriously in short supply; 
the increase in fixed assets is insufficient; the reserve of 
fixed assets is not in flexible use; technological 
transformation projects are few in number; and technical 
installation is far below the national average. 
  These reasons have kept the economy of Harbin, and even 
Heilongjiang, tagnant. He proposed that the state set aside a 
certain amount of money from the increased portion of the 
financial revenue it has gained after abolishing tax reduction 
and exemption for the old industrial base of Harbin so that it 
can use this special fund for a special purpose, and increase 
loans for technological transformation. He also urged the state 
to give priority to supporting state-owned large and 
medium-sized key enterprises, help them raise funds through 
reform of the shareholding system, relatively increase Harbin's 
open collection of shareholders from society and the amount of 
shares listed. 
  Deputy (Gu Shouxian), director of Jixi Coal Mining 
Administration, offered some ideas and suggestions for solving 
some major issues of coal enterprises across the province, which 
must not be neglected. He said: At present, Heilongjiang's 
coal enterprises are in a difficult position of maintaining 
normal safety, production, and operation. The state should 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over the coal 
market, improve the transport capacity, increase the number of 
railway carriages, urge the users to settle and directly pay the 
railway transportation payment, arrange the market in a unified 
manner, forbid coal in Shanhaiguan to be delivered to northeast 
China, delegate coal export power to Heilongjiang, support coal 
mining areas to develop tertiary industry, readjust their 
contracting work index, and solve their historical burdens and 
the badly needed circulation funds. 
  Deputy (Chang Baoshi), a worker technician of (Faan) 
Machinery Plant in Qiqihar, introduced the difficulties of light 
industrial enterprises. He proposed that the state help them 
extricate themselves from their predicament as quickly as 
possible. 
  Deputy Ni Zhirong, chairman of the provincial Trade Union 
Council, gave a speech on strengthening democratic management 
among workers; and Deputy Yang Guojun, mayor of Mudanjiang city, 
also gave a speech on the suggestions and demands of 
invigorating state-owned, large and medium-sized industrial 
enterpirses. 
  After listening to the suggestions, State Councillor Li 
Guixian, said: The state should help Qiqihar's (Faan) Machinery 
Plant solve difficulties. This is not a minor matter. The raw 
material products turned out by Heilongjiang have been suffering 
money losses during transactions. These industries are the 
economic pillars of Heilongjiang. They are also of great 
signifiance to the state. At present, the distortion of prices 
of these raw material products has greatly affected not only 
Heilongjiang's economic development but also the national 
economy of China. Regarding enterprises of the war industy, the 
state is actively doing what it can to help this industry rid 
itself of difficulties. 
  After that, Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, said: 
Heilongjiang is the state's important coal producing base. At 
present, it has reached a situation in which its difficulties 
must be resolved. As a minister, I feel very unhappy. This 
year, the central authorities are concentrating efforts on 
solving the default of payment for workers, and will invest 2 
billion yuan in coal industry and use 500 million yuan to help 
coal mines develop tertiary industry. I believe the prospects 
for the coal industry to be bright.

  [Text] At the third meeting held today by the Heilongjiang 
delegation attending the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress, Premier Li Peng said with full confidence: 
Heilongjiang's economy has great hopes. As long as the higher 
and the lower levels are of one heart and jointly overcome the 
present difficulties, Heilongjiang will regain its vitality. 
  Premier Li Peng said: Heilongjiang Province is an old 
industrial base and a major raw materials producing province of 
the state. Many industries, such as heavy industry, agriculture, 
and energy, are the important aspects of the national economy. 
During the transition from the planned economy to the market 
economy, your province will meet some prominent difficulties 
which are much more prominent than Liaoning and Jilin. The 
central authorities have also realized this. In the course of 
price reform, we will gradually decontrol the prices. Our 
national condition cannot tolerate the strain of doing without 
such major raw materials as petroleum, grain, timber, and 
energy. If the price of diesel oil is raised, peasants will be 
unable to stand it. The price readjustment of raw materials can 
only be gradually decontrolled. Linking with the international 
market is also one of the major reasons for China's success in 
reform. 
  In referring to agriculture, Premier Li Peng said: Since 
China has a vast territory and dense population, the foundation 
status of agriculture is very important. We must never slacken 
our efforts in this aspect at any time. On the issue of grain 
storage, Heilongjiang has made great contributions. It is very 
unrealistic not to store grain. For example, the grain prices 
rose in south China last year. Many unlawful businessmen forced 
up the commodity prices and the people could not stand this. 
The central authorities allocated 5 billion tonnes of grain to 
the market to keep the prices down. 
  Premier Li Peng continued: We all know the difficulties of 
old coal mines. The most difficult mining area of Heilongjiang 
is Jixi. In addition, there are also problems concerning large 
and medium- sized enterprises and war industrial enterprises. 
These enterprises have heavy burdens and outdated equipment. 
The primary reason for this does not lie in Heilongjiang. 
However, development and structural readjustment need a process 
and the common efforts of the higher and the lower levels. The 
key to achieve this still lies in yourselves. 
  Premier Li Peng said with full confidence: Heilongjiang has 
many advantages and tremendous potentials, including industrial 
foundation, personnel quality, commodity grain bases, and border 
trade. You should not forget the northern part of China, and 
should have full confidence in it. If we give play to these 
potentials, Heilongjiang's economy will surely be pushed to a 
new height.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- People of all 
nationalities in the Tibet Autonomous Region are now 
concentrating their efforts on economic development at a time 
when Tibet enjoys political stability, economic development, 
social progress, national unity and improved livelihood for 
local people. 
  Raidi, chairman of the standing committee of the regional 
people's congress and a deputy to the National People's Congress 
(NPC), made the remarks here today at a press conference called 
by the Tibet delegation at the current session of the Eighth NPC. 
  Raidi, who used to be a serf in old Tibet, said that Tibet 
is 
an integral part of China and Tibetan nationality is a member of 
the big family of the Chinese nation. Any attempts at 
separatism and any activities aimed at creating the 
"independence of Tibet" are doomed to failure and will be firmly 
opposed by all the Chinese people including Tibetans. 
  Asked about his comment on the Dalai Lama, Raidi said that 
the Dalai Lama has engaged in activities aimed at separatism and 
sabotage of national unity since he began to live in exile after 
the 1959 rebellion. 
  The central government's attitude towards him has always 
been 
explicit, hoping he will abandon separatism and return home to 
contribute to the country's construction. 
  In response to a Hong Kong reporter's question on the state 
of human rights in Tibet, Losang, a neighborhood committee 
director of Chengguan District of Lhasa city, said, "I'm most 
qualified to answer this question since I used to be a serf. In 
old Tibet, my grandfather, my father and I were all serfs. We 
suffered hardships and beatings with no right to speak of." 
  "It is only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist 
Party that we Tibetans enjoy real human rights. We are now 
masters of the country, enjoying equality with other 
nationalities, and economic equality and equality between men 
and women and fully enjoying freedom of religious belief," 
55-year-old Losang said. 
  "Without knowing well the historical background, it is hard 
to understand things now," he added. 
  Raidi chipped in, saying that the claim that 105 "peaceful 
protesters" were jailed in prisons in Tibet was groundless. "I 
do not know how the list is compiled," he added. 
  Asked whether Tibet enjoys full freedom of religious belief, 
Losang Gyaincain, vice-president of the Buddhist Association of 
China, said that the policy of freedom of religious belief 
adopted in Tibet is protected by the Constitution. 
  "We have the freedom of religious belief and also the 
freedom 
of not believing in religion and the freedom to choose religions 
or religious sects," Gyaincain said. 
  Gyaincain, also a living Buddha in Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery in 
Xikaze, told reporters that in recent years Tibet has invested 
200 million yuan in renovating temples. Now the region is home 
to more than 1,400 temples which basically satisfy needs of 
local religious believers. 
  Answering questions about relations between Han and Tibetan 
nationalities, Raidi said Han and Tibetan people have lived in 
peace and harmony and enjoyed equality since the peaceful 
liberation of Tibet in 1951. Han and Tibetan people have forged 
close friendship in their joint efforts of building Tibet. 
  "Thus they have shared a common fate and can never be 
separated from each other," Raidi added. 
  On the claim of "emigration" of Han people to Tibet, Losang 
Toinzhub, mayor of Lhasa, said, "that's a sheer nonsense." He 
cited Lhasa, capital of Tibet, as an example. Among its 400,000 
population, Tibetans account for 87.21 percent and Han, 11.9 
percent. Among the Han people, some came to help with Tibet 
construction and some came to do business. 
  Toinzhu called economic exchanges "inevitable" in the course 
of reform and opening up. People from inland areas can go to 
Tibet and Tibetans can go to interior areas to do business 
there. "Why cannot people do so?" he asked. "The flow of 
people is not necessarily a bad thing and the most important 
thing is whether it is conducive to the development of Tibet. 
When Americans were opening up the West, weren't there many 
immigrants there?" he said. 
  Gyalcan Norbu, chairman of the Tibet regional government, 
disclosed at the press conference that, of a total population of 
2.28 million in Tibet, Tibetan people account for more than 96 
percent and, Han people and people of other nationalities less 
than four percent.

<F P=106> [Report by station reporter Ren Yongming; from the "News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Deputies from Tibet to the Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress continued deliberation of 
Premier Li Peng's government work report on 14 and 15 March. 
They held in- depth discussions focusing on Tibet's reform, 
opening up, foreign trade, and education for this year; and 
maintain that Tibet must pay keen attention to the two major 
issues of development and stability, and must subordinate the 
work in all fields to the overall interests of seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability [the 20-character 
principle], thereby actively and prudently pressing reform and 
opening up ahead in an all-round manner and creatively 
implementing the central authorities' guidelines. 
  Minister Song Defu and Vice Minister Zhang Zhijian of 
personnel; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation; and Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State 
Education Commission; attended the discussions to hear deputies' 
opinions and answer their questions. 
  NPC deputies Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional party 
committee; Raidi, Standing Committee member and deputy secretary 
of the regional party committee and chairman of the regional 
people's congress Standing Committee; and Yang Chuangtang and 
Luosang Toinzhub, vice chairmen of the regional government, 
spoke at the discussions. They emphasized: Development and 
stability are two major issues for Tibet. To accomplish the 
various tasks of this year, we must correctly handle the 
relations among reform, development, and stability. Reform is 
the motive force for economic development; development is the 
foundation for stability; and stability is the prerequisite for 
reform and development. To correctly grasp and handle the 
relations among these three issues in the light of the overall 
situation is crucial for the success of this year's work. In 
spite of mounting difficulties on the road of establishing a 
socialist market economic system in Tibet, we must resolutely 
implement the 20-character principle to serve the interests of 
the overall situation. We must take the overall interests into 
account and, in line with the principle of "three conducive's," 
go all out to proceed everything from reality and to work hard 
and conscientiously to achieve concrete results. Currently we 
should further solve deep-rooted problems of ideology and 
understanding, especially such problems among leading cadres; 
and should correctly handle the relations among the maintenance 
of social stability, the acceleration of reform and opening up, 
and the pace of economic development. We should also correctly 
handle the relations between self-reliance and hard work on the 
one hand and support and assistance from the state and fraternal 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions on the other; 
as well as the relations between economic and social benefits. 
We should get mobilized immediately and, based on the 
capability of each locality, department, or unit, work hard and 
conscientiously to continually scale new heights in Tibet's 
reform and opening up. 
  The deputies concluded: In invigorating Tibet's economy, we 
should continue to promote agriculture and animal husbandry, and 
more importantly, break the region's self-confinement and open 
it to the outside world. 
  Song Defu, Wu Yi, Liu Bin, and other officials answered 
questions raised by deputies on Tibet's institutional reform, 
foreign trade, and education. They said: The party Central 
Committee and the State Council have shown great concern for 
Tibet, and have stressed the need to support and assist the work 
in Tibet. Under the new circumstances of a socialist market 
economic structure and while continuing to implement the central 
authorities' preferential policies for Tibet, new preferential 
policies in keeping with the new situation have been studied and 
formulated. The central authorities have begun investigations 
of problems raised by deputies from Tibet. Efforts are being 
made to resolve most of the problems. 
  The officials unanimously pledged to do everything possible 
to solve Tibet's problems. Meanwhile, they urged Tibet to seize 
the opportunity; further promote reform and opening up; and make 
ample flexible, and effective use of the central authorities' 
preferential policies for Tibet to push its economy to a new 
stage of development.

<F P=106> [By ANHUI RIBAO correspondent (Li Changfang) and station </F>
correspondent (Zhan Xu) from the conference hall of the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress in Beijing; 
from the "Provincial Hookup" program] 
  [Text] While listening to the Anhui delegation's 
discussion of Premier Li Peng's government work report on 14 
March, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee 
[CPCCC] Political Bureau and member of the CPCCC Secretariat, 
stressed that agriculture is of extremely great importance to 
China and Anhui. Wen Jiabao said: In 1993, we focused attention 
on fulfilling three tasks for peasants and achieved 
comparatively marked success. First, we lightened peasants' 
burden. Second, no more IOU's were issued for the purchase of 
agricultural and sideline products. Third, to a certain extent, 
we put an end to letting land in rural areas lay uncultivated 
and to the exodus of rural areas' funds and personnel to other 
localities through macroeconomic regulation and control. The 
three tasks brought about a fundamental change in the situation 
of our having once attached little importance to the 
agricultural sector. Meanwhile, they showed that we can succeed 
in doing something for the agricultural sector so long as we 
have the determination. 
  Touching on the problems confronting the agricultural sector 
this year, Wen Jiabao said: This year, as far as the nation is 
concerned, the three most important tasks concerning the 
agricultural sector and rural areas are as follows: First, we 
must maintain a steady increase in the production of such main 
agricultural and sideline products as grain, cotton, and cooking 
oil; and we must do a good job of carrying out the vegetable 
basket project so as to guarantee the supply of grain, cotton, 
cooking oil, and other agricultural and sideline products and to 
guarantee a stable market. Second, we must continue to increase 
peasants' income. Third, we must maintain social stability in 
rural areas. So far as Anhui is concerned, it must bear in mind 
these three tasks and focus attention on fulfilling the 
following tasks: First, it must maintain a steady increase in 
the production of grain and cotton. Last year, Anhui increased 
grain output by a comparatively big margin and its peasants 
increased income comparatively quickly. This represented a 
comparatively outstanding success among those scored by the 
provinces and municipality in southern China and by all other 
areas across the country; this also showed that the Anhui party 
committee and government had attached great importance to the 
role played by agriculture as the national economy's foundation. 
Second, Anhui must increase peasants' incomes and continue to 
make efforts to improve their living standards. Efforts must be 
made to develop a highly efficient type of farming that provides 
greater and better yields through restructuring, to exploit 
various resources, to develop primary and secondary industries, 
and to develop village and town enterprises. Anhui must take 
comprehensive measures to increase peasants' incomes. Third, 
Anhui must step up efforts to carry out infrastructure 
construction for water conservancy works so as to enhance the 
agricultural sector's comprehensive capabilities of production 
and resistance against natural disasters. This task is of 
extremely great importance to Anhui. This year, it is still 
necessary for Anhui to continue to pay close attention to 
carrying out the harnessing of the Huai He in accordance with 
the central authorities' plan. Fourth, Anhui must strengthen 
leadership over agricultural and rural work and further bring 
into play the peasants' initiative. Anhui carried out rural 
reform ahead of all other provinces in China. It may be said 
that rural reform is a successful practice for the establishment 
of a socialist market economic system and has important [words 
indistinct] significance for us to reform the whole economic 
structure. It is hoped that Anhui will continue to give full 
play to its own strong points and will properly protect, guide, 
and bring into full play the initiative of peasants through 
deepening reform. 
  Finally, Wen Jiabao said: The central authorities recently 
drew up a series of policies and measures to improve the 
agricultural sector. What counts is our paying close attention 
to their implementation.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by XINHUA reporters He Ping (0149 1627) and Li </F>
Jianmin (2621 1696 3046): "Ardent Expectations -- Sidelights on 
Hu Jintao's Discussion With Gansu Delegation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- "How are you doing, 
comrades?" -- walking into the venue where Gansu deputies to the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
were holding their discussions, Hu Jintao, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the CPC 
Central Committee Secretariat who worked in Gansu for 14 years, 
greeted the deputies cordially. While examining and discussing 
the government work report, Hu Jintao probed ways to promote 
economic development in central and western China with the 
deputies. 
  Deputy Zhang Wule, acting governor of Gansu, was the first 
to 
speak: Gansu's economic development was fairly healthy in 
recent years and saw a growth rate of 8 to 10 percent every 
year. Its total output value of goods and services reached 34.9 
billion yuan last year. Hu Jintao was very pleased to hear this. 
  Speaking on some reform programs for this year, Zhang Wule 
expressed his full support for the central authorities' 
decisions and noted that these reforms were, in general, 
favorable to Gansu's economic development and that temporary 
difficulties could be overcome. Then, he spoke on problems in 
helping Gansu's poor areas extricate themselves from poverty and 
become prosperous; running large and medium-sized state 
enterprises well; developing village and town enterprises; and 
correctly handling relations among reform, development, and 
stability. 
  Hu Jintao, who knows Gansu's conditions very well, asked 
directors and managers from Lanzhou Petroleum Processing and 
Chemical Complex, Lanzhou Chemical Industrial Corporation, and 
the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Corporation about the operation 
of their respective enterprises. Guo Xilian, Yang Jinyi, and 
other deputies answered his questions. They reported: 
Presently, large and medium-sized state enterprises are facing 
the problems of antiquated equipment, heavy social burdens, and 
poor internal management. The fundamental way out of such a 
difficult position lies in deepening reform, changing operating 
mechanisms, and accelerating the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system compatible with a socialist market economy. 
  When Deputy Gu Jun, administrative commissioner of Dingxi 
prefecture, touched on antipoverty work in the prefecture, Hu 
Jintao asked with concern: "Have people there resolved the 
problem of inadequate food and clothing?" Gu Jun replied: "An 
overwhelming majority of them have basically resolved this 
problem. Now the per capita apportionment of food in the 
prefecture is nearly 300 kg and per capita income for peasants 
is about 500 yuan. The major contradiction in antipoverty work 
has shifted from the settlement of the food problem to ways to 
increase peasants' income. To adjust ourselves to the new 
situation, we will make corresponding changes in our ideology 
and work methods." Hu Jintao nodded with satisfaction after 
hearing this. 
  In his remarks Deputy Lu Kejian, chairman of the Gansu 
Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, proposed that 
it was necessary to gradually intensify the supervision over 
governments, people's courts, and people's procuratorates by 
people's congress and their standing committees at various 
levels, and to gradually have this work done in accordance with 
standards, procedures, and laws. Hu Jintao said: The system of 
people's congress is China's basic political system and a good 
form for inviting people to be their own masters. In the course 
of establishing socialist democracy, we should further 
strengthen this system and constantly improve it in practice. 
  Deputy Zheng Jinxia, a female health worker from Zhennan 
village, Dongxian county -- the most remote, poor area of Gansu 
-- reported that schools run by the people in the villages could 
not pay teachers on time and they had difficult lives. She 
hoped that the central authorities would attach importance to 
and tackle this problem. 
  "You have put forward an excellent opinion!" said Hu Jintao 
loudly, "authorities from central to local levels must resolve 
to settle this problem. We would rather cut a project or cancel 
a construction project than default teachers' wages. Wages for 
teachers working in areas with hard conditions should, in 
particular, be ensured by taking special measures." 
  Hu Jintao asked Gansu's party and government leading cadres 
sitting amid the deputies: "Do you agree or not?" Gansu 
Provincial Party Secretary Yan Haiwang said: "I absolutely 
agree. We will resolve this problem appropriately." 
  After hearing deputies' remarks, Hu Jintao first expressed 
his nostalgia and concern over the land of Gansu itself and 
people of various nationalities there. He noted: Over the past 
decade or so, Gansu, like other parts of the country, has 
brought about a significant change in its appearance through 
firm adherence to the party's basic line and unity and hard work 
of people throughout the province. They have particularly 
implemented the guidance in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important 
talk during his south China tour and the guidelines of the 14th 
CPC National Congress and have further emancipated their minds 
to achieve new progress in various aspects of work. This has 
further strengthened our confidence in taking the course of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 
  Hu Jintao said: There is one important reward from this 
session -- deputies have generally reached a consensus in the 
basic principles and overall interests for the work of the 
entire party and the whole country, which has laid a good 
ideological foundation for accomplishing all sorts of work for 
this year more satisfactorily. Now that the tasks are set and 
the general policies and principles are defined, as long as we 
unswervingly adhere to the central authorities' arrangement; 
keep the overall situation in mind; work in a down-to-earth 
manner; and correctly and properly handle the relations among 
reform, development, and stability, we are sure to complete all 
sorts of work well this year. 
  Hu Jintao noted: To enliven Gansu's economy, we should, 
first of all, further emancipate the minds, get a clear 
understanding of the situation, seize the opportunity, and use 
new ideas and new concepts suitable for the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure to guide our work. We 
should proceed from specific conditions in Gansu, promote 
development with opening up and reform, take the advantage of 
local conditions, and make good use of our own superiority. It 
is necessary to attach great importance to and strengthen 
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy; improve 
the basic conditions for agricultural production; gradually 
readjust the economic structure in rural areas after ensuring 
stable grain production; develop high-yield, fine-quality, and 
high- efficiency agriculture; vigorously develop village and 
town enterprises; and strive to increase peasants' income. We 
should further invigorate large and medium-sized state 
enterprises and continue to enable them to play the role as a 
mainstay in the national economy. We should encourage the 
social practice of respecting knowledge and professionals and 
promote economic development by relying on scientific progress. 
We should further enhance unity among various nationalities and 
maintain social stability, so that Gansu will achieve better 
results in various aspects of work.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Xu Xingtang (1776 5281 1016), Pu Liye </F>
(5543 4539 2814), and Wu Yilong (1566 1150 7893): "The Origin 
of Xiamen's Application for Local Legislative Power -- An 
Interview With Zhang Binsheng, Xiamen City People's Congress 
Standing Committee Vice Chairman"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- As the Second Session 
of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] will soon 
deliberate the "Decision on Empowering the Xiamen City People's 
Congress and Its Standing Committee and the Xiamen City People's 
Government To Enact Laws, Regulations, and Rules for Enforcement 
in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone [SEZ]," these reporters 
today interviewed Zhang Binsheng, Xiamen City People's Congress 
Standing Committee vice chairman, on this issue. 
  In 1989 and 1993, 30 or so deputies from the Fujian 
deputation submitted a joint motion first to the Second Session 
of the Seventh NPC and then to the First Session of the Eighth 
NPC, and had it included in the agenda of both NPC Standing 
Committees. 
  Zhang Binsheng said: The Xiamen SEZ was established in 1980. 
Viewed from the angle of the legal system, a SEZ only exists as 
a result of a stipulation by policy and takes the form of a 
special zone in the economic sense with an unclear legal status 
but no legal distinction from other localities. Practice has 
shown that the authority and credibility of some special 
economic policies implemented in a SEZ would be in doubt if 
these policies are not affirmed by any forms of corresponding 
legislation. After the NPC adopted a resolution in 1981 to 
empower Fujian Province to formulate separate economic laws and 
regulations for its SEZ, the provincial people's congress has 
done a lot of work in enacting a number of economic laws and 
regulations for getting economic development off the ground in 
its SEZ. Because of too much red tape and the legislative 
progress' lagging behind the needs of practical development, 
however, the provincial authorities had found some specific 
problems lying beyond their reach in terms of powers and pace. 
In view of this reality, the Xiamen SEZ's application for local 
legislative power was placed on their agenda. 
  On the significance of Xiamen's application for local 
legislative power, Zhang Binsheng said: The most important 
point is Xiamen's desire to become a pilot zone for making 
legislations related to Taiwan. NPC Chairman Qiao Shi had 
repeatedly stressed the need to move ahead with local 
legislation first and to set up experimental zones for 
legislation. If Shenzhen is called an experimental zone for 
legislation related to Hong Kong and Macao, then Xiamen would be 
the most ideal place for setting up a zone for experimenting 
with legislation involving Taiwan. 
  Zhang Binsheng went a step further and said: Once the issue 
of "three exchanges" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait 
is settled, Xiamen will be the top choice for a direct shipping 
port. It has a unique advantage in cross-strait relations that 
should be given a greater role. Being the mainland area with 
the highest concentration of Taiwan investment as well as the 
mainland port most frequently visited by Taiwan compatriots at 
present, Xiamen has seen the endless emergence of Taiwan-related 
legal affairs, including those of an economic nature such as 
trade, economic exchanges, and investment; a floodgate of civil 
legal relationships such as Taiwan- related marriages and estate 
inheritances; as well as criminal cases such as sea smuggling 
and airplane hijacking which have begun to crop up in recent 
years. As these Taiwan-related legal affairs are rather 
concentrated in Xiamen, the granting of local legislative power 
to Xiamen is thus an issue concerning not only Xiamen itself but 
whether Xiamen will have a chance to play a greater role and 
make greater contribution to the great cause of reunifying the 
motherland. 
  He said: This year is important to promoting and achieving 
a breakthrough in the reform of the economic structure in an 
all-round way. The extent, range, and difficulty of new reform 
measures are all unprecedented. Xiamen as a SEZ should take the 
lead in establishing a socialist market economic structure and 
following international practice and play a demonstrative role 
for the whole country. This is another important reason to give 
legislative power to the Xiamen SEZ. 
  Zhang Binsheng said: The people in Fujian and Xiamen have 
been expecting to obtain local legislative power for Xiamen and 
have understood their great responsibility. If the on-going NPC 
session will adopt the decision, people in Xiamen will certainly 
cherish and properly use this power. In recent years, Xiamen 
has been making long-term and annual plans for legislative work, 
has made a lot of social investigations, and has gained 
experience. The Xiamen City People's Congress Law Committee and 
the city government's legislative bureau have always considered 
it their main task. Xiamen has adequate legislative 
organizations and legal personnel. The legislative forces of 
Xiamen and Fujian can certainly handle the heavy task of local 
legislation properly with the assistance of experts from the 
central authorities and Beijing and by absorbing the advanced 
experiences of the Shenzhen SEZ. Besides, the Fujian CPC 
Committee and government have always supported Xiamen in 
obtaining local legislative power. 
  He said: Xiamen has accumulated some experience in 
legislation. Eight laws and regulations drafted by Xiamen have 
been adopted by the Fujian Provincial People's Congress Standing 
Committee. In addition, Xiamen has formulated more than 200 
standardized administrative documents [xing zheng gui fan xing

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Calling on members of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
from Hong Kong and Macao today, Li Ruihuan, member of the 
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, pointed out: It 
is the common responsibility of compatriots in Hong Kong and 
Macao, and people of the whole country to maintain the stability 
and prosperity of the Hong Kong and Macao regions in the last 
few years of their period of transition. At present, we should 
especially heighten vigilance against the possibility that while 
creating political confusion, some people might try to work in 
secrecy under the cover of nice words and fashionable 
"decorations" in an attempt to empty Kong Kong's economy by 
creating chaos. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Over the past decade and more, compatriots 
in Hong Kong and Macao have made significant contributions to 
reform, opening to the outside world, and economic construction 
on the mainland. Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have made 
indelible contributions to the emergence of a situation on the 
mainland characterized by rapid economic growth and economic 
prosperity. Of course, stability and development on the 
mainland have also provided a reliable guarantee and forceful 
support for prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao. Stability and 
prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao cannot be separated from those 
on the mainland. With the approach of 1997 and 1999, this 
supplementary relationship between Hong Kong and Macao on the 
one hand and the mainland on the other will manifest itself more 
explicitly. Both Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and the people 
of the whole country should reach this consensus: It is 
necessary to closely link the stability and prosperity in Hong 
Kong and Macao with that on the mainland, to take it as our 
bounden duty to safeguard and promote stability and prosperity, 
and to do our utmost to contribute to such a cause. He said: 
Continued maintenance of stability and prosperity in Hong Kong 
and Macao is not only a political principle but also means the 
common economic interests of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and 
of the people of the whole country. After resuming its exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, the Chinese Government 
will, vigorously and yet prudently, handle issues concerning 
Hong Kong and Macao. All should rest assured regarding this 
question. 
  Li Ruihuan pointed out: The British side must be held solely 
responsible for the suspension of Sino-British talks on the 
arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong. Under 
the cover of democracy, the British side attempted to take 
advantage of its remaining years of colonial rule to create 
division and confusion in Hong Kong in a bid to hinder its 
peaceful transition, and to influence and manipulate Hong Kong's 
political situation after 1997 as much as possible. This is 
something we absolutely will not allow. We did not wish to see 
the talks break down, but it is not terrible now that they have, 
because there can only be two possibilities: You will not 
listen to what I say and I will not recognize what you do. 
After we resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 
1997, it is reasonable for us to end colonial rule and all 
arrangements not commensurate with the Basic Law. Regarding the 
issue of the political system, the important thing is we should 
all work together with one heart to make arrangements for work 
after 1997 to enable the Special Administrative Region's 
political framework to be formed quickly and to operate 
effectively. 
  Li Ruihuan said: What is important now is that while we are 
concerned about the political question, we must not neglect the 
economic question. In the past, the colonialists openly carried 
out plundering, but they are now using a modern method of raking 
economic benefits. Hong Kong's money belongs to the people of 
Hong Kong. If they lower their vigilance, their money will be 
hallowed out, and economic confusion will result, thus leaving a 
huge financial burden for the future government of the special 
region and for Hong Kong compatriots. This matter merits 
serious attention, and we should prevent it from happening. He 
pointed out: The Chinese Government supports the construction 
of the new airport in Hong Kong, but the British Hong Kong 
Government has raised the construction cost to an unprecedented 
level in violation of the provisions in the relevant 
understanding reached between the governments of the two 
countries. It is possible to calculate how much money is needed 
for building an airport and how much is needed for reclaiming 
land from the sea. There are examples in the world we can 
follow. As the situation in Hong Kong is special, it is 
understandable that the construction cost may be somewhat 
higher, but as the cost of construction is exceptionally high, 
one cannot help thinking: Who are the contractors? Who is 
taking away the money? 
  Finally, Li Ruihuan said: For years all of you here today 
have done a great deal in safeguarding the stability and 
prosperity of the Hong Kong and Macao areas. It is my hope that 
you will continue to work hard to make still greater 
contributions. I am convinced that with your unity and 
cooperation, and with the backing of the thriving motherland, 
Hong Kong's bright future is fully guaranteed.

<F P=106> [By reporters Sun Yong (1327 0516) and Zhu Dongju (2612 0392 </F>
5468) ] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- The fifth meeting of the 
Standing Committee of the Eighth National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
opened this morning at the CPPCC auditorium. 
  It was presided over by CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li 
Ruihuan. 
  Members of the Standing Committee first examined and passed 
the agenda and schedule of the current Standing Committee 
meeting. According to the agenda, the meeting will examine and 
approve the Standing Committee's work report and the person to 
deliver the report at the Second Session of the Eighth National 
CPPCC Committee; discuss the "Report on the Work of the 
Government" (draft for soliciting opinions); examine and approve 
the "CPPCC Constitution (Draft Revision)"; hear and discuss a 
report by Comrade Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, on the current situation of 
the anticorruption struggle; and examine and approve the 
namelists of the additional members to be elected to the Second 
Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee and the members 
to be elected to replace members of the Second Session. 
  At the meeting, Zhu Zuolin, deputy secretary general of the 
National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on the agenda 
(draft) and schedule (draft) of the Second Session of the Eighth 
National CPPCC Committee. Chen Jinyu, deputy secretary general 
of the National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on the 
drafting of the work report (draft) of the Eighth National CPPCC 
Committee Standing Committee. Lu Zhichao, deputy secretary 
general of the National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on 
the "CPPCC Constitution (Draft Revision)." National CPPCC 
Committee Vice Chairman Wang Zhaoguo made an explanation on the 
namelists (draft) of the additional members to be elected to the 
Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee and the 
members to be elected to replace members of the Second Session. 
  In his speech, Li Ruihuan hoped that, during the session of 
the current meeting, Standing Committee members will seriously 
examine the aforementioned drafts, freely express their 
opinions, and submit the drafts to the current Standing 
Committee meeting or the Second Session of the Eighth National 
CPPCC Committee for examination and approval. 
  In November 1993 National CPPCC Committee member Shi Jiuyong 
was jointly elected a judge of the International Court for a 
nine-year term by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security 
Council. To abide by and to implement relevant stipulations of 
the International Court's rules, he tenendered his resignation 
as National CPPCC Committee member. National CPPCC Committee 
member Qian Qing tendered his resignation as member of the 
National CPPCC Committee's Foreign Affairs Committee for health 
reasons. After examination, the 10th chairmanship meeting has 
approved their requests to resign. The above was reported to the 
Standing Committee for the record. 
  The meeting examined and approved a decision on approving 
Comrade Song Demin's resignation as secretary general of the 
National CPPCC Committee for health reasons. 
  Because Liu Hanzhen supported and took part in fraudulent 
activities of "seeking treasures [zhao bao (2109 1405)" and 
"presenting treasures [xian bao (3759 1405)," and because Ma 
Liesun committed serious crimes, the meeting examined the cases 
and approved a decision on annulling Liu Hanzhen's and Ma 
Liesun's credentials as members of the Eighth National CPPCC 
Committee and its Standing Committee. 
  Those attending today's meeting included National CPPCC 
Committee Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Yang Rudai, 
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Hong Xuezhi, Zhao Puchu, Qian Weichang, Hu 
Sheng, Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, Su 
Fuling, and Ann Tse Kai.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- After Taiwan is admitted 
to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the 
average tariff rate on agricultural product imports will be 
somewhere between those adopted by Japan and South Korea, an 
official with the Council of Agriculture said Thursday [17 
March]. 
  "In adjusting tariff rates on agricultural imports, we'll 
not 
only consider GATT requirements but also refer to the rates of 
GATT members whose economic levels are similar to ours, such as 
Japan and South Korea," the official explained. 
  South Korea's average tariff rate on agricultural products 
stood at 19.6 percent in 1993, slightly higher than Japan's 18 
percent but lower than Taiwan's 21.63 percent. After the GATT 
Uruguay Round accords take effect later this year, the official 
said, the two countries must further lower their tariff rates by 
24 to 36 percent. 
  The official said Taiwan will be forced to open its 
agricultural market after it is admitted to the Geneva-based 
world trade regulatory body which advocates free and fair trade. 
  "With its limited production, Taiwan's agricultural industry 
cannot compete in international markets," the official noted. 
"And without tariff and non-tariff protection, the products 
will not even be able to compete on the domestic market." 
  Among others, growers of sugar, peanuts, red beans, garlic, 
mushrooms and potatoes will be hardest hit if the government 
removes subsidies and cuts tariffs in accordance with GATT 
regulations, the official said. Current local prices for those 
products are two to four times those quoted on international 
markets. Peanuts, red beans and garlic are major crops for 
farmers in southern Taiwan. "The social and political costs for 
allowing importation of these products will be very high," the 
official warned. 
  Many locally produced fruits, including pears, peaches, 
plums, apples, grapefruit, bananas, mangoes and guava, may also 
be squeezed out of the market after current import restrictions 
are eased, the official said. 
  To help local farmers overcome difficulties that are 
expected 
to arise after Taiwan's GATT entry, the official said, the 
agricultural council will adopt several strategies to cope with 
tariff problems. 
  First of all, the official said, the government will ask 
GATT 
to allow Taiwan to import only limited quantities of rice for 
the first 10 years of membership. "The import quota will be set 
at 1 to 4 percent of Taiwan's total annual rice consumption," 
the official said. "If this goal can be realized, the impact on 
our rice farmers will be limited," he noted. 
  Meanwhile, the official said, Taiwan will liberalize 
importation of other farm products under a tariff system. 
"After we join GATT, we'll use different tariff strategies 
toward different farm products," he explained. 
  For example, the government may lower tariff rates on some 
farm products during the off-season. The government may also 
adopt a two-tier tariff system for some items under which 
imports within quotas will be subject to lower tariff rates and 
higher rates will be imposed on those exceeding the quotas.

<F P=106> [News conference by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and Vice </F>
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng with moderator Wang Zheren and 
foreign and domestic correspondents at the Information Center of 
the Second Sessions of the Eighth NPC and the CPPCC Eighth 
National Committee in Beijing on 16 March; from the "Special 
News Program on the Second Session of the Eighth NPC"] 
  [Text] [Wang Zheren] Today, the Information Center of the 
Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
and the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is holding its seventh 
news conference. We are very glad that the persons in charge of 
the Finance Ministry and the State General Administration of 
Taxation [SGAT] are attending this news conference at our 
invitation. They will answer your questions on the reform of 
China's fiscal and taxation systems. Those present here are Mr. 
Liu Zhongli, finance minister and SGAT director; Mr. Jin Xin, 
SGAT deputy director; and Mr. Xiang Huaicheng, vice finance 
minister. 
  [Liu] To save time, we will dispense with opening remarks. 
Your questions will be welcome, and we are willing to answer 
them. 
  [Liu Shaobo] I am Liu Shaobo from the Central Television 
Network, and I have a question for Minister Liu. The 30 billion 
yuan treasury bond issue did not go very smoothly last year, and 
this year's issue will exceed 100 billion yuan. What measures 
will you take to ensure its smooth issue this year, and will it 
be apportioned? 
  [Liu] In issuing the 30 billion yuan of treasury bonds, we 
did indeed encounter some difficulties for a while. This was 
because the financial situation and financial order were poor 
last year. There were many unauthorized loans and instances of 
the illegal raising of capital funds, which diverted funds from 
legitimate uses to unnecessary purposes and which caused an 
irrational flow of funds. The situation improved soon after the 
State Council rectified the financial order, and the treasury 
bonds were in fact successfully issued by June or July of last 
year. The situation this year is different from last year, and 
our financial order has improved. At the same time, we will 
offer a preferential interest rate on treasury bonds and improve 
the methods of their issue. We will cooperate more closely with 
financial institutions this year. We will adopt international 
practices and gradually establish a system of first-class 
agents, and the bonds will be sold openly at second-class 
markets. We will also provide as many conveniences as possible 
to bond buyers so that people can buy and cash their bonds 
anytime they want. Judging from the size of the issue and our 
current financial situation, I believe that the issue will go 
smoothly and will win the people's support. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a Hong Kong reporter and 
have a question for Minister Liu. According to estimates, China 
will reach a peak period of servicing its foreign debts. To my 
knowledge, China's foreign debts in the first half of 1993 
totaled $74 billion, while they were $69 billion in 1992. Will 
you tell us about China's current foreign debt situation, and 
can you give us some examples? What measures will the state 
take to service its foreign debts? 
  [Liu] At present, China's foreign debt ratio stands at 
around 
90 percent and its debt service ratio at 7.6 percent. According 
to international standards, the warning levels for debt ratio 
and debt service ratio are set at 100 percent and 15 percent, 
respectively. Our 7.6-percent debt service ratio is far below 
the international warning level. So, I don't think we have any 
big problem concerning our foreign debt. In addition, since we 
started opening to the outside world and using foreign funds, 
our credit rating has always been good. 
  [Unidentified foreign correspondent in English, fading into 
Mandarin translation] I am from the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. I 
have a question about the budget law that was submitted to the 
NPC yesterday. According to a plan to revise the law, China 
shall maintain a balance between its domestic budget [guo nei yu 
suan] and its external budget [guo wai yu suan]. If the deficit 
goes beyond its ceiling, will you, as the finance minister, be 
held accountable? 
  [Liu] There are two parts to the budget law. One part says 
that no deficit is permitted for the routine, public portion of 
the central budget. A deficit, in the form of a bond issue, is 
permitted, to meet the needs of national construction projects. 
The law stipulates that the size and structure of the debt 
incurred from the bond issue must be rational. In other words, 
it must be within our solvency. At the same time, the law also 
stipulates that whoever violates the deficit ceiling and borrows 
more than an authorized amount of debt shall be held legally 
liable. So, if the deficit and the debts exceed the 
NPC-approved figures, the finance minister should of course be 
held accountable. If something unforeseeable, such as an 
extraordinary natural disaster, happens during the course of 
executing the budget, we may readjust the budget with the 
approval of the NPC Standing Committee. Then our responsibility 
will be assessed according to the adjusted amount of the budget. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am from ZHONGGUO RIBAO and I 
have a question for Vice Minister Xiang. The promulgation of 
the tax assignment system [fen shui zhi] has caused more 
reactions in the central and western regions, particularly the 
old revolutionary base areas, ethnic minority regions, border 
regions, and poor regions, than in other parts of the country. 
They are worried that they might lose the preferential 
treatment and financial subsidies that they currently enjoy. 
Are their fears warranted? 
  [Xiang] Their fears are unwarranted. First, after the new 
system takes effect, the old distribution pattern will remain 
unchanged. Some provinces in the western region which receive 
central financial subsidies will continue to receive them, with 
the amounts not being changed. Second, existing preferential 
policies will remain valid if they are the basis for the base 
figures of local revenues and expenditures. Third, after the 
tax assignment system takes effect and the central revenues 
gradually increase over the next several years, we will 
formulate procedures for spending transfers according to 
international practices. Then, the regions encountering 
difficulties and ethnic minority regions in the western part of 
our country will be the first to enjoy the benefits of the 
procedures. For this reason, if I represent the western region, 
I would be the first to approve of the tax assignment system. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with XINHUA. 
I heard that Minister Liu will leave for the United States 
tomorrow to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] 
meeting of finance ministers. I would like to know what the 
meeting's discussions will focus on and whether the issue of the 
trade deficit between China and the United States will be 
discussed at your talks with the U.S. treasury secretary. Thank 
you. 
  [Liu] After consultations, it has been decided that the 
Asian-Pacific regional finance ministers meeting will be held in 
Hawaii on 18 to 19 March. The meeting will be a formal meeting 
of the finance ministers of Asian-Pacific countries. The 
primary goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for the 
finance ministers of the APEC member states to exchange views 
and opinions on regional issues of common concern to enhance 
mutual understanding. The main topic of the meeting is to 
discuss the strategy of macroeconomic growth, international 
financial issues, and building a domestic financial market -- a 
capital market. The meeting will be a multilateral forum, and 
thus it will not discuss bilateral issues. Therefore, China and 
the United States also will not discuss bilateral issues. 
  [(Li Gao]) I am reporter (Li Gao) of GONG SHANG SHI BAO. I 
would like to ask Minister Liu a question, that is, will the 
implementation of the system of sharing tax revenues between the 
central and local authorities affect the economic growth of some 
economically developed provinces in the coastal region? 
  [Liu] It should not and will not have any impact because the 
results of January and February have already proved this. This 
is especially true when it comes to the kind of tax called the 
value-added tax, which everyone and all localities are most 
concerned about. We have adopted a sharing system for 
value-added taxes, so they are actually shared taxes -- that is, 
after a locality's economy is developed, both the central and 
local authorities will benefit, and whoever develops faster will 
benefit more. Therefore, there will not be any impact. 
  [Unidentified correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin 
translation] I would like to know what is the interest rate of 
your treasury bonds. The inflation rate in cities is about 20 
percent, while your risk rate [as heard] is only about 13 
percent. How can this encourage city residents to purchase 
treasury bonds? 
  [Liu] I think that our goal this year is to keep the 
inflation rate at 10 percent. We are working on this. If it is 
10 percent, then the (?annual interest rate of our three-year) 
treasury bonds, which is 13.96 percent, is a positive rate. 
Second, when we announced the interest rate for treasury bonds 
last year, we said that treasury bonds were meant to hold their 
value. If for some reason the inflation rate goes out of 
control, then [words indistinct] will still have to purchase 
[words indistinct]. Now that everyone understands the policy, I 
hope that everyone will enthusiastically purchase [treasury 
bonds]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Minister, if your draft 
budget is approved by the NPC, it will be implemented as of 1 
January 1995, which is only two and a half years from when Hong 
Kong reverts to China. Your draft Budget Law stipulates that 
localities are not allowed to permit deficits, and the Hong Kong 
Basic Law also stipulates that Hong Kong is not allowed to 
permit a deficit. But, Hong Kong's finance department has 
estimated that as of 1 January 1997, during the 1997-98 fiscal 
year, the money, including the land fund and financial surplus, 
left to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] by the 
British Hong Kong Government will be around 270 billion Hong 
Kong dollars. As a financial expert, do you think it is 
financially reasonable to leave more than 200 billion Hong Kong 
dollars idle and not be allowed to spend it? 
  [Liu] Hong Kong is an SAR. It has its own Basic Law, and it 
should do things according to the Basic Law. There is a special 
clause in the Basic Law that concerns financial problems. 
Therefore, things should be done according to the Basic Law. 
The central government will not seek financial help from Hong 
Kong. I will not discuss this issue in detail with you, but 
there is one thing -- that is, the current Chinese Government 
has taken the Hong Kong people's long-term interests into 
consideration.

<F P=106> [By reporters Li Anding (2621 1344 1353) and Ding Jianming </F>
(0002 1017 6900)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Liu Zhongli, minister 
of finance and director of the State General Administration of 
Taxation, answered Chinese and foreign reporters' questions 
concerning China's financial and taxation reform this year at 
the news center for the "two sessions" today. 
  In answering a question regarding the issuance of treasury 
bonds this year, Liu Zhongli said: A total of 100 billion yuan 
of treasury bonds are planned to be issued this year. Although 
the total amount of bonds issued is much larger than that of 
last year, the issue is expected to go smoothly because the 
financial order this year is good, the bonds have a preferential 
interest rate, and the method of issuance has greatly improved. 
In particular, banking institutions have cooperated closely to 
handle issuance work on this occasion. Bonds will be 
underwritten by banks and other financial institutions, which 
will be responsible for resale to investors who can make 
purchases at any time. Because they are easy to purchase and 
because of other favorable conditions, including the 
inflation-proof interest rate, the work will be supported by the 
people. 
  Speaking of China's foreign debts, Liu Zhongli said: China 
has achieved great results in utilizing international funds in 
recent years. The total amount of China's current foreign debts 
is $80 billion, including funds provided by foreign investors of 
Chinese-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and 
wholly foreign-owned enterprises, as well as loans obtained by 
enterprises and the government. At present, the ratio of 
China's total foreign debts to its annual export value is 90 
percent and its debt service ratio is 7.6 percent, which are far 
lower than the internationally recognized warning levels, which 
are 100 percent in debt ratio and 15 percent in debt service 
ratio. China has enjoyed a good international credit rating. 
As of last February, China's foreign exchange reserve had 
increased to $27.2 billion from $21.2 billion recorded at the 
end of last year. 
  Speaking of ways to reduce this year's deficit, Liu Zhongli 
said: We will no longer use bank overdrafts to cover our 
deficit. Instead, we hope to reduce the deficit first by 
effectively controlling the scale of capital construction; and 
second, by reducing the loss of tax revenues through 
implementation of the new taxation system. 
  In response to a reporter's question on whether the 
introduction of the tax-revenue-sharing system will affect state 
revenue, Liu Zhongli answered: Judging from developments in the 
first two months after introduction of this system, the overall 
situation is good. The state's revenue reported a relatively 
large increase over the previous year, growing 31.2 percent. 
The increase in expenditures, however, is also not small. 
Therefore, it is necessary for us to keep a sober mind. We 
should promptly take measures to solve problems cropping up 
during the course of carrying out the tax-revenue-sharing system 
to gradually perfect it. 
  In response to a reporter's question on whether 
implementation of the revenue-sharing system implies that the 
central government is withdrawing the delegated authority and 
China's policy allowing some regions to become prosperous ahead 
of others has changed, Liu Zhongli said: Revenue-sharing is a 
commonly practiced system throughout the world. The 
revenue-sharing tax system we are implementing has borrowed the 
experience of developed countries while taking into 
consideration China's national conditions. In implementing the 
system, the central government has not withdrawn the delegated 
authority. It is true that more tax revenues will be collected 
by the central government, but they will be returned to 
localities through a refund system. The refund will use 1993's 
actual revenue receipts as the base, and the refunded amount 
will be available to localities to use in prescribed ways. 
Naturally, the central government will appropriately collect 
more revenues from the increased portions of tax receipts, which 
is necessary. Besides, the central government will also return 
a fixed proportion of the increased revenues to localities. 
  In response to a reporter's question on whether the 
implementation of the revenue-sharing tax system will affect 
economic growth in coastal and other developed provinces and 
municipalities, Liu Zhongli said: Implementation of the 
revenue- sharing tax system will not and should not affect local 
economic growth. Economic growth in the first two months 
following implementation of the system has made this clear. 
Under the revenue-sharing tax system, the central and local 
governments will share added-value taxes from a growing economy. 
This benefits both the central and local governments. 
  A reporter asked: Comrades in the central and western 
regions are worried that with implementation of the 
revenue-sharing tax system, the central government will abolish 
some of the preferential policies granted to central and western 
regions; how should this question be approached? Vice Finance 
Minister Xian Huaicheng said: There is no need to worry about 
that. Implementation of the system will not change the existing 
interest distribution pattern, and the subsidies given by the 
central government to central and western regions, and poor 
provinces and autonomous regions in the past will continue. 
Some of the original preferential policies will be retained if 
they accord with regulations. Besides, a payment shift [zhuan 
yi zhi fu 6567 4448 2388 0102] system will be established 
following implementation of the revenue-sharing tax system, 
which will benefit central and western regions, and poor 
provinces and autonomous regions most. 
  Jin Xin, deputy director of the State General Administration 
of Taxation, attended the news conference.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- China's foreign 
exchange reserve has risen from 21.2 billion U.S. dollars at the 
end of last year to 27.2 billion U.S. dollars at present, 
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said here today. 
  Speaking at a press conference, Li said that China has no 
difficulty servicing its debt. 
  Liu said that China's state foreign debts amounted to 80 
billion U.S. dollars, while its annual exports come to over 100 
billion U.S. dollars. The ratio of its total debts to its 
annual export value stands at 90 percent and its debt service 
ratio, 7.6 percent. Both are much lower than international 
warning levels. China has always had a good credit rating since 
it began implementing an open policy, he said. 
  Though China will incur a domestic debt of more than 100 
billion yuan this year, Liu was optimistic about a prospective 
treasury bond issue to pay the debt. 
  He said last year's difficulty in selling treasury bonds was 
caused by a financial disorder and an irrational fund flow. 
After rectifying measures were taken, the financial order has 
turned around. 
  This year, he said, the state will offer a preferential 
interest rate on bonds and improve the methods of their issue. 
Bonds will be mainly underwritten by dealers of financial 
institutions. The state will also adopt measures to enable 
individuals to trade bonds at any time. "Therefore, the issue 
will go ahead smoothly," he said. 
  The finance minister said that China will adopt two measures 
to reduce deficits. First, it will control the scale of capital 
construction; second, the central government will increase its 
revenues through implementing a newly-introduced 
tax-revenue-sharing system. 
  However, it will be a long time before the government can 
eliminate deficit. In two or three years to come, the scale of 
domestic debts may remain relatively big, he admitted. 
  He also said that, as the bankruptcy law has come into 
force, 
banks have set aside bad-debt reserve to reduce financial 
subsidies to enterprises running at a loss. But, the state 
treasury will continue to subsidize those enterprises that 
suffer losses because of policy reasons.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Strengthen Cross-Strait Economic </F>
and Trade Exchanges, Work Together To Boost the National 
Economy"] 
  [Text] On 5 March, the Sixth Session of the Eighth NPC 
Standing Committee examined and passed the "PRC Law on the 
Protection of Investment by Taiwan Compatriots" (hereinafter the 
Protection Law). This is the first special law involving Taiwan 
formulated by the NPC. 
  In recent years, relations between the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait have been developing continuously, their economic 
and trade exchanges have been increasingly brisk, and the two 
sides have made remarkable achievements. As China continues to 
pursue the policy of reform and opening up, the huge potential 
of its economic development and the broad prospect it 
demonstrates has been drawing numerous investors from Taiwan 
like a strong magnetic field. Taiwan compatriots have kept 
investing on the mainland and their investment has increased 
speedily. At the end of 1993, there were more than 20,000 
investments made by Taiwan compatriots on the mainland with a 
total agreed investment of over $20 billion. 
  The state has always adopted a positive and encouraging 
attitude toward Taiwan investment on the mainland, and pursued a 
preferential policy to protect the legitimate rights and 
interests of Taiwan businesses investing on the mainland. In 
1988, the State Council's "Regulations on Encouraging Investment 
by Taiwan Compatriots" were promulgated. These administrative 
regulations are supported by vast numbers of Taiwan compatriots. 
Over the past few years, Taiwan- funded enterprises and Taiwan 
investment have increased speedily. The formulation and 
implementation of the Protection Law once again shows that the 
state attaches great importance to the development of 
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and demonstrates its 
sincerity in vigorously promoting them. 
  Over the years, Taiwan-funded enterprises on the mainland 
have grown from scratch and are now mature. However, anything 
has a course of continuous improvement in its development. As 
Taiwan investment on the mainland has speedily increased, some 
new circumstances have appeared and new problems have to be 
seriously studied and resolved. The Protection Law which has 
been passed was formulated after incorporating the reasonable 
opinions of Taiwan compatriots and relevant Taiwan quarters on 
the basis of fully summing up the experience since the State 
Council's "Regulations on Encouraging Investment by Taiwan 
Compatriots." The Protection Law standardizes by legal means 
the better and conscientious resolution of problems often 
encountered by Taiwan compatriots in their investment. This not 
only enhances the protection for investment by Taiwan 
compatriots and for their other legitimate rights and interests, 
but is beneficial to improving the legal environment for Taiwan 
compatriots to make investments on the mainland and will further 
strengthen the confidence of Taiwan compatriots to invest on the 
mainland. 
  In the world today, economic regionalization is speeding up 
and economic competition is becoming increasingly acute, so the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait must not neglect the necessity of 
cross- strait cooperation. Help from others is no better than 
help from oneself, and this is required for national 
self-strengthening. Economic and trade exchanges between the two 
sides of the Taiwan Strait are not only objectively necessary, 
but also have broad prospects and are very promising. The 
economies of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have their own 
characteristics and advantages and are strongly complementary. 
Strengthening cross-strait economic and trade cooperation and 
combining and supplementing each other's advantages will surely 
benefit each other and lead to common prosperity. The fact that 
Taiwan entrepreneurs come to invest on the mainland in 
accordance with the mainland's industrial policy plays a 
positive role in the mainland's reform and opening up and 
economic prosperity and also brings along Taiwan's economic 
growth and injects new vitality into Taiwan's economy. 
  There is no denying the fact that the Taiwan authorities 
still create many obstacles to economic and trade cooperation 
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, making their 
economic and trade exchanges unsmooth. We sincerely hope that 
the Taiwan authorities will base themselves on the overall 
interests of the Chinese nation, have the future in mind, have 
the 21st century in mind, be broadminded, discard prejudices, 
remove obstacles, join hands with the other side of the strait, 
and make concerted efforts to invigorate the economy of the 
Chinese nation.

<F P=106> [Report by Liu Yu-mei; from the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Chien Fu yesterday [16 March] said 
that former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has played a very 
important role in the history of development of human society in 
the 20th Century and is a cross-century historical figure. He 
is convinced that the current visit to Taiwan by Gorbachev will 
be able to promote exchanges and understanding between China 
[Republic of China] and Russia. In addition, in light of 
newspaper reports on Russia's largest opposition party hoping to 
invite President Li to visit Russia in April, Minister Chien Fu 
said yesterday that President Li could not accept the invitation 
to visit Russia due to the short notice and the stand of the 
Russian opposition party. The following is a report by Liu 
Yu-mei: 
  [Begin recording] [Liu Yu-mei] According to newspaper 
reports, Chairman Zhirinovskiy of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia, which is Russia's largest opposition party, has 
openly invited President Li to visit Russia to attend its party 
convention scheduled to begin on 2 April. Foreign Minister Qian 
Fu answered a question yesterday morning raised by a legislator 
at the Legislative Yuan on whether President Li would go to 
Russia as invited. He said he did not see any invitation 
document from Russia and only learned the information from 
newspapers. He said: However, judging from the situation, a 
head of state cannot make preparations to go abroad in just two 
weeks. We should also consider whether the Liberal Democratic 
Party, as an opposition party, can provide all facilities for a 
visit by a head of state. Therefore, President Li could not 
possibly go to Russia as invited in early April. As for 
Zhirinovskiy's revelation that the Russian Government may adjust 
its policy of selling airplanes to China [Republic of China], 
Chien Fu, in answering an interpellation by legislator (Yin 
Yao-peng), said Russia has developed a phobia of communists 
[k'ung kung cheng] and that it is also impossible for Russia to 
sell weapons to our country. 
  [Chien Fu] The Russian Government has developed a high 
degree of phobia [k'ung chu cheng] with regard to Communist 
China [chung kung]. Asking Russia to sell weapons to us at 
present is almost impossible. It is almost impossible. It 
seems to me the so-called invitation may be (?just a report) 
[words indistinct]. It is unlikely to have much positive 
(?meaning). Therefore, I do not want to spend too much [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Liu Yu-mei] As for the visit by former Soviet leader 
Gorbachev and his wife next Sunday, Chien Fu praised Gorbachev 
as a historical figure. His opening and reform policy has 
promoted the democratization of the Soviet Union. Through his 
visit to China [Republic of China] and meeting with President Li 
to exchange opinions and make contacts with various circles of 
the country, he can further understand Taiwan's experiences in 
development. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do its best 
to coordinate Gorbachev's activities during his visit. 
  This is a report by China Broadcasting Corporation reporter 
Liu Yu-mei at the Legislative Yuan. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Liu Hung-wei (0491 3163 0251): "Zhu Rongji Stresses </F>
Three-Point Principle in Financial Work"] 
  [Text] Zhu Rongji has made an important comment on 
financial issues. 
  He said that since June last year, the financial system has 
rectified the financial order, observed strict financial 
discipline, promoted financial reform, strengthened 
macroregulation and control, resolutely implemented "simple 
rules to be observed by all concerned," and swiftly changed the 
chaotic situation in the financial order. At the same time, new 
conditions and problems arising in the national economy have 
been promptly studied and analyzed, appropriately taking stock 
of macroregulation and control according to the demand of 
"blocking the evil door and opening the right door" and 
resolutely and decisively adjusting the capital flow structure. 
The rate of availability of promised capital for key state 
projects exceeded 99 percent, no IOU's were issued in purchasing 
farm products, the shortage of circulation funds for key 
production enterprises and foreign trade enterprises was 
basically alleviated, and excessively big fluctuations in the 
development of the national economy were avoided effectively. 
At the same time, the trend of excessive currency issuance was 
checked, the total volume of currency issued for the whole year 
was basically controlled within fixed macroregulation and 
control targets, the market exchange rate was stable, and the 
state's foreign exchange reserves had increased. 
  Zhu Rongji said that the State Council has decided that the 
financial work principle this year is to continue to rectify the 
financial order, steadily promote financial reform, strictly 
control the total volume of credit, and earnestly strengthen 
supervision over finance. 
  He raised three new demands for the broad masses of cadres 
and staff in the financial system. 
  First, they must strictly control the total volume and scale 
of credit this year. "The crux of controlling the total volume 
of credit is to control loans for investment in fixed assets 
released by banks at various levels. Beginning this year, the 
scale of loans for infrastructure and basic industrial projects 
are all being handed over to the newly founded State Development 
Bank to make centralized arrangements. Other banks will not be 
allowed to squeeze other investment projects. In particular, 
for projects which involve the total volume of loans being used 
as circulation funds, projects which have not received approval 
to begin construction, and projects which break up the whole 
into parts, no loans will be given, no single project will get a 
loan, and not a single yuan will be given in excess. Whoever 
uses undue means to exceed the total volume of credit will be 
held responsible." 
  Second, after business of a policy nature are separated from 
them, various specialized banks should transform themselves into 
commercial banks, and they must courageously try things out and 
take exploratory steps this year. "Taking into consideration 
that state-owned enterprises are in the process of changing 
their operational mechanisms this time, specialized banks should 
first practice management of a proportionate balance between 
assets and liabilities under a controlled amount of lending, 
gradually build self-restraint and risk-taking mechanisms, and 
be able to make their own decisions regarding operations and 
take responsibility for gains and losses. To coordinate with the 
implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, preparatory funds 
allocated for tackling outstanding amounts this year should be 
properly used." 
  Third, branches of the People's Bank of China at various 
levels must earnestly change their functions and duties and 
should play a dominant role in financial supervision in the 
localities. "Branches and offices at various levels must really 
spend most of their energy on stabilizing the currency and 
financial supervision. At present, particular attention must be 
paid to stopping the emerging tendency of random fund-raising 
activities; whenever such activities exist, they must be banned. 
Only when random loans and random fund-raising activities are 
brought under control can the scale of investment in fixed 
assets be brought under control and can inflationary pressures 
be alleviated." 
  This year will witness the increased weight of financial 
reform, and it is necessary to boldly carry out reform on the 
one hand, and, on the other hand, avoid a chaotic financial 
order like that which emerged last year; therefore, how far Zhu 
Rongji's financial work principles can be realized is a problem 
which deserves only cautious optimism.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor, and Shiny Li in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Financial troubleshooter Zhu Rongji's tough 
measures to crack down on speculative activities by China's 
state-run banks have failed. An investigation by the State 
Audit Administration reveals up to 90 per cent of bankers have 
refused to carry out the vice-premier's rectification policy to 
stop them setting up businesses. They were the major target of 
Mr Zhu's rectification policy introduced last June. 
  The report said many state-run banks and their branches were 
unwilling to separate their linkage with businesses invested and 
owned by them due to huge interests and complicated legal, 
economic and practical problems. "Banking institutions and 
their affiliated businesses are closely tied together for 
interests," a banking official said. "Firms are dependent on 
banks to supply capital and banks rely on firms for huge profits 
which are much higher than returns by banking business 
activities." 
  China's state-run banks have been widely involved in 
businesses, especially in speculation in the country's fledgling 
stock and property markets. Their activities have caused 
widespread corruption and overheating following Beijing's rush 
to embrace a capitalistic economy. Mr Zhu, also governor of the 
People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, launched the 
rectification campaign to wipe out the malpractices. 
  The State Audit Administration says branches of the People's 
Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank, Agricultural Bank 
and Construction Bank in a central China province had not cut 
links with all of the 757 bank-affiliated businesses owned by 
them. Chinese sources said the result by the investigation 
would greatly embarrass Mr Zhu who vowed to get rid of the 
practice when being appointed central bank governor last June. 
  Meanwhile, a senior banking official said Beijing would give 
more generous terms to Hong Kong and Taiwan banks than foreign 
banks in setting up business on the mainland. "Anyway, they 
(Hong Kong and Taiwan) are parts of our nation," said Dai 
Shanglong, referring to requirements for overseas banks to set 
their branches in China. 
  Chinese regulations require a foreign bank to have assets of 
above US$10 billion (HK$78 billion) to set up a representative 
office. The office should have been established three years and 
the bank have assets over US$20 billion before it can apply to 
set up a branch. Mr Dai said Beijing would ease this term for 
banks from Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, he hinted that China 
was unlikely to open its yuan business to foreign banks. 
  According to Mr Dai, China can completely open the Chinese 
yuan business to foreign bankers only when the following three 
basic requirements are met: 
  -- Specialised state-run banks should be restructured into 
real commercial banks and policy-banking activities should be 
separated from business ones in these banks to enable them to 
compete with their foreign counterparts on an equal footing; 
  -- As many banks are granting policy loans to help 
enterprises in the red to help maintain social stability, and so 
long as state-run firms are not restructured into self 
responsible businesses to enable banks to release the burden, it 
is improper for China to open its currency market to foreign 
bankers; 
  -- China should unify its corporate tax rates for all banks 
to create an equal footing for competition as Beijing now 
provides various tax rates, with 15 per cent for foreign banks 
in Special Economic Zones, 30 per cent for foreign banks in 
opening cities while charging 55 per cent for staterun banks. 
  Mr Dai said Beijing could approve some foreign banks to 
operate yuan business in some regions on a trial basis.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has succumbed to tough lobbying by the 
state sector and scaled down plans to overhaul chronically 
unprofitable government enterprises. Executive Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji has also encountered stiff resistance to his plans to 
change the ownership system of public-sector firms. 
  In speeches to delegates attending the National People's 
Congress (NPC) yesterday, Prime Minister Li Peng concentrated on 
shoring up ailing state-sector units instead of radical surgery, 
such as transforming them into quasi-private shareholding 
concerns. And despite the Government's just-announced measures 
to fight inflation by controlling money supply, the People's 
Bank of China yesterday announced new loans to bolster the 
depressed coal, metal and electricity industries. 
  While addressing NPC members from northeastern Jilin 
province 
yesterday, Mr Li hinted more government funds should be 
earmarked to prop up state companies. "The Government must 
ensure a beneficial external environment for enterprises and 
help them transform their management mechanism," XINHUA (the NEW 
CHINA NEWS AGENCY) last night quoted Mr Li as saying. The 
premier urged various levels of government to help boost the 
competitiveness of large and medium sized state enterprises. 
Chinese economists said Mr Li was in effect asking that more 
investment be pumped into the chronically inefficient state 
sector. 
  Vice-Premier Mr Zhu also recommended prudence in "pushing 
(state) enterprises towards the marketplace". While talking to 
deputies from Hunan province yesterday, Mr Zhu expressed more 
determination that Mr Li over restructuring the state sector. 
[sentence as published] "Do not link the existing difficulties 
of state-owned enterprises with the reforms of today," Mr Zhu 
said. He admitted, however that it would be unrealistic to 
expect the problem of public-sector inefficiency to be solved 
soon. "Of course, the central authorities will still adopt 
practical measures to solve the question of the historical 
burden of the state sector," Mr Zhu said, hinting that Beijing 
was not about to cut its grants to public- sector companies, 
which will come up to 16.63 billion yuan (HK$14.77 billion) this 
year. 
  In an earlier talk to Hunan delegates, Mr Zhu also indicated 
large-scale bankruptcies for government-run business units, 
which had been advocated by liberal economists, were not a 
practical solution. The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO 
yesterday quoted Mr Zhu as saying "we don't have a mechanism for 
bankruptcies at this stage". Mr Zhu said each county should not 
have more than one bankruptcy because "bankruptcies do not mean 
we can stop taking care of the (laid-off) workers". 
  But the Vice-Premier stressed that Beijing must push ahead 
with experiments in "changing the ownership system of government 
enterprises", a euphemism for quasi-privatisation. Chinese 
sources said yesterday central planners including conservative 
elder Chen Yun had recently insisted that public-sector firms 
remain the mainstay of the economy lest the socialist nature of 
China be adulterated.

<F P=106> [By Timothy Charlton] </F>
  [Text] China's recently introduced value-added tax (VAT) 
is causing headaches for new foreign ventures with some 
rethinking investment entirely. One American manufacturer said 
he was not sure if his joint venture would survive the switch to 
a value-added tax. He believed the transition phase might cause 
a working capital crisis that could lead the parent company to 
decide the cash demands of the China subsidiary were too great. 
  Under the old system, imported capital goods and raw 
materials attracted a five per cent tax. This has risen to 17 
per cent under the VAT regime, which was introduced on January 
1. In theory, companies are able to reclaim the tax after the 
raw materials have been turned into goods and sold effectively 
passing on the tax to the consumer. However, there are still 
grey areas concerning the tax refund, according to KPMG Peat 
Marwick tax manager Ayesha MacPherson. "The Government was very 
quick to pass and implement the law but very slow to clear up 
areas like how to claim a rebate," she said. As a result, 
companies are left in a position where it is impossible to make 
accurate cash-flow projections because there is no way of 
knowing when the rebate will be paid. "The mainland authorities 
have said that a refund will be made, but they have not given 
any details," Ms MacPherson said. 
  Another grey area is how the transition from the old tax 
system to the new is handled. Ms MacPherson said there was 
confusion for companies which had paid tax on their raw 
materials under the old system but would sell the finished goods 
under the new tax regime. Price Waterhouse senior tax manager 
Peter Kung said: "Potentially VAT is recoverable, but to some 
foreign businesses just starting in China, the effects can be 
quite serious. "They will need a few months to set up and start 
production, so it may take several months before they can 
recover the tax."

  [Text] China is resuming Stalinist planning economics by 
stockpiling staple foods. The move is prompted by price rises 
in major cities in December and panic buying in recent years 
after sweeping market-driven reforms. It also underscores 
serious concern by the leadership over increasing inflation and 
other potential social instabilities, Beijing analysts and 
diplomats say. 
  The decision, mapped out by Ministry of Internal Trade and 
endorsed by the State Council China's cabinet, orders localities 
to revive a Mao-era practice of storing basic goods and 
necessities. "Storage of important commodities is the basis for 
the government to guarantee supply to meet the needs of basic 
life of the people, to combat inflation and deal with natural 
disasters and other unexpected events," Chinese sources quote a 
government circular as saying. 
  The central government is asking localities, especially 
large 
and medium-sized cities, to have a certain quantity of 
commodities such as grain, pork, sugar and edible oil in 
storage. Consumer products are also listed but the central 
government notes that emphasis should be laid on necessities and 
commodities sensitive to markets. Beijing also requires 
localities to set up risk funds to enable the government to 
maintain stockpiles. 
  The practice was popular under socialist planning economy 
throughout Mao's period, by which the government controlled all 
market supplies under a rationing system. However, the system 
has abated since the late 1970s when paramount leader Deng 
Xiaoping launched market oriented economic reforms and openness 
policies. 
  Nevertheless, the government has kept grain stores-the 
rationing system for this staple food was only recently 
abolished. The circular says the storage system should only be 
conducted by government departments through state-run commercial 
enterprises. The cost should be met by the state and enterprises 
will not be liable.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Xie Mi: "Laidoff To Benefit From Plan"] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Labour plans to start a 
re-employment programme for those who have been out of work for 
more than six months. It should help get people off the welfare 
rolls and relieve the State's financial burden of taking care of 
them. 
  Last year, 900,000 workers were laid off, mostly from firms 
that restructured or went bankrupt. The figure for 1992 was 
350,000. The dramatic rise is partly attributed to enterprise 
reform. 
  More unemployed people means that workers have had to work 
harder -- and wait longer -- to find a new job, said Zhang Xin 
of the ministry's employment department. 
  He said that before 1992 most people would find work within 
five months. Now the wait often exceeds six months, costing the 
government dearly in unemployment pay. 
  Statistics indicate that in the first half of last year the 
nation's jobless received 108 million yuan ($12.4 million) in 
unemployment insurance benefits, compared with 130 million yuan 
($14.9 million) between 1987 and 1992. 
  But the country's unemployment insurance fund -- supported 
by 
government appropriations and corporate contributions -- is 
limited. Last year it was about 3 billion yuan ($345 million). 
  Unemployed workers get 75 yuan ($8.5) per month. Those with 
less than one year's working experience are not eligible for 
unemployment benefits; those who have worked one to five years 
get benefits for 12 months; and those with more than five years 
get benefits for up to 24 months. 
  According to the ministry's programme, people out of work 
for 
more than six months have to attend a monthly conference 
sponsored by local labour service departments. 
  If they fail to attend, their welfare benefits will be cut 
off. 
  At the meetings, officials will issue labour market 
information. provide job-hunting tips and offer re-employment 
training services. 
  They also issue recommendation letters to enterprises 
indicating the kind of training the workers received. 
  For those who have been unemployed for more than a year, 
authorities will organize meetings between enterprises and the 
jobless. 
  Companies that hire the unemployed workers will get 
unemployment insurance from labour departments to cover part of 
the worker's salary. Enterprises can also employ people on a 
three-month trial basis. 
  Efforts are underway to expand unemployment insurance to all 
city employees, but at present only unemployed workers dismissed 
by firms that have gone bankrupt or have merged are eligible for 
unemployment insurance. 
  If workers attend the re-employment programmes and still 
fail 
to find jobs, they get insurance for another three months. 
  Workers can get preferential policies when paying taxes and 
applying for bank loans if they decide to find jobs by 
themselves. 
  "This programme is also an effort to transform the 
government's functions," Zhang said. "In the past, laid off 
people were usually assigned by labour departments to other 
units. But now we do not enjoy the same administrative power so 
we are providing re- employment services." 
  The programme is expected to begin on a trial basis next 
month in Liaoning, Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hebei, 
Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces as well as in 
Shanghai. 
  If it is successful, it will likely be promoted nationwide 
in 
1995.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Trade unions in 
foreign-funded enterprises in China are receiving growing 
attention from the Chinese Government, according to a national 
working conference on the work of trade unions in foreign-funded 
enterprises held today in north China's Tianjin. 
  A number of laws and regulations have been stipulated in 
China since 1993 and the number of trade unions in 
foreign-funded enterprises have grown a lot, participants said. 
  Trade unions have now been set up in 45 percent of the 
foreign- funded enterprises where they should be organized 
according to China's laws or regulations. In economic 
development zones, where foreign-funded enterprises are given 
some preferable policies, 60 percent of the foreign-funded 
enterprises have trade unions. 
  Trade unions mediate labor disputes and give Chinese workers 
legal knowledge and technical training. 
  Trade unions not only stimulate the production enthusiasm of 
workers and reduce labor friction but also help maintain normal 
operations of overseas investors' businesses, Yang Xingfu, vice 
chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said at the 
conference. 
  Trade unions should cooperate with foreign investors for 
better development of the enterprises while protecting workers' 
rights and interests, he said. 
  Trade union leaders from Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, 
Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian, Liaoning and some development zones 
attended the meeting.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Health-Care Plan To Cut </F>
Death Rates"] 
  [Text] The Public Health Ministry yesterday unveiled a 
$200 million health project that aims to drastically reduce the 
death rates of pregnant women and little children in 
poverty-stricken counties. 
  The programme demands that by the year 2000 the mortality 
rate of pregnant women in these counties be cut by 50 percent 
while deaths of children under 5 years old be reduced by 
one-third. 
  The World Bank will loan China $100 million over the next 
six 
years for the project. 
  And governments at all levels will match the WB loan in 
their 
budgets to jump start the joint health project, said Liu 
Peilong, Director of the Foreign Loan Office of the Public 
Health Ministry. 
  The project is scheduled to begin this summer. It targets 
reducing death rates of mothers and children by expanding and 
improving primary health care services in the remote and poor 
districts. 
  The $100 million loan and local matching fund will be used 
to 
build and improve the village and county health care centres as 
well as anti-epidemic institutes. 
  Grass-roots medical workers will be trained in the latest 
methods of treating diseases and preventive health care. 
  The World Bank and the ministry last week concluded the 
first- phase pre-evaluation on the project counties. 
  Liu said around 300 counties with a population of nearly 1OO 
million were selected for the project. 
  The counties were chosen from Yunnan, Sichuan, Qinghai, 
Gansu 
Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Guangxi and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  The Chinese and foreign specialists studied project plans by 
examining current health situations in the counties. 
  The ministry, with help of some international health 
organizations and foreign specialists, is compiling teaching 
materials to train the local medical workers. 
  Ministry statistics show that in the poor and remote 
counties, the death rate for children is more than 60 per 1,000. 
And the maternal mortality rate is more than 200 per 100,000, 
yet in some places it can be as high as 1,000 in every 100,000. 
  The main cause of maternity fatalities is post-delivery 
bleeding, accounting for about half of the deaths . 
  Malnutrition is one of the major causes of the high 
mortality 
rate of children in the poor counties.

<F P=106> [From the "Earnestly Studying Volume 3 of the Selected </F>
Works of Deng Xiaoping column"; article by Xie Shijie, 
secretary of the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee: "Promote 
Development Through Opening Up"] 
  [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed: "Development is 
the last word," "poverty does not mean socialism, nor does slow 
development." For a large developing country like ours, only by 
paying close attention to the central task of economic 
construction and vigorously developing the productive forces can 
we constantly improve our comprehensive national strength and 
enhance the people's standard of living. 
  The domestic conditions are very good at the moment. The 
international environment is favorable, and Sichuan is also 
equipped with the conditions for more rapid development. We 
should bring into full play the initiative of cadres and masses, 
seize the opportunity, deepen reform, and widen the scope of 
opening up, so that our province will have sustained, rapid, and 
healthy [chi xu gao su jian kang 2170 4958 7559 6643 0256 1660] 
economic development and scale a new height every several years. 
  In the last 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, Sichuan Province has registered a comparatively 
good trend of development in its economy. In 1993, in 
particular, encouraged by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour 
talks and the instructions of 14th CPC National Congress, our 
province made encouraging achievements in economic development. 
The province's gross domestic product increased by 12.8 
percent, the gross industrial output value at the township level 
and above increased by 20.9 percent, and there was a good 
agricultural harvest despite natural disasters, the increase in 
the gross output value being 1.5 percent over the previous year. 
  We should soberly understand, however, that there is still a 
large gap between our province and the developed coastal 
provinces and cities, and that some total economic indices are 
even lower than the country's average. Therefore the cadres and 
masses in Sichuan have a strong desire for accelerating the 
province's economic development. Their common understanding is: 
If Sichuan does not seize the last several years in the 1990's 
to speed up its economic development, the gap between the 
province and the developed fraternal provinces and cities will 
become wider and Sichuan will make a historic mistake. 
  Being aware of an opportunity is good, but a more 
important point is to seize and use that opportunity to 
formulate an economic development strategy with a scientific 
attitude in light of the new situation and to take practical 
measures to implement it on schedule. 
  The year 1994 is a crucial one for China to establish the 
socialist market economy structure and is also an important year 
for Sichuan to fulfill the second-step strategic target three 
years ahead of schedule. We will comprehensively put into 
effect the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee; 
continue to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development; and strive to increase the province's GNP by 9.6 
percent on the basis of achievements in 1993. We will increase 
gross industrial and agricultural output value by 12.8 percent, 
industrial output value by 15.6 percent, and agricultural output 
value by 4 percent. Though this development task is arduous, it 
corresponds with the province's actual conditions, and we have 
full confidence in fulfilling it. 
  According to the dialectical materialist concept of 
development, internal factors are the basis for the development 
of things. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out repeatedly: 
Things in China "must be fulfilled by relying on the efforts 
the Chinese themselves," and "independence and self-reliance 
were, are, and will be our standpoints." He stressed: "For a 
large country like China, it cannot but rely on its own efforts 
in construction. It must mainly rely on its own efforts; this 
is called self-reliance." Sichuan is a large province, covering 
an area of 570,000 square km, with a population of more than 100 
million. In developing its economy, it must, as Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping said, "rely mainly on its own efforts." Sichuan is 
already equipped with some basic conditions for more rapid 
economic development: It has huge markets -- high-potential 
rural markets, in particular; it has tens of thousands of 
hard-working and capable workers; it has a large number of 
scientific research units and scientific-technological 
personnel; it has rich natural resources; it has a large number 
and a certain scale of large and medium-sized state enterprises, 
as well as town and township enterprises; it has a corresponding 
scale of basic facilities and is carrying out a number of 
traffic, telecommunications, and energy projects; its productive 
forces have greatly developed after some 10 years of reform and 
opening up; and the province now is experiencing political 
stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. Taking 
the country as a whole, the decision of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has provided us with 
the basic framework for establishing the socialist market 
economy structure; the party Central Committee and the State 
Council have put the development of the western region and the 
exploitation of its resources at the top of the agenda and have 
instructed Sichuan to develop more rapidly and to actively 
explore ways of reform and opening up in the western region. 
All these serve as very favorable conditions for our sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development. 
  The dialectical materialist concept of development suggests 
that the internal factors of things are the basis of their 
development, but no one thing is isolated from another. 
External factors are the necessary conditions for the existence 
and development of things. Their impact on the development of 
things varies with specific conditions, and some external 
factors even play an important role. Comrade Mao Zedong vividly 
described such internal factors as "temperatures." Without the 
proper temperature, eggs cannot develop into chickens. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed not only the importance of 
"relying mainly on one's own efforts" in development, but also 
the important role of external conditions. He has dialectically 
integrated these two. He pointed out: "An important reason 
China remained for so long in stagnation and backwardness was 
that it closed itself to the outside world. Experience has 
proved that carrying out economic construction behind closed 
doors cannot succeed. China's development cannot be separated 
from that of the world." He also stressed: "Without opening 
up, there can be no development," and "we should be bolder in 
reform and opening up" and "should carry out a large-scale 
opening up." 
  Taking the world as a whole, none of the countries and 
regions with economic achievements have failed to pay close 
attention to utilizing external conditions. Reviewing China as 
a whole, rapid economic development in Guangdong's Shenzhen, 
Shanghai's Pudong, and Shandong's Yantai has proved the 
correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. 
  In 1993, in accordance with the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour 
talks, we organized people to actively explore new ways to widen 
the scope of opening up, and we achieved some new progress. 
Through various channels and tiers, we carried out investment 
and capital orientation activities, and successfully held 
business talks in Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand, and the ROK on 
investment and capital orientation. We held "Sichuan Festivals" 
in Moscow and Sofia to advertise Sichuan's achievements in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, and to explore 
the prospects for economic and technological cooperation. Last 
year, agreements throughout the province on introducing foreign 
capital amounted to more than $2 billion and newly established 
foreign-invested enterprises totaled more than 1,900. Some 
large international financial groups began to take an optimistic 
view of Sichuan and expressed a very deep interest in some of 
its important infrastructural projects, such as energy and 
communications, and in exploiting its superior resources. Both 
sides are negotiating on some major projects. Apart from this, 
the province also made new headway in exploring export markets, 
contracting for international projects, labor service 
cooperation, establishing enterprises outside the borders, and 
tourism. 
  Although Sichuan is equipped with the internal factors for 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and has 
explored some new ways, done some work, and made some progress 
in understanding and utilizing external conditions, there are 
still some restrictive factors, such as fund shortages and 
backwardness in infrastructural construction. Whereas 
accelerating infrastructural construction requires a large 
amount of capital injection. We must seek a new idea to resolve 
problems in Sichuan's economic development. In this way, we 
will fulfill the target of the province's development strategy. 
  In accordance with the principle of integrating theory with 
practice, in the fourth quarter of 1993 we repeatedly and 
seriously studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping on seizing the opportunity, speeding up 
development, and scaling a new height in the national economy 
every several years; on China's development being inseparable 
from that of the world, and opposing seclusion and isolation; 
and on using the criteria of "three favorable's" in our 
judgment, in light of the difficulties and key issues in our 
province's economic development, thus further improving our 
understanding of the importance of widening the scope of opening 
up. 
  Sichuan is a large hinterland province with comparatively 
backward economic development. Although we have done a certain 
amount in opening up to the outside world, on the whole the 
impetus of opening up is not strong enough. Export volume, 
particularly foreign exchange earned through exports, does not 
match the scope of the province's economic development, and 
foreign investments and "three-capital" enterprises still lack 
high-tech projects. What needs to be pointed out in particular 
is that the country's opening up to the outside world is 
developing more profoundly and in a broader field, but some 
comrades still have obstacles in their minds which affect the 
widening of the scope of opening up and they have not regarded 
widening the scope of opening up as a strategic task in 
invigorating Sichuan's economy. We feel deeply that 
widening the scope of opening up has become a key point in 
accelerating Sichuan's economic development. Sichuan's future 
development rate and progress depend, to a certain degree, on 
the progress and achievements in its opening up to the outside 
world. Only large-scale opening up will bring about large-scale 
development. Therefore, in planning Sichuan's economic work 
for this year, we have placed widening the scope of opening up 
and improving the actual results of opening up at the top of our 
list of six key tasks. 
  Opening up to the outside world is also an inherent 
requirement of the socialist market economy structure. The 
market economy is, in itself, an open economy. Opening up to 
the outside world will help widen the room for resource 
distribution. Some countries and regions in the world are not 
very rich in resources and their ability to accumulate capital 
is not strong, either. However, they can seize the opportunity 
of economic and capital internationalization to distribute their 
resources around the world, creating rapid economic growth 
rates. Looking at Sichuan, it is comparatively rich in some 
resources, but these need exploitation and a way out. Sichuan 
is short of resources in some aspects and needs to introduce 
some from abroad. Thus, it is necessary for Sichuan to open up 
to the outside world so as to absorb others' strong points to 
make up for its weakness and to accelerate its economic 
development. 
  Widening the scope of opening up is an effective way 
to resolve the province's shortage of funds. Rapid 
economic development is inseparable from a huge amount of 
capital investment. This is a very simple theory. Sichuan is 
weak in capital accumulation and it has long been faced with a 
shortage of funds. China is a socialist country. We can neither 
plunder nor loot to accumulate capital. If we carry out 
development by means of slow accumulation, this could cause a 
long delay and make us miss the opportunity, thus widening the 
gap between Sichuan and other provinces. Widening the scope of 
opening up will enable us to absorb and utilize foreign capital 
to make up for our shortcomings. This is a common practice in 
some newly emerging industrialized countries and regions during 
their development period, and there are exploitable funds in 
some countries and regions in the present-day world. We can 
borrow others' money for our use, particularly for the 
construction of basic industries and basic facilities. We 
should be bold in this matter. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: 
"Basic industries are, simply speaking, the raw materials 
industry, communications, energy, and so on; investments in 
these fields should be strengthened and this should be carried 
out for 10 or 20 years. This should be strengthened, even if we 
become indebted. This is also a kind of opening up. In this 
respect, we should be bolder and there will not be major faults." 
  Widening the scope of opening up is also an important 
method for promoting scientific, technological, and social 
development. Over the last decades, modern science and 
technology have brought about new leaps in almost all fields, 
rather than in just some individual fields or production skills, 
nor have they given rise to progress or reform in only general 
terms; they have and are producing a number of newly emerging 
scientific and technological projects. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
pointed out: "There is a wide gap between our science and 
technology and the advanced world level; our scientific and 
technological strength is still weak and far from being able to 
meet the needs of modernization." Therefore, we should continue 
to widen the scope of opening up, absorb a large amount of 
advanced technology, introduce talented people, and carry out 
exchanges of scientific and technological achievements according 
to our needs. In the meantime, we also should introduce advanced 
managerial experience to promote our scientific and 
technological progress. 
  Widening the scope of opening up will bring about rapid 
economic development, which is the basic guarantee for social 
stability. In this sense, widening the scope of opening up is, 
in itself, fundamentally promoting social stability. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping profoundly pointed out: "If we do not 
carry out modernization, our scientific and technological level 
is not boosted, the social productive forces are not developed, 
the country's actual strength is not increased, and the people's 
material and cultural life does not improve, then our socialist 
political and economic system cannot be consolidated and our 
national security will not have a reliable guarantee." Sichuan 
is a large province, with a population of more than 100 million. 
Its situation is complicated, its economy is comparatively 
undeveloped, and its people's material and cultural life needs 
further improvement and enhancement. To preserve social 
stability -- apart from distinguishing between two different 
kinds of contradictions and handling them correctly, stabilizing 
the overall situation, and properly handling relations in all 
fields -- there is also a need to firmly widen the scope of 
opening up, accelerate economic development, improve the 
comprehensive strength, and enhance the people's material and 
cultural life. In this way, the people will love and support 
the socialist system more, and our society will become more 
stabilized and developed. 
  Widening the scope of opening up does not in the least 
mean neglecting agriculture or the peasants. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out: "Eighty percent of the Chinese population 
are in the rural areas; whether or not China is stable depends 
on whether or this 80 percent is stable. Cities, no matter how 
beautifully they are built, will not stand without the rural 
areas, which serve as a stable basis." Therefore, keeping 
in mind the objectives of "stabilizing grain production, 
increasing income, and moving toward moderate prosperity," we 
will continue to take positive measures to speed up agricultural 
and rural economic development so that the peasants will 
increase their income and become better off. In accordance 
with the requirement of establishing the socialist market 
economy structure, we will continue to deepen reform, transform 
enterprises' operational mechanism, form a modernized enterprise 
system, and improve large and medium-sized state enterprises. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently pointed out: "Seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, widening the scope of opening 
up, promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhua zhu 
ji yu shen hua gai ge kuo da kai fang cu jin fa zhan bao chi wen 
ding 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 
0191 6651 4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353] are major aspects of 
the work of the entire party." Jobs in all fields must be 
subordinated to these major aspects, and Sichuan must make its 
contributions in this respect. Proceeding from Sichuan's actual 
conditions, we should make bold experiments and endeavors; 
promote development through opening up; and under the leadership 
of the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core, work harder for the achievement of sustained, rapid, and 
healthy national economic development and overall social 
progress in Sichuan.

<F P=106> [Report: "China Announces That Its Aviation Market Will Be </F>
Opened to Foreign Investors"] 
  [Text] Beginning in 1994, foreign investors will be 
allowed to invest in China's commercial airports and get 
involved in all aspects of the air transportation industry 
except for air traffic control. 
  This was recently announced by Lin Kun, a department 
director 
of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, who is responsible for foreign investment in China. 
  Reportedly in order to more rapidly boost the construction 
of 
transport facilities in all fields, China will adopt various 
forms to encourage and attract foreign investment. China will 
open its aviation market to foreign investors, and this is one 
of the major actions to be taken. In fact, China's transport 
industry, especially the air transport industry, is far from 
being able to meet the needs of its economic development. Such 
problems as insufficient transport capacity, backward 
technology, poor management, a lack of competent personnel, and 
the low safety coefficient have become increasingly serious and 
have caused serious concern among people at home and abroad. 
  People in this industry pointed out that if China's air 
transport industry is opened up to the world and introduces 
advanced world equipment, management methods, and technology, 
this will play a certain role in resolving the above-mentioned 
problems and will help change the current backward condition of 
the air transport industry and promote its healthy development. 
  Foreign investors have strong interest in the Chinese 
mainland's huge air transport market, which has great 
development potential. Aircraft maintenance and repair is a 
major field of such investment. At present, China Southern 
Airline, Rockefeller International Airplane Service Corporation 
of the United States, and Hutchison Whampoa (China) of Hong Kong 
have set up a joint venture in Guangzhou to offer aircraft 
repair services. 
  In addition, Hong Kong Air Terminal Service Ltd. and Xiaman 
International Economic and Technological Cooperation Corporation 
have also signed an agreement to set up an aircraft maintenance 
joint venture in Xiamen. Other Hong Kong companies 
participating in the joint venture include the New World Group, 
Kumagai (Hong Kong) Ltd., the Fok family, and Macao's Hainan 
Tongao Economic Development and Investment Ltd. 
  Regulations on the operation of travel agents for 
border-crossing air tickets were formulated before Director Lin 
Kun announced the opening of China's aviation market. Travel 
agents allowed to sell air tickets into China should have at 
least 500,000 yuan of registered capital; and those being 
allowed to sell air tickets out of China should have at least 
1.5 million yuan of capital. They must have registered offices 
inside China, and their personnel should have work experience in 
the field of air transportation. After their applications are 
approved, their business licenses will be valid for three years.

  [Text] Yinchuan, March 14 (XINHUA) -- A massive 
afforestation campaign in north, northwest and northeast China 
(the "three-north" region) has stifled the encroachment of 
deserts in the region and helped form an economic belt there, 
official sources said. 
  Rows of desert-defying forest greenbelts, orchards, newly 
developed farmland and tourist attractions with a taste of the 
wild desert have diminished the ferocity of the desert that once 
dominated the region. 
  Many of the country's desert areas are scattered over more 
than 260 counties in 13 provinces, municipalities and autonomous 
regions in the "three-north" region, which has plus-1.9 billion 
mu (about 12.7 million ha [hectare]) of desert and desertified 
land. 
  The lingering desert problem, compounded by the arid 
climate, 
frequent wind storms and a vicious cycle of escalating wind and 
desert, has harmed farmland, devoured pastureland, buried 
houses, disrupted transportation and overall severely affected 
the lives and production of some 35 million local people. 
  Since a comprehensive "three-north" afforestation campaign 
was launched 15 years ago, more than 70 million mu (4.67 million 
ha) of desert land has been planted with various species of 
trees, in addition to afforestation of 56 million mu (3.73 
million ha) of enclosed desert land and aerial seeding of some 
7.5 million mu (500,000 ha) of land. 
  The figures have combined to help raise the region's total 
area with tree cover to over 200 million mu (13.3 million ha). 
  So far some 12 percent of the "three-north" desertified land 
has been improved and around 20 million mu (1.33 million ha) of 
farmland has been developed in the former deserts. 
  In the region's 164 million mu (around 11 million ha) of 
farmland whose yields were perenially poor and unstable because 
of storms and the advance of the desert, grain output has been 
hiked by 10 to 30 percent. 
  And grass output in the 134 million mu (8.93 million ha) of 
pastoral land threatened by desertification and salinization has 
increased by more than 20 percent. 
  The green drive has meanwhile spurred the local forestry and 
fruit tree planting industries. The region's commercial 
orchards now produce more than six billion kg of fresh and dried 
fruits annually, bringing in an additional six billion yuan 
(about 690 million U.S. dollars) in output value. 
  In Inner Mongolia's Chifeng city and Jirem League, both open 
to the unbridled assault of desert storms in the past, a 
seven-million-mu-sized production base for mountain almonds has 
been established, yielding six million kg of such almonds a 
year. The output of apples and pears in the specialized 
production base in Bayannur League is 10 million kg annually, 
and the Wuhai Grape Production Center produces five million kg a 
year. 
  North China's Shaanxi Province has set up a six-million-mu 
willow production and processing zone, which annually earns more 
than 20 million yuan (2.3 million U.S. dollars) in profits and 
2.8 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. 
  Officials said that the planting of commercial forests has 
become one of the mainstay industries in the local economy. 
  They said that the forest belts, reservoirs and newly-built 
houses on the most extreme frontiers of deserts have marked the 
turning point of man's fight against deserts. 
  In Yulin of Shaanxi Province, four desert forest belts add 
up 
to 1,500 km in length, covering an area of 1.8 million mu 
(120,000 ha). The belts have effectively halted desert 
expansion, officials said. 
  Neighboring Gansu Province has so far improved and 
afforested 
some five million mu (333,000 ha) of desertified land as well as 
protected 4.7 million mu (310,000 ha) of farmland and orchards 
from the intrusion of desert and 1,400 villages from being 
swallowed up by drifting sands. The arid area has now emerged 
as a major grain producer in north China. 
  Northeast China's Jilin Province has planted eight million 
mu 
(530,000 ha) of trees and claimed a total of four million mu 
(367,000 ha) of farmland from the desert. The province has 
virtually controlled the spreading of deserts, officials said. 
  North China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has considered 
the exploration of desertified land and sand mountains as a 
major source to increase farmers' income. 
  The successful experiences of the "three-north" region of 
China in containing desert expansion and improving desertified 
land has caught attention worldwide. Officials and experts from 
more than 40 countries, regions and the United Nations have 
inspected the afforestation project in China's "three-north" 
region.

"Chinese Peasants Go Abroad To Earn a Living"] 
  [Text] The reform carried out in mainland China recently, 
with the establishment of market mechanism as its orientation, 
is changing the peasants' traditional idea of "clinging to the 
land." Lots of peasants no longer consider "leaving their own 
native place" to make a living as a big deal. They flock into 
towns and cities to do business or work, picking up jobs no 
matter whether they are full-time or not. They also go outside 
their counties or provinces. Some even venture into the 
international business or labor markets to make a living. 
  Since mainland China began its reform and opening to the 
world, the bondage of registered permanent residence has been 
loosened. Big, lateral economic asociations formed by various 
provincial and regional enterprises have broken through regional 
obstacles and separation. This change also provides objective 
conditions for peasants to do business or engage in industry. 
The contingent of "engaging in industry and doing business" 
organized by peasants has set their footprints all over the 
country. Some people go to Taiwan. Still more dare to leave 
the country to travel far away across the sea to do business and 
engage in industry, giving full play to their talents and 
abilities in more than 20 countries and regions. 
  The transnational labor markets which mainland peasants 
enter 
are chiefly located in China's neighboring countries and areas. 
According to statistics from the mainland department concerned, 
in the China's coastal provinces alone tens of thousands of 
peasants have been engaged in transnational businesses and 
employment. Of these, the peasant supply and marketing teams 
from Gutian, Fujian Province, have traveled north and south, 
leaving their footprints in Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Burmese 
border areas in the south as well as the Sino-Russian and 
Sino-North Korean border areas in the north. They have succeeded 
in opening up foreign markets for Gutian's mushrooms. The 
peasants from Jinjiang and Shishi sell Russia a large amount of 
Western-style suits and jeans produced in their hometowns. The 
polyester fiber goods made in Changle have entered the markets 
of countries such as Laos, Vietnam, and Burma. The peasants 
from Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, sell several hundred thousand 
pieces of children's clothing and dresses to Russia annually and 
a large amount of piece goods to Vietnam and Burma. Several 
hundred peasants from Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, have been 
shuttling between trade fairs in Guangxi and Vietnam, in Yunnan 
and Thailand, and between Yunnan and Burma purchasing the local 
Chinese herbal medicines and selling them to Taiwan, Japan, 
Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philipines after processing. A few 
hundred peasants from the Daba Shan area in Sichuan Province 
have set up several enterprises in Burma. 
  The official government planned labor exports in recent 
years 
have also changed the fate of millions of peasants in mainland 
China. In Lu County, Sichuan Province, known as the "home of 
builders," there is a peasant construction team composed of more 
than 100 good technicians. This team has excelled itself by 
undertaking nearly 1000 projects in the Middle East, Africa, 
etc. After inspection, all the projects they undertook were up 
to standard. In 1992 alone, the production value stood at 
nearly 200 million yuan. In Sichuan Province alone, there are 
already more than a dozen counties which have realized their 
goal of earning over 100 million yuan through labor export. 
Thousands of peasants from Qidong and Haian in Jiangsu Province 
are now actively engaged in a dozen trades such as building 
construction, cooking, nursing, textile garments, chemical 
industry, decorating, machine repair, and ocean fishery. Of 
these, the peasants in Qidong concluded labor export contracts 
worth over $11 million last year. In Heilongjiang Province, 
each year there are over 10,000 peasants who display their 
skills to the full in agricultural planting and construction 
work in the CIS. 
  The peasants in mainland China leave their small peasant 
courtyards and play an active role in the domestic and 
international markets. No matter whether they are engaged in 
international trade or paid employment, all these engagements 
enable them to increase their income and quicken their steps 
toward the goal of becoming well-to-do. Labor export has become 
an important economic development measure, especially for those 
townships and towns which get involved in official government 
labor exports because it needs less investment but can achieve 
quick results. It can not only find placements for the local 
surplus labor force but also bring back capital, techniques, and 
information from outside to help develop the local economy and 
promote the peasants' sense of commodities.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- China's railway 
departments have withstood a severe test in the past month since 
the spring festival, the biggest Chinese traditional festival, 
that fell on February 10 this year. 
  During this period tens of millions of migrant rural 
laborers 
from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Henan, Hubei and other relatively 
poor provinces and autonomous regions in the central and western 
parts of China travelled by train to the more developed eastern 
and coastal areas, hoping to find employment there. 
  The interflow of rural laborers brought about heavy pressure 
on the railways. On February 16 the Zhengzhou railway station, 
the country's largest railway transit station, handled 140,000 
passengers, but there were still more than 20,000 passengers 
stranded there on that day. Some rural laborers had to line up 
for several days and nights for tickets. 
  Guangdong Province in south China, which was the first part 
of China to open to the outside world and is now one of the 
country's most economically developed areas, absorbs about ten 
million or nearly half of the country's total floating rural 
laborers from all parts of the country. Statistics show that 
the migrant population accounts for over 70 percent of the total 
population in some cities and towns in Guangdong. 
  Cai Shengli, 20, a rural laborer from central China's Henan 
Province, told a XINHUA reporter at the railway station that he 
was working in an arts and crafts factory in Xinhui county, 
Guangdong. Among the 700 workers and staff members in the 
factory over 500 are from other provinces and autonomous regions. 
  Experts note that these migrant rural laborers have 
contributed greatly to the province's rapid economic growth, 
which has stood at 13 percent a year for 15 years in a row. 
Liang Guiqun, director of the institute of development under 
the Guangzhou City Academy of Social Sciences, explained that 
the large numbers of migrant rural laborers have enabled the 
rapid development of labor-intensive industries in Guangdong, 
especially the Pearl River Delta. Besides, they have boosted 
the internal market and made the economy of the area prosperous. 
  Sociologists point out that the migrants, mostly from 
backward inland areas, help promote economic development in 
their home regions by making remittances to their families and 
taking new and scientific ideas on economic development back 
home. 
  Cai Shengli, a graduate of junior middle school, told XINHUA 
that he is planning to work in Guangdong for two more years to 
save enough money to study the techniques of processing farm 
products and then return to his home village to set up an 
enterprise. 
  Of course, the sociologists admit, the interflow of rural 
laborers has also brought about many social problems. Besides 
the heavy pressure on transportation, the floating population 
increases difficulties in handling of law and order, and 
environmental hygiene and puts a great strain on urban 
facilities. 
  In order to bring the interflow of rural laborers under 
control, the Chinese central government and some local 
governments have taken various measures, which include the 
setting up of registration centers in both the areas exporting 
rural laborers and the areas absorbing them, and establishing 
job-introduction centers. 
  However, some experts point out, the key to the solution of 
the problem of the nationwide interflow of rural laborers lies 
in reducing the differences in economic development between town 
and country and between the coastal and the inland areas. They 
predict that it will take up to ten years for this to happen.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (AFP)--Dissident Shao Jiang has 
sent an open letter to Chinese leaders calling for political 
detainees' release, press freedom and respect for citizens' 
rights. A copy of the letter dated March 12 was received by the 
foreign press in Beijing Tuesday [15 March]. Shao, who became 
famous during the 1989 student demonstrations in Beijing, sent 
the letter to Deng Xiaoping, President Jiang Zemin, Prime 
Minister Li Peng and delegates meeting at the National Peoples' 
Congress in the capital. 
  Shao's was the third open letter sent to Chinese leaders by 
democracy advocates within one week, in what some observers see 
as the most serious challenge to Chinese authorities since the 
1989 demonstrations. The letter denounced "corruption, social 
disorder, the economic imbalance between the interior of the 
country and the coastal regions, inflation and unemployment." 
  Shao also wrote that it was "important now to create a good 
social environment for the development of China." He called for 
"the liberation of all persons detained for their beliefs," "the 
halt of violations of dissidents' rights as citizens," the 
"suppression of points of law concerning beliefs," and "freedom 
of the press." 
  The dissident also asked that the public be informed of the 
"assets possessed by the (communist) party and state officials" 
and that the government "open a dialogue with all Chinese on 
society's problems." Shao's letter also demanded "official 
explanations of the deaths of June 4, 1989" when the military 
crushed demonstrations in Beijing. Officially, some 300 persons 
were killed in the capital, but according to most witnesses, the 
crackdown caused more than 1,000 deaths. 
  Shao, 24, is a mathematician. After the Tiananmen events, he 
spent 18 months in prison and was released in February 1991. He 
was questioned March 2 in Beijing and interrogated for 24 hours 
in a campaign of intimidation launched by police against 
dissidents. 
  Wang Dan, one of the 1989 Beijing student leaders, sent an 
open letter March 10 to NPC delegates calling for a debate on 
human rights. The same day, seven intellectuals sent another 
open letter demanding "the liberation of all citizens imprisoned 
because of their speeches or their ideas." Among signatories 
was professor Xu Liangying, 74, a long-time defender of 
individual liberties. 
  On March 8, the militant democrat Liu Nianchun officially 
requested to register an independent workers' union, called the 
League for the Protection of Working People, which claims to 
unite some 120 signatories.

<F P=106> [By John Colmey] </F>
  [Text] One day last week, 1,000 copies of the first 
edition of the China Labour Bulletin were smuggled from Hong 
Kong to Beijing. They were also carried to factories across the 
mainland from Guangzhou to Shanghai to Wuhan. They will be 
photocopied and faxed and quietly passed from person to person 
until thousands of workers have learned about the strike at 
Shanghai's first Taiwan-funded department store on January 7, 
the 550 million yuan (about HK$488 million) claim in back wages 
owed to miners in Heilongjiang, the pitiful compensation paid to 
families of the 84 people killed in the fire at the Hong 
Kong-owned Zhili toy factory in Shenzhen, and about the need for 
free trade unions. Eventually, a copy will fall into the hands 
of the Ministry of Public Security whose officers will pore over 
every word. They are going to be upset when they read it. But 
they will be positively incensed when they learn the author is 
someone they know and fear -- exiled labour activist Han 
Dongfang. 
  Anywhere else, Mr. Han's 20-page monthly publication would 
not even be noticed. The word "democracy" is not even 
mentioned. There are no calls for the overthrow of the regime, 
peaceful or otherwise, or even talk of opposing the Chinese 
Government. Most of the text is taken from official government 
sources. 
  But China is in the throes of a potentially violent 
succession. Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, whose economic 
reforms have produced some of the fastest economic growth in 
history, is ailing and his conservative opponents are already 
preparing an offensive. In the midst of it all, labour unrest 
among the country's 300 million workers is rocketing. As Mao 
Zedong once said, a spark can inflame the whole plain. Mr. Han 
could become that spark. 
  "The Government forced me to do this," Mr. Han said in his 
studio apartment on Lamma island where he produced the bulletin, 
"because they won't let me go back to China." 
  Until Mr. Han was expelled it would have been an 
exaggeration 
to call the young, uneducated, former railway worker from 
Beijing the "Lech Walesa of China". But now that does not seem 
so far-fetched. Mr. Han met privately with United States 
President Bill Clinton last year and has testified before Senate 
hearings to decide whether the U.S. should extend China's Most 
Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status. The 155 members of the 
International Federation of Free Trade Unions, who gave Mr. Han 
the laptop computer he used to produce the bulletin, have 
adopted him as their favourite son. 
  And that was also before CNN, the BBC and most of the 
world's 
newspapers ran lead stories about Mr. Han's arrest in a 
Guangzhou hotel room last August and his subsequent expulsion 
from China for "issuing anti-Government speeches" to 
international audiences. "Originally, his scope of activity on 
the mainland was limited because people were afraid to identify 
with him," said Lee Cheuk- yan, president of Hong Kong's 
Confederation of Trade Unions. "But after Beijing threw him 
out, he has become very important in world politics and famous 
within China. President Clinton was right to meet him." 
  Mr. Han was in the headlines again last week when the 
Ministry of Public Security began rounding up labour and 
democracy activists across the mainland, including Mr. Han's 
lawyer and friend, Zhou Guoqiang. The two men spoke on the 
telephone just before his arrest, as they have done a couple of 
times a week over the past months. Journalists, analysts and 
human rights activists all looked to Mr. Han for answers. Is 
this the beginning of conservative offensive? Is it a message 
to the U.S. to stop meddling in China's internal affairs? 
  "I tend to agree with Han Dongfang," Chinese University law 
professor Michael Davies said. "Things are getting out of 
control on the labour front and they wanted to send a message to 
them. As we get closer to the MFN vote, the Government can 
throw tidbits to the U.S. by releasing them. But you have to 
look toward labour unrest." 
  Mr. Han gave a similar message to U.S. Under Secretary of 
State for Human Rights, John Shattuck, when the two met in Hong 
Kong last Saturday. "I told him the MFN issue is closely 
related to labour relations in China," Mr. Han said. 
  "Workers are treated like slaves and labour unrest is 
increasing. U.S. businessmen are investing in a very vulnerable 
investment environment," Mr. Han told Mr. Shattuck. "He told me 
that, based on his visit, he had not seen progress or anything 
that would justify passing MFN. He said without any future 
improvement, it would lead to very significant consequences." 
  Mr. Han left for the United States on Thursday. Although it 
is likely there will be more requests for interviews awaiting 
his arrival, his reasons for visiting are nonpolitical. "I'm 
going to the U.S. to visit my family," he said. "I hope to 
persuade them to come to Hong Kong." 
  It has been several months since he last saw his wife, Chen 
Jingyun and his 15-month-old son Linfeng, now living in New York 
where his son was born. It would have been difficult to bring 
them here before now. Since Governor Chris Patten intervened to 
allow the labour leader to stay in Hong Kong -- much to the 
chagrin of China -- Mr. Han has moved six times. He did not 
have a job and had to depend on donations from friends and 
labour unions to get by. The Christian Industrial Committee, and 
its director, legislator Lau Chin-shek, gave him his present job 
as editor of the China Labour Bulletin. That led to an 
employment visa to stay in the territory. The committee is part 
of the Hong Kong Christian Council. 
  Like many of China's dissidents who took part in the 
Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and managed to live through 
prison afterwards, Mr. Han, 30, is mature for his age. A quiet, 
friendly man with a quick sense of humour and almost majestic 
demeanour, he lives alone in his small $3,500-a-month studio on 
Lamma, just up the hill from the Yung Shue Wan ferry terminal. 
A small balcony overlooks the sea. Papers and books are strewn 
around the floor and dirty clothes are piled on one of two 
chairs. 
  There is a no-smoking sign on the door, a reminder of the 
tuberculosis that he contracted in prison. U.S. pressure, and 
China's fear he would die in prison, eventually led authorities 
to release him on medical grounds and allow him to travel to the 
U.S. for treatment, provided free of charge by Columbia 
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and its doctors. 
Although surgeons had to remove a quarter of his left lung, he 
says the disease is in remission. When Mr. Han is not writing, 
or calling his contacts in China -- "he's always on the phone," 
says a friend -- he takes walks in Lamma's hills, remembering 
harsher times and people, such as the prison doctor who tortured 
him with acupuncture needles. "At least he said he was a 
doctor," he says, laughing, then adds ruefully, "I still feel 
the numbness in my legs." 
  Mr. Han never set out to be an international labour leader, 
but he admits he was always "active". He was born into a poor 
family in an impoverished farming village of 2,000 people, 
called Nanweiquan, about 700 kilometres from Beijing. His 
father, who still lives there, was a peasant on a collective 
farm, his mother, who died in 1988, was a babysitter. She left 
her husband for Beijing while she was still young and, except 
for a few years when they returned during the Cultural 
Revolution, Mr. Han grew up in Beijing. "We were part of the 
great proletariat," he says of his family. "We were very poor." 
  Mr. Han had his first run-in with authority when he joined 
the army, on his mother's advice, in 1980 when he was 16. 
Although he failed in his studies, he was a good soldier and 
became a squad leader. He fired his first verbal salvo at the 
state when he stood up at a troop-reviewing ceremony. "My men's 
main problem is food," he announced as officers began to cringe. 
"The officers are stealing a third of our food allowance. This 
is in direct contravention of Chairman Mao's line that officers 
and men are equal and must share both sufferings and good 
times." The next day, his superior commander tore up his 
application for the Communist Party. 
  And yet, two years later, he was accepted in the prestigious 
Communist Youth League. "People always thought I was a good 
boy," he says. "They were wrong." He says he applied to be a 
party member "because I thought communism was a worthy ideal". 
But by then he was working for the railway as an electrical 
repairman on a refrigerator car, and gradually became 
disenchanted with the state as an employer. He stopped going to 
Youth League meetings and in 1986 withdrew his membership over 
the objections of the leadership. "They wanted to make me a 
member of the propaganda committee." 
  The event that put him firmly on the road to becoming what 
China sees as a counter-revolutionary happened in 1988 when his 
mother was dying. At the time, Mr. Han was traveling most of 
the year and asked for a one-month shift in Beijing to be near 
his mother. His unit leader, who had marked him as trouble, 
refused but eventually agreed if he would give up one month's 
pay. "I went to the union and they told me they couldn't do 
anything because they worked for the same leader," he says. Mr. 
Han went to the next highest leader and was again told no. 
  "I started screaming at him and almost punched him in the 
nose," he says. "I told him, since my mother was dying anyway, 
I would take it to the congress of employees (an annual meeting 
of all the railway workers). After that he let me take the 
Beijing shift. 
  "I learned then I had to count on myself. Before that, I 
trusted my leaders and, to a lesser extent, the union. After 
that, I knew I had to take a stand and be uncompromising in my 
stance," he said. "Being meek and mild would get me nowhere. I 
had to fight." 
  Mr. Han got his chance a year later on April 16 when he went 
to Tiananmen Square with his wife, and listened to the student 
speeches. "The feelings didn't come from the students but from 
myself. I had seen enough injustice in my own life and all 
around me and grew up in such poverty. Finally all my thoughts 
and feelings unfolded. I thought this country has very serious 
problems," he remembers. "All the grievances and the injustices 
that had been accumulating over the years had reached a point of 
explosion. I couldn't imagine what would happen." 
  What happened next, both in Tiananmen Square and to Mr. Han, 
is well documented in the book Black Hands of 
Beijing, by Robin Munro, the head of Asia Watch in Hong 
Kong, and George Black. After eventually joining the Beijing 
Autonomous Federation of Workers, within one month Mr. Han 
became well known for his speeches trying to unite the students 
and the workers. After the June 4 crackdown, he went into 
hiding but eventually turned himself in when his picture 
appeared on television as one of the three most wanted workers' 
leaders. After 22 months in jail without trial, he was 
eventually released when it appeared he was about to die. A 
year later he went to the U.S. for treatment. 
  Mr. Han's rise to the world stage is at least partly due to 
increasing labour unrest and to Beijing's desperation to keep a 
lid on it. According to Hong Kong-based French sinologist 
Jean-Phillipe Beja, Beijing has to contend with two different 
groups of labourers. The first are the estimated 120 million 
urban dwellers who have official status as workers. Most of 
them labour in the factories and survive on the "iron rice bowl" 
-- guaranteed pay and benefits for government employees -- or 
used to. They fall under the leaky umbrella of the state union, 
the All China Federation of Trade Organisations. 
  The second and larger group is the roughly 180 million 
workers in the special economic zones, private companies and 
rural cottage industries -- "the artisans of the so-called 
Chinese miracle," Mr. Beja says. "These are the peasants and 
farmers on the move, who have no official status and are not 
considered workers. People usually talk about them at Lunar New 
Year and then forget about them. These are also the people who 
died in the Zhili toy factory and the Taiwan-funded Gaofu 
Textiles factory in Fuzhou." 
  The Chinese Government's biggest worry, however, has been 
how 
to keep urban labourers happy in the state enterprises, most of 
which are bleeding money. The recurring problem has been how to 
close them down when there is no safety net for the laid-off 
workers. Beijing's solution to keeping them content was to 
implement what Mr. Beja calls the "half lay-off". If you have a 
couple, the man might continue working in the factory while the 
wife was allowed to open a small business, such as a restaurant, 
but she would still receive 70 per cent of her pay. 
  "The Government encouraged this as a cushion for 
inflation," Mr. Beja says. "This worked for a while. But then 
last year Beijing began to print money to cover its debt. Then 
they didn't have enough to pay the workers." 
  Mao's army suddenly found they were being asked to work 
longer shifts with less and less to show for it. The China 
Labour Bulletin gives an example of a union investigation into 
wages among mining, forestry and textile industries in 
Heilongjiang. They found that employees in 10 cities were owed 
2.66 billion yuan. About 70 per cent had received their cheques 
three to six months late, and even then wages had failed to keep 
up with inflation. Benefits had also been cut. 
  "In theory, when a worker pays a medical bill he goes to the 
factory to be repaid," Mr. Han says. "Now when he goes to the 
unit leader, the leader says the factory doesn't have any money." 
  Mr. Beja said some union representatives at first tried to 
defend labour rights, but found themselves in an increasingly 
awkward position because they also worked for the state. 
"Eventually they had to take a stand against the workers," he 
says. "Management even tried to get money for them, but they 
just couldn't do it. They had to take a stand too." Mr. Beja 
says this has caused a huge dilemma for the leadership. 
Reformers argue that the answer is to introduce shock therapy 
as was done in Poland and Russia. Conservatives say that the 
workers will revolt. And anyway, they argue, surely the party 
is supposed to represent the labourers. As a result, nothing is 
being done. "The Government is in a very embarrassing situation. 
  But the sanctioned proletariat has it easy compared to the 
peasants in the cottage industries, who earn about half the pay 
of the state employees. "A Chinese worker in a private factory 
earns about US$20 a month," Mr. Han says. "Prisoners make US$1 
a month. It's not that different." 
  Unofficial workers are badly exploited and often work in 
terrible conditions. "Those people really depend on the open 
market economy," Mr. Beja says. "No one looks out for their 
interests." Although the Government says there are laws in place 
to protect workers, you would never know it by visiting a 
Chinese factory. 
  For example, it is against the law to have what is known as 
three-in-one factories, where the plant, warehouse and sleeping 
quarters are connected. However, you find them all along the 
southeast coast, and many belong to Hong Kong companies, 
including the Zhili factory where 84 people burned to death when 
they found themselves locked in their dormitory. 
  The dilemma facing Beijing is that China's greatest 
attraction is its cheap and unregulated labour force. But 
workers are getting tired of waiting for the benefits of the 
reforms to trickle down. Last year, the number of strikes and 
walkouts began to increase. The Government's response was to 
crack down. 
  According to an Asia Watch report on political dissidents, 
released last month, the number arrested in 1993 was the highest 
since the post-Tiananmen roundup. Outside of Tibet, arrests of 
labourers began to race ahead of political dissidents. "Workers 
were given the stiffest sentences," Mr. Munro says. "The 
Government is vigilant about a solidarity-type movement." 
  According to Mr. Han: "These problems have always been 
there, but have become more visible and worse under Deng's 
reforms. Before, only the state had the power to exploit 
workers. But with the reforms, entrepreneurs and foreign 
investors also have that freedom. It's like frosting on the 
snow." Under normal circumstances, he says, workers could 
complain to an independent union. "But in China, the union is 
paid by the state," he says. 
  He says China has never understood the role of unions in 
releasing pressure on labour tensions. In 1947 there were two 
unions. One belonged to the nationalists, who used the unions 
to maintain power, the other belonged to the communists, who 
used the unions to take the power away. "They don't understand 
that unions don't have to threaten the state. But the 
Government is confused about its role. In most cases it used to 
be the employer, but it is not any longer. If it understands 
its role is to mediate, it can remove itself from this mess. If 
not, the Communist Party will destroy itself." 
  That is where Mr. Han comes in. He says if things keep going 
like they are, the result could be a "violent explosion". If 
the Government faces an economic crisis, they may have to 
further undercut the well-being of the workers. That could lead 
to a mass uprising in the streets, in which no individual or 
group will be responsible. "We don't want to see it happen. 
Because another uprising will lead to suppression, which means 
violence, brutality and chaos. And that won't lead us anywhere." 
  Mr. Han believes the only answer is for the Government to 
introduce free trade unions. 
  That is what he hopes to make workers realise with his 
bulletin. Unlike other activists, he says, he will never suggest 
that anyone oppose the Government. "Everything must be done 
within the law." However, that is what Mr. Han told his 
interrogators in 1989 to no avail. As he wrote in his appeal 
upon his parole: "I am here repeating what I have said many 
times. As a Chinese citizen, the constitution gave me the right 
to associate with others and speak my mind." 
  Of course his bulletin should also be protected by this 
"constitutional right" but, if he were allowed back into China, 
he would almost certainly be arrested. 
  Perhaps what is most astonishing is that Mr. Han is still 
trying to go back. Before his lawyer was picked up last week, 
he was in the process of filing yet another appeal against his 
expulsion. While most people will say he is crazy, Mr. Beja says 
he represents the attitude of younger workers: "They are 
threatened by the reforms and they have absolutely no way to 
protect themselves. If there is a market economy, everyone is 
against you." As to Mr. Han's wish to return, Mr. Beja says: 
"He thinks that to make things advance, you need to sacrifice. 
Some people just don't care." 
  "I won't give up my determination to go home," Mr. Han says. 
"Maybe they will put me in prison, maybe even kill me. But I 
don't want to be the first Chinese to be thrown out of his own 
country. If I stop, they will kick the others out one by one."

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] The health of one of China's most revered dissident 
intellectuals is said to be in danger because he has been kept 
under house arrest since Thursday. Xu Liangying, who last week 
initiated a petition to the authorities to free all political 
prisoners, said yesterday he was suffering from heart disease 
and he needed to go out to replenish his medical supplies. 
  After American Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
departed 
yesterday the authorities in Shanghai freed two activists, Yang 
Zhou and Wang Fuchen. The two expressed worries they might be 
subjected to "police harassment" any time the authorities saw 
fit. 
  Speaking in his Beijing apartment, Mr Xu, 74, an 
internationally known historian of science said there were still 
around 20 policemen in his compound. "They have started letting 
my friends come in to see me," Mr Xu said. "But this morning 
when my wife and I wanted to go out to take a walk, the police 
stopped us." Mr Xu said police gave him no indication when his 
house arrest would end. "I have had heart disease for some 
time, and I have taken extra doses of medicine the past few 
days," he said. The scholar said it was lucky that two staff 
from his unit, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, had brought 
along some medicine when they visited him yesterday. 
  Mr Xu said Mr Christopher's visit had been a failure because 
it had only provoked the Chinese leadership into saying they 
would never accept the "Western" view of human rights. While he 
hoped it would get Most Favoured Nation status, Mr Xu said China 
had to make improvements in human rights to earn it. 
  In Shanghai, Mr Yang and Mr Wang were set free hours before 
Mr Christopher left Beijing. "The U.S. should keep up the 
pressure ... I believe China should at least release more 
dissidents who are being locked up for political reasons such as 
Fu Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang," said Mr Wang. "I am not afraid 
of them (police), I can't lie and I cannot speak against my 
conscience," he added. According to Mr Wang, he was kept under 
constant surveillance during his detention. "I could not even 
go to the toilet (on my own)," he said. He was not treated 
badly, but said the detention was nonetheless illegal. 
Throughout his captivity, Mr Wang was never given any documents 
to explain why he was detained. "They only said I should know 
why," he said. "I am going to write to the National People's 
Congress to complain about my treatment. I am a law- abiding 
citizen. I haven't broken any law and they can't do this to 
me," Mr Wang said. 
  According to Mr Yang, who was taken away every night for the 
past three days, his treatment at the police station was 
acceptable. He was allowed to read newspapers every morning and 
was even offered a packet of cigarettes every day. But the 
police also reminded him that he must "repent" or risk going to 
jail. "They told me that they could 'reform' even old men -- 70 
or 80 years old -- and I would not be an exception," said Mr 
Yang. "But I told them I am 50 years old and I won't change."

  [Text] A report dated 28 January from the General Office 
of the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that in 1993 a 
total of about 280 underground publishing houses were banned and 
more than 1.5 million reactionary or pornographic books and 
tabloids, including some published in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and 
abroad and reprinted, were seized and confiscated in 183 cities 
across the country. The report points out that readers of 
reactionary publications from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and abroad are 
mostly intellectuals, middle-aged and young cadres, and 
university students, while readers of pornographic publications 
are mostly self-employed businessmen and young workers and staff 
members.

  [Text] "Part-time general secretary" Deng Liqun recently 
made a study tour of Zhejiang Province and made some 
enlightening remarks at an organization meeting of old cadres in 
the province. He said that if the present political line 
continues to develop, China will become a capitalist society led 
by a communist party guided by non- Marxist theories in less 
than 15 years, or even in seven to eight years. We cannot use 
the manifesto of a ruling party as the standard for judging what 
road a country takes and what structure it establishes, but must 
look at the political line of the ruling party and the specific 
principles and policies its pursues. The so-called leftist 
political parties, the socialist parties and labor parties of 
the European countries, also practice capitalism. Today, I can 
say with certainty that there cannot even be half of the total 
number of party members who think that the present political 
line is following the socialist road. Deng Liqun also said: I 
will not waver at all in my own beliefs. 
  Deng Liqun's remarks were excerpted from bulletins issued by 
the General Office of the CPC Central Committee.

1,000 Members Apply for Withdrawal From the CPC"] 
  [Text] According to information from the CPC Central 
Committee Organization Department on 25 January, after the 
resolution on the establishment of the socialist market economy 
was adopted at the 14th CPC National Congress, 1,630 party 
members applied to withdraw from the party or forfeited their 
membership by refusing to pay membership dues or take part in 
organizational life by the end of 1993. Among them, over 1,100 
became party members in the 1940's and 420 in the 1950's. The 
reason for withdrawal from the party given by most is: The 
party's existing line goes against the party's manifesto and 
their beliefs when they joined the party. It was disclosed that 
over 500 among a total of about 2,200 who applied to withdraw 
from the CPC changed their minds after they reconsidered the 
issue and after relevant organizations carried out ideological 
work among them. Among those who resigned from the party, more 
than 90 were once cadres at ministerial or provincial level or 
members of the Central Advisory Commission.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 March (XINHUA) -- A national conference 
on party school work opened here today. Speaking at the 
conference, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, member of the 
secretariat, and president of the Central Party School, 
stressed: We must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the guide 
in studying new developments and problems in party school work 
under the new circumstances, to achieve unity in understanding, 
to strengthen leadership, and to comprehensively deepen 
education reform in party schools to bring about a new stage in 
party school education. 
  Hu Jintao discussed five issues: 1) further clarifying the 
new situation and tasks facing party school work; 2) 
persistently using the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to guide party school work; 3) deepening party 
school reform, and comprehensively raising the standards of 
party school work; 4) building a contingent of better-qualified 
teachers as the key to running party schools successfully; 5) 
earnestly strengthening the party committee's leadership over 
party school work. 
  Hu Jintao pointed out: In this crucial period of historical 
development, and in the face of a new situation and new tasks, 
we must, more than at any time in the past, attach greater 
importance to the party's ideological and theoretical 
construction; to using Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and 
especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics to arm the entire party; and to 
train and improve the vast number of cadres and raise the 
qualified personnel needed in our times. Hu Jintao said: 
Training cadres requires the efforts of the entire party in 
many areas, and party schools at all levels shoulder 
particularly important responsibility in this regard. Closely 
integrating the practice of reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization; arming leading cadres with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; bringing up a theoretical backbone force; and 
conducting theoretical study and propaganda constitute the 
fundamental tasks of the party school in the new situation. 
They are also the basic requirements put forward by the party 
central committee on party school work. We must carry out the 
training, rotational or non-rotational, of leading cadres in 
active service and strive to improve their skills in finding 
solutions to basic political, economic, social, and cultural 
issues in the new period and their ability to command the 
overall situation, operate the socialist market economy, foster 
material, cultural, and ideological progress, and handle 
complicated contradictions. We must earnestly carry out the 
training of young cadres, strengthen the training of theoretical 
backbones, and do a good job of theoretical research and 
propaganda. 
  Hu Jintao looked at, from 10 aspects, the guiding ideology, 
basic requirements, and work principles needed to strengthen 
cadres' education and theoretical work which were put forward by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping in light of the new situation facing the 
party and the new tasks it shoulders. He pointed out: From 
either the immediate or long-term perspective, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's series of expositions is of extremely great 
significance as a guide for us in successfully conducting party 
school work in the new period. When we stress the strengthening 
and improvement of party school work, we must first concentrate 
our efforts on using the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to guide party school work. 
  Hu Jintao stressed: The key to raising the standards of 
party school work lie in deepening reform. The general 
requirements for party school reform are: Using the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line as the guide; focusing on efforts to vigorously 
improve teaching quality; strengthening scientific research and 
using it as the foundation; more successfully upholding the 
policy of integrating theory with practice; closely integrating 
the practice of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization; 
correctly understanding and grasping the law governing the work 
of education for party cadres in the new period; gradually 
establishing a sound party school education system, scientific 
research system, and management system with Chinese 
characteristics; further improving party school operations; and 
more satisfactorily serving the need to train qualified leaders 
for the party, the need for theoretical construction, the need 
for scientific decisionmaking by party committees and 
governments, and the need for reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization. Hu Jintao pointed out: To further improve party 
schools, we must pay closer attention to and seriously 
strengthen the building of a contingent of teachers. We must 
make concrete and relentless efforts to build a contingent of 
better- qualified teachers in sufficient numbers in accordance 
with the requirement to raise their standards, improve their 
makeup, maintain a stable backbone force, and train qualified 
successors -- to build a contingent of teachers who are capable 
of upholding the party's basic theory and line and upholding 
unity between the emancipation of the minds and seeking truth 
from facts, who are good at studying the new situation and 
correctly answering new questions, and who possess strong party 
spirit and Marxist study style and are worthy of the name of 
teacher. 
  Hu Jintao concluded: To earnestly strengthen the party 
committee's leadership over party school work, we must 
concentrate on doing three tasks well: 1) The building of 
leading bodies. We must select a group of comrades who have a 
better grasp of Marxist theory, possess rich practical work 
experience, and are enthusiastic about the role of party school 
education in strengthening the leading bodies of party schools. 
In addition, we must strengthen the building of ideology and 
work style among the leading bodies. 2) We must ensure that 
party schools are operated in the right direction. 3) We must 
help party schools resolve major issues related to their work. 
Hu Jintao fully affirmed the arduous efforts and important 
accomplishments made by comrades on the party school education 
front. He urged them to further pluck up their pioneering and 
enterprising spirit and work hard to explore new paths of party 
school education with Chinese characteristics to enable party 
schools to play a greater role in the drive to build socialism 
with Chinese characteristics.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Friends, Please Join the Ranks of </F>
Volunteers"] 
  [Text] The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" under the 
theme of "enthusiastically dedicating oneself to society and 
warming human hearts" took off across the country some time 
between last winter and this spring, bringing a breath of fresh 
air to society and receiving favorable widespread comments. 
  The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" is a key part of the 
"Cross-century Youth Spiritual Civilization" project sponsored 
by the Chinese Communist Youth League. The project has enriched 
and developed the drive to learn from Lei Feng in a new format 
to match the new era and is a new way to foster the "four 
have's" new generation and promote ideological and educational 
youth work. The project counts on the participation of young 
volunteers, orients toward society, and provides sustained and 
detailed voluntary services such as public labor, environmental 
protection, rescue and relief operation, community service, law 
and order, and the defense of youth rights. 
  Since reform and opening up, there has been a boom in modern 
developments and projects. A large number of ambitious, 
hardworking, enterprising, pragmatic, dedicated, advanced, and 
Lei Feng-style people have emerged in various trades and 
professions. However, money worship, hedonism, and extreme 
individualism have also grown in some localities, and 
indifference to suffering and refusals to help in emergencies 
are often reported. The party and government have stressed 
repeatedly that in developing a socialist market economic 
system, it is necessary to vigorously educate people in arduous 
struggle, thrift, nation-building, and vocational and social 
ethics with the aim of voluntarily resisting and overcoming 
various negative and corrupt phenomena and creating a better 
opinion and social climate for reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization. The "Chinese Young Volunteers' Action" was 
initiated against such a background. It can actively promote 
good social morality; encourage solidarity, friendliness, 
helpfulness, courageous acts, and selfless dedication; boost 
patriotism and collectivism; strengthen socialist spiritual 
civilization; and raise ideological, moral, and scientific 
quality of youth. 
  The activities are characterized by attention to 
self-education and stress on voluntary participation, which 
turns "being made to participate" into "me participating," 
allowing the majority of youths to join activities and services 
to help others and society, while having their souls purified 
and forming a correct outlook on life. They will have a chance 
to continually improve themselves morally, cultivate themselves, 
raise their quality, and finally turn into talented, 
disciplined, cultured, and morally sound youths with ideals and 
who work for the socialist cause. Therefore, from the very 
beginning, these activities spread very quickly across the large 
cities, illustrating their vitality. 
  The Chinese Young Volunteers' Action has had a good 
beginning. Tens of thousands of young people across the 
countries have participated actively in this great project with 
enthusiasm and love. In launching this activity, localities 
should take note of their local conditions and ensure voluntary 
participation, that they go only as far as their abilities 
permit, work for results, and sustain their efforts. Only a 
pragmatic approach can deepen and sustain these activities, 
which will foster a generation of new people in the 
"Cross-century Youth Spiritual Civilization." 
  The times call for more volunteers! Friends, join the ranks 
of the volunteers. Let more people contribute voluntary 
services toward a fundamental change for the better in the 
social climate and the progress and civilization of human 
society.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A few 
days ago, Ai Zhisheng, minister of radio, film, and television 
in China, said at a meeting: It is necessary to maintain high 
vigilance against decadent overseas ideologies and culture and 
to resolutely resist the corrosive influence of foreign decadent 
ideologies. We should never allow the bourgeois lifestyle to 
run rampant in China. 
  Ai Zhisheng said: China has signed agreements of cooperation 
and exchange with over 100 countries and regions and many 
television programs are introduced from overseas. These 
practices are necessary. However, the problem is that we do not 
analyze and differentiate programs introduced from overseas, and 
consequently, a large number of movies, videotapes, and tapes 
even regarded as vulgar or pernicious in the West are 
introduced. Radio and television programs have been overflowing 
with vulgar popular songs, rock and roll shows, and beauty 
pageants in disguised forms. 
  Ai Zhisheng said: Many movies and audio-visual products from 
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the West are brought into our country 
through various legal and illegal channels, and occupy most of 
the theaters in cities and townships. This severely affects 
locally produced movies. An overwhelmingly majority of these 
movies and audio-visual products are vulgar, and are very 
damaging to adolescents. 
  Ai Zhisheng pointed out: It is equally notable that some 
people from overseas use money to entice others to make movies 
which smear the revolutionary history of China, play up the 
seamy side of things, and reject socialism. Some people from 
overseas also come to the mainland to hold various false 
"charity shows" and "beauty pageants" in disguised forms, and to 
use huge monetary awards to wantonly promote a decadent 
lifestyle which advocates consumption and hedonism, as well as 
negative and decadent ideologies and culture. These activities 
have brought about many grave consequences. 
  Ai Zhisheng said that, in order to safeguard the interests 
of 
the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and to 
educate the younger generations in a better way, it is necessary 
to unswervingly implement Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "We 
must unswervingly implement the policy of opening up to the 
outside world and vigorously widen the scope of exchange with 
the outside world on the basis of equality and reciprocity; but, 
in the meantime, we must keep sober-minded and resolutely resist 
the corrosive influence of foreign decadent ideologies. We 
should never allow the bourgeois lifestyle to run rampant in our 
country."

<F P=106> [Interview with Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's </F>
Congress Standing Committee, by staff reporter Yao Kan-nan (1202 
6373 0589) in Beijing; date not given: "Qiao Shi Answers 
Questions on Building the Legal System In the Context of 
Socialist Market Economy"] 
  [Text] Just before the second session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC], Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC 
standing committee, gave an interview to our staff reporter in 
Beijing on the building of the legal system in the context of 
the socialist market economy. Despite his busy schedule, Qiao 
Shi spared some of his precious time and answered the questions 
in detail. The topics covered issues people are concerned about 
in many areas, such as the establishment of the legal system for 
the socialist market economy, the acceleration of drafting 
economic laws, the coordination of the reform and opening up 
with the building of the legal system, and the improvement of 
the whole society's awareness of law and understanding of the 
legal system. 
<H5>  Accelerating the Drafting of Economic Laws </H5>
  [Yao] The second session of the Eighth NPC is about to open. 
Chairman, what expectations do you have of this session? 
  [Qiao] Before this NPC session, the NPC standing committee 
made some down-to-earth preparations. The objective we are 
striving for is to form a rough legal structure framework for 
the socialist market economy before the end of the current NPC's 
term. Since the first session of the Eighth NPC, the standing 
committee has adopted 19 laws or decisions related to legal 
matters. This year, another batch of important laws are due to 
be promulgated. We set great store by the building of the legal 
system and strive to integrate the reform and opening up with 
the building of legal system and learn to administer the economy 
by way of law. In pursuance of the principles provided in our 
Constitution, we shall accelerate the drafting of economic laws 
and, in the meantime, make a good job of the formulation, 
substantiation, and improvement of laws in other fields. We 
shall, with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the 
guides, make sure that the forthcoming NPC session will have the 
nature of being democratic, unified, truth-seeking, practical, 
trailblazing, and enterprising, so that the people of all 
nationalities in the whole country can be further mobilized to 
work as one, seize the opportunity, deepen the reform, expand 
the opening up, promote development, maintain stability, and 
promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. I am full of confidence about this. 
  [Yao] This year, the tasks of deepening the reforms in the 
whole country are very heavy and many reform measures have been 
promulgated. How can the work of the NPC and people's 
congresses at all levels in localities adapt to the needs of the 
reforms? Could you please comment on this? 
  [Qiao] As you have just said, the year 1994 is one wherein 
many measures for deepening the reforms will be promulgated. 
Each and every reform measure we adopt is of vital importance. 
For this reason, the NPC and local people's congresses at all 
levels will promote and support the smooth implementation of all 
reform measures through their respective efforts. This year, 
the NPC Standing Committee will continue to give top priority to 
the acceleration of legislation, especially the drafting of 
economic laws. We have made a legislation plan for this term 
and, according to its requirements, we shall make proper 
arrangements for the legislative work and guide, promote, and 
support the reforms with laws. As to the reform measures which 
have already been promulgated, we should sum up our experiences 
in good time and try to finalize them in a legal form to the 
greatest extent possible, so that they can be standardized and 
codified. 
<H3>  Make a Good Job of the Legislative Work in a Number of 
Respects </H3>
  [Yao] In the course of establishing a socialist market 
economic system, we will encounter some contradictions and 
problems in the changeover from the old system to the new one. 
In what way does the NPC Standing Committee plan to make a good 
job of the legislative work, so that these problems can be 
smoothly solved? 
  [Qiao] The coming few years will be a critical period for 
the conversion of our economic system. There has never been any 
successful precedent in the world of a smooth transition from a 
planned economy to a market economy. It is all up to us to 
explore. In the meantime, there is no existing model to follow 
as to how the framework of legal system for the market economy 
should be established and we must also make a big effort to 
explore this. The socialist market economy does not mean one 
can do whatever one wishes to or that each can go his own way 
with total disregard to laws. In a sense, the socialist market 
economy is one ruled by law. Therefore, the NPC and local 
people's congresses are faced with onerous legislative tasks. 
Only by guiding, standardizing, and supporting it with laws, 
can we ensure a healthy development of the socialist market 
economy. 
  In the course of legislation for the market economy, we may 
encounter some contradictions and difficulties. To solve these 
problems, we will mainly resort to the following solutions. The 
first solution is that we will try to match legislation with the 
progress of the reform and opening up. On this point, Deng 
Xiaoping once said: Having laws is better than having no laws; 
fast legislation is better than slow legislation. For some 
matters which should be either promoted or eliminated, if the 
conditions for legislation are not ripe for the time being, we 
can first make administrative regulations or local regulations 
and, when we have had some experience, upgrade them to laws. 
The second solution is that we must stick to the principle of 
subordinating local interests to the overall interests of the 
country, avoid overemphasis on local interests and powers, and 
avoid passing the buck to each other. The third solution is 
that we must base ourselves on China's national conditions and 
boldly absorb and draw upon foreign experiences. We can 
directly transplant some legal provisions used by other 
countries which suit our national conditions and keep improving 
them through practice. Some market economy-related laws in our 
country should be made in such a way that they can converge with 
the relevant laws of other countries and international practice. 
The fourth solution is that local people's congresses and their 
standing committees should, in light of the actual needs of 
their respective administrative areas, step up efforts to 
formulate local regulations regarding the market economy, under 
the premise of not contravening the Constitution, laws, and 
administrative regulations. Besides, we also emphasize that the 
role of experts should be brought into play in the process of 
legislation and the quality of legislation should be enhanced. 
This way, laws are bound to be able to play the role of 
effectively supporting and promoting the development of the 
socialist market economy. 
<H5>  Laws Which Urgently Need Promulgating </H5>
  [Yao] You once said the laws that urgently need to be 
promulgated in China at present include: Laws standardizing the 
subjects of the market; laws to regulate the relationship among 
the subjects of the market and maintain fair competition; laws 
which improve and strengthen macroregulation and control and 
promote coordinated development of the economy; and laws to 
establish and improve the social security system. Could you 
please elaborate a little on these? 
  [Qiao] Making laws to standardize the subjects of the market 
is largely for the purpose of safeguarding the rights and 
interests of the subjects of the market and defining their 
obligations according to law, to ensure that they can operate by 
making their own decisions, assuming sole responsibility for 
profits and losses, seeking development with their own 
resources, and exercising self- restraint. For example, the 
"Company Law" that was adopted not long ago is important. It is 
of great significance in defining the legal status of companies 
as a subject of the market, standardizing the organization and 
behavior of companies, establishing a modern enterprise system, 
and promoting the healthy development of the socialist market 
economy. The laws for regulating the relationship among the 
subjects of the market and maintaining fair competition, such as 
the "Law Against Unfair Practices in Competition," the "Economic 
Contract Law," the "Securities Act," the "Checking Law," the 
"Arbitration Law," the "guaranteed Mortgage Law," the "Real 
Estate Law," and the "Law For the Protection of Consumer Rights 
and Interests, are all extremely important and necessary. Of 
these, the "Law Against Unfair Practices in Competition," the 
"Economic Contract Law," and the "Law for the Protection of 
Consumer Rights and Interests" have been drafted. Other laws 
have been listed in the legislation plan of the NPC standing 
committee and their formulation will be carried out with greater 
efforts. As to the laws for improving and strengthening 
macroregulation and control and promoting coordinated 
development of the economy, we plan to submit the budget act to 
the second session of the Eighth NPC to be held this year for 
deliberation; other laws such as the "Central Bank Law," 
"Commercial Bank Law," and "Foreign Trade Law" are listed in the 
legislation plan and will be drafted. We will also make laws 
for adjusting the industrial structure and promoting scientific 
and technological advance. As to the laws for establishing and 
improving the social security system, we pay close attention to 
such laws as the "Labor Law" and the "Insurance Law." In short, 
the legislation in the above areas is mandatory. Some laws have 
already been drafted, some are under deliberation, and some will 
be made efficiently and in a planned way. 

<H5>    How To Improve the Legal System </H5>
  [Yao] So far, many laws have been promulgated in China but, 
in the course of implementation, cases of "failure to abide by 
the laws in force" have happened. How can this problem be 
solved? 
  [Qiao] The Chinese society stayed in the feudal stage for 
thousands of years, so people's understanding of the legal 
system is still quite weak. Therefore, it takes long-term, 
unremitting efforts to establish a society ruled by law and 
gradually perfect it. We should, through legislation, make 
people realize what they should do and what they are not allowed 
to do; what is lawful and what is unlawful. Alongside 
lawmaking, we should also strengthen the propaganda on law, 
conduct extensive education to spread the knowledge of law, and 
help the people enhance their awareness of the law and 
understanding of the legal system. In the meantime, we should 
energetically strengthen inspection and supervision on the 
enforcement of laws after they are made; supervise the 
enforcement of the Constitution; and see to it that 
administrative, procuratorial, and judicial organs enforce the 
law to the letter. This is the power which the Constitution has 
vested in the NPC Standing Committee. We will, through our 
unremitting efforts, establish the authority of the Constitution 
and laws societywide and firmly redress any phenomenon of 
failing to abide by laws in force, failing to enforce the law to 
the letter, or failing to prosecute law breakers. 
<H5>  Expectations and Requirements on CHING CHI TAO PAO </H5>
  [Yao] Do you have any expectations and requirements 
regarding CHING CHI TAO PAO? 
  [Qiao] The 1990's is an important period for our country to 
achieve national reunification. China will resume sovereignty 
over Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999 respectively. I hope 
that CHING CHI TAO PAO, as a rather influential economic journal 
in Hong Kong, while providing a window to China's economic 
construction, will make an effort to explain the work done by 
the people's congresses at all levels in China and what is going 
on with legislation in China, so that more Hong Kong and Macao 
compatriots, Taiwan compatriots, overseas Chinese, and foreign 
people can see that China will be built into a modern and 
democratic socialist country with a well developed legal system. 
I hope you will continue with your efforts and run the journal 
well, contributing to the cooperation and exchange between the 
mainland and various parties in Hong Kong and Macao.

<F P=106> [Report: "Wang Dan Returns From Xiamen to Beijing, With </F>
Authorities' Tacit Consent"] 
  [Text] Noted pro-democracy activist Wang Dan, who abruptly 
left Beijing on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's 
visit to China, returned to Beijing yesterday. He said he left 
Beijing of his own accord to avoid intensifying the conflict 
between the government and pro-democracy activists. 
  On the other hand, as it is believed that many dissidents 
still are being detained by the Chinese authorities, 
Krzaklewski, leader of Poland's Solidarity trade union, wrote a 
letter to Chinese Premier Li Peng calling on Beijing to release 
them. 
  Wang Dan was interviewed by our staff reporter after 
returning to Beijing with Zhou Duo and Min Qi. Wang said he 
left Beijing because he had learned through relevant channels 
that if he did not leave Beijing at that time, the conflict 
between the government and some pro-democracy activists -- 
including himself -- would likely be intensified. Under the 
strong persuasion of Zhou Duo and other friends, and in order to 
avoid intensifying the conflict, he left Beijing for Xiamen. 
  Wang stressed that the place and means of travel were 
decided 
of his own accord and that his freedom of movement during this 
period was not restricted or interfered with. 
  Meanwhile, Wang corrected news agencies' remarks, saying 
that 
he also returned to Beijing of his own accord. Since he did not 
meet with any obstruction or warnings, he guessed that the 
government had given tacit consent to his move. According to 
news agency reports, after staying in Xiamen for several days, 
Wang Dan returned to Beijing with government approval. 
  In addition, Krzaklewski, leader of Poland's Solidarity 
trade union, wrote a letter to Li Peng, calling for the 
"immediate and unconditional release" of labor and pro-democracy 
activists, such as Wei Jingsheng, Zhou Guoqiang, Qian Yumin, 
Yuan Hongbin, Bao Ge, Wang Jiaqi, and Wang Dan. 
  The letter said, "their prolonged detention constitutes a 
clear violation of International Labor Organization conventions 
protecting the right to set up trade unions." 
  So far, however, China has acknowledged only the arrests of 
Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbin, and Wang Jiaqi for their "violation 
of the criminal law." Yesterday, the whereabouts of Wei 
Jingsheng and others (with the exception of Wang Dan) remained 
unknown.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by group of staff reporters: "Deng Xiaoping Has </F>
Bridge Parties Three or Four Times a Week, Loves To Watch TV 
With Daughter as `Hearing Aid'"] 
  [Text] In the past few days, Deng Rong, Deng Xiaoping's 
youngest daughter who is also a People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
deputy to the National People's Congress, has talked about her 
father on many occasions. According to her latest remarks, 
after returning from Shanghai to Beijing, Deng Xiaoping, 90, is 
"a bit fatter" than before. He still plays bridge three or four 
times a week. He also reads newspapers for over two hours. 
  Deng Rong stressed that Deng Xiaoping need not rely on 
others 
when reading newspapers, neither does he have to use any 
supplemental tools, such as a magnifier. Deng Rong said: "His 
eyes are always very good. He is not myopic and he is 
particularly good when looking at things far away. However, he 
has to wear presbyopic glasses. He has worn glasses for more 
than a decade. My father watches television programs every 
night, but he is not so good in hearing what others say, so we 
have to act as his `hearing aid'." 
  Deng Rong said: My father has a very regular diet and he 
normally will not eat too much or too little. Now, he is also 
concerned about our family's food. If he eats more, he will be 
"praised" by our family members. He is a bit fatter after his 
return to Beijing. In Beijing, he mainly eats cooked wheaten 
food, whereas in Shanghai, he mainly ate rice. 
  When asked about Deng Xiaoping's hobbies, Deng Rong said: 
"My father is fond of playing bridge and he can play three or 
four times a week. He always plays with my sisters, my elder 
brother, and some old bridge partners who have already retired." 
  Summing up her father's secret of longevity, she said that 
apart from leading a regular life, there was also an important 
factor, that is, "he is particularly sanguine and is always 
cheerful." She said: "Someone described him as taking serious 
things lightly. Without this characteristic, it would have been 
very difficult to get over the decade of the Cultural 
Revolution." Deng Rong, who claimed to stay with her father 
everyday, said that she did not sense any change in her father's 
health and that she always felt that her father was very 
healthy. She said: The most important point is that he is 
healthy, and right now, he does not catch any disease." 
  When asked about her progress in writing the second part of 
her book, My Father, Deng Xiaoping, she said that the 
table of contents had been fixed. She did not agree that it 
must be more difficult to write the second part than the first 
part "because I am writing about my father from a daughter's 
viewpoint."

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping is being looked after by a 
large medical team, including a group of about 20 consultants 
and specialists well versed in Western and Chinese medicine. 
  Chinese sources said yesterday that, while the 89-year-old 
senior leader had no life threatening diseases, he was too weak 
to attend the NPC. This is despite the fact he was elected a 
member of the NPC presidium last week. The sources said the 
patriarch, who was "exhausted" after a two-month sojourn in the 
Shanghai area would likely spend the spring recovering. 
  An informed source said Mr Deng was being looked after by a 
medical team on a 24-hour basis and doctors in the team could at 
any time call upon the expert advice of another group of 
consultants and specialists. 
  The Chinese media, however, is anxious to allay widespread 
fears about Mr Deng's health, caused by the fact that he looked 
sick during his television appearance in Shanghai on the eve of 
Lunar New Year. Most national newspapers gave prominent 
treatment on Tuesday to remarks by the two Deng daughters, Deng 
Nan and Deng Rong, that their father was in "excellent health." 
The same stories were repeated in yesterday's edition of the 
Guangming Daily, which is read by most intellectuals in the 
country. Ms Deng Rong, also Mr Deng's private secretary, told 
the paper her father was in good health. "The most important 
thing is that he is not sick, he doesn't have any illness, he 
doesn't even catch colds from other members of the family," Ms 
Deng said. She said Mr Deng played bridge three or four times a 
week with family members and other retirees, and spent two hours 
daily reading more than 10 newspapers. 
  Analysts said, however, that Ms Deng had used similar 
phrases 
to describe the state of Mr Deng's health many times. They 
pointed out that the fact a few Deng offspring had kept to their 
regular travelling schedules showed Mr Deng's life was not in 
imminent danger.

<F P=106> [By Wang Chuanzhen (3769 0278 4176): "Yang Shangkun Comes </F>
to Guangdong on an Inspection Tour"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 9 Mar (XINHUA)--While in Guangdong on an 
inspection not long ago, Yang Shangkun said that he hoped 
Guangdong people would continue to keep up their style of hard 
struggle and playing a leading role and serving as the driving 
force in reform and opening China to the outside world. 
  Around the Spring Festival, accompanied by Xie Fei, a member 
of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of 
the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Huang Huahua, deputy 
secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, Yang 
Shangkun travelled to Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, and Foshan on 
an inspection tour, visiting the Shekou Industrial Zone, the 
Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, a 
construction site in western Zhuhai, large state enterprises, 
and Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises. During the tour, he 
listened to reports by local party and government leaders on 
completed work and the situation and had cordial conversations 
with cadres and other people. Yang Shangkun praised Guangdong 
for the changes it had brought about every year, saying that 
every year sees bigger changes in Guangdong. 
  In the late 1970's, Yang Shangkun held a leading position in 
Guangdong. He said: "At that time, the central authorities 
decided to set up special economic zones in Guangdong and 
introduce special policies to encourage businessmen from many 
countries to invest in Guangdong or to cooperate with China in 
economic development, thus effecting an earth-shaking change. 
Facts have proven that the principle and the policies of reform 
and opening up are entirely correct." 
  Yang pointed out: "The state will promulgate many major 
reform measures involving many fields this year. As we are 
pressed for time and have arduous tasks to attend to, we must 
take care to study new problems, overcome new difficulties, sum 
up new experience, and do our work more energetically and in a 
more prudent and better way." He hoped Guangdong will strive 
for greater successes in economic development. 
  During the inspection tour, Yang Shangkun especially praised 
Guangdong for training a large number of competent cadres. He 
said: "A number of cadres, especially the entrepreneurs I have 
met here, are very competent and very young, with some of them 
only a little over 30. This indicates that there is no lack of 
successors to carry on our cause. They are where our hopes lie." 
  Yang's stay in Guangdong coincided with the tenth founding 
anniversary of the Guangzhou Economic and Technological 
Development Zone, so he went there to visit and to listen to a 
work report. Over the last 10 years, the zone has spent 4.35 
billion yuan on capital construction, introduced foreign capital 
of $790 million, and set up 195 industrial enterprises, whose 
total output value is 11.5 billion yuan, total export value is 
$1.17 billion, and profits of 3.2 billion yuan with tax 
delivered to the state amounting to 900 million yuan. Yang 
praised the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development 
Zone for its high-speed construction. He said that it is 
necessary to launch more support projects related to water and 
electricity supplies, transport, and the production of raw and 
semi-finished materials, adding that in introducing advanced 
technologies and equipment, efforts should be made to raise the 
level of localizing imported equipment to build up greater power 
for sustained economic development. 
  While in Guangzhou, Yang climbed to the 63d story of the 
Guangdong International Hotel, the tallest building in China, to 
enjoy a full view of Guangzhou. Catching sight of many tall 
buildings standing in great numbers and the incessant stream of 
vehicles in the streets, which shows Guangzhou has initially 
developed into a modern city, he said happily that the scene on 
this side was unique. He hoped that Guangzhou would be built 
into a more beautiful and modern city. 
  During the tour, Yang also visited the Shenzhen Anke 
Company, 
the Huawei Company, the Guangzhou Baoyuan Limited Company, the 
Guangdong Fotao Group, Guangxin Jiangwan Stock marketing 
department, and other high-tech and financial enterprises and 
wrote inscriptions of encouragement.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Years spent toiling for a powerless committee of a 
powerless body of the Chinese government can wear down even the 
most intrepid spirit. To the point where, during the annual 
exercise in democratic window-dressing known as the meeting of 
the National People's Congress (NPC), such a committee worker 
might mumble to a foreign journalist he saw taking notes at a 
meeting of provincial delegates: "I'd like to talk to you. I 
could tell you about all sorts of things you don't understand." 
  For more than 20 years, a man we shall call Wang has worked 
on the staff of one section of the NPC's education, science, 
culture and public health committee. Working in a dingy 
Soviet-style building only a stone's throw from the real centre 
of power--the party's national headquarters at Zhongnanhai--Wang 
has pushed paper on everything from religious organisations to 
teachers' salaries. Paid a monthly salary of 210 renminbi 
(HK$185), Wang is one of those responsible for ensuring that 
members of the NPC's Standing Committee, which does most of the 
real legislative rubber-stamping, receive background information 
on certain categories of laws handed down from the State 
Council, to be passed without delay. 
  Wang harbours no illusions about his country's political 
system. "There is a small group of leaders who basically have no 
need to listen to the people," he said. "We still have not 
overcome the power of emperors." 
  Meeting with foreign journalists, for Wang, is not easy. 
Sequestered in a distant hotel with delegates from three 
provinces, he must make up an excuse late one night in order to 
be excused from the mass movie outing organised to keep the 
docile delegates entertained. But in the safety of a hotel 
where no delegations are staying, Wang gives vent to many years 
of frustration. 
  "As long as I've been here, they've been talking about 
raising the influence of the NPC. But nothing has happened," he 
said. "During this meeting, for example, the delegates should be 
amending the work reports in many different ways but, in fact, 
they're just here to study documents. All they do is study the 
documents." 
  Asked about the views of the committee chairman, Zhao 
Dongwan, a former minister of personnel, Wang seems bemused: 
"It doesn't matter. He would never dare to say anything which 
goes against unanimity. Nothing ever goes against the critical 
need for unanimity with the party. The NPC has never disagreed 
with the party. Do you understand?" But despite the congress's 
long tradition of obedience, the party often does not even 
bother to obtain its concurrence, he said. 
  Like many closet democrats in China, Wang has written a book 
about democracy. Published in 1988, his book went through a 
first printing by a semi-private publisher before the company 
was shut down in 1989 for publishing books that had not been 
approved. "I don't even think about it anymore. Now, I'm more 
interested in other topics like the place of religion in China," 
he said. "That's an area which still has some hope."

<F P=106> [By Gong Xinwen (7895 6580 2429): "Public Security Minister </F>
Tao Siju Signs Order To Begin Implementation of the `Regulations 
on Patrols by the Urban People's Police'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Public Security 
Minister Tao Siju signed and issued an order to begin formal 
implementation of the "Regulations on Patrols by the Urban 
People's Police" (hereinafter the Regulations). 
  The patrol officer's duties and competence, activities while 
on the beat, and discipline are clearly defined by the 
Regulations so that the patrolling officers can be on the beat 
and perform their duties according to law and subject themselves 
to mass surveillance. 
  Duties which the people's police should perform while on the 
beat are defined by the Regulations, such as maintaining public 
order within their jurisdiction, forestalling and stopping 
violations of public order, cordoning off scenes of public order 
emergencies, dispersing the masses and maintaining order, taking 
part in dealing with illegal rallies, marches, and protests, 
taking part in handling disasters and accidents, maintaining 
order, and rescuing people and property. They are to maintain 
traffic order, stop practices which hinder state functionaries 
from performing their duties according to law, receive citizens 
who report cases, mediate disputes between people in public 
places, stop troubles caused by mental patients and drunkards, 
help pedestrians who ask for directions, aid people who badly 
need assistance, such as those who sustain injuries, who are 
sick, and who are in distress, and help the handicapped, the 
aged, and children who are confronted with problems. Officers 
should accept and handle lost articles and try by every means to 
return them to their owners or send them to departments in 
charge of lost property, patrol their jurisdiction to ensure 
safety and brief relevant units and residents along the road on 
removing hidden perils, inspect discipline of the people's 
police, and fulfill other missions prescribed by laws and 
regulations. 
  As stated in the regulations, the people's police can also 
exercise the following authority according to law: They can 
interrogate people suspected of perpetrating crimes and inspect 
vehicles and articles involved; check residents' identity cards; 
detain or take other coercive measures against criminals caught 
in, before, or immediately after their acts, people suspected of 
perpetrating major crimes, or offenders at large; check 
violations of road traffic management; punish people who violate 
public order management according to the PRC Regulations on 
Punishment of Violations of Public Order Management; and enjoy 
priority, after showing their credentials, in using means of 
transport and communication belonging to organs, groups, 
enterprises, institutions, and individual citizens in such 
situations as pursuing and capturing criminals, rescuing people, 
and dealing with emergencies. They should promptly return those 
means of transport and communication to their owners and pay 
appropriate charges. They should also exercise other duties and 
powers prescribed by laws and regulations. 
  As urged by the Regulations, the people's police must 
fulfill 
the following tasks when they are on the beat: They must wear 
police uniforms, with armed belts, and carrying firearms, police 
weapons, and means of communication; scrupulously fulfill their 
duties and abide by laws and disciplines; strictly enforce the 
law and impartially handle matters; never overstep or abuse 
their authority; and have a decent manner, performing their 
patrol duties in a civilized way, and treating others politely. 
  As stated by the regulations, the people's police on beat 
should be subject to mass surveillance, and citizens have the 
right to lodge complaints and inform against the people's police 
once discovering that certain policemen have violated laws and 
discipline.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let's Hope That Qian's For Real"] </F>
  [Text] Are we clutching at straws or has China's foreign 
minister, Qian Qichen, given reason for hope? The question 
arises following his remarks yesterday when he seemed to be 
saying that the breakdown of Sino-British talks on political 
reform did not mean a termination of discussion on economic 
matters. We would be churlish not to acknowledge the minister's 
statement because, when the talks finally collapsed, EASTERN 
EXPRESS was of the view that China had a historic opportunity to 
seize victory from the jaws of defeat by publicly stating that a 
lack of progress on the political front did not have to mean the 
end of cooperation on economic matters. 
  The only reason we are guarded in offering a welcome to 
Qian's statement is that Chinese officials are forever issuing 
contradictory statements. One minute there are dire warnings of 
the impact on economic matters should Britain and China fail to 
resolve political matters. Then, but less often, come 
statements, like that issued yesterday, which present a very 
different view. 
  If we were totally cynical, we would say that the hard and 
soft approach is a matter of deliberate policy, designed to keep 
Britain and Hong Kong people guessing about China's real 
intentions. We suspect that this is not the case. It is far 
more likely that the discrepancies in these statements reflect 
the lack of coordination among China's Hong Kong policy makers. 
  Indeed, all current policymaking in China is rather 
confused, 
as the vultures gather in anticipation of the demise of 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. No one wants to stick their 
neck out too far, no one is confident enough to take the 
initiative for a new policy, and no one wants to be seen taking 
a line which contradicts, or even appears to contradict, the 
Gospel according to Deng. 
  All this notwithstanding it is easy to see how China's best 
interests are served by furthering economic cooperation. 
Britain will be long gone by the time the benefits of major 
projects such as the airport are realised. Yet we should never 
underestimate the extent to which political considerations can 
override logical thinking, especially when it comes to China's 
policy towards Hong Kong. The baggage of history weighs heavy. 
  The humiliation of losing a part of the motherland and, 
worse 
still, failing to recover it, festers. Any suggestion that 
China should have something less than full sovereignty over its 
restored domain is met with an aggrieved response. 
  In reality China's sovereign rights are not in question. Nor 
is anyone seriously arguing that the Chinese Government does not 
have the right to bring Hong Kong back to the fold. It is the 
process by which the return to Chinese rule is achieved which is 
causing the problems. 
  Whatever the disagreements between China and Britain, and 
the 
perhaps more profound differences between many Hong Kong people 
and the Chinese Government, there is no reason to leave the 
future of the territory in a state of suspension. It is 
downright irresponsible to play cat and mouse with issues of 
economic confidence. 
  China says it is forced into this posture by Britain. Maybe 
so, but even if this is the case, why do China's leaders feel 
obliged to behave in precisely the manner in which Britain is 
accused of behaving? If Qian Qichen's remarks represent a move 
towards a more consistent and constructive policy towards Hong 
Kong's economic affairs, they are to be welcomed with open arms. 
He is, after all, supposed to be supervising the work of the 
Preparatory Working Committee and his ministry has prime 
responsibility for dealing with Britain in negotiations over 
Hong Kong. 
  Let us hope this moment of optimism is not a prelude to what 
that old Russian Communist V. I. Lenin used to describe as 
another round of two steps backwards and one step forwards.

Ztu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "Voices From the Political Bureau 
and State Council"] 
  [Text] Voices stressing unity within the party have been 
pouring out from Zhongnanhai recently. 
  Previously, there was a common understanding in society; 
that 
is, whenever the CPC propagated unity within the party on a 
grand scale, it meant that there were problems concerning the 
issue of unity. 
  Today the CPC is behaving more honestly and has refrained 
from saying a lot of high-sounding words. In stressing the 
necessity of unity, instead of using the tune of propaganda, it 
admitted the existence of differences and disputes. 
  The issue of unity within the party's Central Committee is 
very serious as well. Deng Xiaoping recently talked about this 
issue, which reflected that organizational crises also exist in 
the party and government organs, including the Political Bureau, 
the State Council, and so on. 
<H3>  Jiang Zemin Relayed Deng's Remarks on Unity Within the Party 
to Senior Officials </H3>
  The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an 
enlarged meeting, the first in 1994, in Zhongnanhai on 20 and 21 
January. Present at the meeting were members and alternate 
members of the Political Bureau, secretaries of the Central 
Secretariat, members of the Central Military Commission, state 
councillors, some vice chairmen of the National People's 
Congress [NPC] Standing Committee and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference National Committee, and some 
persons in charge of central departments and commissions. At 
the meeting, Jiang Zemin transmitted to the participants remarks 
that Deng Xiaoping recently made on the issue of unity while in 
Shanghai. He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying: "At present, both 
the domestic and international situations are favorable to us. 
The question is how we can further emancipate our minds and 
tightly seize and treasure the current rare historical 
opportunity to push forward reform, tackle the difficult 
problems in the course of reform, and maintain sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic growth with a view to achieving the 
second-step strategic objectives of the national economy and 
social development. I repeat: The crux now lies in the unity 
of the central leading body. It should be a genuine unity aimed 
at a common goal. Unity is necessary for the Political Bureau, 
the State Council, the NPC Standing Committee, and between the 
State Council and the NPC Standing Committee." 
  Deng also said: "The Communists must always place the party 
character and the cause of the party and people in the primary 
position. Review and examination on this issue should be 
conducted frequently. If the issue of unity is properly 
resolved, what difficulties cannot be surmounted? What problems 
cannot be tackled? The political intervention and economic 
sanction of the hegemonism and the subversion of the 
antagonistic forces will be totally defeated by us." 
  Deng Xiaoping's remarks are clearly aimed at something. He 
said in early October last year: "Unity is necessary within the 
central leading body. Members of the leading body should not 
think that they are always right and therefore refuse to accept 
others' merits. Many problems have cropped up because some of 
them do not pay serious attention to party character and the 
sense of responsibility for our cause so that they have not been 
able to forge a solid unity." 
<H3>  Contradictions Escalated After the New Body of the State 
Council Was Formed </H3>
  At the beginning of last December, the Political Bureau made 
a decision that Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi, with the coordination 
of Wan Li, Bo Yibo, Yang Dezhi, and Gu Mu, should have talks and 
exchange views with Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Li Lanqing of 
the State Council and some vice chairmen of the NPC Standing 
Committee, including Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Wang Bingqian, Li 
Ximing, Chen Muhua, and so on. These people are the leading 
stars who have been contending with one another to play their 
roles in the farces. 
  Since the conclusion of the 14th CPC National Congress held 
in November 1992, tension has surfaced in the new CPC Political 
Bureau and Secretariat. In April 1993, the contradictions 
escalated in the wake of the formation of new leading bodies of 
the State Council and the NPC Standing Committee. They are 
reflected in the relations between Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and 
Li Lanqing; between Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, and Wang Bingqian; 
between Tian Jiyun and Zou Jiahua; between Li Lanqing, Wang 
Bingqian, and Chen Muhua; between Wang Bingqian and Chen Muhua; 
between Ding Guangen and Wei Jianxing; between Li Tieying, Wang 
Hanbin, and Ren Jianxin; and between Tian Jiyun and Chen Xitong. 
At meetings, they took advantage of discussions on work and 
policies to criticize and attack one another. The most 
prominent instances were the attack on Tian Jiyun from all sides 
and the censure against Zhu Rongji. 

<H3>    Zou Jiahua Indirectly Criticized Tian Jiyun for Lacking 
Party Character </H3>
  At a group meeting during the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, Zou Jiahua said: Quite a few tasks 
have not been performed on schedule. In many cases, it is 
because the relevant legislation has not been enacted, but in 
some there were man-made reasons. Some people have talked about 
the legal system more glibly than others, but what did they do 
in reality? When the people who are responsible for economic 
work in the NPC Standing Committee went to the grass-roots 
units, they often made unrealistic comments as well as open and 
groundless criticism against other comrades instead of 
conducting investigation and study or holding discussions with 
the relevant departments of the State Council and the 
localities. As members of the Political Bureau, do these kinds 
of actions demonstrate their party character? Have they not had 
an impact on others? Did they ask the Political Bureau and the 
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee for instructions before 
making such comments? Here, Zou Jiahua referred to Tian Jiyun's 
speech made during his inspection in Hunan Province, which, in 
Zou's opinion, "had gone a bit too far." 
<H3>  Wang Hanbin and Others Reported Tian Jiyun to the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection </H3>
  Last October, Wang Hanbin, Wang Bingqian, Li Ximing, and Ni 
Zhifu, among other people, reported to the Central Commission 
for Discipline Inspection that Tian Jiyun attacked other 
Politburo members by innuendo when talking with some members of 
the NPC Standing Committee in the name of Jiang Zemin and Qiao 
Shi, that Tian received remuneration for writing inscriptions 
four times without reporting the matter to the leadership, that 
Tian's family was engaged in speculative stock activities in 
Shanghai and Shenzhen, that Tian found an excuse to travel in 
Europe with a certain delegation using public funds, and so on. 
  Later, approximately 20 state councillors, ministers, and 
members of the NPC Standing Committee jointly wrote a letter to 
Jiang Zemin and Deng Xiaoping, saying that Tian Jiyun spread 
rumors among the cadres in various ministries and commissions to 
this effect: He is a target to be squeezed out, he has been 
assigned the position on a temporary basis, and the rising stars 
in the political arena are Zhu Rongji, Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, and 
Zhang Wannian. 
  Deng Xiaoping gave his written instruction to the effect 
that, if people had different opinions, it would be better for 
them to sit down and exchange their views. Will Jiang Zemin, 
Qiao Shi, and Hu Jintao have a talk with Wang (Hanbin), Zou 
(Jiahua), and Tian (Jiyun)? 
  A source said that Zou Jiahua, Li Lanqing, Tian Jiyun, Wang 
Hanbin, and others often wrangled at Politburo meetings, and 
many times Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, Chen Xitong, Zou Jiahua, Li 
Lanqing, and so on left ahead of time during the debates at the 
Politburo and State Council meetings. 
<H5>  Li Lanqing Attacked Zhu Rongji Without Mentioning Him by Name </H5>
  At a group meeting of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, Li Lanqing assaulted Zhu Rongji without 
mentioning him by name. Li said: Even though I am a vice 
premier, I am not very clear about some of the views that the 
State Council maintains. However, there was such a comrade who 
issued directives and made decisions the moment he took up his 
post, and on what grounds did he act like that? I should like 
to ask whether he did so after collective discussions. We still 
need principles in giving guidance to the economic work. At 
present, central regulation and control at the macro level has 
had a certain effect, but the problems have not been 
fundamentally resolved. How can we say that the desired result 
has been basically produced? The central authorities do not 
hold such a view, and no resolution on this has been made. Li 
Lanqing's above remarks were directed against what Zhu Rongji 
and Guangdong's leaders had said earlier. 
  The discord within the Political Bureau and State Council 
naturally has shocked Deng Xiaoping. Deng asked the general 
secretary to act as a mediator, and other CPC elders also made 
their positions known one after another upon being informed of 
the above situation, hoping that they would turn big problems 
into small ones and small ones into nothing. Wan Li and Yang 
Shangkun have aired their opinions in this connection. 
<H3>  Wan Li and Yang Shangkun Aired Their Opinions on the Discord 
Among the Senior CPC Officials </H3>
  When talking with some Politburo members, state councillors, 
and vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee in early 
December last year, Wan Li pointed out: In my opinion, the fact 
that senior officials within the party are on bad terms owing to 
different views primarily originates from individualism, whereby 
some people drew over others to attack and criticize a certain 
person at meetings, and went on to engage in a cross attack by 
writing joint letters after the meetings. By so doing, they 
have concentrated their energies on the evil affairs and, as 
things go on, they will be engaging in sectarianism. This is 
very dangerous and has seriously damaged the authority of the 
central leadership. 
  During his meeting with a group of former members of the 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection coming to spend 
their holidays in Zhuhai at the Zhuhai Hotel on 22 January, Yang 
Shangkun said: The central authorities should resolve the issue 
of unity in order to maintain the authority of the central 
leadership. Only by so doing can the party's line be 
comprehensively and actually put into practice. 
  According to an informed source, Wan Li's view that the 
internal conflicts within the party "will develop into 
sectarianism" was not overstated. Conversely, he did not say it 
bluntly. As a matter of fact, sectarianism has existed because 
there are a number of people in the Political Bureau and State 
Council who want to elbow out Tian Jiyun and attack Zhu Rongji. 
Of course, this is a comparatively outstanding aspect of the 
contradictions and not the whole of them. 
  It is no wonder that Deng Xiaoping is very anxious about the 
issue of unity within the party Central Committee. If a solid 
unity cannot be forged or the contradictions further develop 
when the old man passes away, can he prevent and stop the 
outbreak of "disturbances" or "drastic changes" from the nether 
world?

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on crime, investigations, trials, sentencings, and other 
judicial-related activities in the PRC during the period 1-14 
March 1994. The source and mode of processing are given in 
parentheses at the end of each entry. Certain reports deemed 
more significant may have been filed separately, in which case 
the summary will include the serial number of the separately 
filed item. 
  As evidenced by the stories listed below, during the month 
PRC crime reportage focused on no single issue. 
<H6>  INTERNATIONAL </H6>
  Since the normalization of relations between China and 
Vietnam, border trade has developed very rapidly, while criminal 
activities, including gun- and drug-smuggling, have also 
increased. Since June last year, Guangxi frontier guards, in 
152 cases, have seized 1,463 firearms, 7,179 bullets, 418 
grenades, 69.037 kg of opium and 7.099 kg of heroin, and smashed 
49 criminal rings involving 239 persons. Ding Tingmu, executive 
deputy secretary of the regional party committee, said that the 
fight facing the region was arduous since there was a land and 
sea border of over 2,000 km. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN

  Two fishermen carried 6 million yuan in forged notes, 
printed 
with a 1980 plate and with a face value of 100 yuan each, from 
Keelung Port, anchoring on 8 March at an anchoring point for 
Taiwan vessels in Putian's Wenjia Port, using the excuse of 
sheltering from a typhoon. On 9 March, officers and men of the 
Putian Frontier Detachment under the Fujian Provincial Armed 
Police Frontier Headquarters discovered four paper cartons on 
the deck containing the forged notes. The Taiwan fishing boat 
involved was detained and the two fishermen were also detained 
for trial. This is the first major forged Renminbi case cracked 
by the frontier guards of the public security departments this 
year. (Summary) (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 0830

<H6>  CENTRAL </H6>
  The Ministry of Public Security says 1.21 million criminal 
cases were cracked in 1993, of which 370,000 were serious and 
important, with detection rates rising 6.8 and 3 percent 
respectively compared with 1992. Cash and goods worth 3.95 
billion yuan were recovered. 
  The ministry launched a series of campaigns against train 
robbers and highwaymen, criminal gangs, criminals involved in 
abducting and selling women and children, drug and firearms 
traffickers, economic criminals, smugglers and snakeheads 
(traffickers in illegal emigrants), and those engaged in 
transnational and transregional crime. In 1993, 21,000 "train 
and highway banditry" cases and a number of cases of abducting 
and selling women and children were solved. Some 4,000 kg of 
heroin and 3,000 kg of opium were seized in 14,000 cases, and a 
number of criminal gangs were broken up. A number of criminals 
involved in transnational and transregional crime were 
prosecuted, and 20 felons from foreign countries or from outside 
the borders were extradited. 
  The ministry has urged cracking down on murderers, robbers, 
thieves, and organized crime, and truly maintaining social 
security and stability, thus creating a more favorable social 
environment for reform and economic construction. (Summary)

  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce says some 
159,750 economic cases were dealt with last year, with 29,942 of 
them, or 18.74 percent, described as big and serious. Twenty 
provinces have seen a rise in the number of big economic crimes, 
with such cases in Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Yunnan 
increasing by 300 percent. Fines imposed for such crimes in 
each of Shandong, Guangdong and Fujian amounted to more than 100 
million yuan. 
  Economic crimes in state-owned and in collectively owned 
units increased by 13.93 percent and 5.75 percent respectively, 
with the number of big cases in these units making up 62.57 
percent of all big cases. Most of such cases involved smuggling 
and counterfeiting and production of low-quality products. A 
case involving illegal stock dealing was discovered in Shanghai 
late last year and 72 cases of underground foreign exchange 
speculation were dealt with in Shenzhen, with fines totaling 
more than 2 million yuan. 
  The number of such cases increased to a great extent in the 
northern coastal regions, but decreased in the southern coastal 
regions, with Fujian seeing a decrease of 50 percent. The 
number of big cases, however, increased by 92.7 percent, with 
greater fines. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in English

  Hunan 
  Zhan Shunchu, president of the Hunan Higher People's Court, 
said recently that in a drive launched in the middle of last 
October, the courts have sentenced 8,078 criminal offenders, of 
whom 2,873 were sentenced to five years or more imprisonment and 
587 local ruffians and despots were sentenced to life 
imprisonment or death, thus offering a fine social order. 
  In view of the large numbers of murder and injury cases, 
repeated occurrences of waylaying by highwaymen and waterway 
gangsters, and increasing numbers of cases of disruption of 
agricultural production and the peasants' livelihood, Hunan 
party committee and government decided on a province-wide battle 
to improve social order in the rural areas. The attack is 
focused on hooliganism, robbery, murder, deliberate injury, 
rape, and abduction of women and children; sabotaging production 
and stealing communications equipment, farmland and irrigation 
facilities, and property of the state, collectives, and 
individuals; inciting fighting between clans and creating 
trouble among the masses; beating and retaliating against 
basic-level cadres, officers of the political and legal organs, 
and law enforcement personnel; illegal possession of rifles and 
smuggling and selling ammunition; and other serious crimes, 
which gravely harm social order. From 20 to 31 January this 
year, 14 prefectural and city courts throughout the province 
held 137 rallies to sentence more than 2,700 criminal offenders 
according to law. (Summary) (Beijing FAZHI RIBAO in Chinese 28

Inner Mongolia 
  The Tuoketuo Public Security Bureau in Hohot, Inner 
Mongolia, 
recently smashed a major human smuggling ring. By the end of 
January 59 suspects had been detained, of whom 22 were arrested. 
  Li Daichun and Li Dailin, natives of Sichuan's Fengxi 
County, 
are the principal offenders. With Li Dailin's wife Huang Yan, 
Li's sister-in-law Xie Suqing, and 11 others, in the name of 
recruiting people, they abducted more than 200 women from 
Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou to Inner Mongolia and sold them to 
human smugglers there for over 800,000 yuan. When the first 
trader of the ring found some women, he contacted the local 
smuggler. After the women were escorted to Inner Mongolia, they 
were sold at a low price to the second trader, who would 
transfer them elsewhere by truck and sell them to third and 
fourth traders. 
  The Tuoketuo Public Security Bureau has arrested 245 human 
smugglers since 1989 and saved more than 160 victims. (Summary)

"Public Security in China: 1993-1994 -- Interview With Public 
Security Vice Minister Tian Qiyu (3944 2601 3768)"] 
  [Text] In 1994, reform and opening-up and the Chinese 
mainland's modernization program have entered a year of crucial 
importance. The Chinese Government will introduce a number of 
major reform measures in the systems of fiscal charges, banking, 
planning, and investments, which will inevitably promote the 
overall progress of Chinese society, but will also bring up new 
problems in public security work in China. A TZU CHING magazine 
correspondent recently had a special interview with Chinese 
Public Security Vice Minister Tian Qiyu and asked him to 
elaborate on how to strike more forceful blows against serious 
criminal offenses, how to strengthen security control, promote 
public security structural reform and strengthen the public 
security contingent itself, and how to build closer cooperation 
between the police forces of the Chinese mainland and of Hong 
Kong. 
<H3>  I. Jiang Zemin Seriously Puts Forward Requirements on 
Various Localities </H3>
  Taken as a whole, the present public security situation in 
China is normal, and this plays the role of guarantor for reform 
and opening-up and developing the economy. However, criminal 
cases are still on the rise, and especially prominent are major 
and malevolent cases. There are, indeed, some places where the 
public security situation is not good, with criminals running 
wild and the masses lacking a sense of security. Serious 
criminal activities have been one of society's hot spots in 
recent years. 
  Discussing this problem, Tian Qiyu told the correspondent 
that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to 
fighting criminal activities, which the masses hate bitterly, 
and once again have asked law enforcement departments at various 
levels to increase the strength of their attack. General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin of the CPC Central Committee recently 
asked major party and government leaders and departments of 
political science and law of various provinces, municipalities, 
and autonomous regions to seriously study the problem of 
increasing criminal offenses, asked them to study the law, take 
measures, and do their utmost to contain the momentum of 
increasing criminal activities. 
<H3>  II. Constantly Increase the Strength of Blows Against 
Criminal Offenses </H3>
  Public security organizations at various levels have 
attached 
great importance in recent years to fighting serious criminal 
activities, and constantly increased the strength of their 
attack against them. Last year, aiming at criminal activities, 
they organized and developed extensive and varied modes of 
attack, rectification, and control. From January to November, 
public security organizations throughout China cracked over 1.04 
million criminal cases, seized illicit money and stolen goods 
equivalent to 4.08 billion yuan, and captured 3,950.82 kg of 
heroin. In striking blows against various criminal activities, 
the public security departments resolutely upheld the dignity of 
law, laid stress on strict enforcement of law, punished 
criminals severely and quickly according to law, and 
successfully investigated and handled a number of major criminal 
cases and economic cases of great impact. 
  For example: The Yu Zuomin case of Da Qiu County, Tianjin; 
the Beijing-Moscow No. 3/4 international train case which 
involved criminal gangs from the eastern region of Russia; the 
especially big theft of cultural relics in Kaifeng County, Henan 
Province; and the case of the $10 billion [figure as published] 
spare credit card of the Hengshui District Central Sub-Branch of 
the Hebei Agricultural Bank, retrieved huge economic losses for 
the state. 
  After reviewing the work against criminal offenses in 1993, 
Tian Qiyu said that in 1994, with "cracking major cases, 
striking blows at gangs, and pursuing escaped criminals" as the 
focus, and suiting measures to local conditions, we should 
struggle to achieve special purposes, and carry out 
rectification and control over crucial cases. In places where 
security problems are prominent, we should organize centralized 
and unified city-wide, county-wide, or even larger operations 
and seriously battle murder, robbery, theft, and organized 
crimes. We will continue to challenge bandits and despots along 
railway communications lines. 1994 is a year of crucial 
importance in the work of seizing firearms and narcotics in 
Yunnan, Guanxi, and other southwest frontier areas, and we 
should spare no effort. The objective is to block firearms and 
narcotics at the borders and prevent them from coming into the 
interior. We should struggle unremittingly against smuggling 
and illegal emigration in various provinces, cities, and 
autonomous regions along the coast, exploit victories, and 
strictly guard against setbacks. Various localities should 
strike severe blows at the vicious forces of hooligans in towns 
and townships. We should maintain sharp vigilance against the 
infiltration of triads from outside China, must never allow them 
to set up organizations and recruit members inside China, and 
will resolutely fight their criminal activities inside China. 
Moreover, aimed at the increase in major economic and fraud 
cases, we should step up work to ensure that state and 
collective property is not lost, or less is lost. 
  Public security organizations at various levels should 
carry out reform and step up criminal investigation work, 
increase strength, increase input, improve equipment, step up 
the building of basic vocational work, and combine modern 
advanced instruments with the initiatives of the broad masses of 
cadres and policemen in detecting and solving cases. 
  Presently, it is necessary to emphasize increasing the 
number 
solved cases, especially major cases; emphasize the work of 
prosecuting cases after solving them; raising the efficiency of 
handling cases; emphasize strict law enforcement and make full 
use of all available legal weapons; punish severely and quickly 
serious criminal elements according to law; and resolutely 
overcome the problems of imposing a financial penalty instead of 
imprisonment, bending the law for the benefit of relatives or 
friends, and lowering the standard of punishment. 
<H3>  III. Improve the Legal System, and Strengthen Security 
Control </H3>
  Relevant data shows that public security departments are 
actively creating relevant laws and regulations. Last year, the 
"Announcement on the Prohibition of Using Military Firearms for 
Business Shooting Activities," the "Announcement on Striking 
Severe Blows at the Criminal Activities of Theft, Sabotaging 
Railways, Oil- Fields, Electric Power Plants, and Communication 
Equipment," and the "Methods of Taking In and Educating 
Prostitutes and Persons Visiting Prostitutes" and other laws and 
regulations were submitted to the State Council for release. 
Public security organizations in various localities also 
promulgated quite a number of local control laws and regulations 
and strengthened various public security control positions 
according to law. 
  Tian Qiyu believed that this year, with rapid development of 
the economy as a whole and the upgrading of marketization, the 
growth of various markets will quicken, tertiary industry will 
further develop, and a great deal of insecurity will continue to 
exist in production and operations. Therefore, public security 
control and safety precautions will be needed for new situations 
and problems. At present, it is important to strengthen social 
security comprehensive control. 
  Relevant regulations of the State Council and the Ministry 
of 
Public Security should be strictly carried out, and security 
control, traffic control, fire control, entry and exit control, 
and other spheres should be strengthened. Problems driven by 
economic interests should be resolutely put right, and public 
security personnel taking part -- directly or indirectly -- in 
the operations of trades under their control by use of powers or 
authority should be strictly prohibited. 
  We should step up the building of local police offices, 
especially those in the rural areas, build up sound public 
security organizations at basic levels, and pay attention to 
bringing their role into play. This year the floating 
population will continue to increase, and management of these 
people will be one of our emphases. We should actively study 
ways to manage the floating population. The contingents who 
protect and control the masses have played an important role in 
safeguarding public security, and we should continue rectifying, 
consolidating, and strengthening them, and actively develop 
"safety small district" activities, and popularize people's 
defense, material defense, and technology defense measures. We 
should educate and help those who have been released after 
serving sentences or have been relieved of education through 
labor, and step up the control of key people. It is necessary 
to actively explore new approaches to strengthening enterprise 
security work under the new situation. Locality, railway, 
communications, civil aviation, forestry, and public security 
organizations should coordinate closely with each other, 
strengthen security in railway stations, wharves, airports, and 
forests, and should develop centralized rectification and 
control in places where problems stand out sharply. In short, 
we should increase efforts to wipe out evil social phenomena, 
and make sure we achieve actual results. 

<H5>    IV. Carry Out Public Security Structural Reform </H5>
  On this subject, Tian Qiyu declared that public security 
work 
must also constantly enhance the strength of reform under new 
situations and conditions. Building up the people's police 
patrol system in cities is a major reform of public security 
work which meets the new situation of reform and opening-up and 
economic development. In June 1993, the Ministry of Public 
Security called the "All-China Working Conference of People's 
Police Patrol in Cities," and developed, on a preliminary basis, 
the work of the people's police patrol in a number of cities. 
Shanghai, Tianjin, and some other cities started work on an 
institutional, standardized, and systematic basis. The rapid 
development of this work enabled public security organs in large 
and medium-sized cities to greatly enhance their control of 
social order, and to frighten criminals, which prevented crimes 
and built close relations between the police and the people. In 
1994 the Ministry of Public Security demanded that various 
localities should consolidate and strengthen this job in terms 
of hardware and software. 
  According to the requirement of the State Council, the 
Ministry of Public Security last year set up a working group in 
charge of organizational reform, and public security departments 
and bureaus of the great majority of provinces, regions, and 
cities also did a great deal of exploratory work. Through 
repeated study and by pooling the wisdom of the masses, the 
organizational reform plan of county-level public security 
organs was worked out, experimental work was gradually spread 
out in various provinces, regions, and cities, and many 
localities even began reform experiments in some of their 
vocational departments. 
  While performing structural reform, it is also necessary to 
pay attention to the building of the public security 
contingents, and great efforts should be made in anticorruption 
work and instilling honesty. Concerning this, Tian Qiyu stated 
that, in August of last year, the Ministry of Public Security 
set up a special working group to fight corruption; called an 
anticorruption telephone conference of public security organs 
throughout China; stipulated the "Regulations on 10 Not-Alloweds 
for Public Security Organs and Public Security Cadres and 
Policeman," and "Decisions on Abolition of 16 Items of 
Indiscriminate Fee Collection"; and sent out investigation teams 
to various localities for supervision. 
  This year, on the basis of summarizing last year's 
anticorruption struggle, we should continue investigating and 
dealing with major cases; resolutely punish corrupt people; 
overcome the problem of people knowingly violating the law; and 
punish those who break the law while enforcing it, bend the law 
for the benefit of relatives or friends, and encroach on the 
interests of the masses. We should further build up a sound 
internal supervisory and constraining mechanism of public 
security organs, and actively explore and develop a supervisory 
system that conforms with the vocational characteristics of the 
people's police. We should strengthen the management of public 
security contingent, and build up and improve various rules and 
regulations. We should firmly grasp the opportunity to 
implement public servant regulations and start building up an 
entire set of rules and regulations on contingent management 
that links with the public servant regulations and police 
regulations and conform with the characteristics of public 
security organs, so as to make contingent management more 
standardized and in line with the legal system. 
<H3>  V. Cooperation Between the Police Forces of Both Sides Is 
Fruitful </H3>
  Discussing the present situation in which Sino-British 
negotiations have broken down as a result of the fact that the 
British side adhered to a wrong position and practiced the 
"three violations," Tian Qiyu, as a member of Preliminary 
Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, declared: The disruption of 
Sino-British cooperation is what we and the broad masses of our 
compatriots in Hong Kong are unwilling to see. We hope that 
Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable, and the Chinese 
police force hopes that Hong Kong will experience fine social 
security order. After the establishment of the meeting system 
in 1984 between the public security organs of the Chinese 
mainland and the Hong Kong police force, both sides held working 
meetings every year in Beijing and Hong Kong and cooperated in 
battling criminal offenses involving firearms, smuggling, 
narcotics trafficking, economic crimes, and triad criminal 
offenses. Cooperation between the police forces is fruitful. 
  To my knowledge, the police forces of both sides achieved 
splendid results in recent years in pursuing crimes involving 
the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. Since 1991, public security 
organs in the Chinese mainland have handed-over 60 recovered 
luxury cars stolen in Hong Kong, and 24 such cars were returned 
last year alone. In recent years, mainland public security 
organs have delivered dozens of criminals to the Hong Kong 
police force: 15 in 1992, and 17 in 1993. They joined efforts 
against crime, and forcefully frightened criminals, which 
obviously reduced serious criminal cases of gun robbery and car 
theft that took place recently in Hong Kong. Auto theft cases 
in Hong Kong dropped by 46 percent, and crimes involving guns 
dropped by nearly 50 percent, which played a positive role in 
stabilizing social security in Hong Kong. Representatives of 
public security organs from the Chinese mainland who went to 
Hong Kong for investigation and to deliver evidence also won 
enjoyed the positive cooperation of the Hong Kong police force. 
Such cooperation is advantageous to maintaining the public 
order of both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. 
  Tian Qiyu said: We hope such cooperation will be further 
strengthened and developed during the later stage of transition. 
  To further promote the understanding between the police 
forces of the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, we will enlarge 
exchanges in police vocational work, education and training, 
technological equipment, and culture and sports through working 
meetings, exchange of visits, and friendly contacts. We also 
welcome friends of the Hong Kong police force to come to the 
mainland for tours, vacations, and to visit relatives. We not 
only welcome visits from the upper and middle levels, but also 
visits from the lower level. We not only welcome Chinese, but 
also welcome those of non-Chinese descent. We welcome them to 
visit the Chinese mainland mainly for the sake of increasing 
understanding and strengthening friendship, so that both sides 
will coordinate more smoothly and more effectively in the 
preparatory work during the later stage of transition. 
  When the correspondent asked about the appraisal of the Hong 
Kong police force and its use after 1997 -- a general concern of 
Hong Kong police circles -- Tian Qiyu calmly replied: We have 
talked about this issue on many occasions. The overall quality 
of Hong Kong policemen is quite good, they are highly efficient 
in handling affairs, and they have played a proper role in 
maintaining the social security of Hong Kong. They not only 
play an important role in ensuring the smooth transition of Hong 
Kong during the later stage of transition, but will also be an 
important force for maintaining the public order of Hong Kong 
region after 1997. During the later stage of transition, the 
social security of Hong Kong remains the responsibility of the 
British-Hong Kong authorities. 
  The great majority of Hong Kong policemen "love their 
motherland, and love Hong Kong", and after 1997 they will not be 
discriminated against politically because they worked for the 
British-Hong Kong Government. The Hong Kong police force is an 
important component of the Hong Kong civil service. The policy 
of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong civil service 
naturally applies to the Hong Kong police force. We hope that 
the police force will dispel their misgivings, be relieved, and 
keep their mind on their work. We are convinced that the police 
department of the SAR government will continue to use and 
promote them according to their personal qualifications and 
record of service, experiences, abilities, and their actual 
performance in maintaining the public order of Hong Kong during 
the transitional period. 
  With the approach of the return of Hong Kong in 1997, we 
hope 
that the police force of the Chinese mainland and that of Hong 
Kong will continue to strengthen cooperation, and work with 
concerted effort for the smooth transition and successful return 
of Hong Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (AFP) -- Pro-democracy activities 
have become widespread and will continue throughout China 
despite the apparent failure of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to warn Beijing its MFN trade status was at stake if 
human rights did not improve, activists here say. Militant 
Chinese pro-democracy activists said they do not expect "sharp 
repression" by the authorities as their movement gains more 
members and the government shows "restraint" in its reaction. 
Christopher, whose visit here was aimed at obtaining a 
guarantee for "substantial progress" in China's human rights 
record, left Monday without securing any change in Beijing's 
position that categorically opposes interference in what it 
considers a "private" matter. 
  Dissident Yang Zhou, 50, who is spokesman for the Chinese 
Human Rights Association based in the eastern city of Shanghai, 
has said that "no country on its own could put pressure on 
China" to change. "China continues to resist external pressures 
while within the communist party there is a conservative current 
that wants to reassert its power," Yang said in a telephone 
interview. "If (U.S. President Bill) Clinton increases 
pressure, the democracy movement could suffer further." 
  University professor Xu Liangying, 73, who was one of seven 
intellectuals to sign an "open letter" to Chinese authorities 
demanding greater democracy, is resolutely opposed to foreign 
pressure on China. "I am Chinese and I don't like foreigners 
putting pressure on my country," he said. However, Xu rejects 
the official Chinese view that economic development must precede 
any improvement in individual freedoms. "A little more than 200 
years ago, France and the United States adopted measures in 
favor of human rights when their economic state was well below 
that of China today." 
  Ding Zilin, a 57-year-old academic who has also added her 
signature to the letter, welcomed "all the support that 
foreigners could bring to the democracy movement." She added 
however that "improvements in China's human rights cannot be 
achieved overnight." 
  Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 democracy movement 
that was crushed at Beijing's Tiananmen Square when troops 
opened fire on demonstrators, said: "human rights in China 
cannot be accomplished by the Americans or Europeans, only by 
Chinese themselves." The leading dissident returned to the 
capital Wednesday after several days of "forced vacation" in the 
countryside. Before and during Christopher's visit, some 15 
well-known dissidents were detained by police with three of them 
still behind bars. Yang has been questioned four times since 
the beginning of the month, but says he believes that "the 
police have changed their attitude towards dissidents in 
Shanghai and carry out their work without brutality," showing 
"that the government is now more careful in treating the 
democracy movement." "The movement comprises many more persons 
than before and from all walks of life," Yang said. "We can 
speak out publicly to demand the freedom of arrested dissidents. 
I myself was able to express my criticisms to the police who 
questioned me, which would have been unthinkable a few years 
ago." 
  Three open letters on democracy have been sent to the 
Chinese 
leadership in the space of a week, and some observers say it is 
the biggest act of defiance launched since the 1989 
demonstrations. "At the time, the concept of democracy was a 
little too abstract. Now the movement is closer to reality, 
with more concrete objectives," Yang said. "We have passed from 
a clandestine stage to a public stage while trying to proceed in 
a legal way." Wang Dan agrees with the description of the 
movement's evolution, but adds that "with the progress of 
economic reforms, calls in favor of political reform will 
multiply." Ding says that "what is happening today is the 
continuation of 1989." Her 17-year-old son was killed when 
troops opened fire on students at Tiananmen Square. "Before I 
wasn't involved in politics. It was the death of my son that 
woke me up. I don't want the same thing to happen to other young 
Chinese and that is why I wrote that open letter with the other 
intellectuals."

correspondent Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601): "Ding Zilin and 
Her Husband, Cosigners of Human Rights Appeal, Placed Under 
House Arrest"] 
  [Text] New York, 16 Mar (LIEN HO PAO) -- Ding Zilin [0002 
1311 7207], professor at the People's University of China, and 
her spouse, Jiang Peikun [5592 1014 0981] -- two of the "seven 
gentlemen" who signed the human rights appeal in Beijing -- are 
still under house arrest. Personnel from the State Security 
Ministry, the National People's Congress Security Department, 
and the Family Dependents Commission keep a 24-hour watch in 
front of their house, and all who come to see them will be 
questioned and warned. This serious interference in her normal 
life has caused Ding Zilin to have a heart attack. Even when 
she went to the hospital for treatment, she was "accompanied" by 
some persons. 
  Several of her students who are studying in the United 
States 
have called this newspaper or faxed messages to us saying they 
were concerned about Ding Zilin's condition. At the same time, 
the Humanitarian Rescue Work Committee of the Autonomous 
Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in America has urged 
the mainland authorities to lift the unlawful house arrest of 
Ding Zilin and her spouse immediately, on the grounds of 
humanitarianism, and to provide a good medical environment and 
treatment conditions for Ding Zilin.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (AFP)--Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa will hike pressure on China this weekend, 
calling on North Korea's last remaining ally to exert every 
influence on Pyongyang to defuse the Korean nuclear crisis, 
sources said Friday. 
  Hosokawa -- who will be dangling a fat line of credit for 
the 
Chinese economy -- will be making the pitch at a critical stage 
in the unfolding crisis, coinciding with possible moves to press 
for UN sanctions against North Korea. 
  "I don't think that Hosokawa will go so far as to lobby the 
Chinese openly, but he is still likely to call on them to take 
concrete steps to make North Korea give in," an Asian diplomat 
in Beijing said. 
  A foreign ministry official in Tokyo confirmed Friday that 
Hosokawa would ask China to "do its best to persuade" Pyongyang 
to give up its suspected drive to build a nuclear bomb. 
  The expected moves come amid a new surge of tension in the 
Korean peninsula, after the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) revealed that its inspectors had again been barred from 
probing a suspect North Korean nuclear facility. 
  Pyongyang's refusal once more placed it at loggerheads with 
Washington, after a three-week lull that raised hopes for a 
negotiated solution to the year-old crisis. 
  The United States now says there is "no basis" for talks it 
had scheduled with North Korea on Monday that were part of the 
package deal. Analysts say the next steps could lead to U.S. 
lobbying for UN sanctions against Pyongyang for snubbing the 
world's nuclear watchdog. 
  Diplomats said Japan, like China a supporter of a 
non-confrontational approach on the crisis, would naturally turn 
towards Beijing for help, as China is the last big country with 
any friendly ties with Stalinist North Korea. 
  But China, they noted, is also loath to back sanctions as a 
UN Security Council member and said clearly on Wednesday it had 
no wish to be a "mediator" in the showdown with the North. 
  A key aim of the Hosokawa visit will be to sketch out the 
next phase in economic cooperation, including the renewal of a 
massive line of credit on which China has been drawing for its 
economic development. 
  Sources in Tokyo said China is likely to ask for credit of 
1.5 trillion yen (14.28 billion dollars) for the 1996-2000 
period, nearly twice the amount under the existing arrangement, 
which expires next year. 
  "Japan is reluctant to insist on progress on human rights, 
as 
the United States does, but will probably raise the issue when 
it comes to the loan renewal, and also insist on military 
transparency," an expert on East Asian affairs said. 
  An aide to Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said here 
in January that Japan may cut the credit line if it considers 
China's military spending to be too great. 
  China's drive to modernise its armed forces, and 
declarations 
of sovereignty of small islands in the South China Sea, has 
alarmed several of its neighbours. 
  Last week, it announced that military spending would rise 
from 4.94 billion dollars in 1993 to 5.97 billion this year. 
  But Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Wednesday insisted that 
China had no expansionist aims, had only hiked the military 
budget in line with inflation and in any case found it at a 
"derisory" level compared with that of Japan or the United 
States. 
  Other big economic topics are possible investments in China 
by Japanese firms and a scheme to build a high-speed train link 
between Beijing and Shanghai, a project that will no doubt draw 
huge competition from French and German firms. 
  Hosokawa, who will be making his first visit to China since 
taking office last August, will hold talks with Premier Li Peng, 
President and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of the economy.

  [Text] Xian, March 17 (XINHUA) -- China, Japan and the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
will work together to restore the remains of ancient palaces in 
Xian, capital of Shaanxi Province. 
  The daming palaces were the imperial quarters and political 
offices for 230 years in China's Tang Dynasty (618-907). These 
large-scale palace complexes built in the middle period of 
Chinese history were of an incomparable splendor. 
  Local sources said that the Japanese will provide about a 
million U.S. dollars for the project, and Chinese and Japanese 
archeologists will together hammer out a protective restoration 
program. 
  The sources also revealed that a formal agreement on the 
project will be signed when Japanese prime minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa pays an official visit to China shortly. 
  Preparations will be made this year, and the program is to 
be 
carried out fully next year. 
  Cheng Andong, secretary of the city Communist Party 
Committee, said while meeting UN and Japanese representatives 
early this month that the city has been putting special emphasis 
on the palaces restoration plan. 
  Cheng said that the government has designated specific 
people 
to be in charge of the work and the city has spent more than one 
million yuan (about 114,900 U.S. dollars) in recent years on the 
greening of land around the palaces and removing unrelated 
buildings.

<F P=106> [By Greg Torode] </F>
  [Text] A senior United Nations shipping safety official 
expressed shock yesterday at reports of piracy attacks by 
Chinese officials but revealed that Beijing believed actions 
outside territorial waters were "just and lawful." Admiral 
Thimio Mitropoulos, of the United Nation's International 
Maritime Organisation (IMO), said: "If the (Hong Kong 
Government) reports are right, as a human being I would be 
shocked." 
  Before leaving Hong Kong to continue his East Asian piracy 
fact-finding mission, Admiral Mitropoulos outlined China's 
strongest statement on the issue, received during talks in 
Beijing with Foreign Ministry and Customs officials this week. 
To eradicate a smuggling boom as China opened up Admiral 
Mitropoulos said, China wanted to get the message across that it 
had taken "appropriate measures involving the detention of local 
and foreign ships within China's territorial seas and adjacent 
contiguous seas. China attaches great importance to the 
maintenance of law and order and will take strong measures to 
suppress piracy and lawlessness. China does not accept the 
lawful execution of law enforcement by competent Chinese 
authorities is unlawful," he said, in a statement which local 
government and shipping industry officials believe could justify 
fears that China is claiming the South China Sea as its own. 
  Admiral Mitropoulos, director of the IMO's maritime safety 
committee, said he could not get answers from China as to 
exactly what territory could be classed as "contiguous" and said 
they had admitted to taking action in areas "adjacent to 
contiguous seas". 
  He said China strongly denied any involvement by its navy. 
Many of the 100 distress reports handed over unabridged to the 
IMO by the Government this week involved attacks hundreds of 
kilometres from Chinese territory, some mentioning the navy. 
  While saying China's version of its actions could well be 
legal under international law, he said he was heartened by 
yesterday's reports that China was setting new guidelines for 
wayward forces. He said he had not heard of that while in 
Beijing but said he welcomed anything that would make the South 
China Sea safer, adding: "I feel that if there has been a crime 
committed then the perpetrators should be brought to justice." 
  The Deputy Secretary for Security, Jim Morris, said last 
night the statement from China issued by the admiral was a 
"clear advance. At least it's an acknowledgement that their 
ships are involved... I think that's a clear advance in itself. 
They've previously been reluctant to do that. That's got to be 
good." 
  When asked if he was concerned that it could mean the whole 
South China Sea, he said: "It's not for us to be expressing 
concern. Why should I express concern on behalf of another flag 
state."

  [Text] Washington, March 17 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today [17 March] telephoned Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to discuss ways of 
resuming the Mideast peace talks, the White House said. 
  "The President discussed with each leader ways to resume 
negotiations as quickly as possible," White House communications 
director Mark Gearan said in a statement. 
  During the talks with Mubarak and Al-Asad by telephone, 
Clinton described his conversations Wednesday with visiting 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Clinton and Rabin Wednesday discussed ways to restart the 
peace talks and called on Palestine Liberation Organization 
(PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to resume the negotiations 
immediately. 
  The Palestinians broke off the peace talks with Israel after 
the massacre by an Israeli settler of more than 40 Palestinians 
in Hebron two weeks ago. 
  Gearan characterized Clinton's discussions with Mubarak and 
Al-Asad as useful.

  [Text] Bonn, March 9 (XINHUA) -- German and Russian 
defense ministers announced here today that the navies of the 
two countries would stage a joint exercise early this summer in 
the Baltic Sea. 
  German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Russian 
counterpart Pavel Grachev also told a joint press conference 
that a small-scale joint military exercise will be held in 
Russia in 1995 and another in Germany in 1996, to be followed by 
a larger event involving ground troops. 
  Grachev, who arrived in Bonn earlier today for a three-day 
visit, announced that Russia would withdraw all of its remaining 
weapons and ammunition from the former East Germany by the end 
of May this year. 
  The two ministers said they would make efforts to cooperate 
in a regular, planned and long-term manner. 
  Grachev stressed that Russia viewed the proposal 
"Partnership 
for Peace" agreed between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) and East European countries, as a transitional plan. 
Although Russia would act positively to the NATO proposal it 
was not going to make a hasty political decision on it.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (XINHUA) -- A joint statement 
regarding the basis for the friendly ties between China and 
Azerbaijan signed by President Jiang Zemin and Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev was made public in Beijing today. Text 
of the joint statement follows: 
  President Aliyev of the Republic of Azerbaijan paid an 
official visit to China from 7-10 March at the invitation of PRC 
President Jiang Zemin. The leaders of the two countries 
exchanged views on bilateral relations between the PRC and 
Azerbaijan and international issues of common concern in a 
friendly, sincere, and realistic atmosphere. 
  As a result of the talks, the two sides made the following 
statement: 
  1. The Republic of Azerbaijan and PRC (hereinafter referred 
to as "the two sides") believe that the similarities in history, 
culture, and customs between the two peoples and their friendly 
ties serve as an underlying foundation for close cooperation in 
many areas; they share the view that to further boost bilateral 
friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation conforms 
to the fundamental interests of the two peoples and also 
benefits the peace and security in the region. 
  2. As friendly nations, the two countries will develop their 
relations in accordance with the UN Charter, the five principles 
of peaceful coexistence -- mutual respect for sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, non-interference in 
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and 
peaceful coexistence -- and other norms of international law. 
  3. The two sides will promote bilateral cooperative ties in 
politics, economy and trade, science and technology, culture, 
education, public health, and other fields on the basis of 
mutual benefit and trust, and sign corresponding agreements to 
this end. 
  4. The two sides will work together to strengthen world 
peace 
and trust, enhance stability and security, and frequently 
exchange views and hold consultations on the above-mentioned 
issues. 
  5. The two sides place great importance on expanding 
contacts 
between the parliaments of the two countries and promoting 
cooperation in this aspect. 
  6. The two sides will actively cooperate in cracking down on 
illegal trafficking, terrorism, illegal actions jeopardizing 
navigation and civil aviation security, smuggling of 
antiquities, and other organized and international criminal 
offenses. They can sign independent agreements in this regard 
according to the actual needs. 
  7. The Republic of Azerbaijan Government recognizes the 
People's Republic of China Government as the sole legitimate 
government of China, and Taiwan as an inalienable part of the 
Chinese territory. The Azerbaijani Government will not establish 
official ties with Taiwan. 
  8. The Chinese Government supports the Azerbaijani 
Government's efforts to safeguard national independence and 
develop its economy and recognizes and respects Azerbaijan's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  9. Neither of the two sides will participate in any actions 
or adopt any measures of a third country directed against the 
other. They also agree that no third country is to be allowed to 
utilize the territory or facilities of either signatory to 
oppose the other signatory. 
  10. This statement does not involve the interest of a third 
country or the two sides' commitments and obligations to other 
international treaties.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Fan Weiguo: "Why Russia, Ukraine Dispute </F>
Over Gas Supply?"] 
  [Text] Kiev, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The dispute between 
Russia and Ukraine over natural gas supplies erupted again, 
after they had solved the issue of nuclear arms. And it is 
possible that it will escalate at any time. 
  Russia decided on March 3 to reduce its natural gas supply 
to 
Ukraine, which, Russia says, owes a large amount of money for 
previous supplies. 
  And Russia threatened to totally stop the supply of gas if 
Ukraine fails to pay the debt within five days. 
  That threat still exists, although Russia agreed to extend 
the time limit to April 10 after urgent negotiations. 
  Russia is Ukraine's biggest supplier of natural gas, 
essential to Ukrainian industry. And 60 percent of the 
country's natural gas comes from Russia annually. 
  However, Ukraine cannot pay the debt due to its domestic 
economic crisis and the soaring price of gas provided by Russia. 
Under the circumstances, it is buying most of its natural gas 
on credit. 
  The Russian Government cancelled a state loan to Ukraine 
because of their strained relations. According to Russian 
statistics, Ukraine now owes Russia 1.5 trillion rubles. 
  The dispute was triggered by Turkmenistan, another important 
source of energy for Ukraine, when Turkmenistan decided to 
discontinue supplying 77.8 million metric meters of natural gas 
daily, thus worsening Ukraine's energy crisis. 
  The lack of natural gas has forced 40 to 45 of the 110 
generating units in Ukraine's thermal power plant to stop 
operations. And many Ukrainian industries have suffered a heavy 
blow by the lack of natural gas and electricity. 
  National industrial production decreased by 7.4 percent in 
1993. And it dropped 32.7 percent in January against the same 
period last year. 
  On the surface, Russia has the right to ask Ukraine to repay 
its debt. But in fact, Russia asking for the money at this time 
conveys deep economic and political significance. 
  Exports of natural gas to Western Europe have always been an 
important channel for Russia to earn foreign currency. But 95 
percent of its exports must be carried through gas pipes across 
ukraine, for which Russia must pay a great deal. 
  Therefore, Russia's threat to cut off the gas supply is 
usually met by Ukraine threatening to cut off the pipelines. 
And Moscow is worried by the fact that Kiev could intercept 
their gas exports at any time. 
  In addition, Kiev has many underground storehouses to 
preserve natural gas for emergency use in case Moscow 
discontinues the supply. 
  Russia must control the pipelines in order to defeat Ukraine 
in this dispute. 
  So it was suggested during negotiations held on March 10 
that 
Ukraine pay part of the debt with cash and part with shares of 
its gas facilities. It has been reported that Russia insisted 
on obtaining 51 percent of the shares, thus controlling the 
pipelines. This was refused by Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk. 
  But Ukraine has agreed to pay its debt of about 370 million 
U.S. dollars to Russia this year with cash. 
  Moscow's request for debt payment appears to be politically 
motivated. 
  It is no coincidence that on March 3, when Russia decided to 
reduce the gas supply, Kravchuk was visiting the United States, 
which is trying to improve relations with Ukraine, and giving 
economic and political support to the former Soviet republic. 
  Worried by the possibility that its influence over Ukraine 
will lessen as the country approaches Western nations, Russia 
took action on the gas supply to warn Kiev not to harm Russian 
interests. 
  Meanwhile, pro-Russia forces in eastern Ukraine and 
nationalists in western Ukraine are both busy preparing for the 
upcoming parliamentary elections. The new parliament will play 
an important role in the development of ties between the two 
countries. 
  The "KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA" newspaper said Russia raised the 
issue of gas supplies at this time in order to back the 
pro-Russia forces and create for itself a favorable political 
environment in neighboring countries. 
  This dispute not only has strained economic relations 
between 
the two countries but also cast a shadow over Ukraine's smooth 
implementation of the nuclear disarmament treaty. 
  The Ukrainian president, while visiting the U.S., said that 
the gas supply was not only a question of economics, but also 
involved many other issues. 
  He added that if Ukrainian industries were closed because of 
a lack of natural gas, the nuclear disarmament process would be 
harmed. 
  Kiev also accuses Moscow of owing pipeline transportation 
fees of about 100 million U.S. dollars, and it does not rule out 
the possibility of retaliation once Russia cuts off the supply. 
  Under these circumstances, this controversy is likely to be 
long lasting, regardless of any progress which may be achieved 
in the next round of talks. 
  And the issue will be used by Russia as a way to control 
economic and political relations between the two countries, and 
to gain concessions on other disputes such as the Black Sea 
Fleet, the division of ex-Soviet Union overseas properties and 
the Crimea issue.

  [Text] Moscow, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Russia today initialed 
with Latvia an accord on the withdrawal of troops from the 
Baltic state by the end of August. 
  Under the accord, Russia will keep its Skrunda radar station 
in Latvia for four more years and have another 18 months for its 
dismantlement, the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  Chief Russian negotiator Sergey Zotov described the accord 
as 
"a victory for common sense" and said it paved the way for the 
signing of a final agreement probably before mid-April when the 
presidents of the two countries meet. 
  The bulk of the 20,000 ex-Soviet troops in Latvia and 
Estonia 
were stationed in Latvia. Russia completed the withdrawal of 
troops from the third Baltic state of Lithuania last year.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The Sino-American 
Trade Development Council today urged all groups and firms 
concerned to contribute to renewal of China's most favored 
nation (MFN) trade status with the U.S. 
  At a press conference here this morning, council Chairman 
Robert Goodman said urgent actions should be taken to bridge the 
communications gap and to avert cancellation of China's MFN 
status which would be equally detrimental to both countries. 
  That there are serious misunderstandings and misimpressions 
in the U.S. as to what the real situation in China is and these 
are endangering MFN renewal, he said. 
  "Americans need to hear about and appreciate the tremendous 
advances that China has made in recent years on human rights and 
to understand the improvements in the standard of living that 
China has achieved for its citizens," he said. 
  China deserves to be given credit for their accomplishments 
in these important areas, Goodman said, as it "has, after all, 
managed to employ, feed and house one billion people." 
furthermore, "no one could dispute that the booming Chinese 
economy is providing unprecedented economic opportunities for 
its citizens," Goodman added. 
  the council chairman argued that America has heard more 
through the media about the small numbers of dissidents and not 
from the millions of ordinary working people in China who are 
satisfied with and enjoying the improved living standard. 
  "this silent majority also has a right to be heard," he 
stressed. 
  he predicted the voice of the average Chinese workers, who 
have a stake in the MFN issue, would be even more influential to 
the U.S. Congressmen. 
  to facilitate this effort, Goodman suggested a special Sino- 
American cultural exchange fellowship program, calling on all 
groups and firms concerned to finance visits by ordinary Chinese 
people to meet congressmen in Washington and broaden their 
understanding. 
  "I am convinced that China is very much committed to 
improving human rights, but would do so within the context of 
their own social environment," he said. 
  Goodman said he was also impressed by China's commitment to 
broaden and strengthen its relationship with the U.S. and to 
promote bilateral trade opportunities. 
  His council would be recommending to President Bill Clinton 
and the U.S. Congress to grant permanent renewal of MFN for 
China, Goodman added. 
  The Sino-American Trade Development Council, founded in 
early 
1993, is a non-governmental organization which acts as a bridge 
between China and the U.S. to promote trade contacts and 
cultural understanding, especially for small businesses of the 
two countries.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
should renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status to 
ensure maintenance of trade and investment ties between the 
states and China, vice-chairman of the Amoco Corporation General 
Office said at a press conference here this afternoon. 
  Lawrason D. Thomas, who is attending the China Petroleum 
Investment Conference held here today and tomorrow, added that 
Sino-U.S. relations are, from the viewpoint of global strategy, 
a parallel partnership. 
  He believed that human rights and trade should not be linked 
together, hoping that the U.S. and Chinese Governments could 
solve the problem of human rights and trade through talks. 
  On Amoco's attitude toward the renewal of China's MFN 
trading 
status and China's re-entry into the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Thomas said that his company is making 
efforts toward these two goals. He himself has already 
discussed the issue with some administrative officials of the 
United States. 
  Thomas said that he had a discussion last Thursday [10 
March] 
with three U.S. senators in Washington on the same issue. 
  "Different people think of human rights in different ways. 
My suggestion is that we have people from both sides, the 
United States and China, sit down and discuss the issue and find 
areas of common agreement," Thomas stressed. 
  For those who have poor knowledge about China, Thomas 
suggested that they come and see China with their own eyes. 
"Seeing China firsthand is a lot different from reading about 
it in the newspaper," he said, adding that many people change 
their minds after coming to China. 
  C. Patrick Chu, president of the Amoco Orient Company, told 
the press conference that he had met with dozens of visiting 
U.S. senators and over 20 U.S. Congressmen in Beijing to discuss 
the MFN trade issue with them. 
  Chu hoped that the human rights issue could be separated 
from 
trade and China's MFN trading status renewed. Both in 
Washington and Beijing, Amoco is making efforts to this end.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 KYODO -- Hundreds of Chinese 
activists demanding war compensation from Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa have been detained or questioned by 
Chinese police, sources close to the movement said Friday [18 
March]. 
  Several detentions took place Friday morning in front of the 
Japanese Embassy in Beijing, including two people who were 
delivering open letters to Hosokawa on the eve of his Saturday 
arrival. 
  Among those taken away were Gao Xiongfei, an associate 
professor from Zhejiang Education College, and Gao Mingke 
(unrelated), 82, from Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, the source 
said. 
  Up to 400 people from neighboring Hebei Province are 
planning 
to come to Beijing for the Hosokawa visit, the source said, 
while nearly 100 activists have been detained on both Thursday 
and Friday at either the Beijing railroad station or in front of 
the Japanese Embassy. 
  Hundreds of others in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces have 
been detained or questioned by police and warned not to come to 
Beijing during the prime minister's visit, the source said. 
  Sources said Chinese Public Security bureaus in Beijing met 
Thursday to discuss war compensation activities and decided to 
crack down on any activities that might disturb the Hosokawa 
visit. 
  Tong Zeng, leader of the unofficial Victims of Japanese War 
Crimes Reparations Committee, was believed detained by police 
Thursday and his whereabouts are presently unknown, the source 
close to the movement said. 
  The Chinese Government has been sensitive about demanding 
war 
compensation for civilian casualties from Japan as it is afraid 
it could damage already good governmental relations, that 
include as much as 1.2 trillion yen in loans. 
  A group of delegates to the ongoing National People's 
Congress, China's rubber stamp parliament, is presently 
preparing a motion demanding war compensation from Japan, but it 
is not known whether the central authorities will approve such a 
document. 
  Their motion calls for an apology by Hosokawa on his visit, 
the use of yen loans in compensating civilian victims of Japan's 
war atrocities and the Chinese Government's right in organizing 
and approving a compensation process. 
  The open letters, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, make 
similar demands. 
  The letter from Gao Xiongfei, believed to be in his 50s, 
asks 
Hosokawa to apologize and clearly answer demands for 
compensation from the victims of Japanese atrocities. 
  Gao Mingke's letter recounts an episode of Japanese 
brutality 
in Xuzhou in which a dozen of his unarmed relatives were 
murdered in his house. 
  "We are asking the Japanese Government to compensate the 
civilian victims and their relatives. It is absolutely 
justified that we continue to struggle until the Japanese 
Government offers economic compensation," he writes. 
  With the elder Gao, three others, all in their 70s or 80s, 
were questioned and taken away after a vehicle they were driving 
pulled up in front of the Japanese Embassy, witnesses said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The upcoming China 
visit by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will lay a 
solid foundation for furthering Sino-Japanese economic and trade 
relations. 
  This view was expressed both by Chinese and Japanese 
officials in charge of foreign trade in an interview with XINHUA 
before the Japanese premier's visit, which starts tomorrow. 
  Takashi Koezuka, Japanese economic counsellor in Beijing, 
said that the prime minister's visit, following the recent visit 
to Japan by Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, is another 
important event in the two countries' bilateral relations. 
  During the coming visit, the leaders of the two countries 
will exchange views on bilateral relations, especially economic 
and trade cooperation, and the international situation, he said. 
An agreement on expanding bilateral environmental cooperation 
is to be signed. 
  "Although no agreement on economic and trade ties will be 
reached this time, deep and careful discussion on the long-term 
bilateral economic and trade ties will definitely promote the 
existing good ties," the counsellor said. 
  An official from the Chinese Ministry of Trade and Economic 
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that since the economies of the two 
countries were complementary, and a historic opportunity to 
further bilateral trade ties was appearing, the high-level 
exchanges will promote bilateral economic and trade ties to a 
new stage on the basis of last year's high record. 
  In 1993, Japan for the first time became China's biggest 
trade partner, with a trade volume of 39 billion U.S. dollars, a 
jump of 53.8 percent over the previous year. 
  Japan's direct investment in China increased greatly during 
the same period, and its exports of technology and equipment to 
China accounted for 28 percent of China's total imports, ranking 
highest among China's trade partners. 
  The official pointed out that in China's exports to Japan, 
the percentage of finished products has been increasing, but 
their added value was not high enough. "If more high-value 
added products are shipped over with the efforts of both sides, 
the potential of expanding China's exports will be very big," 
she said. 
  She said she hoped that China's large trade deficit in this 
bilateral trade would be reduced soon by more varied means. 
  With China becoming more open, more Sino-Japanese 
joint-ventures and cooperative enterprises will be established, 
she said. These companies will bring in a large amount of 
equipment from Japan, and export their finished products to 
Japan, as one way to increase bilateral trade. 
  She added that in order to revive its economy, Japan will 
regulate its industrial structure and expand its overseas 
markets. To cooperate with China, whose economy is growing 
rapidly, is one of Japan's ideal solutions. 
  Takashi Koezuka said that China, the second biggest trade 
partner of Japan, plays an important role in his country's 
foreign trade. The two-way trade developed tremendously last 
year though Japan's economy was in recession, so he believed 
that the prospect of bilateral trade this year was bright since 
Japan's economy will improve this year. 
  He also said that more Japanese companies are interested in 
investing in China. According to a survey by the Japanese 
federation of economic organizations of its member companies, 
many of which are economic giants, the investment focus of most 
of them is on China for the next five years, rather than on 
South-East Asia, as it was in the past five years.

  [Text] Tokyo, 10 Mar (XINHUA) -- This afternoon, Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who will soon visit China, met 
with Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin at the prime 
minister's official residence. Hosokawa said: The development 
of Japan-China relations is now very smooth in all fields. He 
said he was looking forward to exchanging opinions with Chinese 
leaders on issues of common concern. 
  Touching on the question of economic cooperation between 
Japan and China, Hosokawa expressed his view that Japan and 
China each has its advantageous points, that China's development 
serves the interests of Japan, and that Japan's development is 
also beneficial to China. He hoped the two sides would make 
joint efforts to build a relationship of interdependence and 
make up for each other's deficiencies. 
  During the meeting, Xu Dunxin indicated that the Chinese 
Government attached great importance to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's forthcoming visit to China and hoped that the prime 
minister's visit would achieve complete success.

  [Text] Osaka, March 17 KYODO -- A group of Japanese 
rightists that has engaged in anti-Chinese campaigns throughout 
Japan arrived in China Thursday [17 March] for eight days of 
meetings with government and research groups, group organizers 
in Osaka said. 
  The delegation, comprised of 16 members of seven nationalist 
organizations in Japan, was invited by a private association 
that promotes exchanges with the Chinese. 
  Organizers in Osaka said it is the first time that 
representatives from more than one nationalist organization have 
been allowed into Communist China at the same time. 
  The members are scheduled to visit Beijing, Dalian and 
Shanghai. They will meet with members of government and research 
bodies to debate China's military growth, the export of military 
weapons and technology, and China's territorial claims to the 
Senkaku Islands located about 160 kilometers north of Yaeyama 
Islands, southwest of Okinawa. 
  The group also will distribute documents outlining arguments 
against the commonly accepted version of the 1937 Nanjing 
massacre, in which more than 142,000 Chinese were killed 
according to estimates made at the Tokyo war crimes trials. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China 
this weekend, but the group's organizers said their visit will 
be different. 
  "We take China seriously. Unlike the present 
administration's apologetic diplomacy, we want to change the 
historical awareness of the last 100 years from the 
Sino-Japanese war, which has been only a discussion in diplomacy 
of assailants and victims," the members said.

  [Text] Shanghai activist Bao Ge is to send an open letter 
to the Japanese Embassy in Beijing today demanding a public 
apology from Tokyo and reparation for the Sino-Japanese war when 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrives in China on 
Saturday. The letter, which will be sent by express mail today, 
is signed only by Mr Bao after other activist groups declined to 
support a signature campaign for fear of police action. Beijing 
has imposed a news blackout on the reparation movement. 
  In his letter, Mr Bao urged Mr Hosokawa to "use his 
influence" on Chinese leaders to accelerate the pace of 
democracy in China. He also said that it would be "hypocritical 
and unfounded" for Japan to pledge its friendship with China 
unless Tokyo first apologised and paid compensation for the 
damage it inflicted on China during the Sino-Japanese war. 
  The medical researcher accused the Chinese Government of 
violating its own constitution and acting "against the wishes of 
its people" when it renounced its rights to seek reparation from 
Japan in 1972. He said the renunciation was made without the 
consensus of the National People's Congress--the highest 
authority in the Chinese Government--and was therefore 
unconstitutional. "I have to make the statement public now 
because I understand they will stop me from speaking out when Mr 
Hosokawa comes," said Mr Bao yesterday. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing student activist Wang Dan and two other 
dissidents returned to Beijing yesterday after having left the 
Chinese capital for the duration of U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's visit. Mr Wang said he and dissidents Zhou 
Duo and Min Qi had spent the past few days in the southeastern 
coastal city of Xiamen. They had gone of their own volition to 
prevent the tension surrounding Mr Christopher's visit from 
becoming even greater after several dissidents were detained to 
keep them away from the current session of the National People's 
Congress and the Secretary of State. 
  Mr Wang, one of the main leaders of the 1989 student 
movement, said he decided to leave Beijing after"the repeated 
persuasion of some friends." He also said he had been advised 
that "the conflicts would become more acute" if he stayed but 
refused to say who had told him this. "If the authorities had 
demanded that I go, I would not have gone," said Mr Wang. 
  The three men stayed at a hotel in Xiamen and spent the time 
touring the city. Three or four plain-clothes policemen 
followed them wherever they went. 
  When Mr Wang arrived back in Beijing, uniformed police were 
still in the reception room at the apartment block where he 
lives. Nevertheless, Mr Wang said: "I'm completely free." Mr 
Wang said he was heartened by the concern Mr Christopher 
expressed about human rights in China but said he did not pin 
much hope on pressure from outsiders. 
  Sources said that dissident Wei Jingsheng, who served more 
than 14 years in prison before being released last September, 
was unlikely to return to the capital from Tianjin over the next 
few days. Mr Wei left Beijing on March 6.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Nengqing (7812 5174 3237): "Situation on </F>
Korean Peninsula Tends to Relax"] 
  [Text] On 1 March, technical experts sent by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency entered the territory of the 
DPRK and carried out inspections at seven of its nuclear 
facilities. On 3 March, representatives from northern and 
southern Korea resumed contacts between working representatives, 
and they sent special envoys to visit each other, which had been 
suspended for four months. The United States announced the 
resumption of the third round of high-level intergovernmental 
talks with the DPRK on 21 March and conditionally announced the 
suspension of this year's "Team Spirit" exercise. This series 
of dialogues and detente has thrown a new ray of hope on the 
tense and mutually confrontational Korean peninsula. 
  The DPRK announced on 12 March 1993 that it would withdraw 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and decreed that the 
Korean people remained in a "state of semi-war." The United 
States and some Western countries then stated that they would 
impose sanctions on the DPRK. The DPRK, however, announced that 
international sanctions would mean a declaration of war against 
it. With the mediation of some countries, on 2 June, the DPRK 
and the United States held a high-level intergovernmental 
meeting, issued a joint declaration, and agreed on principles 
such as guaranteeing the non-use of nuclear weapons and of armed 
threats, establishing a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, that the 
DPRK and the United States should respect each other's 
sovereignty and not interfere in each other's internal affairs, 
and that the United States supports the reunification of Korea. 
This was the first document reached between the DPRK and the 
United States toward the normalization of relations since they 
stopped fighting 40 years ago. In view of the United States' 
promises, the DPRK announced that it would not withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily. In mid-July, the 
two sides held a second round of high-level intergovernmental 
talks where the United States promised to supply the DPRK with 
civilian nuclear technology in exchange for its acceptance of 
international nuclear inspections. 
  Nevertheless, the two sides differed in opinion on the form 
and number of nuclear inspections with the result that the 
nuclear inspections could not proceed as scheduled. The two 
sides took opposing attitudes over this question and the 
situation became tense again. 
  At working talks between DPRK and U.S. representatives in 
New 
York last October, the two sides discussed a "basket of 
proposals for the resolution of the nuclear issue." They 
included the question of official U.S. recognition of the DPRK 
and holding a third round of high-level intergovernmental talks. 
As planned, the third round of DPRK-U.S. intergovernmental 
talks should have begun in November or early December last year. 
But on 1 November, with the United States' insistence, the UN 
General Assembly adopted a resolution demanding that the DPRK 
accept nuclear inspections. In mid-November, the ROK and the 
United States carried out joint military exercises. In the face 
of international pressure, the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
intergovernmental talks failed. In late December, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto visited the DPRK to mediate. On 29 December, the 
DPRK-U.S. working talks made progress. The United States stated 
that it would suspend South Korean-U.S. "Team Spirit" exercises 
in 1994 while the DPRK also agreed to accept "continuous" 
nuclear inspections. The two sides agreed to create conditions 
for a third round of DPRK-U.S. intergovernmental talks. In 
January, the United States sent nongovernmental personalities to 
visit the DPRK, and U.S. evangelist Billy Graham even passed a 
message from Clinton to Chairman Kim Il-song expressing 
willingness to make efforts to improve DPRK-U.S. relations. 
However, at the same time, the United States sent a team of 
intelligence experts to Seoul to step up monitoring of the DPRK. 
Moreover, it stated that it would deploy Patriot missiles to 
the ROK. 
  On 25 February, an agreement issued by the DPRK and the 
United States announced that the two sides had reached an 
agreement. The United States announced that it had agreed to 
suspend "Team Spirit" exercises with the ROK, while the DPRK 
accepted continuous nuclear inspections intended to safeguard 
nuclear security. They also agreed to resume working contacts 
between northern and southern Korea, which is intended to 
facilitate the mutual dispatch of special envoys and holding a 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks between high-ranking officials in 
Geneva on 21 March. 
  We must see, however, that in announcing a date for a third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks and the suspension of the "Team Spirit" 
military exercises, the United States has attached conditions. 
These preconditions were absent from the original agreement 
reached between the DPRK and the United States. The United 
States also stated that if the international inspections were 
unsatisfactory, "Team Spirit" would be resumed. Observers 
maintain that in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula, they must have good faith or else agreements will 
become empty even if there are many more of them.

  [Text] (Han Sang-u), deputy chief of the DPRK mission in 
the UN Headquarters in Geneva, yesterday denounced the United 
States for having unilaterally canceled the DPRK-U.S. high-level 
talks and hindered the thorough resolution of the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula. (Han Sang-u) stated that the attitudes 
of the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] had complicated this matter and that it was difficult to 
predict their consequences. 
  On 16 March, the IAEA denounced Korea for having rejected 
the 
IAEA specialists' [words indistinct] inspection of nuclear 
facilities. Using this as an excuse, the United States later 
declared that it would cancel the 21 March DPRK-U.S. high-level 
talks. The ROK and the United States are reportedly holding 
negotiations on the Team Spirit joint military exercise.

  [Text] At noon on 15 March, at Jinan Nanjiao Guesthouse, 
Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party 
Committee, cordially met with the government delegation of 
Tauranga city in New Zealand, headed by Mayor (Kisclock), and 
with Mr. Christopher Elder, New Zealand ambassador to China. 
During the reception, Jiang Chunyun first extended a warm 
welcome to the guests on behalf of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government as well as Shandong 
people. Then, he said: Last year, while leading the Shandong 
delegation to visit New Zealand, I was warmly welcomed and 
cordially treated by your government and your people on various 
circles. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks. 
During our stay in New Zealand, we were deeply impressed by your 
country's beautiful scene and abundant natural resources as well 
as your hospitable people. Through that visit to your country, 
our understanding of New Zealand was deepened, the mutual 
friendship was strengthened, and the mutual economic and trade 
cooperation and exchanges were promoted. We believe that the 
current visit by your mayor will further deepen the friendship 
between the peoples of Shandong and New Zealand and press 
forward the further cooperation between the two sides. 
  After briefing the guests on Shandong's natural resources 
and 
economic development situation, Jiang Chunyun said: China's 
economy has now embarked on the stage of rapid development, and 
the dynamics of reform and opening up has been increased. 
Therefore, we are urgently required to conduct economic and 
technological cooperation with developed countries and regions. 
New Zealand and Shandong are much complemented in the economy, 
and there are bright prospects for the mutual cooperation. We 
hope that the current visit by your mayor and ambassador will 
further expand the sphere of mutual cooperation and exchanges. 
  While talking about the on-going second session of the 
eighth 
National People's Congress and the second session of the Eighth 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, Jiang Chunyun said: These two sessions 
have given prominence to the subjects of seizing the opportunity 
to deepen reform, expanding the scale of opening up, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability in line with the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. China's economy has 
continued to maintain a relatively high growth rate. As a 
developed coastal province, Shandong effected a 24.2 percent 
increase in economic growth rate last year. This year, Shandong 
plans to effect a 12 percent increase in the gross domestic 
product. To effect such a high growth rate, we should, what is 
very important, bring in funds and technology from abroad, in 
addition to making good use of our own natural resources. 
Therefore, we are very happy to see that New Zealand is willing 
to continuously conduct economic and technological cooperation 
and exchanges with us. Our cooperation favors both sides. We 
hope that the friends of New Zealand will make investment in 
Shandong and also encourage Shandong's enterprises to run plants 
and do business in New Zealand. As the window of the mutual 
cooperation between the two sides, the Shandong Luxin Economic 
and Technological Consulting Corporation, that will soon be 
established, will certainly play a positive role in promoting 
the economic and technological cooperation between Shandong and 
New Zealand. 
  In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun wished the mayor and ambassador 
of New Zealand success in their visit to Shandong. 
  The mayor of Tauranga city and the New Zealand ambassador 
expressed their belief in the new progress in the mutual 
cooperation and exchanges in the future. 
  During the reception, Wang Jiangong, vice governor of 
Shandong Province, and responsible comrades of departments 
concerned were also on hand.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- China's central bank 
is fully confident of maintaining a stable exchange rate 
throughout this year, Zhou Zhengqing, vice-governor of the 
People's Bank of China said. 
  Zhou expressed his confidence on behalf of the central bank 
at a press conference held by the ongoing session of the 
National People's Congress (NPC) here today. 
  He said that, since China adopted a unified exchange rate 
between the Chinese yuan and major foreign currencies on January 
1, the exchange rate has remained stable -- 8.7 yuan to the U.S. 
dollar -- and the country's foreign exchange reserve has seen a 
sharp increase. 
  Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli disclosed yesterday 
that 
the country's foreign exchange reserve now stands at 27.2 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  On the possibility of foreign banks in China dealing in the 
local currency, Zhou said: "Conditions are not ripe yet." 
  He gave three reasons for this. First, tax rates for Chinese 
banks and their foreign counterparts in China are different at 
present -- higher rates for the former would make competition 
unfair; second, China has yet to convert banks into purely 
commercial institutions, though their conversion is in the 
pipeline; and third, the country has yet to formulate laws 
governing banking activities. 
  However, Zhou said, China is creating required conditions. 
He listed work being done in this direction. It includes the 
formulation late this year of a central bank law, a commercial 
bank law, a securities law, a bills law, an insurance law and a 
series of banking regulations. 
  He said related experiments are being done in a few selected 
joint Sino-foreign banks to gain experience. 
  On the central bank's role in the field of macro-controls, 
Zhou said it is adopting a "steady" policy, explaining that it 
"will neither squeeze nor loosen credit." 
  "For this year," he said, "the increase of total money 
supply 
over last year will be controlled at between 23-24 percent." 
  Last year, money supply went up 25 percent from the previous 
year. 
  China's banking order has turned for the better since the 
second half of last year, after the introduction of tightened 
macro-controls. In the first two months, people's savings 
deposits increased by a big margin, and recovery of all the 
money released immediately before the Spring Festival is 
expected before the end of March, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The bill-handling 
group of the current session of the National People's Congress 
(NPC) had received 723 bills by March 16. 
  Of these proposals, 63 were made by NPC delegations and the 
rest by deputies jointly. 
  Various NPC special committees have prepared reports on how 
to handle these proposals and will submit their reports to the 
presidium of the current NPC session for deliberation. 
  An official of the bill-handling group said that the bills 
cover a wide range of areas, with their focus on the economy. 
  A considerable number of these bills deal with economic 
legislation, the official said. 
  Bills calling for the enactment of a number of new laws, 
such 
as a futures trading law, an arbitration law, a credit law, a 
real estate law and a mineral resources law, have been included 
in the five-year legislation plan of the current NPC Standing 
Committee. 
  He said that deputies also submitted many bills on the 
formulation of new economic laws on debt, mortgage and 
construction as well as a law against the reaping of staggering 
profits. Some bills stress the need to intensify the central 
bank's functions of exercising macro-economic controls. 
  In their bills, many deputies said that measures to narrow 
the gap between developed eastern China and underdeveloped 
western China should be incorporated into a legal system for the 
establishment of a market economy. 
  Moreover, they called for the enactment of a new economic 
law 
on how to assist underdeveloped areas in speeding up economic 
growth there, the official said. 
  He said that many bills emphasize the importance of 
strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the national 
economy and protecting farmers' initiative. 
  Several bills propose the enactment of a new law governing 
investment in agriculture, and the implementation of measures to 
curb price rises for farming-related manufactured goods, and to 
stabilize grain prices and narrow the difference between prices 
of farm products and manufactured goods, he said. 
  The bills also call for the formulation of a new law 
concerning grain trade, another law on agriculture environmental 
protection and still another regarding the development of 
township-run enterprises, as well as the implementation of 
measures to tighten control over the use of resources and 
strictly protect farmland. 
  Many other bills call for the enactment of new laws and 
revision of existing ones in order to maintain social stability, 
the official said. 
  Deputies agreed that the building of a clean and honest 
government is closely related to the maintenance of social 
stability, he said. 
  To this end, they called for the formulation of a new law to 
punish civil servants violating discipline, another law on 
compensation for parties involved in misjudged cases, and 
general rules governing law-enforcers. 
  He said that many bills call for the revision of regulations 
on penalizing violators of public order, the enactment of an 
anti-narcotics law and the revision of existing laws to severely 
punish children abductors. 
  Some bills call for the enactment of a new law concerning 
safety in production, a minimum wages law, a law on promoting 
employment, a law on pension insurance and a law on protecting 
aged people. 
  Many deputies also called for the formulation of a new law 
to 
supervise the implementation of existing laws in an effort to 
facilitate the establishment of a socialist market economy. 
  The official said that many bills deal with the promotion of 
ideological and cultural progress. 
  For example, some deputies called for the enactment of a new 
law to manage the cultural market, another on higher education 
and still another on education input. Others proposed revising 
the compulsory education law. 
  He said that some bills involve national defense and the 
protection of servicemen. 
  The bill-handling group had also received 1,200 proposals 
made by deputies, he said.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524) and Li </F>
Anding (2621 1344 1353): "Jottings on the Two Sessions: Prices 
Brook No 'Riding Without Tickets'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- During group 
discussions of the two sessions [The Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress and Second Session of the 
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese Peoples' Political 
Consultative Conference], a relatively large number of deputies 
and committee members spoke about the price issue. They 
requested that while taking measures to maintain an overall 
balance between supply and demand this year, the state control 
price hikes to an extent tolerable for the people. At the same 
time, they pointed out: An undercurrent lurked in the midst of 
price reform. Brandishing the banner of price reform, some 
people took the opportunity to wantonly raise prices, hiking bus 
fares and increasing prices in disguised forms. Deputies 
vividly depicted such an occurrence as "riding without a ticket" 
[wu paio cheng che 2477 4384 0042 6508]. 
  The phenomenon of "riding without a ticket" is especially 
marked in the service industry. It may appear in various 
places, ranging from parking a bicycle and making a telephone 
call to hotel services and house renovations. When the people 
became more inquisitive and began questioning the validity of 
the hikes, it was couched with the fine-sounding terms of "we 
are now undergoing price reform." 
  This sort of "riding without a ticket" price reform is 
highly 
pernicious. Deputies and committee members pointed out sharply: 
This kind of behavior has created confusion, defamed the reform, 
and also increased the people's burden, and adversely affected 
the stability of society. When introducing a series of price 
reform measures, the state must consider the people's ability to 
withstand certain increases. Price readjustment should proceed 
in an orderly manner and step by step. However, "riding without 
a ticket" may appear at every level and out of the blue. 
Confronted with such a situation when least mentally prepared, 
people tend to pay additional charges out of their pockets. If 
we let this kind of phenomenon drift freely and go unchecked, 
will our price reform not go upside down? 
  Deputies and committee members proposed: This phenomenon of 
"riding without a ticket" must be resolutely curbed, and we must 
not be soft in handling this matter. Instead, we should resort 
to legal, political, and economic means, and deal with it in a 
comprehensive manner. As soon as such a case is detected, we 
must investigate and deal with it accordingly. 
  To deal with the tactic of "fishing in troubled water" 
adopted by those "riding without tickets"; and those taking 
advantage of the situation to indiscriminately raise prices when 
the public are not clear about service industry charges and the 
price of some commodities, some deputies and committee members 
suggested we set up a consultation center so that if the people 
are doubtful about the prices of certain commodities and 
services, they may telephone to seek clarification and avoid 
being taken for a ride by someone "riding without a ticket."

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS)--Chairman of the Financial 
and Economic Committee of the NPC Mr Liu Suinian, delivering a 
report reviewing the plan for last year's national economy and 
social development and this year's draft plan at the meeting of 
the Presidium of the 8th NPC today, said that the central bank 
must be responsible for giving priority to stabilizing the value 
of the renminbi and it would not be allowed to stimulate further 
economic increases by merely issuing more money. 
  The committee put forward seven suggestions in light of the 
recent report on planning work by Minister of the State Planning 
Commission Mr Chen Jinghua. One of the main suggestions dealt 
with attempts to control the size of credit and the supply of 
money. 
  Mr Liu said that China had increased its credit at a high 
speed in the past two years and had increased the issuing of 
money into circulation. If the government did not make up its 
mind to reduce the supply of money, a number of serious problems 
would be created unfavourable to stable economic development. 
  The committee suggested that the banks should greatly 
improve 
their fund management and speed up capital flow, strictly 
restricting and striving to reduce the size of credit. 
  It also suggested greatly strengthening macro-control, 
restricting investment in fixed assets and overgrowth in demand 
of consumer goods, developing the rural economy in an overall 
way, particularly in the production of grain, cotton, vegetable 
oils, meat, sugar and vegetables, strictly controlling prices 
for everyday needs, services and agricultural production means 
and cracking down firmly on criminal acts and misdemeanours 
involving speculation and the raising of prices. 
  With regard to boosting economic results, Mr Liu said that 
China's economic results on the whole remained low with 30 
percent of state-owned enterprises running at a loss. Social 
capital circulated slowly and the debt problem among enterprises 
was becoming increasingly serious. China, therefore, had to 
deepen reform and boost economic results while enterprises with 
serious losses must be declared bankrupt.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Financial and 
Economic Committee [FEC] of the National People's Congress [NPC] 
-- after completing deliberations on the "Report on the 
Implementation of the 1993 Plan for National Economic and Social 
Development and the Draft 1994 Plan" delivered by Chen Jinhua, 
minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, on behalf 
of the State Council -- believes that the guiding idea, 
principle, and key points of the 1994 national economic and 
social development plan are correct and that measures put forth 
therein are feasible. The FEC recommended that the "Report on 
the Implementation of the 1993 Plan for National Economic and 
Social Development and the Draft 1994 Plan" delivered by Chen 
Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, be 
approved and a draft 1994 plan for national economic and social 
development be adopted. In the process of carrying out the 
national plan, any partial adjustment of the plan necessitated 
by major changes of the circumstances has to be reported in 
advance to the NPC Standing Committee for examination and 
approval. 
  The examination report points out: In 1993, people of all 
nationalities across the country -- under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, and the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and in accordance 
with the guidelines of the First Plenary Session of the Eighth 
NPC -- worked in unity and scored major progress in economic 
construction, reform and opening up. The national economy 
registered sustained growth, a good harvest was recorded in 
agriculture, and grain output grew continuously. Industrial 
production maintained a rather high growth rate and state plans 
for major products were fulfilled. A number of key construction 
projects and technical upgrading projects of the state were 
completed and put into operation. The market at home and abroad 
was brisk, income in both urban and rural areas grew, and living 
standards continued to improve. China's opening up continued to 
advance to higher levels and expanded in all directions and in 
all domains. There was a sharp rise in the utilization of 
foreign capital and further progress was achieved in science and 
technology, education, and other social undertakings. 
  The report believes that in spite of the progress, there are 
some problems meriting our attention. The major ones are: 
Insufficient capacity for sustained growth in agriculture, 
grain production in particular; a rather sharp drop in cotton 
output; an overly large volume of investment in fixed assets; 
irrational structures; slow progress in industrial 
restructuring; a worsening of "bottleneck" restraints regarding 
some infrastructure facilities and basic industries, with a 
large proportion of enterprises operating in the red and with 
large deficits; high inflation; and an import growth rate higher 
than that of export. We must take these problems seriously and 
conscientiously solve them in the new year. 
  The FEC offered the following suggestions for the smooth 
implementation of the 1994 plan: 
  1. Extend every effort to strengthen and improve 
macroeconomic regulation and control in order to ensure 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. 
  2. Continue to develop the rural economy in an 
all-round way and protect peasants' economic interests. 
  3. Continue efforts to improve economic efficiency. 
  4. Exercise strict control over the volume of 
investment in fixed assets and optimize the investment pattern. 
  5. Maintain tight control on credit volume and 
issuance of currency. 
  6. Strictly control inflation and display genuine 
concern for the people's livelihood. 
  7. Properly solve some of the problems in science and 
technology, education, culture, public health, other social 
undertakings about which the people care. 
  The report points out: The tasks of reform, opening up, and 
economic development in 1994 are onerous. New situations and 
new problems are bound to arise in our march forward. Favorable 
conditions, however, also abound. In order to successfully 
accomplish the various tasks, we must unify our thinking in line 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, the guidelines 
of the 14th CPC National Congress, and the decision adopted at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and 
seize and take full advantage of the opportunity. Government at 
all levels must further mobilize the initiative of the masses, 
get them mobilized and organized, and get them to understand and 
support reform with the utmost enthusiasm and plunge themselves 
into the great practice of reform. Leading cadres at all levels 
must work with one heart and one mind, set a good example, work 
hard and do solid work, tell the truth, provide real services, 
and guard against going through the motions or doing things for 
appearance's sake. We must go deeply into the realities of 
life, maintain close contact with the masses, serve the people 
wholeheartedly, and strive for the successful accomplishment of 
the 1994 Plan for National Economic and Social Development.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS)--Director of the Financial 
and Economic Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) 
Mr. Liu Suinian said this morning that the government had to be 
determined to streamline its structure by strictly controlling 
the financial spending in order to alleviate the state's 
financial difficulties. 
  Mr. Liu made these remarks at the session of the presidium 
of 
the 8th NPC when he delivered a report on a review of the state 
budget for 1993 and a draft budget set for 1994. There are now 
nearly 25 million persons on the state payroll which is part of 
financial spending, 50 percent more than in 1985. 
  The committee believed that a too big government structure 
and redundancy of staff were the main reason for excessive 
financial spending. The committee suggested that China should 
make reference to other countries and make a decision to 
streamline government structure. 
  Other proposals put forward include cutting the financial 
deficit by every possible means, increasing financial revenue, 
maintaining the growth of financial revenue and the gross 
domestic product at the same pace and raising the input of 
capital to support development in economically poor areas. 
  According to the draft state budget for 1994 made known by 
the Minister of Finance Mr. Liu Zhongli, China will borrow loans 
of over RMB129.2 billion this year. The committee believed that 
it was inevitable that a deficit and loan-making would take 
place at a time when China was now seeing rapid economic 
development and a change in its system. It said, however, that 
the authorities had to pay much more attention to controlling 
spending on new items of basic construction while subsidies for 
the making up of losses should be kept under control and 
reductions or exemptions of tax not in line with the law should 
be prevented.

  [Text] Major social conflicts including racial and 
religious disputes surged in China last year, jeopardising 
stability, the Public Security Ministry said in a report to the 
National People's Congress. The number of petitions, 
demonstrations, rallies, strikes in factories and markets, and 
boycotts of school classes rose sharply. The report said most 
of the cases were because of delays in payment of wages for 
workers and teachers, price rises, resettlement caused by urban 
re-development, hefty levies on peasants and the reclamation of 
farmland. Some erupted as a result of racial and religious 
problems, it said. 
  "As the disputes directly hinged upon the interests of a 
group of people, some incidents were of a larger scale and 
lasted for a long period of time. They involved more people. 
Over the past year, these incidents have increased. (We) should 
have a high degree of vigilance over the problem," the report 
said. 
  The increase in mass unrest was only part of a nationwide 
picture of worsening law and order in the past year, marked by a 
dramatic increase in major crimes, gang activities, social 
evils, fraud, violence and industrial accidents. "The overall 
law and order situation remains grim. The number of problems 
has been relatively large," the report said. 
  The ministry reported that major crime cases handled by 
police officers at all levels had risen by 18 percent annually 
in the past few years. Theft and robbery cases took up 80 
percent of cases it said. Highway robbery had sharply increased 
last year. Crimes on roads and highways remained out of control 
in some places. Gangsters, some armed with guns and knives, had 
seriously endangered social order in some villages and township 
areas, the report said. 
  The ministry highlighted coastal cities when discussing the 
rampant growth of social evils such as the sex trade. Such 
activities have also spread into villages. 
  The total number of fraud cases involving more than 100.000 
yuan (about HK$88,800) soared by 53.2 percent in the previous 
year, it said. There were more than 10 "hundreds of million of 
yuan" cases, including the US$10 billion case (HK$77 billion) in 
a Hebei branch of the Bank of Agriculture, which involved 
malpractices in the issuing of letters of credit. 
  The report accused domestic and international criminal 
elements of collaborating to take advantage of loopholes in the 
financial system, under the guise of fund-raising. Some 
criminals had given bribes to banking officials to siphon 
massive amounts of foreign exchange out of the country, it said. 
  The report pointed out the number of assaults on public 
security officers had also gone up. The number of injuries rose 
from about 600 in 1985 to more than 8,000 last year and 275 were 
killed. 
  The ministry admitted a small number of public security 
officers were involved in corruption. "Although the number is 
small, the impact is really bad. The reputation of the whole 
police force has been tarnished and the relationship between 
them and the masses has been damaged." Following the 
anti-corruption campaign launched last August, it said the 
ministry had handled 1,677 cases of violations of laws and 
regulation by 2,002 public security officers. The report said 
it was hoped a new People's Police Law would be forwarded to the 
Standing Committee for discussion soon. 
  The ministry urged police forces to prepare for unrest and 
to 
closely monitor the situation.

<F P=106> [News conference by Tibetan leaders with foreign and </F>
domestic correspondents, hosted by Wang Zheren, in Beijing on 17 
March -- recorded; from the "Special Program on the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress"] 
  [Text] [Video shows Tibetan leaders and Chinese and 
foreign correspondents taking their seats, cuts to show the 
moderator speaking. To his left are seated, in order, Gyaincain 
Norbu, Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, and Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain. 
Except for Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain who is dressed in a 
traditional Tibetan costume, the other Tibetan leaders are 
dressed in Western business suits] [Wang] Today, all the Tibetan 
deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] are very glad 
to meet with Chinese and foreign correspondents and answer their 
questions. You are now welcome to raise your questions. 
  [China Central Television Station correspondent] I am from 
China Central Television Station. Chairman Raidi has just 
briefed us on Tibet's economic development. My question is: 
Other than relying on the assistance of the central government 
and fraternal provinces and municipalities, how will Tibet duly 
speed up its development to narrow the gap with coastal areas at 
the earliest possible date? Thank you. 
  [Gyaincain Norbu] Regarding the question of how to speed up 
Tibet's economic development in order to narrow the gap with 
fraternal provinces and municipalities, I think the entire party 
and country should consider the overall interests -- seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, accelerating 
development, and maintaining stability. Tibet should also serve 
these overall interests in carrying out its future tasks. 
Guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and by the party's basic line, we should 
continue to thoroughly implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, and focus on the goal of fostering a 
socialist market economy so as to expedite reform and 
development and to maintain stability. To accelerate reform, we 
recently introduced measures to separate profits and taxes 
delivered by state-owned enterprises in farming and pastoral 
areas, as well as measures to reform the social insurance, 
investment, and public housing systems. These measures have 
injected great vitality into development. 
  On the question of development, I think we should mainly 
carry out the following three tasks: 1) We should maintain the 
status of agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation of 
the national economy and strive for more bumper harvests in 
agriculture and animal husbandry this year. 2) We should 
nurture new factors for economic growth. We should concentrate 
on developing processing industries, foreign trade, tertiary 
industries, and village and town enterprises. 3) We should 
continue to develop the energy, transportation, and 
communications sectors; education; science and technology; and 
key infrastructure projects. We have set our future economic 
growth rate at 8 percent. To attain this goal, we should deepen 
reform and accelerate the pace of development. To this end, we 
should consolidate and build upon political stability and unity 
and create a good social environment for reform, opening up, and 
economic development. 
  Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the founding of 
the Tibet Autonomous Region. More than 2.3 million people of 
all nationalities across the region should redouble their 
efforts to realize the goal of accelerating Tibet's development 
and usher in the occasion with practical actions. 
  [Sprinkle, in English fading into Mandarin translation] 
James Sprinkle of THE TIMES of London. It is widely known 
that... [sentence incomplete as heard] This person is the Dalai 
Lama of Tibet. However, in the introduction Chairman Raidi gave 
just now, he did not mention this Tibetan, the Dalai Lama. I 
would like to ask what is the status of the Dalai Lama now? How 
is he regarded by the Tibetan? How are the talks going? 
  [Raidi] Certainly, every Tibetan knows about the Dalai Lama. 
He has been living in exile since 1959 when he took part in a 
rebellion and fled, and he has since been engaged in activities 
aimed at separatism and sabotage of national unity. The central 
government's policy toward the Dalai Lama has been very clear 
all along: He must abandon his stance on the independence of 
Tibet and he is welcome to return home to contribute to the 
country's construction. 
  [China Radio International correspondent] I am a 
correspondent of China Radio International. I would like to ask 
Chairman Raidi about inter-ethnic relations -- relations between 
Tibetan and Han peoples, in particular -- in Tibet. 
  [Raidi] Inter-ethnic relations in Tibet refer mainly to the 
relations between Tibetan and Han people. Tibetan and Han 
people have lived in peace and harmony and enjoyed equality 
since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951. 
  Over the past four decades or more since the peaceful 
liberation of Tibet, the Tibetan and Han people have forged 
profound friendship in their joint efforts of building Tibet. 
They have developed a new form of unbreakable socialist 
inter-ethnic relations. Thus they share a common fate, and can 
never be separated from each other. 
  In spite of the effects of the Cultural Revolution and the 
all- out efforts in recent years by separatists to sow 
dissension among the various nationalities and to sabotage 
national unity -- the troubles they stirred have had some 
effects on national unity in Tibet -- taken together, unity, 
fraternity, mutual trust, and mutual assistance remain the main 
features of Han-Tibetan relations today. In the long history of 
revolution and construction in Tibet, events have repeatedly 
show that Han-Tibetan unity serves as a precondition and 
guarantee for the smooth progress and advancement of all 
undertakings in Tibet. Any acts aimed at sabotaging national 
unity are doomed to failure. In my view, this new type of 
inter-ethnic relations will be developed and consolidated as the 
policy of reform and opening up deepens in Tibet, the economy 
continues to grow, and living standards improve. 
  Certainly, some people say the relations between Tibetan and 
Han people are terrible, that Han people dare not come to Tibet, 
or that Han people are being killed on sight. Nothing of the 
sort! Let me cite an example. Transportation in Tibet depends 
entirely -- 80 to 90 percent at least -- on motor 
transportation. The Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways 
are thousands of kilometers long. Sometimes cars on these 
highways break down, leaving some Han drivers helpless. When 
spotted by Tibetan people, the Han drivers have been invited to 
Tibetan homes and have been served [word indistinct] tea and 
zanba [roasted barley, a staple food of the Tibetans]. Do you 
know what these Han comrades say? My goodness, the Tibetan 
comrades are really nice. As for occasional quarreling and 
bickering, I believe you can find such problems in any society. 
Quarreling and bickering do exist. Taken as a whole, however, 
the relations are good. 
  [(Huang Jikuan)] Taiwan CNA correspondent (Huang Jikuan). 
I have a question for [Regional Party] Secretary Chen 
[Kuiyuan]. Developing the economy is an important way of 
solving the problems of minority nationalities in Tibet. In the 
course of establishing a market economy, what obstacles does 
Tibet need to remove, and what advantages can it bring into 
play? Following the First Sessions of the Eighth NPC and the 
Eighth CPPCC National Committee last year, you led a delegation 
to visit various coastal provinces. Do you plan to do so this 
year? Thank you! 
  [Chen Kuiyuan] Tibet is a remote region of China. Due to 
historical reasons and its unique geographical location, the 
region faces grave obstacles in developing the economy. First 
and foremost, the region is located 4,000 meters above sea 
level. A lack of oxygen high in the mountains makes it very 
difficult for people to carry out productive activities and 
economic exchanges. Meanwhile, as a result of the backward 
nature of its economy in the past and a weak transport and 
energy infrastructure, the region's industrial foundations and 
capabilities are lagging far behind other fraternal provinces 
and regions. Moreover, Tibet also lacks technology and 
scientific and technological personnel. Hence, during the 
socialist modernization drive, Tibet faces more obstacles than 
other provinces and regions. A very important condition for 
developing the economy is to open up markets. However, because 
of Tibet's remote location, the region has special difficulties 
in exploring both domestic and international markets. 
Therefore, the region has to exert greater efforts than other 
provinces and regions in establishing a socialist market 
economy. Tibet's advantages in developing the economy should be 
viewed within the context of macroeconomic environment, without 
which Tibet has more difficulties and fewer advantages. Under 
the macroeconomic environment, the state and fraternal provinces 
and regions have given Tibet tremendous support. To help Tibet 
develop itself, the state has adopted many preferential policies 
for the region. Under the state and fraternal provinces' help 
and through efforts by the people of Tibet, the quality of life 
of the people has improved markedly. In this way, Tibet has 
effectively combined the external environment with the internal 
conditions to develop the regional economy. We have the 
determination and confidence that Tibet's economy will develop 
together with other provinces and regions. During last year's 
NPC and CPPCC sessions, I befriended (Huang Jikuan), who kept an 
eye on my whereabouts. This year, I will visit fraternal 
provinces again to learn from their advanced experiences and to 
further promote economic cooperation between Tibet and fraternal 
provinces. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I was told that freedom of 
religious belief is not fully respected. What is the real 
situation? Would you give specific details in your answer? 
  [Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, in Tibetan fading into Mandarin 
translation] Freedom of religious belief is fully respected in 
Tibet. There are currently some 1,400 Buddhist temples, 
monasteries, and lamaseries to satisfy the needs for normal 
religious life by the masses, with the number of monks and nuns 
over 30,000. Day-to-day religious activities are conducted in 
an orderly manner at temples. In Tibet, the majority of the 
people are Buddhists. Of course, there are nonbelievers too. 
This shows that both religious believers and nonbelievers enjoy 
ample freedom of religious belief. 
  [Wang Zheren] That is the end of today's news conference. 
Thank you all!

<F P=106> [By reporters Liu Haimin (0491 3189 3046) and Zheng Qingdong </F>
(6774 1987 2639)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- This morning, 15 
National People's Congress [NPC] deputies from the "roof of the 
world" proudly voiced the aspirations of more than 2 million 
Tibetan people in front of hundreds of Chinese and foreign 
correspondents in the Tibet room of the Great Hall of the People. 
  Over the years, Tibet has always been a region of great 
public interest, and its deputies have always been the focus of 
the news media during NPC sessions. At the request of Chinese 
and foreign correspondents, Tibetan deputies to the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC were collectively interviewed by the 
news media for the first time today. 
  Deputies, some in Western business suits and some in 
traditional Tibetan costumes, answered each and every question 
with ease and confidence in front of flashing cameras. Raidi, a 
serf who became a senior leading cadre as deputy director of the 
Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee and chairman of the 
Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress Standing Committee, 
first told the correspondents joyously: "Tibet currently enjoys 
political stability, economic development, social progress, 
national unity, and higher living standards. Its situation is 
heartening and its prospects are bright." 
  Relations among various nationalities in Tibet were an issue 
of general concern to the Chinese and foreign correspondents. 
Deputy Raidi said: Tibet is an inalienable part of the sacred 
motherland. The Tibetan nationality is a member of the Chinese 
nation. In the 40-plus years since its peaceful liberation in 
1951, Tibet has followed a glorious course along with other 
nationalities in all parts of the country. In recent years, 
splittist elements within and outside the national boundaries, 
with the support and tacit encouragement of anti-Chinese forces 
in the international community, have waged many activities aimed 
at splitting the motherland, including those aimed at creating 
disturbances and troubles in Lhasa. Nevertheless, people of all 
nationalities across the country, including Tibetan compatriots, 
have firmly opposed these splittist activities. 
  "Order leads to a country's ascendancy, whereas chaos leads 
to its downfall." People of all nationalities in Tibet have 
drawn this conclusion from the past and the present. Deputy 
Raidi said: "Over the past several decades, the central 
authorities have always shown great concern for Tibet's 
construction and social development. Other localities have also 
lent full support and assistance to Tibet. The central 
authorities have implemented an array of preferential policies 
and provided full financial and material support, thereby 
rapidly developing the productive forces in chronically 
underdeveloped Tibet. Compared to the pre-liberation period, 
Tibet's entire social outlook has undergone tremendous historic 
changes." 
  Raidi cited the follow statistics to substantiate his 
statement: In 1993, Tibet's gross regional product amounted to 
3.65 billion yuan, up 8.1 percent from the previous year; 
agriculture registered a bumper harvest for the sixth year, with 
the total grain output reaching 620,000 tonnes; per capita net 
income of peasants and herdsmen was 521 yuan, an increase of 180 
percent over 10 years ago; ..... [ellipses as received] 
  In recent years, some people of the international community 
have shown an interest in the so-called state of human rights in 
Tibet. When a foreign correspondent raised this question, Losang 
-- a neighborhood committee chairman of Chengguan District of 
Lhasa City who was a serf along with his father and grandfather 
-- said promptly: "Whoever wants to discuss the state of human 
rights in Tibet is ignorant of history. I am most qualified to 
answer this question since I used to be a serf." 
  "Old Tibet was a society of serfdom combining religion and 
politics," said Losang with deep emotion while taking off his 
black Tibetan cap. He said loudly in Tibetan: "In old Tibet, 
the vast number of people were bullied and oppressed as serfs 
and had no rights whatsoever of which to speak. We had no 
political rights, no economic equality, not even freedom of 
marriage. We suffered beatings and hardships. At the slightest 
displeasure of the owners, serfs were sent to prisons, or had 
their heads and legs chopped off. Our right of survival was not 
guaranteed, not to mention our rights as human beings." 
  Losong said: It was only after the democratic reform in 
Tibet in 1959 that the vast number of Tibetans began to enjoy 
true human rights and to feel the warmth of the big family of 
nationalities. Especially since the implementation of the reform 
and opening up policy, life is improving with each new day; and 
the people are fully enjoying their rights as human beings and 
citizens. Their lives today as compared to pre-liberation days 
are as far apart as heaven and earth. 
  Speaking forcefully, Losong said: "Without knowing well the 
historical background, it is hard to understand things now. We 
people who experienced serfdom in old Tibet understand best what 
human rights are. Any attempt to use the so-called human rights 
issue to realize ulterior motives is doomed to fail, and is 
ludicrous." 
  Answering a question on whether Han people have been 
emigrating to Tibet in large numbers, Losang Toinzhub, vice 
chairman of the Tibetan Regional People's Government and mayor 
of Lhasa, said that assertion is a sheer nonsense. He said: 
Among a population of 400,000 in Lhasa, Tibetans account for 87 
percent and Han less than 12 percent. In recent years, many 
people from inland areas have come to Tibet to do business. 
They have helped enliven the market and contributed to economic 
development. This is a result of the policy of reform and 
opening up. They have, together with local people of all 
nationalities, made great contributions to Tibet's economic 
development. 
  Speaking of religious beliefs, Losang Gyaincain, vice 
chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Regional 
People's Congress and president of the Tibetan Buddhist 
Association, said: Tibet is home to more than 1,400 temples and 
over 30,000 monks and nuns. Thanks to the implementation of the 
party's policy on religion, people of all nationalities are 
enjoying the right of freedom of religious belief. There are 
people who believe in religion and those who do not in Tibet. 
This facts represents an aspect of the freedom of religious 
belief in Tibet. 
  Asked about whether there is any change in the Central 
Government's policy toward the Dalai Lama, Deputy Raidi said: 
Dalai has been living in exile since 1959, when he took part in 
a rebellion and fled. He has since engaged in activities aimed 
at separatism and sabotage of national unity. The central 
government's policy toward the Dalai Lama has been very clear 
all along: He is welcome to return home to contribute to the 
country's construction if he abandons his stance on splitting 
the motherland and sabotaging national unity. 
  Deputy Raidi told the Chinese and foreign correspondents 
present: "Under the guidance of the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, the First Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
people of all nationalities in Tibet -- amid the tidal waves of 
reform, opening up, and developing a socialist market economy -- 
are determined to seize the favorable opportunity, work hard to 
build a socialist market economic system, deepen reform, and 
concentrate their energies to develop the economy." He said 
that he is confident that Tibet will become more united, 
prosperous, democratic, and civilized.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Revolutionary 
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang [RCCK] Central Committee 
held a cocktail party today to entertain some of the National 
People's Congress [NPC] deputies and Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] members from Hong Kong and Macao 
attending the two sessions [the Second Sessions of the Eighth 
NPC and Eighth CPPCC National Committee] in Beijing. 
  RCCK Central Committee Chairman Li Peiyao proposed a toast, 
and said: Promoting the motherland's peaceful reunification is 
a major task of the RCCK. In recent years, the RCCK has been 
widely supported for its work in this respect. Within this 
century, China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and 
Macao, and the Taiwan issue will also be placed more urgently in 
front of the people. The RCCK is willing to join hands with 
various sectors and jointly contribute toward the great cause in 
the reversion of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland as well 
as the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan 
Strait. 
  At the party, people from Hong Kong and Macao held cordial 
conversations as well as renewed their friendships with leading 
comrades of the RCCK Central Committee. In addition, they 
exchanged views on many issues. In an enthusiastic atmosphere, 
the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to toast 
for the motherland's prosperity and the people's progress.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondents Zhu Dongju (2612 0392 5468) and </F>
Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7486)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- In his speech at the 
third Plenary Meeting of the Second Session of the Eighth 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], CPPCC member Li Ganliu, vice 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee 
of the Chinese Kuomintang [RCCK], addressed the Kuomintang [KMT] 
authorities in Taiwan on behalf of the RCCK Central Committee in 
connection with the great cause of China's reunification: The 
principle of "peaceful reunification, one country and two 
systems," proposed by the CPC, is the only correct way to solve 
the Taiwan issue. 
  Li Ganliu said: This policy reflects the will of the people 
of all nationalities across the country; embodies the CPC's 
sincerity and goodwill; takes cares of history and reality; 
takes into account the interests of the people of all walks of 
life in Taiwan; and is in line with the national conditions and 
wishes of the people. 
  Li Ganliu pointed out: Since the beginning of last year, 
significant changes have taken place in relations between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait and in the situation of peaceful 
reunification. The mainstream in the development of the 
situation is a positive one, which manifests itself mainly as 
follows: Cross- Strait economic ties are becoming closer, and a 
pattern of economic and trade development characterized by 
mutual complementarity and mutual benefit has initially taken 
shape. Contacts between personnel of both sides are becoming 
more frequent, with the level of contact rising steadily; 
exchanges have entered a new stage in which extensive and 
in-depth discussions have been conducted in various branches of 
learning. Progress made in the "Wang-Ku talks" has contributed 
to an historic stride forward in standardizing and 
institutionalizing cross-Strait exchanges. Finally, the white 
paper on "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," published 
in a timely manner by the State Council, demonstrates the 
Chinese Government's principled stand and basic principle for 
solving the Taiwan issue; thereby safeguarding state sovereignty 
and territorial integrity, solemnly repudiating the fallacies on 
"two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," as well as "Taiwan 
independence," and invoking a strong response at home and abroad. 
  "However, some new negative factors unfavorable to peaceful 
reunification are increasing within the island of Taiwan, 
enhancing obstacles to the development of cross-Strait 
relations." Li Ganliu said: In the past year or so, on the one 
hand the KMT authorities on Taiwan have continued to pursue its 
unpopular mainland policy to seriously interfere with the 
further development of cross-Strait relations and to obstruct 
the opening of "Three links" between the two sides; on the other 
hand, internationally, the KMT authorities have been pursuing 
more intensively their separatist policy known as "a phased 
two-China policy," and vigorously launched their "money 
offensive" and "elastic diplomacy" tactics. In particular, last 
year the KMT authorities escalated their activities on 
"returning to the United Nations" with the aim of winning "dual 
representation," and recently they launched their so-called 
"vacation diplomacy." Facts have proven that the KMT authorities 
on Taiwan have not changed their erroneous stand on the question 
of reunification at all. If this situation continues, they will 
never be able to free themselves from being passive, and they 
will become more and more isolated. 
  Li Ganliu stressed: Mr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out long ago 
that "In the face of the mighty tidal current of the world, 
those who bow before it survive and those who resist perish." 
Reunifying the motherland to invigorate the Chinese nation is 
the common aspiration of the Chinese people, including the 
compatriots in Taiwan as well as the Chinese nationals overseas, 
and is an irresistible historical trend. If the KMT in Taiwan 
is not blinded by its own interest but is willing to be a 
responsible political party, it should put the interest of the 
nation above all else, conform to the trend of the times and the 
desire of the people, and make a correct choice. The stalling 
tactics it has been adopting in an attempt to seek temporary 
comfort and ease will not last long. Its attempt to create "two 
Chinas" in a disguised form by relying on foreign forces is 
doomed to fail. A reliable guarantee to ensure a sustained 
development of Taiwan's economy is to rely on the mainland and 
to maintain a mutually beneficial and mutually supplementary 
relationship with it. The KMT authorities in Taiwan should 
reach an appropriate conclusion after weighing the advantages 
and disadvantages. 
  Li Ganliu said: China's affairs should be solved by the 
Chinese people themselves. The Taiwan issue is an internal 
affair of China. We strongly support our government's just stand 
in safeguarding national dignity and opposing interference by 
any external forces. A wise policy for the KMT authorities in 
Taiwan to adopt is to cast away illusion, look facts squarely in 
the face, change their attitude, be sincere, accept the proposal 
of the CPC, agree to establishing the "three links" as soon as 
possible, and conduct talks between the KMT and CPC. So long as 
consensus on the reunification of the motherland is reached, all 
problems can be solved through consultations. The Revolutionary 
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang shares historical origins 
with the KMT on Taiwan, and has a responsibility to promote the 
reunification of the motherland. At this important juncture, we 
would like to sincerely offer our advice. We hope the KMT 
authorities in Taiwan will think carefully and make a decision 
in the interest of the country and nation, so as to bring a 
bright future for the people of Taiwan and write a new page in 
the annals of the KMT.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- A tax revenue-sharing 
(TRS) system introduced since the beginning of this year, which 
readjusts interests between central and local governments, has 
had the understanding of local officials, especially those from 
rich provinces and cities. 
  Under the TRS system, one of a series of recent, major 
reforms, taxes are classified and collected separately by the 
central and local governments, ensuring that both have stable 
income sources, with the central government gaining a larger 
share of increased incomes. The new system has taken 
international practices as reference. 
  Like other major reforms, the new taxation system will have 
a 
long-term and fundamental positive effect on local economies and 
create some temporary difficulties for some departments or 
localities. 
  Whether or not local governments will put the national 
interests above their own and whether or not they are willing to 
accept the new system, therefore, will decide the progress and 
even the success or failure of the TRS system. 
  At the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress here, local leaders have shown their understanding of 
the need to give priority to overall national interests when 
discussing the new taxation system. 
  They agree that the TRS system will have great significance 
for promoting a rational growth of state coffers, increasing the 
central financial power and beefing up the central government's 
macro- economic regulating capacity. In the long run, the new 
system will be conducive to a fast, sustained and sound 
development of the national economy. The local and central 
governments have no differences on this understanding. 
  Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said that a socialist market economy 
will not work without behavioral standards. Reform of the 
financial and taxation systems aim to set standards and norms to 
adjust interest relations between the state enterprises and 
between the central and local governments. If the proportion of 
revenues for the central coffers is too small to carry out macro 
regulations, the whole situation may be thrown into chaos and it 
will be difficult for Shanghai to develop under such 
circumstances. Therefore, Shanghai gives active support for the 
TRS system. 
  Statistics show that the revenues of the central treasury 
accounted for only 45 percent of the total financial revenues of 
the country in 1992. During the year, the central treasury had 
to pay half of its expenditures by issuing bonds and borrowing 
loans. 
  While local financial departments gained substantial 
increases of revenues last year, difficulties of central 
finances deteriorated. A weakening of the central financial 
power was attributed mainly to the contractual financial system 
which diverted the lion's share of increased incomes to 
localities in the past decade. 
  A goal of the TRS system is to increase the proportion of 
revenues for the central coffers to 57 percent of the total, 
which is considered necessary for the state treasury to perform 
normally. 
  Chen Huanyou, governor of Jiangsu Province, said realization 
of the goal means localities will increase their revenue 
contributions to the central coffers gradually. Though local 
economies may be affected to a certain extent, the impact should 
be temporary only. "with a `bigger cake' and growth of the 
national economy, localities will be benefited," he said. 
  Provincial officials estimate that Jiangsu will contribute 
an 
additional 18.5 billion yuan to the central coffers between now 
and the year 2000 under the TRS system. 
  Shanghai and Jiangsu have led the country in contributions 
to 
the central treasury in the past decades. In 1993 Shanghai 
handed over 13 billion yuan and jiangsu, 7.6 billion yuan, 
accounting for 70 percent and 50 percent of their local 
financial revenues respectively. 
  The new taxation system will affect some provinces that 
develop rapidly. Guangdong will be at the front to bear the 
brunt. 
  According to the new system, 70 percent of a locality's 
increased revenues will be handed over to the central coffers, 
with the locality itself keeping the rest. Of Guangdong's 
financial revenues of 34 billion yuan in 1993, only two billion 
yuan was turned over to the state under the old financial 
system. Under the new TRS system, Guangdong has to hand over 
many times that amount to the central treasury this year. 
  However, leaders of Guangdong Province expressed their 
support for the new system. Governor Zhu Senlin said the new 
system means a redefining of relations between the central and 
local authorities rather than a recall of local power. 
  The measure will mobilize local initiatives and facilitate a 
readjustment of the country's economic structure, he said. 
  Huang Kehua, director of the Finance Bureau of Shandong 
Province, said increased revenues for the central government 
will enable it to carry out macro-economic controls effectively. 
  Since the second half of last year, the central government 
has adopted a series of macro-economic control measures, which 
have alleviated and solved some economic contradictions and 
problems. Achievements made so far have helped people understand 
the necessity of macro-economic controls in the process of 
establishing a market economy. 
  Zhang Ruifu, director of the Finance Bureau of Hunan 
Province, said that macro-economic controls can alleviate and 
solve the problems of unfair wealth distribution and regional 
imbalance. Solution of the two problems is considered an 
important factor for social and political stability in China. 
  "The central treasury, with increased revenues, can better 
support underdeveloped areas, agricultural provinces and ethnic 
minority areas," he added. 
  For this reason, Hunan, Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan and other 
inland provinces have placed great hopes on the new taxation 
system. 
  In enforcing the new TRS system, the central government has 
adopted a gradual approach and shown a certain degree of 
flexibility. This, meant to protect the vested interests of 
localities, also wins votes for the TRS system. 
  For instance, the central treasury will return a certain 
amount of revenues to localities based on their 1993 
contributions; localities which used to receive subsidies from 
the central coffers will continue to retain this privilege for a 
period to come; provinces and regions with a concentration of 
ethnic minority people will be allowed to adopt some 
transitional methods to alleviate the pressure on lower-level 
financial departments. 
  Though the new taxation system has been implemented smoothly 
in the past months, financial experts said that it is necessary 
to study contradictions and problems arising in its 
implementation, study countermeasures timely and minimize its 
negative effect.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Haimin (0491 3189 3046)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Faced with the great 
tide of reform and opening up, people in Hunan have begun to 
think: As a large agricultural province, how can Hunan bring 
its strong points into play and do its best to work out its 
potential? NPC Deputy and Hunan Governor Chen Bangzhu said: 
Hunan is working on a new framework for agriculture to meet 
China's and the world's needs. 
  Over the past few years, Hunan, a province with more than 50 
million peasants, has made gratifying achievements in reform and 
opening up. It made major strides in reforming the agricultural 
structure, expanded acreage of top quality rice, increased 
production of cash crops by a wide margin, and made a 
breakthrough in developing breeding of special aquatic products. 
For the first time, Hunan's total output of agricultural 
production topped 50 billion yuan. The proportion of non-grain 
crops in the total agricultural output increased from 38.3 
percent to 40 percent; the proportion of forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in total 
agricultural output increased from 47.4 percent to 48.6 percent; 
and in the total social output value of rural areas, the output 
of non-agricultural sectors increased from 47.9 percent to 56 
percent. Every year, Hunan exports more than 2 billion jin of 
grains and more than 5 million hogs to support other regions. 
In Hong Kong, one-quarter of the hogs on the market come from 
Hunan. 
  Although Hunan has made such brilliant progress, Chen 
Bangzhu 
is still not satisfied with its agricultural development. He 
believes it is unacceptable for Hunan not to make progress under 
the new situation. 
  Chen Bangzhu arranged a new "blueprint" for this reporter on 
the tea table using an ashtray, tea cups, and document pouches 
to explain his plan. 
  Chen Bangzhu said: "We should gear science and technology 
toward agriculture." He continued: We need science and 
technology to guide us on the road of seeking high yields, and 
improving product quality and farming efficiency. Beginning 
this year, we will focus on tackling problems in agrotechnology, 
and developing science and technology in all agricultural 
fields. We will pay close attention to 40 counties in which 
commodity grain bases were established, 15 high-quality cotton 
bases, and three special model areas known for their high-yield, 
high-quality, and efficient agriculture. Hunan will quicken the 
popularization and establishment of a science and technology 
service system, especially the construction of agrotechnology 
education centers in towns and townships. We will set up 
agrotechnology education centers extensively, to broaden the 
scale of scientific and technological popularization, and 
increase projects in this field in a bid to carry out the 
strategy of comprehensively supporting, systematically 
developing, and wide- rangingly popularizing agrotechology. 
  Chen Bangzhu said: We must make efforts in agricultural 
development. We must integrate resource exploration with market 
demands and comprehensive development of mountain areas with the 
scheme of helping the poor. Hunan is blessed with rich natural 
resources. It has more than 0.2 billion mu of mountainous land, 
20 million mu of water areas, 4 million mu of vegetable plots, 
and more than 5 million mu scattered pieces of land, showing 
great development potential. Since last year, Hunan has begun 
to quicken development. It has increased 0.2 million mu of 
cotton filed; 0.355 million mu of improved tea-oil tree plots; 
16,000 mu of newly- developed water areas; 26,000 mu of shoaly 
land; 40,000 mu of model bases of high-quality economic forests; 
new production bases for cows, sheep, rabbits, and aquatic 
products; and gardens for high- quality fruits. We have opened 
up the road of development and will continue to make major 
strides in the future. 
  Chen Bangzhu said: "Exchange-earning export of agricultural 
products is a pillar of our new agricultural framework." Last 
year, Hunan earned $210 million from exporting agricultural and 
sideline products. However, the production of finely processed 
products is still insufficient. We need to make efforts to 
increase the added value of our farm products. We must develop 
some leading products and gradually set up production areas and 
operate them on a large scale. 
  "People in Hunan should pay attention to both domestic and 
foreign markets. A new chapter will definitely be added to 
Hunan's agriculture," said Chen Bangzhu confidently.

  [Text] [First Announcer] Bai Lichen, deputy of the 
National People's Congress and chairman of the Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Regional People's Government, talked about the 
influence of nationalities' religions over unity among 
nationalities in the light of Ningxia's characteristics. He 
said to reporter (Lian Jun): 
  [Begin recording] The Hui nationality has a population of 
1.6 million in Ningxia, which is China's region where the Hui 
nationality lives in most compact communities. Due to various 
historical and geological reasons, the major areas where the Hui 
nationlity lives in compact communities have two 
characteristics: First, they are comparatively backward in 
general education and economically underdeveloped. At present, 
many people still live in poverty. Second, religions exert a 
comparatively great influence here. Contradictions between 
different religious sects and within a religious sect itself 
have occurred from time to time. Therefore, we have attached 
great importance to the nationalities and religious issues for a 
long time; we have conscientiously implemented the party's 
policies on nationalities and religion, as well as the law on 
autonomy in regions inhabited by minority nationalities; we have 
vigorously selected and promoted various trained personnel of 
minority nationalities; and we have enabled them to play an 
important role at their respective posts. Practice has made us 
realize that unity among nationalities and among different 
religions in areas inhabited by minority nationalities is very 
important. It has a direct bearing on social stability and on 
economic development. We must always pay attention to properly 
handling the relationships among unity, stability, and 
devleopment. [end recording] 
  [Second Announcer] (Wan Ling), it seems that facing the 
facts, admitting the gap, strengthening unity, and deepening 
reform to turn the strong points in natural resources to 
economic strong points have become a consensus on reform reached 
by all the deputies from the regions inhabited by minority 
nationalities. 
  [First Announcer] You are right. We believe China's vast 
expanse of regions inhabited by minority nationalities will have 
a brighter future and will surely usher in an era of economic 
achievements through the joint efforts by the people of all 
nationalities in the regions inhabited by minority nationalities.

Xingtang (1776 5281 1016): "Change Concepts To Seek Development 
-- An Interview With Qinghai Governor and National People's 
Congress Deputy Tian Chengping"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Although their province 
is still being labeled as a "resource-rich, poverty-stricken 
province," the people of Qinghai are as determined and 
courageous as their counterparts in the hinterland in seizing 
opportunities to develop their economy. During an interview by 
reporters, Qinghai Governor Tian Chengping, who is a deputy to 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC], said confidently: "Everybody is talking about 
opportunities. Qinghai Province is similarly faced with very 
rare development opportunities." 
  Such opportunities primarily signify that this year's 
surging 
tide of reform will breathe new life into Qinghai's economy. 
Meanwhile, the current NPC session has given the people of 
Qinghai a profound sense that economic development in west China 
is commanding growing attention. 
  A review of their past achievements gives the people of 
Qinghai both gratification and anxiety. In 1993, Qinghai 
Province topped the 10-billion-yuan mark in two areas, achieving 
10.1 billion yuan in total output value of goods and services 
and 10.2 billion yuan in total industrial and agricultural 
output value. There were more than 60 "partly or wholly 
foreign-owned" enterprises. For the people of Qinghai, these 
figures were not achieved easily. The numbers pale in 
comparison with those of economically developed provinces. The 
people of Qinghai cannot but face this harsh reality: they are 
lagging further and further behind the eastern regions in 
economic development. 
  In light of this disparity, the people of Qinghai are 
beginning to reevaluate their advantages and disadvantages. 
Tian Chengping first touted Qinghai's enviable "resources" in 
front of the reporters. Qinghai has energy resources. Located 
in the upper reaches of the Huang He, it abounds in 
hydroelectric resources, which are mainly concentrated in the 
Longyang Gorge. Its salt lakes contain vast, high-grade 
resources. Western Qinghai has ample petroleum and natural gas 
resources, and its proven natural gas resources are the 
country's fifth largest. Qinghai is also endowed with abundant 
nonferrous metals, and flocks of cattle and sheep can be seen 
everywhere. 
  Why, then, have the people of Qinghai suffered privation 
while guarding their "gold mountain"? There are many reasons. 
Qinghai is an outlying province which lacks advanced 
communications facilities, funds, and skilled manpower. Tian 
Chengping did not dwell on these problems, though. He 
maintained: Although Qinghai must improve these conditions for 
the sake of economic development, its most important task is to 
change its concepts and move quickly to foster new notions, 
ideas, and thinking suited to the market economy. 
  Tian Chengping said: The people of Qinghai must at least 
change their "mentalities" in the following four areas: 
  1) They should abandon the concept born of a self-contained, 
conservative, and self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy, 
moving quickly to foster commodity and market concepts. Take 
animal husbandry as an example. They should no longer feel 
honored by the "large number of livestock in their possession" 
but should improve the slaughter rate in every possible way. 2) 
They should modify the concept born of excessive reliance under 
the planned economy of the past, in favor of a concept that 
favors competition in the market and independent development. 
In recent years, Qinghai provided highway construction jobs in 
lieu of relief, creating a good opportunity for increasing 
income. The jobs were taken up by laborers from the eastern 
regions because some local people were unwilling to take them. 
Instead of helping themselves, these people would rather wait 
for state relief. 3) They should discard the notion that 
encourages seclusion, moving to foster a concept that favors 
opening up in all directions. They should no longer think that 
they will suffer at the hands of outsiders and lose their 
benefits to the latter. In any event, we have witnessed 
appreciable changes in this respect. In recent years, Qinghai 
established partnership relationships with 14 counties and 
cities in Shandong by which the two sides exchanged cadres and 
harnessed their respective strengths for mutual benefit and 
common development. The practice was very successful. 4) 
Cadres and people should foster a new concept that encourages 
bold action to overtake others, discarding the previous notion 
that a peaceful life will suffice. They should no longer aim 
for only a moderate level of prosperity, should stop muddling 
along, and should no longer revert to lounging in the sunshine 
despite what they think and say. They should truly rouse 
themselves to action and swim courageously in the ocean of the 
market economy. 
  At this point, Tian Chengping sounded very excited. This man 
from northern China had performed brilliantly in Beijing's 
Xicheng District before being transferred to Qinghai to serve as 
its governor. He is now working heroically and enthusiastically 
on the loess soil of Qinghai. He told reporters: On the one 
hand, we should urge the state to give the western regions 
preferential treatment in terms of policy and funds; on the 
other hand, we should liberate our minds, change our concepts, 
rely on ourselves, and carry out arduous pioneering work. Only 
by doing so can we push Qinghai's economy onto the path toward 
prosperity and strength at an early date. 
  At the end of the interview, Tian Chengping said: "Qinghai 
will not and should not remain poor forever."

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- A new flow of migrant 
rural laborers to urban areas soon after the traditional Spring 
Festival has caught attention from deputies to the National 
People's Congress (NPC) at its current session here. They said 
this major social phenomenon is becoming a historical trend for 
China. 
  For some years, in early spring, tens of thousands of young 
farmers, men and women, from land-locked provinces of Sichuan, 
Hunan and Guizhou streamed into economically developed Pearl and 
Chang Jiang River deltas, Beijing, Tianjin and other cities to 
work, make money and learn technology. Such a grand scene in 
China's economic and social arena is described vividly as a 
"wave of migrating farmer-laborers." 
  Statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture shows that, of 
China's total rural workforce of 430 million, 130 million are in 
redundance. Besides the 110 million already employed by township 
enterprises, 20 million are on the move every year. Guangdong, 
China's showcase province in reform and opening up in the south, 
leads the country in absorbing outsider farmers, which total 
more than 10 million. 
  Sichuan, China's most populous province and leading grain 
producer, is a major source of the wave. Due to its limited 
farmland, 20 million farmers have become surplus. "Three months 
to work in the fields, two months to spend the Spring Festival 
holiday season and seven months to idle away at leisure" is a 
typical style of their life. 
  They are eager to find jobs and fortunes in a new world. In 
1989, the first groups of Sichuan farmers left their land for 
jobs elsewhere. The "Sichuan armies" of migrant farmers have 
since become well known throughout the country. 
  Xiao Yang, governor of Sichuan and an NPC deputy, said that 
in 1993, five million farmers from Sichuan found jobs in all the 
other provinces, regions and municipalities except Taiwan. 
Remittances they sent back home amounted to five billion yuan 
that year. 
  Zuo Mingzhong, a farmer deputy, said farmers's concepts have 
changed a lot. To them farmland is no longer their sole source 
for subsistence. Migrant farmers have broadened their horizons, 
learned skills and improved cultural and educational standards 
by assimilating nutrition from modern industries and urban 
civilization. 
  Many farmers have returned home with technology and 
information procured from developed areas. They have launched 
businesses in their hometowns to help their villagers get 
prosperous, Zuo said. 
  Li Youwei, major of Shenzhen city and an NPC deputy, said 
migrant farmers are a main workforce in the construction of the 
special economic zone. They work mainly in labor-intensive 
construction, transportation and toy industries. 
  In Shenzhen, they are well received since they are good 
workers, Li said. 
  Economists and sociologists among the NPC deputies maintain 
that the "wave of migrating farmer-laborers" is a historical 
trend under China's fledging market economic structure and 
planned allocation of production factors. The wave is, in 
essence, a process of optimizing the allocation of production 
factors -- a shift of rural laborers from areas with low 
productivity and efficiency to areas with higher standards. 
  Some years ago, farmers moved locally, to non-agricultural 
sectors. But now they moved to other areas and are becoming 
urbanized. 
  This tremendous social change shows that Chinese farmers who 
have relied on farming for centuries have begun to take part in 
the great modernization process and share social-economic 
benefits arising therefrom. "This is a historical progress," 
economists and sociologists said. 
  They predicted, therefore, Chinese farmers are making their 
third great creation, following their first creation of the 
family-based farming system and their second creation of rural 
enterprises. 
  The "wave of migrating farmer-laborers," however, has also 
become a headache for relevant authorities. For instance, the 
outflow of young farmers will hamper the modernization process 
in rural areas. The presence of armies of migrant farmers have 
put strains on transportation departments and management of 
public order in urban areas. 
  Experts suggested governments exercise macro-guidance and 
coordination over the inter-regional flow of farmers in order to 
avoid chaos and set up more employment agencies to provide job 
information, training and consultation. 
  Towns and townships should become the main reservoir to 
siphon surplus laborers in order to slow down their speedy flow 
to urban areas, according to the experts. 
  They said that if China's existing 60 large and medium-sized 
cities are set to absorb rural surplus laborers, every city will 
have one million people more. So that is a choice. And there 
are also potentials in this regard for 300 small cities and 
2,000 county towns. In addition, about 2,000 towns and 
townships out of a total 5,000 can be developed into "farmer 
towns." Thus it will be possible to absorb the 100 million 
surplus farmers. 
  Recently, officials from nine provinces and regions which 
have the biggest flow of migrant farmers in and out gathered in 
Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi Province, to explore ways to 
strengthen organization and distribution of migrant farmers. 
The Ministry of Labor is also planning to study how to make 
rural laborers flow in an orderly way and how to get farmers 
employed in non-agricultural sectors.

(1728 4135 0193)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- "Chinese-invested 
enterprises' active participation in Hong Kong's economic 
development has continually enhanced the `China factor' in Hong 
Kong's economic growth in recent years and helped ensure Hong 
Kong's smooth transition and economic prosperity," said Huang 
Diyan, deputy to the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress who is vice chairman of the Board of Directors 
and concurrently director of Hong Kong and Macao Office of the 
Bank of China, when he assessed the role of Chinese enterprises 
in Hong Kong's economy. 
  He said: Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong have expanded 
rapidly in the past nine years since it entered the transitional 
period in 1985. Thanks to the opportunities provided by the 
hinterland's reform and opening up, old Chinese enterprises -- 
such as the China Resources Group, Merchants Steam Navigation 
Group, International Travel Service, Bank of China, and People's 
Insurance Company -- have advanced by leaps and bounds, each 
with a total asset reaching from 1 to as much as several hundred 
billion Hong Kong dollars [HK$]. The groups' business 
activities have become internationalized and diversified. For 
example, the Bank of China Group, with over HK$400 billion in 
deposits and HK$700 billion in assets, has become the second 
largest financial group in Hong Kong. New Chinese- enterprises 
-- such as the International Trust and Investment Corporation, 
Everbright, Construction International, Guangdong Enterprises 
Group, and many others -- have developed vigorously and 
attracted broad attention. 
  He said: Chinese enterprises are playing an increasingly 
important role in Hong Kong's economic activities. The China 
Resourses Group and other enterprises, which transport and 
manage all kinds of basic means of subsistence, especially those 
supplied by the hinterland, have played an active role in 
stabilizing the livelihood of the compatriots and curbing 
inflation in Hong Kong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation 
Company and Guangdong Enterprises Group have also occupied a 
very important position in Hong Kong's maritime and inland 
navigation, especially navigation linking to the hintherland's 
ports. The Bank of China Group has channeled its more than 
HK$200 billion loans to support Hong Kong's industry, commerce, 
and infrastructure, and to meet the demand for capital by 
various sectors of society. Last year, the group issued loans 
amounting to HK$16 billion to support local industry and HK$100 
billion to help local residents buy housing units in installment 
payments. The Bank of China Group has also actively helped the 
local authorities stabilize Hong Kong's financial markets many 
times and maintain the sound operation of Hong Kong banking and 
stock businesses, thereby winning praise from Hong Kong society. 
  Huang Diyan concluded: In the future, Chinese enterprises in 
Hong Kong should step up efforts to build up their strength and 
strengthen the economic foundation for Hong Kong's smooth 
transition. He added: Chinese enterprises should not only play 
an important role in economic activities but also strive to be 
their own spokesman politically and have their own 
representatives in the Legislative Council's function groups.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS)--Member of the CPPCC and 
former vice minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
Mr. Wei Yuming forecast today that China would continue to have 
an adverse balance of trade this year but that it would be less 
than that of last year. 
  He summarized the following factors adversely affecting an 
increase of Chinese exports this year: 
  --Foreign trade enterprises are lacking circulating capital 
and it will be difficult for them to get bank loans. There will 
also be a shortage of funds for the purchase of goods for export. 
  --The purchasing price for goods for export will increase 
following the price hike in the country. This will affect 
export goods' prices and the confidence of overseas businessmen 
in Chinese commodities. 
  The depressed world economy will lead to a small demand from 
overseas markets. 
  Mr. Wei said that foreign trade enterprises last year had 
achieved more autonomy in their management and had received 
financial aid from banks in the country. China was planning to 
set up banks dealing with import- and export-related business. 
Such things would help meet this year's foreign trade target. 
  Mr. Wei, who is now director of a research group for reform 
of the Chinese foreign trade system, said that the most 
difficult period for reform of the foreign trade system had now 
gone. Difficulties now facing China were how to develop various 
kinds of markets, letting the foreign trade enterprises move 
towards forming large-scale groups and how to prevent a draining 
of talented people from this sector.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of 
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held its third plenary meeting 
at the Great Hall of the People this morning. Ten CPPCC members 
took the floor to give their views on the country's major 
policies. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
chaired 
today's meeting. 
  Yang Rudai, Zhao Puchu, and An Zijie served as executive 
chairmen at today's meeting. Wen Jiabao, alternate member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and member of the 
Secretariat; State Councillor Peng Peiyun; and comrades in 
charge of ministries and commissions under the State Council 
took part in today's meeting. 
  CPPCC member Fang Rongxin was the first to take the floor. 
On behalf of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, 
he called for stepping up efforts to carry out the population 
work to keep up with the development of the socialist market 
economy. He pointed out: To keep up with the development of 
the situation, we must resolve the population issue, and reform 
provides the fundamental solution. We must continue to uphold 
the target responsibility system in managing the population; 
strengthen grass-roots and basic construction in population 
management; perfect the population management network of rural 
townships and villages and urban neighborhood committees; and 
adopt different methods to improve the quality of our population 
to ensure long-term steady economic development. 
  Member Zhu Guangya spoke on behalf of the China Association 
for Science and Technology, appealing to entire society to truly 
respect science. He said: According to survey, the phenomena 
of failure to respect science and talented personnel has become 
a factor obstructing the healthy development of socialist market 
economy and the building of spiritual civilization. This must 
arouse close attention of entire society and leading departments 
at all levels. He hoped that China's legal system would depend 
on and respect science; provide legal guarantee for scientists 
and technicians who publicize science, and popularize scientific 
knowledge, and bring fake and shoddy products and false 
advertisements into light so as to further develop the social 
trend of "respecting knowledge and professionally trained 
personnel." 
  On behalf of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary 
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, member Li Ganliu offered a 
suggestion to Taiwan's Kuomintang: The best policy is to quit 
fantasizing, face the reality, change attitude, and sincerely 
accept the CPC's proposal, agree to conduct "three exchanges" 
with China, and hold talks with the CPC as early as possible. 
He said: As long as we reach a consensus on reunification of 
the motherland, can we resolve any problems by negotiations. He 
hoped that Taiwan's Kuomintang would give careful consideration 
to this suggestion, thus making decisions conducive to the 
nation, bringing about a bright future for Taiwan people, and 
writing a new chapter for our history. 
  On behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic 
League, member Jiang Jingbo spoke on strengthening democratic 
supervision, and bringing into full play the role of democratic 
parties in socialist democratic political construction. He 
said: Democratic parties in China share the glorious history of 
fighting side by side with the CPC. They also share the common 
object of struggle under the new historical period. As a 
result, a solid ideological and political foundation for the 
CPC-led multiparty cooperation system has thus been established. 
Cooperation implies supervision. We believed that the 
democratic supervision role of democratic parties would be 
brought into full play and China's socialist democratic 
political construction would continue to develop through 
perfecting the CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political 
consultative system. 
  At today's plenary meeting, committee members, including Sun 
Han, Li Yongchang, Jin Xin, Qu Shijing, He Shengtao, and Li 
Zhensheng, spoke on strengthening cooperative economy in rural 
areas, on quickening agricultural development, on conducting 
publicity and education in Marxist view on nationality, on 
developing social sciences, on putting an end to the 
deterioration of our environment, and on popularizing 
agrotechnology. 
  Chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee Ye Xuanping, Wu 
Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, Hong Xuezhi, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng, 
Qian Zhengying, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, and Sun Fuling 
attended the plenary meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- This afternoon, 
committee members to the Second Session of the Eighth National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] held group discussions to deliberate the 
"(Proposed Draft Amendment for) the CPPCC Constitution." The 
participants held: The amendment further specifies the CPPCC's 
nature, position, and role in state politics, thereby 
specifically stipulating the CPPCC's key functions; and 
designates the principal content, format, and procedure for 
political consultation and democratic supervision. It has 
importance significance for regulating and enhancing political 
consultative tasks. 
  It has been learned that the "CPPCC Constitution" adopted in 
1982 has been a good one. The constitution has played an 
important role in initiating people's political consultation in 
a new era. As a result of continual progress in China's reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization drive, as well as 
continual development in the people's political consultative 
tasks, we need to make necessary amendments to certain 
provisions of the constitution in accordance with different 
actual conditions. 
  Committee members held: It is appropriate to add a provision 
in the general program, namely: "The CPC-led multiparty 
cooperation and political consultation system shall prevail and 
develop for a long time." The new provision, connected with the 
proposed amendment for the Constitution adopted by the First 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], embodies 
the characteristics and superior features of China's socialist 
political system. To further specify and enhance the CPPCC's 
duties, committee members have added clauses that stress the 
leading position of the theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and socialist basic line during the 
primary stage of socialism including, "regarding economic 
construction as the central task"; "enhancing the socialist 
spiritual civilization drive"; and "promoting the development of 
a socialist market economy." 
  Committee members held: Adding clauses to the general 
provisions on the CPPCC's tasks -- including "political 
consultation means that we hold consultation before making major 
decisions on general and specific state and local policies, and 
on other important political, economic, cultural, and social 
issues, and that we also hold consultation on important issues 
while implementing policy decisions"; and "democratic 
supervision means that by making suggestions and criticisms, we 
carry out supervision over the implementation of the state 
constitution, laws, regulations, and general and specific major 
policies, and work performance of state organs and personnel" -- 
is a new experience we have learned from enhancing China's 
socialist democracy and people's political consultation in the 
past 10-odd years. Such new clauses have important significance 
in regulating and promoting the CPPCC tasks. 
  Concerning the attachment of an extended explanation which 
reads "organize various parties, organizations, and people from 
various circles attending this session to participate in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs" to the key 
functions of political consultations and democratic supervision, 
members maintained: Apart from being an organization conducting 
cooperation and consultations with the CPC and various 
democratic parties, the CPPCC is also an important organization 
for various mass organizations, representatives of all 
nationalities, and persons from various circles who have 
participated in the CPPCC, to conduct consultations and 
discussions of important problems concerning the state's general 
policies and principles as well as the life of people; and to 
exercise democratic supervision through suggestions and 
criticisms. The CPPCC's consultation and supervision 
encompasses a wide range of activities, including consultations, 
discussions, suggestions, criticisms, as well as all sorts of 
ensuing activities, such as inspections, fact-finding tours, 
investigations, studies, and submitting proposals and motions. 
These are also various forms of participation in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs. Adding such an 
extended explanation to the CPPCC's key functions is conducive 
to extensively encouraging the enthusiasm of units and 
individuals who have joined the CPPCC, bringing into play the 
CPPCC's overall superiority, inspiring its work initiative, and 
serving China's modernization drive in a more satisfactory way. 
  Members noted: Enhancing the construction of a clean and 
honest government is an important task of the whole society; 
adding the passages "enhancing the construction of a clean and 
honest government" and "having the right to report, expose, and 
participate in the investigation and examination of violations 
of discipline and law" will further define the rights and 
obligations of CPPCC organizations and members; and is conducive 
to displaying the superiority of CPPCC organizations and 
members, and promoting the construction of a clean and honest 
government as well as a socialist legal system. Adding the 
passage "through proposals, motions, and other forms" to the 
constitution to clearly list duties exercised by members, such 
as submitting proposals and motions, will enable them to play 
their role better. 
  During their examination and discussion, members have also 
put forward many good opinions and suggestions on how to make 
this draft amendment more perfect.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The future Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region (SAR) should follow the principle 
of "one country, two systems" and develop capitalist political 
and economic systems with Hong Kong characteristics, a Hong Kong 
public figure said here today. 
  F. K. Hu, a member of the Eighth National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], said 
the SAR should adhere to Hong Kong's existing system and 
encourage local citizens to work hard and build "capitalism with 
Hong Kong characteristics" under the guidance of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the SAR Basic Law. 
  Economically, it is necessary to carry out a laissez-fair 
trade policy and consolidate the open market economic system to 
ensure fair and free competition among investors and 
industrialists, said Hu, chairman of the Hong Kong Ryoden 
Electric Engineering Co., Ltd. 
  In terms of law, the SAR should uphold the spirit of lofty 
fair legislation to boost the confidence of investors, and the 
most important thing in this regard is to protect private 
properties and human rights, he said. 
  The future Hong Kong should also maintain political and 
economic stability, adopt a simple taxation system and build 
infrastructural projects to attract investors, he said. 
  It is imperative to follow the duty-free policy to 
facilitate 
free flow of funds and goods, free investors and businessmen of 
unnecessary worries, and avoid procedures and overheads caused 
by various control measures such as foreign exchange control, he 
said. 
  He suggested that the SAR maintain the existing civil 
service 
system, build housing whose prices are lined with costs and sell 
units to low-income residents; and strengthen education, medical 
care and social security services. 
  Hong Kong and the mainland should expand exchanges, trade 
and 
cooperation, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Some members of the 
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) called on developing 
agriculture, expanding the grain crop growing area, and 
stabilizing grain price. 
  Speaking at the ongoing session of the CPPCC National 
Committee, Li Yongchang, vice-chairman of the Shandong 
Provincial Committee of the Jiu San Society, said that grain 
crops should account for 70 percent of the total acreage and at 
least for 65 percent so as to ensure growth of grain output. 
  Zhu Xiangyuan, director of the Beijing Nutrition Research 
Institute, suggested that the government readjust the grain 
purchasing price, protect interests of grain farmers, support 
and adopt preferential tax policies for commodity grain 
counties. "It is of vital importance for China to maintain the 
per capita grain output at a high level while the population 
continues to increase," he said. 
  Sun Han, vice-chairman of the CPPCC Jiangsu Provincial 
Committee, suggested that China accelerate establishment of 
community economic cooperatives in rural areas and finally set 
up a national network of economic cooperatives. Economically 
developed areas should organize specialized cooperatives to meet 
needs of a market economy. 
  Some CPPCC members said that China should build up a grain 
supply guarantee system to stabilize grain prices. Zhu 
Xiangyuan proposed that the new system consist of three sectors: 
first, establishment of central and local grain reserve centers 
and risk funds; second, supervising grain prices throughout 
China, setting ceiling and bottom prices and stabilizing the 
prices with grain reserve or risk fund when fierce fluctuation 
occurs; and third, assigning relevant institutions to regulate 
grain supply with rational subsidies and rules.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- China should bid to 
host more international sports meets in an attempt to promote 
its economic growth and prosperity, a Hong Kong member of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said today. 
  Addressing today's full meeting of the current session of 
the 
CPPCC National Committee, David S. H. Chu, said, "economic 
development can spur progress in sports. Meanwhile, progress in 
sports can also improve the quality of a nation, and promote 
economic prosperity and progress. 
  In the course of deepening reforms and opening China wider 
to 
the outside world, he said, it is necessary to mobilize all 
positive factors to invigorate the Chinese nation, including the 
full use of comprehensive and great functions of sports. 
  The fact that China's bidding for the holding of the 2000 
Olympic Games won full support of the entire Chinese people 
shows cohesiveness of the Chinese nation, he said. 
  Now, there are more and more countries loving peace and 
understanding and backing China, he added. 
  According to Chu, bidding to hold major international sports 
meets is a great honor for a country or a nation. 
  For a large country like China, it is far from enough to 
hold 
just several international sports meets every year, he said. 
  The state should encourage cities and localities that have 
never held such meets to submit bidding, he said. 
  Cities and localities that have held such meets should bid 
to 
host more. "To this end, the state should formulate a series of 
encouragement policies," he said. 
  He revealed that he is currently assisting the state physics 
culture and sports commission in bidding for the holding of a 
major international sports meet -- the China Bicycle World Cup 
Tournament. 
  Talks on cooperation have been held with two TV networks: 
CBS 
in the United States and Sky in Europe, he said. 
  The 12-day tournament is scheduled to start from Hong Kong 
to 
the Tiananmen Square in Beijing via Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Nanjing 
and Tianjin. The two networks will televise live the tournament 
four hours daily. 
  The successful bidding for the tournament will not only help 
improve China's cycling standards, but also will enable the 
cities the cyclists will move through to open wider to the 
outside world, said Chu, who is vice president of the China Golf 
Association and chairman of the Mission Hills Golf Club in 
Shenzhen, Guangdong Province.

<F P=106> ["Reporter's Journal" by Lian Jun; from the "Special News </F>
Program on the Second Session of the Eighth NPC" -- recorded] 
  [Text] National People's Congress [NPC] deputies from 
regions inhabited by minority nationalities have reached a 
consensus, namely, the nationalities issue is a sensitive one. 
Regions inhabited by minority nationalities have specific 
characteristics, therefore, stability in these regions is very 
important. Many minority nationality deputies said: Since the 
founding of the PRC, the central government has expended great 
energy on regions inhabited by minority nationalities; adopted 
special policies for them; and supported them by apportioning a 
large amount of funds to enable them to achieve considerable 
development and progress. In particular, these regions have 
enjoyed their most prosperous period in history in the past 15 
years since China implemented reform and opened its doors to the 
outside world. 
  As I come from a region inhabited by minority nationalities, 
I have some experience in this connection. In 1958, Premier 
Zhou Enlai personally presided over a meeting to solicit 
opinions from all fields of endeavor; decided on the basic 
principle of freedom for religious beliefs and of mutual respect 
and equality between religions of different nationalities; and 
abolished the feudal system on [words indistinct] of the founder 
of a religion and Tibet's serfdom, thereby winning the support 
of all nationalities and religious circles. The party's 
policies on nationalities and religion were undermined by 
Leftist influence during the Cultural Revolution. They have 
been carried out to the letter again since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. However, when I was 
conducting news coverage in some localities of regions inhabited 
by minority nationalities, I felt that Rightist deviation had 
reappeared in some localities in their implementation of the 
party's policies on nationalities and religion over the past two 
years. This rendered religious activities out of control and 
even resulted in religious forces being placed above the law and 
government administration. Religious activities in some 
localities have violated the law and become criminal activities, 
causing serious damage to social stability and to the lives and 
properties of local people. Some deputies said: Freedom of 
religious beliefs does not mean there is no rule by law or 
government administration. In particular, the feudal system of 
the founder of a religion which was abolished must absolutely 
not be restored. Regarding criminal activities touched off by 
religion, they must be punished according to the law. Likewise, 
there is no exception to the above in advanced Western 
countries. It seems that it is still necessary for cadres in 
regions inhabited by minority nationalities to continuously 
study in earnest how to truly do a good job of implementing the 
party's policies on nationalities and religion.

QIUSHI; Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 0230 GMT 
on 16 March transmits a service message noting that the article 
is Li Peng's speech at the national "vegetable basket," grain, 
cotton and edible oil work conference on 27 January 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- The party Central 
Committee and the State Council have always attached great 
importance to rural work and have adopted a series of measures 
to strengthen rural work in these years. The party Central 
Committee held a rural work conference in October 1993 and 
arranged for the 1994 rural work. Generally speaking, our 
present situation of agricultural production and market supply 
is good. We have reaped bumper harvests for several consecutive 
years. In 1993, while only the outputs of cotton and sugar 
crops decreased, the outputs of grain, oil-bearing crops, meat, 
eggs, and aquatic products increased and the "vegetable basket" 
work yielded remarkable results. Total supply of farm products, 
particularly food, which suffered long shortages in the past, 
has become relatively ample. Particularly since the 
establishment of the special grain reserve system in 1990, the 
state has had a sizable amount of reserve grain in its hands. 
The governments at all levels have attached great importance to 
the "vegetable basket" work in these years. The market supply 
of agricultural and sideline products is stable and big problems 
are unlikely. The broad masses of the people in both urban and 
rural areas have personal experience of these achievements and 
are satisfied with them. 
  However, despite such a good situation, since last November, 
some problems occurred in the supply of grain, edible oil, and 
nonstaple food in some regions. Rice prices in some southern 
areas increased by a fairly large margin, and a trend of large 
increase in vegetable prices occurred in some large and medium 
cities. Then, the commodity price increases spread from these 
areas to many other areas across the country, caused a bigger 
reaction among urban residents, and attracted the great 
attention of the party Central Committee and State Council. We 
worked on these problems for a time, strengthened macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and marketed some state reserve grain. 
Excessive grain and edible oil prices have dropped and the 
vegetable prices' increasing trend has been curbed. Why these 
problems happened is a question which merits our pondering. 
There are many causes for these problems. In addition to 
objective causes, such as an unsound market system, I think that 
the biggest lesson we have learned is that our leaders at 
various levels lack a clear understanding and experience in 
whether or not it remains necessary to exercise macroeconomic 
regulation and control under the new situation of relaxed price 
controls. The development of a socialist market economy does 
not mean the complete decontrol of commodity prices. Both our 
own and foreign experience prove that large commodity price 
increases are detrimental to reform and development. This 
conference is held to unify our thinking and understanding, sum 
up experience and lessons, and take a further step to make the 
"vegetable basket" work and the grain, cotton and edible oil 
work meet the requirements of socialist market economic 
structure. 
<H3>  1. Governments at all levels should be very much concerned 
about and pay attention to improving the people's living 
standards. </H3>
  In the economic work during the course of advancing to a 
modern, powerful socialist country, we should always pay 
attention to two major tasks -- the task of feeding the people 
and the task of construction -- and correctly handle the 
relationship between the two. Feeding the people means solving 
the people's livelihood problems, which is a major task that 
governments at all levels must perform well. We must unify our 
thinking and understanding with this task in mind; strive to do 
good "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil work; and 
maintain a sufficient market supply and relatively stable prices. 
  Our government is the people's government, and the purpose 
of the people's government is to wholeheartedly serve the 
people. To be concerned about the people's vital interests at 
all times is bound duty of our governments at all levels. 
Grain, cotton, edible oil, and nonstaple food are the basic 
necessities of the people's livelihood. We used to say fuel 
wood, rice, edible oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea were 
our seven daily necessities. Today, we should add vegetable as 
another necessity and as the top necessity. At present, the 
income of most of our people in both urban and rural areas is 
still quite low and their food expenses still account for a 
large proportion of their total consumption expenses. Under 
such a situation, the prices of grain, edible oil, meat, 
vegetables, eggs, aquatic products, and other major food items 
have a direct bearing on the people's consumption level. If 
food prices are too high, urban and rural residents will have to 
increase their basic living expenses and reduce other spendings, 
and their actual living standards will be affected. 
  Our party and government are the representatives of the 
people's interests. We should take constant improvement of the 
people's living standards as the objective of all our work. 
Since we are elected by the people, we should protect their 
interests. A very important one of the three causes in the 
"conduciveness to three causes" stressed by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping is improving the people's living standards [the other 
two are developing the productive forces of our socialist 
society and strengthening the overall capacity of our socialist 
country]. The governments at all levels should first strive to 
meet the basic needs of all the people, and then keep improving 
their living standards. Only after we solve well the problem 
concerning the people's livelihood which they are most concerned 
about, will they support us and listen to what the party and 
government say. The solution of the problems concerning the 
production and supply of vegetable, grain, cotton, and edible 
oil is indeed a very important matter and we must not treat it 
lightly. 
  To correctly handle the relationship among reform, 
development, and stability is the principle which we must pursue 
to do good "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil 
work. To maintain social stability is the precondition for 
deepening reform and promoting development, while to do good 
"vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil work is of 
great significance to maintaining social stability. This is a 
year in which we will take a major step in reform of economic 
structure. A smooth proceeding of the reform requires us to 
maintain social stability and reassure the people. A sharp 
commodity price increase will make people worry, cause social 
instability, obstruct the smooth proceeding of reform, and 
affect the overall situation of economic development. While the 
broad masses of the people are the main force for reform, no 
reform can succeed without the people's support. Of all 
commodities, what the people could feel most directly is the 
fluctuation of major food prices, such as those of grain, edible 
oil, meat, vegetable, eggs, milk, and aquatic products. We must 
make great efforts to maintain a relative stability in the 
prices of grain, edible oil, and major nonstaple food so as to 
consolidate and enhance the current social situation of 
stability and unity. 
  In deepening reform, we must simultaneously consider the 
interests of all strata in urban and rural areas. Reform 
conforms to the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the 
people, and they have indeed enjoyed huge practical benefits of 
reform in the last decade and more. However, a fact during the 
course of reform is that not every strata and everyone enjoys 
the same interest and benefit at the same time. For this 
reason, we in our work should show special concern for those who 
have not yet become well-off, or even are still leading a quite 
difficult life. To further arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for 
production, it is necessary to properly raise the purchase 
prices of grain and cotton, and the higher prices will benefit 
the peasants. However, higher prices of agricultural and 
sideline products will yield a certain impact on some low-income 
urban residents, particularly the workers and staff members of 
those enterprises that have completely or partially suspended 
production, students of colleges and secondary vocational 
schools, retired personnel, and people in poor regions and 
disaster-stricken regions. Governments at all levels should take 
effective measures and make efforts to help the low-income 
people overcome difficulties in livelihood and ensure that their 
basic needs in life are met. 
  2. Ensure an Ample Supply of Commodities and Build a 
Big Circulation Setup 
  Developing production and enlivening circulation are basic 
conditions for maintaining an abundant supply of nonstaple food, 
grain, cotton, and edible oil in the market and for maintaining 
the relative stability of prices. Developing production 
constitutes the foundation for ensuring the supply of nonstaple 
food, grain, cotton, and edible oil. In other words, vegetable 
plots are the guarantee for filled shopping bags. Due to the 
restraints of natural conditions, it is impossible for a given 
locality to be self-sufficient in everything. Localities, large 
and medium-sized cities in particular, must foster the idea of 
large-scale production. They should -- while increasing the 
necessary capacity for self-sufficiency -- develop regional 
cooperation, build production bases through coordinated efforts, 
and forge stable relations between production and marketing in 
order to ensure balanced market supply, make up shortfalls in 
off seasons, and optimize the product-mix. We must not make the 
mistake of neglecting it all year round and starting panic 
buying everywhere when a shortfall in supply emerges, triggering 
price hikes in the market. Localities must set aside special 
funds for construction of nonstaple food, grain, cotton, and 
edible oil production bases, increase input, and speed up the 
pace of construction. Modern technology -- including plastic 
sheeting, the use of straw compost to fertilize farmland, 
sprinkling and trickle irrigation, mechanized hog and chicken 
farming, fish farming, manufacturing of compound feed, the use 
of solar energy, and introduction of fine strains from other 
regions or overseas -- should be utilized in building the 
production bases. We should increase output, improve quality, 
reduce cost, and improve efficiency by way of technical progress. 
  While working vigorously to develop production, we must 
establish a big commodity circulation setup and an operating 
mechanism promoting overall balance, free flow of goods, and 
flexible operation. Nationwide, the problem facing us today is 
not shortages but a lack of transport capacity to ship the goods 
to the marketing regions in a timely fashion, creating 
overstocking in producing regions and shortages in marketing 
areas. Governments in all localities must attach importance to 
the construction of transportation, storage, preservation, and 
other basic circulation facilities to facilitate the shipment of 
vegetables from the south to the north, and grain from the north 
to the south and from the central regions to the west. We must 
truly ensure the free flow of commodities and closely link 
production regions with marketing regions. The Ministries of 
Agriculture and Internal Trade, and other relevant departments 
must continue their support for engineering projects related to 
the "vegetable basket" with funds, technology, and materials. 
Governments in all localities must take further steps to remove 
all kinds of obstacles to circulation and sternly crack down on 
gangsters and thugs in the transportation sector. Except for a 
small number of essential checkpoints approved by the provincial 
government, all other checkpoints must be dismantled. Railway 
and other transport departments must give priority to the 
shipment of farm products. Large and medium-sized cities must 
create conditions to attract out-of-town vegetable growers to 
market their produce in the city by ensuring their safety and 
fair trade. 
  3. Develop Agriculture and Sideline Product Markets, 
and Improve Market Administration 
  To do a good job in the production and supply of nonstaple 
food, grain, and edible oil, it is necessary to pay attention to 
market construction and the establishment of a network which 
combines agricultural product markets, centered on wholesale 
markets, with retailers. This important experience was gained 
by some of the large and medium-sized cities which have achieved 
results in building "vegetable basket" projects in recent years. 
Today, China has a considerable number of wholesale markets 
that are playing a positive role. However, the development of 
agricultural product markets still falls short of the needs of 
economic development and the people's livelihood. A lot remains 
to be done. Governments at all levels should upgrade, expand, 
or perfect the existing wholesale markets in a planned way and 
build a number of regional wholesale markets of agricultural 
products. The state plans to build several central-level 
wholesale markets for agricultural products in key producing 
regions and major cities in the next few years. We will try to 
build a network of wholesale markets composed of central, 
regional, and local wholesale markets, and develop a unified, 
nationwide market to bring about nationwide circulation of 
commodities. 
  Under the conditions of decontrolled operations, governments 
at all levels must pay particular attention to market 
management. Lifting controls to enliven operations does not mean 
washing our hands of the operations. In terms of the 
characteristics of production and marketing, agricultural 
products -- sideline products in particular -- involve 
considerable risks; on the other hand, they are essential, 
sensitive commodities in the market that have a direct impact on 
the people's livelihood. As such, they are unlikely to remain 
stable if left to the spontaneous regulation of the market 
alone. For this reason, the more restrictions are lifted to 
enliven the market, the greater efforts we should make to 
improve market administration. 
  Lack of a standard system for market transactions, lack of 
market order, and assorted deceitful practices that are found in 
the marketplace -- these are conspicuous problems facing the 
agricultural product markets in many localities and in large and 
medium-sized cities. These harmful factors have severely 
affected normal trading in the market. We must adopt effective 
measures to solve them. We must sternly crack down on illegal 
elements who manipulate the market, speculate or jack up prices, 
produce or sell substandard or fake merchandise, entrap people 
or swindle them, or commit other illegal acts. We should cut 
down the intermediate links in the chain of circulation to the 
benefit of the producers and consumers. Industrial, commercial, 
public security, railway, and transportation departments must 
closely coordinate with each other to take concerted action and 
ensure a notable improvement in market order and maintain a good 
market order indefinitely. 
<H3>  4. Put in Place Effective Means for Exercising Macroeconomic 
Regulation and Control </H3>
  The degree of maturity of the market economy is closely 
linked to macroeconomic regulation and control. A mature market 
economic system must have efficient ways to exercise 
macroeconomic regulation and control to meet the needs of 
economic development. It is entirely correct to lift price 
controls. Under no circumstances, however, should we let up 
macroeconomic regulation and control. In exercising 
macroeconomic regulation and control, we use chiefly economic 
and legal means, but that does not rule out administrative means 
when necessary. At present, the following three tasks should be 
grasped in the regulation and control of farm products in our 
country: 
  First, it is necessary to establish a reserve system of 
grain, cotton, oil, meat, and sugar. Agricultural output is 
affected by whether and supply often goes up and down. It is 
therefore necessary to store up appropriate reserves to regulate 
supply and balance market supply and demands. The recent 
fluctuation in grain prices taught us this importance lesson: 
"With grain in our hands, our hearts will not panic." It tells 
us how important it is to have grain reserves. Grain is a daily 
necessity and grain prices have a broad impact. A sharp rise in 
grain prices will lead to price rises in other commodities. 
When we have ample grain reserves, we will be able to stabilize 
prices. This time grain prices across the country were brought 
down after the State Grain Reserve Administration sold only a 
limited amount of grain. The central and local authorities 
should establish a reserve system of grain, cotton, oil, meat, 
and sugar with determination. More efforts should be made to 
improve the administration and use of reserves. It is necessary 
to make a distinction between policy reserves, and operational 
and working reserves. 
  Second, it is necessary to establish a risk fund system for 
grain and sideline products. A decision in this regard was made 
at the Central Conference on Rural Work and the National Work 
Conference on the "Vegetable Basket" last year. According to 
the decision, all the savings of central and local authorities 
from the abolition of subsidies for grain, meat, and vegetables 
should be channeled to the grain and nonstaple food risk fund. 
Moreover, more capital should be raised from other sources to 
expand the system to an appropriate scale. The risk fund should 
serve as a mechanism and be used in a rollover cycle way so that 
it can grow continuously. The risk fund should be used mainly 
to stabilize prices and protect the producers' interests. 
  Third, it is necessary to establish a system of supervising 
and controlling agricultural and sideline product markets, and 
to improve information networks for agricultural and sideline 
products. Good information can help promote production and set 
people's minds at rest. Correct information can be used by the 
government as a scientific basis for enforcing effective 
macrocontrol. Since November last year, the sale price of grain 
and edible oil rose by a great extent in some locales and people 
rushed to purchase food products. One of the lessons we learned 
was that concerned departments did not foresee the problem and 
did not take prompt action. Commercial and grain departments 
should consider the work of watching the market and stabilizing 
prices as their constant task. They should play the state 
commercial outlets' role as the main channel of supply at 
critical moments. In the course of implementing the new tax 
system, the financial and taxation departments should study ways 
to formulate measures to assist state- owned and collective 
enterprises engaged in the operation of grain, edible oil, and 
other supplementary food products; and actively support them in 
fulfilling the tasks of stabilizing commodity prices and 
ensuring ample supply of foodstuffs in the market. 
<H5>  5. Further Implement the Mayors' Responsibility System </H5>
  Judging from the characteristics of commodities, we can see 
that meat, poultry, eggs, and vegetables are different from 
grain and edible oil. Grain and edible oil can be stored for a 
long time, transported to and from distant places, and can even 
be imported to adjust the market situation. Supplementary food 
products are mostly fresh and perishable items, and cannot be 
stored for a long time. People want to use them daily. The 
characteristics of supplementary food products tell us that the 
solution to the problem of supplementary food products must 
mainly fall on local governments. I have repeatedly stressed the 
"vegetable basket" problem should be tackled by governments at 
various localities, especially large and medium cities, and the 
system of linking mayors' job responsibility to targets should 
be implemented. Making proper arrangements for people's daily 
life is a mayors' primary duty and the most important thing in 
stabilizing the whole situation. When a city cannot provide 
residents with ample "vegetable basket" commodities at 
relatively stable prices, we will not question the provincial 
governor or vice mayors but will investigate the mayor. This is 
because a mayor is the highest administrative official in a city 
and has the means and power to adjust the use of manpower, 
materials, and funds to guarantee the production and supply of 
supplementary food products. This point should be included in 
the system of linking mayors' job responsibility to targets. We 
should evaluate the mayors' work each year and report the 
evaluation results to city people's congresses and the people. 
  How can a mayor do a good job in the "vegetable basket" 
project? The most important thing is to ensure an overall 
balance of demand and supply of supplementary food products. 
Various large and medium cities should take up responsibility 
to ensure an overall balance of demand and supply. It is 
necessary to ensure a balance of demand and supply in normal 
times, and it is even more necessary to ensure a balance of 
demand and supply of supplementary food products in off seasons. 
We should see to it that peasants are enthusiastic about 
producing vegetables because they obtain relatively high 
benefits. The problem is that we should, through the market 
mechanism, link vegetable farmers with consumers and ensure free 
circulation of supplementary food products. When we talk about 
seeking an overall balance of supply and demand, we do not mean 
large and medium cities should all be self-supporting. Various 
cities should develop production to strenthen their 
self-sustaining ability and can make up for inadequacies by 
obtaining supplementary food products from other places through 
market mechanisms. Mayors of large and medium cities should 
effectively shoulder this responsibility, take the initiative to 
do a good job, and discover and solve problems in a prompt 
manner. We must never wait and solve problems after they happen 
because in this way our losses will be too large. It is 
necessary to guarantee the area of required vegetable gardens 
and strictly forbid wanton occupation of them. At present, some 
cities occupy too many vegetable gardens for other purposes and 
do not build new ones as replacements. 
  This is the main reason for the short supply of vegetables 
in some locales. We must solve this problem as quickly as 
possible. In city planning and establishing economic 
development zones, we should try our best to avoid the use of 
existing vegetable gardens. If we must utilize existing ones, 
we should till and cultivate new gardens and then use them. In 
building bases for producing supplementary food products, 
various large and medium cities should, according to needs, 
establish stable cooperation with other places in producing and 
marketing supplementary food products. In solving the problem 
of vegetable production, it is necessary to gradually form a 
pattern of laying stress on producing vegetables on the 
outskirts of cities, using suburban areas as supplementary 
vegetable production bases, and adjusting supplies with other 
localities. 
  We must be determined to establish a fund for building 
vegetable production bases, a fund for price risk, and a fund 
for building refrigeration storerooms and other facilities. 
When we can ensure the availability of these three kinds of 
funds, we shall be able to guarantee an ample supply of 
vegetables and relatively stable prices in the market. The 
raising of those funds should mainly depend on various locales. 
So long as we strictly control the scale of capital 
construction, open less development zones and build less real 
estate projects, we will not have much difficulty in raising 
these three kinds of funds. 
  Not long ago, Comrade Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: 
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach 
great importance to the "vegetable basket" project and work 
related to grain, cotton, and edible oil. I am convinced that 
so long as the whole party and governments at all levels attach 
great importance to the work and mayors pay personal, close 
attention to the work, we can certainly improve it further.

<F P=106> [Article by Tang Jian (0781 1696): "Dangerous Signals of </F>
Runaway Economic Reform"] 
  [Text] The "macro-control" economic policy adopted by the 
mainland authorities in the middle of last year was carried out 
for just a short period of several months. In September, the 
opinion of "adding heat" prevailed again, so various localities 
vied with each other to prepare for another "great leap forward" 
round. 
  Some economists note that the economic cycle of 
decontrol-chaos and tighted control-stagnation is getting 
shorter and shorter. A few months after the termination of the 
macro-control policy, phenomena reflecting economic disorder 
appeared everywhere, and high inflation had caused the further 
deterioration of various social problems. A widening gap not 
only exists between rich people and poor people, but also 
between the rich coastal cities and impoverished rural areas in 
the interior. More and more signs show that if the polarization 
of wealth cannot be mitigated in a short time, all kinds of 
trouble could break out. The people, especially the peasants, 
have a stronger tendency to stage "rebellions." 
  The central authorities also feel that the situation is on 
the brink of going out of control. Recently, a taxation reform 
program was hastily put into practice in order to bring the 
situation under control and to redistribute wealth through 
taxation. After various taxes are raised substantially, wealth 
might naturally be shifted from the developed coastal areas to 
rural areas in the interior. However, this reform measure is 
being resisted by the "local lord economy [zhu hou jing ji 6175 
0186 4737 3444]." Some Guangdong officials publicly announced 
that they would not collect value-added property taxes due to 
special local conditions. Such "defiant" statements caused a 
public uproar. Under pressure from public opinion, Guangdong 
Vice Governor Lu Ruihua was forced to announce that Guangdong 
would abide by Beijing's latest instructions. 
  The current situation in mainland China is moving from one 
extreme to the other. In the past, it was stressed that "the 
whole country should be well-coordinated under the central 
leadership like pieces in a chess game"; but now, the country is 
as loose as a plate of sand. 
  Facing another round of economic chaos, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji, who is widely regarded as losing power and influence, 
has again frequently appeared on public occasions. The mainland 
mass media have carried many reports about his new instructions 
on economic work. This indicates that the reform-minded 
strongman is again playing a part of "taking on very important 
assignments at a time of national crisis." 
  In mid-January, a four-day national banking work conference 
was held in Beijing. Principal officials in charge at various 
ministries and commissions of the State Council and provincial, 
municipal, and autonomous regional governments attended the 
meeting. However, the mainland mass media did not publish any 
reports about such an important meeting. It was said that the 
central authorities issued an instruction to unify propaganda 
practice in order to prevent any reports about financial policy 
"upsetting" the people. It was no wonder that the mass media all 
exercised "self-discipline" and kept silent, because many 
startling facts were revealed at the meeting and it would have 
been very "upsetting" if they had been made known to the public. 
  Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Li Lanqing attended the meeting 
and made separate speeches. These leaders who are in charge of 
economic affairs fiercely criticized the "local lord economy" 
and the tough words they used greatly shocked participants in 
the meeting. 
  At the very beginning of his speech, Zhu Rongji criticized 
the eight provincial and autonomous regional governments of 
Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Guizhou, Liaoning, Hebei, and 
Guangxi by name. He sternly criticized them for going their own 
way, not studying and relaying central instructions, and 
knowingly adopting their own policies in violation of 
regulations laid down by the central authorities. This was 
reflected in the following facts: They continue to raise funds 
irregularly, and, in some cases, have even raised interest rates 
to 30 percent without regard to the relevant regulations laid 
down by the state; they have continued to increase investment in 
capital construction without authorization; withheld, concealed, 
and shifted foreign exchange earnings by various means; issued 
bonds in various forms without authorization, with the amount of 
such irregularly issued bonds exceeding 60 billion yuan since 
last December; distributed shares of state-owned enterprises to 
their workers in various disguised forms; sold new publicing 
housing to workers at prices lower than the construction costs; 
hoarded major producer goods in order to drive up prices, which 
disrupted the overall operation of the market and kept prices of 
production materials at high levels; and some provincial 
government departments have even delivered false reports and 
data to the State Council. 
  Zhu Rongji also exposed the duplicitous behavior of some 
localities in covertly defying and violating central 
instructions. He said that some provincial government leaders 
have publicly expressed their willingness to follow central 
instructions at meetings, but they in fact went their own way 
under the pretext of "giving play to local initiative and 
creativity," and he described their behavior in defying 
organizational authority and discipline as pursuing selfish 
local interests and the partial interests of small groups, 
upholding individualism and anarchy as emancipating the mind, 
and breaking conventions. They have seriously violated the 
principle of a subordinate relationship between the central and 
local authorities. 
  Zhu Rongji finally warned: "The central leadership will not 
allow some local leaders to use their powers and functions to do 
whatever they like in violation of central instructions. Such 
leaders must be dismissed from office and will not be forgiven." 
  The warning to dismiss disobedient officials without 
exception shocked those attending the meeting. However, it was 
not hard to understand Zhu Rongji's feelings after they had 
listened to Zou Jiahua's report about the overall economic 
situation. Zou frankly admitted that the overall financial 
situation in the market was serious. Although the policy to 
strengthen economic macro- control last summer did achieved 
certain results in curbing and stabilizing the situation, the 
overall financial situation, especially the banking order and 
foreign exchange payments, was still imbalanced on the whole. 
  Zou Jiahua said: The State Council required all provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities to submit their reports 
on economic construction, reform, and financial conditions in 
1993 by 8 January, but seven provinces and autonomous regions 
had not yet discussed their reports at local party committee 
standing committee meetings, and many provinces and 
municipalities had not yet worked out their 1994 work plans. In 
that case, how could subordinate localities and units handle 
their work, and how could they maintain uniformity with the 
central authorities and carry out central instructions? 
  At the meeting, Li Lanqing called for "setting thinking 
right, changing position, and developing the economy." He 
explained: In- depth reform cannot rely on the inflow of a 
large amount of foreign funds. This is not only because foreign 
investment has to be digested, but also because foreign 
investment has its limitations. The central authorities will not 
relax or change the macro-control policy. 
  Although "macro-control" was again mentioned at the meeting, 
the central leaders really find it a headache to see that the 
local authorities had not obeyed their instructions. 
Reportedly, in early January, Zhu Rongji expressed his opinion 
at a routine meeting of the Political Bureau, and said that 
localism and anarchy had made it impossible to ensure the 
effective implementation of central measures. Zhu added that 
this problem could not lie unsolved any longer and that we 
should face reality squarely and adopt organizational measures 
to solve the problem, and we must take action before problems 
occur to a serious degree. Zhu Rongji also expressed his 
feelings of helplessness. If the local authorities refuse to 
carry out central instructions and "if they continue to pursue 
their own policies without regard to the central authorities, 
what can be done?" 
  In addition to dealing with the serious financial situation 
and the "centrifugal" tendencies of local officials, Zhu Rongji 
is also facing challenges and pressure from the conservatives. 
Recently, Yao Yilin openly challenged him, and asked when 
attending a State Council meeting in mid-January: "A vicious 
cycle has taken shape in the fields of capital construction, 
currency distribution, imports, and credit. Who should bear 
responsibility for this? I think no one can bear such 
responsibility. Does the comrade who took the decisions bear 
such responsibility?" 
  Yao Yilin also made an alarming prediction: "If the reform 
measures do not match national strength and the people's 
endurance, the financial situation may continue to deteriorate, 
the renminbi may be devalued by a big margin once again, and 
serious inflation may occur. If social turmoil happens this 
year, it may spread turmoil caused by other factors, and even 
riots may occur. The consequences will thus be more serious 
than the political riots in 1989." 
  At present, social pressures have become rather obvious, and 
complaints about high inflation have been heard directly by 
Zhongnanhai. On the morning of 18 January, Jiang Zemin 
inspected Beijing's Wangfujing Department Store and attended a 
discussion meeting where worker deputies and party committee 
members of the department store expressed five points to the 
general secretary. On 20 January, their opinions were published 
at a briefing of the General Office of the State Council. There 
was a response within two days, and this shows that the opinions 
had attracted attention from top leaders. The five points were: 
  First, prices of grain, cooking oil, and other foodstuffs 
are 
increasing too quickly, and ordinary residents cannot endure 
this and are cursing the Communist Party and the government. 
  Second, central leaders and Beijing municipal leaders should 
care about the livelihood of Beijing residents. Living 
standards of retired workers are declining drastically, while 
the number of retired workers is increasing. 
  Third, as grain and cooking oil are sold by the state, how 
are their prices raised haphazardly? This has caused a 
disorderly situation in the market and serious concerns among 
the people. The people's confidence in the government has 
dropped. 
  Fourth, it is said that the working class is the leading 
class of the country and that the workers are the masters of the 
state. In reality, however, they do not understand government 
policies and measures and have no right to take part in the 
policy-making process. 
  Fifth, workers are now complaining that reform is going too 
far and that they cannot endure it. This has caused tense 
relations between workers and cadres. 
  Sources in the department store said that when a top 
official such as the general secretary came to see them, the 
workers did not care about his face. The worker deputies 
delivered a petition to Jiang Zemin, which was entitled 
"Workers' Voices and Demands." Party committee cadres on the 
spot tried to discourage the workers from doing this by saying 
that they should deliver the petition to the general secretary 
through the party committee, and adding that this was just the 
opinion of some workers. A full meeting of workers was not 
held. Such remarks aroused indignation among the workers, and 
the atmosphere became rather tense. This made it hard for Jiang 
Zemin to back down with good grace, and he could only say that 
worker deputies represent the voice of all workers. 
  A similar event occurred again on 22 January. When Jiang 
Zemin attended a discussion meeting of workers from some 
industrial enterprises in Beijing, deputies from the 
construction, chemical, and textile industries delivered a 
petition to him. According to an internal newsletter, worker 
representatives in some trades strongly demanded that workers' 
views should be reflected in the management of enterprises, that 
the interests of the vast number of ordinary workers be cared 
for and protected, and that the income gap between party and 
administrative cadres and ordinary workers in enterprises should 
not be widened further in the course of reform. 
  Data showed that in the construction industry, the income of 
party and administrative cadres was 120-300 percent higher than 
for ordinary workers. In the chemical industry, wage ratio 
between cadres and workers was 2.3 to 1, and for bonuses the 
ratio was 4 to 1. Worker deputies from the textile industry 
said at the meeting: In the city, some 100,000 textile workers 
do not work full hours, and their status is at the third tier 
under the party committee secretaries and factory directors at 
the top and department and workshop heads in the second tier. 
  Resentment against the corrupt practice of seeking private 
gains by making use of official functions and powers and against 
the widening gap between rich and the poor has become a serious 
social problem. According to the General Office of the Beijing 
Municipal CPC Committee, between last November and mid-January 
this year, Beijing municipal government leaders held discussion 
meetings in 120 factories, enterprises, and shops in order to 
discover workers' feelings. Beyond their expectations, over 60 
percent of worker representatives required that the pace of 
reform be slowed down, because workers could no longer endure 
it. Some worker representatives even said that ordinary people 
did not care whether there was reform or not; if they could not 
endure it there would be strikes, and they could take to the 
streets to stage demonstrations and even rebellions. 
  For the CPC leadership, the situation has become more 
serious 
than previously, and signs of "turmoil," which they are most 
afraid of, have appeared. The Mayor Li Qiyan of Beijing 
recently admitted at a bureau-level cadre meeting that workers 
are very realistic. If they cannot endure, they will curse the 
government and the Communist Party and could even take to the 
streets to stage demonstrations. He also revealed that last 
year, strikes, go slows, mass rallies, and petitions occurred in 
more than 40 factories, mines, business enterprises, and 
institutions. The Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and the 
Beijing Municipal Government received more than 1,200 complaint 
letters signed collectively. 
  What Li Qiyan revealed was just the situation in the capital 
where the central leaders live. The situation in other places 
can be imagined. As Deng Xiaoping's days are numbered, will the 
CPC leadership be able to withstand the impact produced by 
reform? Economic reform has brought about certain threats 
against the authoritarian rule of the CPC. Will it continue to 
advance or will it backtrack? It seems that the answer will be 
found this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with "Relevant Departments of the State </F>
Commission for Restructuring the Economy (SCRE)" by a staff 
reporter; place and date not given: "Reform and Development in 
1994"] 
  [Text] [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What impact will reform measures 
in 1994 produce on China's economy? Does the introduction of so 
many reform measures have necessary conditions? Will it give 
rise to social instability and dissatisfaction on the part of 
the masses? 
  [SCRE] The year 1994 is a year of crucial importance for 
economic structural reform in China. A number of reform 
measures, including those of taxes, banking, foreign exchange, 
planning, investments, and enterprise system will be introduced 
and put into effect, and the difficulty and strength of reform 
will be quite great. Of course, there are also certain risks. 
We should point out that in working out reform plans, the 
parties concerned have already considered the possible impacts 
these reform measures may produce, and have planned measures to 
cope with the situation. Separate taxation system structural 
reform is undoubtedly of important significance to rationalizing 
the distribution relations between the central authorities and 
localities, mobilizing the two initiatives, promoting the 
rational growth of state revenue, appropriately strengthening 
the financial resources of the central authorities, and 
enhancing the macroeconomic regulation and control ability of 
the central government. However, such reform has also taken 
into account the interests of localities and enterprises, and 
has adopted some transitional measures so as to gradually 
achieve the goal of reform. 
  As to the return amount of local taxation, the central 
financial authorities are taking 1993 as the return base year. 
Subsidies provided by the central authorities, local profits 
turned over to the higher authorities, and related matters of 
settling accounts which were in effect under the original system 
will remain temporarily unchanged after the separate taxation 
system is carried out, they will be gradually standardized after 
a period of transition, and be supplemented by other 
complementary reform measures so as to ensure the successful 
progress of the new system. 
  Carrying out the tax system reform of a unified 33 percent 
income tax rate for home-investment enterprises will inevitably 
produce a major impact on fair tax burdens, on providing 
enterprises with the opportunity of equal competition, and on 
orderly competition and the stable growth of China's economy, 
and should be carried forward rapidly. However, taking into 
consideration the actual situation of the low profits of some 
enterprises, China has taken some transitional measures, such as 
making allowances for the tax rate. In short, after more than 
ten years of economic structural reform, the economic and 
psychological bearing capacity of the Chinese people has been 
greatly strengthened, the material benefits of reform make 
people feel confident of government reform measures and their 
results, the new system has relative superiority and a 
scientific basis, and the considerations given by reform 
measures to the vested interests and corresponding arrangements 
made in transitional rules and regulations have all provided 
ample conditions for carrying out the new system. However, we 
will not lower our guard against problems that may crop up and 
will take necessary measures at any time to overcome them to 
help bring about smooth reform. 
  [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] As far as I know, the GDP for 1993 broke 
through three trillion yuan, with a growth of 13.4 percent, and 
the retail price index was 13 percent. What are the trends of 
economic development and commodity prices this year? 
  [SCRE] Economic development this year will remain high, and 
the trend is "medium growth and medium inflation." Calculated 
by the current growth capacity of China's economy, the economic 
growth rate for 1994 is potentially about nine percent. If we 
lay down hard and fast rules to expand demand, and the growth 
rate increases too rapidly, inflation will be aggravated. To 
make a big step forward this year, we are objectively required 
to have a rather loose economic environment. Therefore, it is 
not suitable for the economic growth rate for 1994 to exceed 10 
percent. 
  Judged from the angle of demand, planned fixed asset 
investment for the whole year is 1.3 trillion yuan, social 
commodity retail sales will be 1.6 trillion yuan, price reform 
will make quite a big step forward, and including the time-lag 
of basic money input from the previous year, it is estimated 
that China will strive to keep the inflation rate under 10 
percent. 
  Last year the central authorities mainly relied on economic 
means, and not on administrative means, to strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and did not take measures 
to control prices by laying down any hard and fast rules. Due 
to the control of total demand, the present price rise has 
slowed down. 
  The introduction of banking, fiscal charges, and other 
reform 
measures in 1994 will not lead to price increases. The 
introduction of price reform measures will only affect pricing 
structure changes. The central authorities attach great 
importance to inflation. When prices of grain and edible oil 
went up recently, the central authorities immediately took a 
number of measures to ensure market stability. Now some prices 
have gone down to a certain extent. 
  The purpose of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control is to achieve a basic balance between general supply and 
general demand, avoid a tight macroeconomic environment, and 
reduce the inflation rate. The state will flexibly wield the 
tool of currency policy, control money supply with satisfaction, 
and make its growth rate stay at 20 to 25 percent. It is 
estimated that price increases this year will be under 10 
percent. In making plans this year, the state has taken full 
consideration of the pressure of high-speed economic growth on 
inflation. In making arrangements for the scale of fixed asset 
investments and the extent of total social commodity retail 
sales, it has also allowed for unforeseen circumstances. The 
growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) has also been 
readjusted from 13 percent for 1993 to 9 percent. 
  [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] The Chinese mainland recently took 
measures to curb price increases of grain, but there was little 
essential growth of peasants' income in recent years. How 
should this contradiction be handled? 
  [SCRE] There were increases in the peasants' income in 
recent years, but after deducting the factor of price increases, 
they were very small. For instance, the per capita net income 
of peasants in 1993 was 880 yuan, an increase of 90 yuan over 
that of the previous year, but after deducting the factor of 
price increases, actual growth was only about 2 percent. Do 
increases in the peasants' income rely mainly on rises in the 
price of grain and other agricultural products? Of course, and 
necessary price rises are necessary, which are also an aspect of 
raising the peasants' incomes. This year, due to the impact of 
the release of raw coal and crude oil prices, it is necessary to 
further raise the purchasing prices of grain and cotton. But 
the price level is affected by supply and demand relations, and 
it is impossible for it to stay at a high level for a long 
period of time. In fact, the prices of grain and other 
agricultural products in China are already close or equal to 
international market prices. It seems that, from an 
agricultural point of view, to increase the income of the 
peasants it is necessary to take the road of high yield, best 
quality, and high efficiency. Apart from developing high-yield, 
best-quality, and highly efficient agricultural products that 
suit market needs and reduce the peasants' burdens, to develop 
nonagricultural industries is the key and breach for increasing 
the peasants' income. 
  At present, there are over 100 million surplus laborers in 
China's rural areas, and there will be a new increase of over 
ten million laborers each year in the future. How we tackle the 
problem of employment for these laborers is a matter of major 
importance for raising peasants' income. The solution to the 
problem is to make great efforts to develop primary, secondary, 
and tertiary industries, of which the stress should be on 
developing township and town enterprises. Why are the peasants 
of economically developed areas in China rich? It is mainly 
because they get a large amount of income from township and town 
enterprises. At present, the income peasants derive from 
nonagricultural industries already accounts for 37 percent of 
their total income, and the great majority of the income of 
peasants in economically developed areas come from 
nonagricultural industries. Therefore, the key to major 
development of the rural economy and to increasing the peasants' 
income is to fully employ peasants and to develop township and 
town enterprises. 
  [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What reform and policy measures will the 
state take in 1994 to reduce the burdens of state-owned 
enterprises? 
  [SCRE] An outstanding problem that currently constrains 
state- owned enterprises to transform mechanisms and move toward 
the market is that they carry heavy burdens. In light of this 
problem, in 1994 the state intends to adopt, while actively 
blazing new trails in the enterprise system and building up a 
modern enterprise system that meets the requirements of market 
system, corresponding policy measures and complementary reform 
measures, reduce enterprise burdens in real earnest, and 
concentrate its efforts on creating conditions for state-owned 
enterprises to participate equally in market competition. The 
state intends to: 
  1. Adopt a unified tax rate, fair tax burdens, and 
strengthen the loan repayment capacity and funds capacity of 
state-owned enterprises. From 1 January 1994, a 33 percent 
income tax rate has been in effect for home-investment 
enterprises. The collection of budget regulatory taxes, energy 
and communication construction funds, and budget regulatory 
funds from large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is 
abolished. According to industrial policy, after-tax profits of 
old state-owned enterprises of sole proprietorship that need 
support can be retained by enterprises for their own use. 
Businesses should conscientiously implement the "General Rules 
for Enterprise Financial Affairs" and "Norms for Enterprise 
Business Accounting," and standardize enterprise cost 
accounting. Loan interest should be charged to cost, and those 
enterprises with proper conditions can increase depreciation. 
The loan repayment capacity of enterprises is enhanced by the 
above measures. 
  2. Rationally solve the debt burden problem of state-owned 
enterprises. Enterprises that find it difficult to repay 
outstanding loans on fixed assets can postpone repayment after 
being examined and verified as having bad debts and overdue 
accounts, a part of which can be handled by a bad-debt reserve 
fund by banks according to relevant regulations. 
  3. Gradually separate the nonproductive undertakings of 
enterprises and solve the problem of enterprises "running 
society." Schools for children of workers and staff run by 
enterprises and other service undertakings and social functions 
undertaken by enterprises should be separated from enterprise 
production and operations as soon as possible. Some should be 
carried on by the government, and others by social 
self-government organizations. 
  4. Pay close attention to solving the redundancy problem of 
ailing enterprises. According to a sample survey, there are 
about 20 million redundant members at their posts in ailing 
state-owned enterprises. These redundant members can be 
digested and dispersed by vigorously initiating tertiary 
industry and setting up servicing economic entities. Moreover, 
pay close attention to working out certain policy measures, and 
encourage a number of staff and workers to go to work in 
township and town enterprises, "foreign-funded" enterprises, and 
private enterprises, or look for jobs by themselves. 
  5. Enterprises that carry heavy burdens, and that lose money 
for a long time and without hope of eliminating deficits, should 
be transformed through bankruptcy, annexation, reorganization, 
and joint ventures, thus fundamentally solving the problem of 
enterprise burdens. 
  [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What is the situation of experiments with 
the shareholding system in China, and what are the plans for 
1994 ? 
  [SCRE] Under the guidance and encouragement of Comrade 
Xiaoping's talk during his inspection tour to southern China, 
the experimental work of China's shareholding system has entered 
a new stage of development. As an important form of equity 
system reform of state-owned enterprises and the transformation 
of enterprise operations, the shareholding system has won 
people's attention. The experimental work of the shareholding 
system started in 1984, and up till now it has been carried on 
for ten years. Although the time for experiments is not long, 
and the number of enterprises under experimentation is small, 
the shareholding system has shown powerful vitality in the 
market economy, injected new vigor into the equity system reform 
of state-owned enterprises, and promoted the setting up of a 
modern enterprise system. 
  According to incomplete statistics, there are 3,800 
enterprises experimenting with the shareholding system. Through 
their method of buying shares, these enterprises can be roughly 
divided into three categories: First, shareholding enterprises 
that include shares held by their own staff and workers, which 
account for about 47 percent. By this form of shareholding 
system, a number of share ownership certificates are issued to 
enterprises' staff and workers, from whom 23.5 billion yuan have 
been raised. Second, shareholding enterprises whose shares are 
purely held by legal persons, which occupy about 46 percent. 
They are mainly joint stock companies whose shares are held by 
specific legal persons, and companies with limited liability, 
invested in and organized by legal persons. Third, shareholding 
enterprises whose stocks are issued to the public, which 
accounts for about 7 percent. These joint stock companies are 
divided into three types depending on how their stocks are 
issued and listed. The first type is: A shares, which are 
issued only inside China, mainly purchased by the public of 
China. The second type is: While A shares are issued, B shares 
are also issued, which legal persons and natural persons outside 
China are allowed to purchase, and the costs of which are 
calculated in renminbi. Transactions of B shares can only be 
made in the securities markets inside China. The third type is: 
While A shares are issued, H shares are also issued to buyers 
outside China, which are listed in Hong Kong. At present, there 
are six joint stock limited companies listed in the Stock 
Exchange of Hong Kong, which includes Tsingtao Brewery, Shanghai 
Petrochemical, Guangdong Shipyard, Beiren Printing, Maanshan 
Iron, and Kunming Machine, and HK$8.4 billion have been raised. 
  By the end of 1993, 196 companies were listed for 
transaction 
in the securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, of which 
33 listed companies issued B shares, and the market price of 
listed shares amounted to 300 billion yuan. There were 25 kinds 
of directional fund-raising corporate shares listed in the 
jointly run STAQ [preceding acronym published in English; 
expansion unknown] Market and China Securities Exchange NET 
[preceding acronym published in English; expansion unknown] 
System, of which 23 kinds were listed for transactions. These 
listed companies were distributed over 19 provinces, 
municipalities, and cities whose plans were separately listed. 
Listed companies expanded in scale from small and medium-sized 
enterprises to large and especially large enterprises, extending 
to industry, commerce, urban construction, energy, 
communications, telecommunications, and other trades. To 
standardize the shareholding enterprises under experimentation 
before the end of 1990, the State Commission for Restructuring 
the Economy approved and acknowledged 119 fundraising companies 
to continue making standardization experiments. 
  The next step, whether enterprises carrying out shareholding 
system reorganization or issue stocks and list for transactions, 
is still making experiments, and not spreading out over large 
areas. The principles of experimental work are: Active 
experiments, strict standardization, steady progress, and 
healthy development. The requirements for experimental work 
are: Making experiments resolutely, not trying to make too many 
experiments, but be sure they are good, and not running into 
disorder. We must still exercise margin control over 
enterprises that are going to issue and list their shares this 
year, and whether their shares are issued inside or outside 
China, preferential measures should be taken toward large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises in energy, communications, 
telecommunications, raw and processed materials, and other 
trades. We should continue restricting monetary enterprises and 
real estate development enterprises from issuing shares, nor do 
we advocate large numbers of commercial enterprises issuing 
shares. This year we will continue recommending a larger number 
of enterprises than that of last year to issue and list their 
shares in Hong Kong and the United States. 
  [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] Please say a few words about the current 
situation of the futures market in China, the present policy of 
developing the futures market, and issues related to it. 
  [SCRE] Since leading comrades of the State Council gave us 
instructions in 1988 to study futures, the development of 
China's futures market -- from research, planning, to making 
experiments -- has been healthy. Up till now, a number of 
broker companies and exchanges for futures transactions have 
been set up, and the business volume of some exchanges has 
reached a considerable scale. However, there have been some 
problems in the course of development of the futures market, 
some of which are quite serious. For example: Recently, some 
localities and departments competed with each other to set up 
futures exchanges or retail markets with the goal of developing 
a futures business, and blindly set up futures broker companies. 
Some law enforcement departments also participated in futures 
brokering activities. Some futures broker companies of foreign 
investments, Chinese and foreign joint investments, or joint 
investments in disguised form deliberately deceived their 
clients, and some illegal elements inside and outside China 
colluded with each other in futures swindling activities. Some 
organizations and individuals lacked a basic understanding of 
the futures market, blindly took part in futures business inside 
and outside China, and were taken in and deceived, resulting in 
losses. Therefore, we must strictly standardize and control the 
futures market, and everything must go through experiments. 
  China's present policy of developing the futures market is: 
  1. In the present experimental work of the futures market, 
we must uphold the principle of "starting by standardization, 
stepping up legislation, everything goes through experiments, 
and strict control," strengthen macroeconomic regulation and 
control, and carry out unified guidance and supervision and 
management. The State Council has decided that the State 
Council Securities Committee shall be responsible for the 
guidance, planning, and coordination of the experimental work of 
the futures market, and that specific jobs shall be done by 
China Securities Supervisory and Management Committee. 
  2. Examination and approval and registration of new futures 
business and broker organizations will be temporarily suspended 
without exception. Existing futures business organizations and 
broker companies are required to complete formalities again for 
examination and approval, and those that are not approved shall 
suspend making futures transactions and futures broker business 
without exception. 
  3. Ban illegal futures broker activities. 
  4. Strict control should be exercised over state-owned 
enterprises and public undertakings taking part in futures 
business. Law enforcement departments and their affiliated 
organizations must not take part in futures broker activities. 
It is strictly prohibited to use bank loans for futures 
business. 
  China's attitude toward foreign capitals entering China's 
futures market and China's enterprises, public undertakings, and 
individuals engaged in futures business outside China is: 
China's futures market is still in its experimental stage and 
has just started, and the building of laws and regulations is 
unsound. Therefore, there is no corresponding legal guarantee 
at present for foreign capital to enter China's futures market. 
It is not suitable, nor is it safe, for them to enter. When 
China's futures market becomes somewhat mature, and when laws 
and regulations become amplified, we welcome foreign capital in 
China's futures market. Regarding China's state-owned 
enterprises, public undertakings, and individuals engaged in 
futures business activities outside China, our attitude is: 1) 
State-owned enterprises and public undertakings taking part in 
futures transactions should be kept under strict control. 
Generally, they are allowed to carry out transactions in 
appropriate commodity futures and index-linked foreign exchange 
futures, while making spot transactions on import and export 
trade. 2) Non-state-owned enterprises and individuals that have 
the capital may engage in futures speculation outside China, and 
all risks are borne by themselves. 
  [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What are the plans for China's import 
structure reform? What are your views on last year's import and 
export trade deficit? 
  [SCRE] The Chinese Government encourages exports and imports 
that are beneficial to China's economic development. Last year, 
there was a deficit (7.8 billion dollars from January to 
November) in China's foreign trade, for which there were many 
reasons. It was a problem accompanied by last years' high-speed 
economic growth. But, from a structural point of view, it also 
explained that the Chinese Government had greatly reduced 
administrative control over imports, and indicated China's 
action of further connecting tracks with international practice 
in its import structure. China reduced its import duty rates 
twice in one year (from 43 percent to about 36 percent, which 
can be regarded as average), and will in the days to come 
further reduce its import duty rate. Beginning last year, China 
carried out plans of reducing in five years about two-thirds of 
its commodities controlled by import quotas and permits, and 
commodities controlled by import examination and approval, and 
the import of machinery and electronic products was changed from 
the system of examination and approval to primarily the system 
of registration. In the future, China will further reform its 
import control system, further reduce administrative 
intervention, strengthen economic means, and maintain a basic 
balance in imports and exports.

<F P=106> [By Hu Deqiao (5170 1795 1564): "Positive Progress in </F>
Reform of Property Rights System"] 
  [Text] Reform of the property rights system is the key to 
reform of the economic structure. In recent years, with the 
constant deepening of reform and opening up, various localities 
have made bold experiments and positive explorations in light of 
their own conditions. In the last two years, in particular, 
guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks during his 
southern China tour and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, reform of the property rights 
system has markedly gathered pace and made positive progress. 
  According to a briefing by a comrade from the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, reform of the property 
rights system in China has made impressive progress in the 
following aspects: 
  --Fundamental changes have taken place in the traditional 
ownership pattern and an ownership structure with the public 
economy as the main body and the common development of many 
economic sectors has gradually taken shape. The proportion of 
the output value of state-owned industrial enterprises in the 
total industrial output value dropped from 77.6 percent in 1978 
to 48.3 percent at the end of 1992, while that of collective 
industrial enterprises rose from 22.4 percent to 38.2 percent, 
and that of foreign-invested, self- employed, and private 
industrial enterprises grew from zero to 13.5 percent. 
  --Experiments in transforming enterprises into joint-stock 
companies have developed healthily. By the end of 1993, there 
were more than 4,000 enterprises across the country, with a 
total stock market value of around 400 billion yuan, 
experimenting with the joint-stock system; over 200 joint-stock 
companies were listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen; and six large 
enterprises including the Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. and 
Qingdao Brewery issued stocks in Hong Kong. Rural enterprises 
under the cooperative shares system have shown momentum of rapid 
development. 
  --Introduction of foreign capital into the country and 
capital export have further expanded. There are now 117 
countries and regions investing in China. Last year, China 
signed agreements worth $110.852 billion in foreign capital, 
with the actual foreign capital input at $25.759 billion. 
  --A large number of small state-owned enterprises are 
operated by civilians. Such enterprises account for a 
considerable proportion in various provinces, prefectures, and 
counties in northeast, northwest, east, and central south China. 
The proportion is 60 percent in Henan, 43 percent in Hebei, 35 
percent in Nanjing, 60 percent in Chongqing, and 60 percent in 
Beijing's commerce department and its affiliated organizations. 
  --Property rights exchanges have been gradually set up, and 
an important step has been taken in experimenting on the public 
sale of state-owned enterprises and their "grafting" with 
foreign capital. Property rights exchanges have so far been set 
up in over 20 cities and areas in over 10 provinces, and their 
business has become brisker with each passing day. Hunan 
Province put 220 enterprises on sale last year and sold 16 of 
them at a total value of 63.7 million yuan. Quanzhou City 
"grafted" all its state-owned enterprises (41 in all) and Wuxi 
City over half (170) of its large and medium-sized enterprises. 
  --Like a new force suddenly coming to the fore, rural 
enterprises under the cooperative shares system have become 
another invention of the peasant masses. Such enterprises grew 
so rapidly last year that they accounted for 10 percent of the 
total number of township and town enterprises across the country.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Major reform measures 
introduced by the Chinese Government this year will have an 
important bearing on China's development in the future, 
according to economists attending the annual sessions of the 
National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference here. 
  Economics Professor Dong Fureng said the new reform measures 
mean a major readjustment of interest relations of all social 
sectors. 
  "Reform in the new phase is so extensive that it can be 
described as `touch of a single hair will give a jolt to the 
whole body'," he said. 
  Professor Wu Jinglian described the new reform measures as 
signaling the start of a "storming heavily-fortified positions" 
phase for China's reform program. 
  Since the early 1980s, he said, China's economic reform has 
gone through "rapids and shoals." The country's economic system 
has finally come on the track of a market economy after 
different steps of transition, from central planning, to central 
planning supplemented by market regulations, to "a planned 
commodity economy," he said. 
  Statistics show that prices of 90 percent of consumer goods 
and 85 percent of capital goods are now regulated by the market; 
and the value of products unregulated by state mandatory plans 
account for over 95 percent of the national industrial output, 
he said. 
  Scholars attending the sessions agree that reforms in the 
past decade have accumulated precious experience and achieved 
great successes. 
  However, limited progress has been made in the reform of 
such 
difficult areas as banking, finance, taxation, foreign exchange, 
investment and enterprise system. If nothing is done for these 
areas, they said, China's economy would face the double ills of 
hyerflation and stagnation for a long time to come. 
  Facing challenges and opportunities, the government has 
started all-round reforms, which have won support from the 
public, they said. 
  Since China instituted a single exchange rate, a new 
taxation 
system and other reform measures from the beginning of this 
year, Wu Jinglian said, the economy has maintained a relatively 
high growth rate and the market shown a stable trend. 
  Reform of banking, finance, investment and foreign trade 
sectors as well as state-owned enterprises is proceeding 
healthily, he said. 
  Professor Wang Jue believed that the new reform measures 
will 
result in a prototype of a new system by the end of this year, 
the public will become familiar with them next year and a 
framework of the new system will come into being in three years. 
"By the year 2000, China's economy will `dock' with the 
international market," he said. 
  However, some economists have worries over the current 
reforms. An economist with a Ph.D. said that the real test will 
come in the second half of 1994 when all reform measures are 
implemented and economic growth approaches the zenith of the 
current cycle. 
  Monetary experts said that real threat comes from inflation, 
because a considerable number of the Chinese people have a 
limited tolerance for price hikes. 
  For Economics Professor Li Yining, the main problem is 
unemployment. "In terms of economics, inflation is not a serious 
question as long as it is lower or equal to economic growth," he 
said. "But high unemployment may trigger social instability." 
  Another economist said success of the ongoing reforms hinges 
on the performances of governments at all levels, which are 
targets of the reforms as well as their designers, executors and 
organizers.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 17 (XINHUA) -- China's general 
merchandise sector, both retail and wholesale, is gaining 
momentum, according to a symposium held here recently. 
  Managers who took part in the annual meeting on general 
merchandise, which closed here few days ago, said they believed 
that competition in the market will become more intense. As a 
result, the companies engaged in retail and wholesale will have 
to adjust their business structures and change their management 
mechanisms. 
  Over the past few years many of the state-owned wholesale 
companies in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou have made 
great achievements in broadening their business scopes and 
shifting their management mechanisms, according to the meeting. 
  Among the more than 300 members of the national general 
merchandise association, 46 retail and wholesale companies have 
so far adopted the joint stock system, and 16 have been listed 
on the country's stock exchanges.

<F P=106> [Report by Li Xiuqing (2621 4423 3237) and Sun Minqiang </F>
(1327 3046 1730): "No. 11 Research Institute of Carrier Rocket 
Research Academy of China Aerospace Industry Corporation Scores 
Fruitful Results in Manufacturing Civilian Goods"] 
  [Text] Researchers of the China Aerospace Industry 
Corporation Carrier Rocket Research Academy No. 11 Research 
Institute have applied themselves to revamping and transplanting 
their professional techniques, and thus have opened a broader 
and broader path in serving the national economy. For the last 
10 years, they have developed goods for civilian use, 
transformed projects, and developed nearly 1,000 major import 
substitutes by making use of techniques for the manufacture of 
rocket engines. Twenty percent of their innovations were unique 
in the country or filled in the gaps in the fields of science 
and technology. 
  The research institute concentrated on developing the key 
components, projects, and major equipment for the petrochemical, 
metallurgical, light, and textile industries which China 
previously had to import from abroad. It utilized technologies 
for the manufacture of rocket engines, including vacuum [zhen 
kong 4176 4500], automatic control, heat exchange, special 
pumping [te zhong beng fa 3676 4429 3119 7042], and electronic 
quantitative [dian zi ji liang 7193 1311 6060 6852] 
technologies, and others. The safety valve needed for the 
equipment imported by the petrochemical department had been seen 
as an item that could not be manufactured in China, with the 
result that the state had to spend millions of U.S. dollars in 
importing the valve from abroad every year. During the "Seventh 
Five-Year Plan," however, the research institute, with the 
assistance of the China National Chemicals Import and Export 
Corporation and of customers, developed 10,000 valves in 300 
varieties, with 2,000 specifications. These valves were as good 
as or even better than their imported counterparts in terms of 
quality. The research institute is now the only unit in the 
country that can manufacture high-speed pumps for civilian use. 
Therefore, the institute was declared by the State Science and 
Technology Commission as China's engineering development center 
for special pump valves. 
  Earlier, the institute carried out reforms designed to 
quickly transform science and technology into productive forces, 
and to adapt its scientific and technological products to market 
needs. Out of the nine research laboratories under the 
institute, three were still responsible for developing "defense 
products," and the remaining six were committed to developing 
civilian items. About 500 science and technology workers were 
sent to all quarters across the country to gather information 
and seek out markets, and they obtained a steady flow of orders 
for various civilian items. They now have set up close 
partnership relations with enterprises -- large petrochemical 
enterprises, in particular -- in more than 20 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions. Since 1990, the 
institute's output value has grown by 20 percent annually.

<F P=106> ["XINHUA Mailbox -- Questions and Answers on New Tax System: </F>
What Are the Specific Contents of the Value-Added Tax?"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- The current 
value-added tax [VAT] adopts a scheme consisting of a basic rate 
and a low rate: the basic rate is 17 per cent while the low rate 
is 13 percent. A zero tax rate will be applicable to export 
commodities, which means once a product has been declared at 
customs and exported, all tax payments will be refunded. 
  According to the current VAT, sales of the following goods 
are subject to a low tax rate: (1) grains and edible vegetable 
oil; (2) water, central heating, air conditioning, hot water, 
coal gas, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, methane, and 
household-use coal-related products; (3) books, newspapers, and 
magazines; (4) foodstuff, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, farm 
machinery, and agriculture-use vinyl sheets; and (5) other 
merchandise as may be prescribed by the State Council. A 
13-percent tax rate has been fixed on the aforementioned goods, 
be they sold by industry or commerce. 
  Sales tax is arrived at by multiplying the sales amount by 
the fixed VAT rate. Sales tax is to be computed by the seller 
according to the fixed rate. Purchase tax refers to the tax 
amount stated in a purchase invoice when an enterprise pays for 
the goods, including the sales tax paid at a previous taxation 
stage for the goods purchased. The sales tax paid by an 
enterprise minus the purchase tax will be the taxable amount. 
When a taxable amount is in the negative, it may be offset in 
the next transaction. The sales amount mentioned above is 
exclusive of tax. 
  Which type of purchase tax amount is not deductible from the 
sales tax? Specifically, this includes the following 
categories: (1) purchases of fixed assets; (2) purchases of 
goods or taxable services not for use by an enterprise in its 
commodity production or not for resale; (3) purchases of goods 
or taxable services by an enterprise for use in production of 
duty-free commodities; (4) purchases of goods or taxable 
services for collective welfare or personal consumption; (5) 
purchased goods sustaining losses due to damage not through 
normal wear and tear; (6) purchased goods or taxable services 
used in unfinished or finished products sustaining losses due to 
damage not through normal wear and tear.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (CNS) -- Haikou, Guangzhou, 
Nanning, Qingdao and Ningbo were the five cities with the 
highest prices in the country last year. The mayors from these 
cities expressed their opinions on price rises in their cities. 
  Mayor of Hainan [as received], Mr. Zeng Harorong, said that 
Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, saw a 25.8 percent rise in 
retail prices last year while the price index for residential 
consumer goods increased by 30 percent last January, ranking the 
city first in terms of price rises among on the 35 medium- and 
large-sized cities in the country. According to Mr. Zeng, the 
overall opening of grain prices and the rising adjustment of 
fares and charges for energy and transportation last year 
resulted in the prices of fine and coarse food grain increasing 
by 37 percent and 44 percent respectively and the prices of 
pork, eggs and chicken which were related to the grain prices 
increasing by 29 percent, 40 percent and 44 percent 
respectively. Residents' wages income was, however, also raised 
by an average 30 percent last year and its suburbs' farmers' 
income from their production by 40 percent. 
  NPC [National People's Congress] deputies from Guangdong 
criticized the province in its talking about agriculture while 
not carrying their talk into practice, resulting in a reduction 
of grain output in three consecutive years. Guangzhou, as the 
capital of the province, saw retail prices and prices for 
people's daily expenses respectively rising to the second 
highest and the fourth highest in the country. Mayor of the 
city, Mr. Li Ziliu, said in his explanation of this problem that 
the rapid price growth in some commodities such as steel 
products could not be kept under control by localities. 
  Nanning, capital of Guangxi, suffered 25.1 percent increase 
of prices for residents' daily expenses and 24.1 percent growth 
in retail prices last year, respectively ranking the city second 
and third in the country. According to analysis by the mayor of 
the city, Mr. Xie Ruxuan, there were three reasons for the price 
rise. First, the absolute value of prices in the city had been 
low for a long time in the past since the city was listed as a 
coastal opening city until the year before last year because of 
military reasons; second, the economy in the city started its 
rapid development last year with investment in fixed assets 
reaching RMB 1.9 billion, 90 percent up over the previous year; 
and third, residents' daily expenses in the city last year 
increased by 47 percent. [sentence as received]

  [Text] Beijing, Mach 14 (CNS) -- Deputy-Governor of the 
People's Bank of China Mr. Zhou Zhengqing said today that the 
bank together with other relevant departments planned to offer 
credit to key industries such as coal, metallurgy and electric 
power which were indebted to each other in order to relieve the 
problem of "triangular debts". 
  "Triangular debts", Mr. Zhou said, reflected the shortage of 
circulating capital in enterprises resulting from the failure of 
utilization of investment in fixed assets and products failing 
to meet market demands. 
  The key to solving such debts, he said, lay in restricting 
overgrowth of investment in fixed assets and the speeding up of 
the transferring of enterprises' operating mechanism. There was 
also a need for adjustment of product structure and an 
improvement in economic efficiency. 
  The People's Bank of China, Mr. Zhou said, would strictly 
control the total amount of credit this year. A new increase of 
RMB [renminbi] 470 billion for bank loans had been decided based 
on an increase of nine percent for the national economy this 
year. 
  The restriction on the total amount of credit did not mean 
tightening the money supply but indicating support for key 
industries. Funds for agricultural production and the purchase 
of farming and sideline products as well as loans for 
infrastructural construction for energy, transport and raw and 
finished materials would be guaranteed, he said. Circulating 
capital would also be offered to enterprises in cases where what 
they produced could find markets. 
  Mr. Zhou said that more than 90 percent of money offered by 
the state for key construction had been made available. 
"Triangular debts" were the result of some enterprises failing 
to raise enough funds for themselves, resulting in a funding 
shortage. 
  Mr. Zhou reiterated that three principles set out in Premier 
Li Peng's government work report had to be carried out in order 
to control the scale of fixed assets investments. First, a 
certain proportion of the capital on hand should be guaranteed 
for new infrastructural construction products. Second, the 
banks should strengthen their supervision and administration in 
order to see that there was no embezzling of circulating funds 
for investment. Third, basic circulating capital should be 
guaranteed for production purposes.

  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (CNS) -- According to the 
relevant department, since the beginning of this year, steel 
products in China, which once suffered sluggish sales in the 
markets have now had an increasing demand with their prices 
skyrocketing. 
  Since mid-January this year, the prices of steel products' 
futures for construction purposes have been rising rapidly with 
the prices in Suzhou, Tianjin and Shanghai markets for such 
futures set for July and August this year generally rising to 
RMB [renminbi] 3,900 per tone, equal to the highest price in 
1993. 
  The rise of futures' prices has promoted the rise of prices 
in the spot market with some steel plants continuously raising 
the ex- factory prices for steel products while in addition, 
some big dealers on the one hand have been engaged in panic 
purchasing and on the other hand have kept back such products 
from being sold out. Some personnel have warned that if such a 
phenomenon is not kept under control, the skyrocketing of steel 
products' prices would recur. 
  According to experts, the rebound of demand for such 
products 
is one of the factors resulting in the price rise but the main 
factor lies in capital speculative activities.

<F P=106> [From "China Economic News" column: "New Regulations on </F>
Establishing Joint-Stock Companies"] 
  [Text] Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation laid down new regulations on the 
establishment of joint- stock companies: 
  First, Sino-foreign corporations may issue special renminbi 
shares (B shares) to attract foreign funds. This is a new form 
of using direct foreign investment. Economic and trade 
departments in various localities should properly handle 
examination, approval, and management work. 
  Second, the establishment of corporations issuing special 
renminbi shares or the issuance of special renminbi shares by 
existing companies should be regarded as using foreign capital, 
and economic and trade departments in all localities should 
examine their contracts and rules according to the state's 
relevant laws, regulations, and approval procedures for using 
foreign capital. If any existing foreign-funded enterprises are 
to be reorganized into corporations, their assets should be 
reevaluated, and their revised contracts and rules should be 
examined and approved by the authorities concerned. 
  Third, apart from Shanghai and Shenzhen, the establishment 
of 
Sino-foreign corporations should be reported to the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation for examination so that 
they can determine whether they are able to enjoy (or continue 
to enjoy) the status of foreign-funded enterprises. 
Certificates will be issued to them if such a status is 
approved. The corporations should apply for the issuance of 
special renminbi shares according to the relevant regulations of 
the State Council and the management regulations of the Shanghai 
and Shenzhen securities exchanges. 
  Fourth, the establishment of Sino-foreign corporations 
should 
be in keeping with China's industrial policy on using foreign 
capital, and is now limited to industries in which the state 
encourages and allows foreign investment. No Sino-foreign 
corporations can be set up in industries in which they are not 
allowed to do so or where the interim regulations on the 
operational terms of Sino-foreign joint ventures do not allow 
them to do so.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A New Measure To Maintain People's </F>
Living Conditions"] 
  [Text] The State Council has issued the "Circular on 
Strengthening Supervision and Examination of Prices of Basic 
Necessities and Services for Residents," which demands that 
departments in charge of prices within governments at various 
levels use price adjustment records and the information feedback 
system to supervise and monitor the price trend of 20 
commodities and services which have the closest ties to the 
people's living conditions, and, when necessary, they should 
examine price increases for certain commodities and carry out 
appropriate intervention according to the situation. Under the 
new situation in which the socialist market economy system is 
being promoted and established, this is an important measure to 
strengthen macroeconomic management in order to maintain 
people's living conditions and deepen price reform. 
  Maintaining relatively stable prices of basic necessities 
and 
services for residents has a direct bearing on the immediate 
interests of the broad masses of the people, as well as on 
economic development, the deepening of reform, and social 
stability. Among commodities and services included in the 
"circular" by the State Council for supervision and examination, 
most have had price restrictions lifted and have been handed 
over to local governments for management. Of these, most are 
basic necessities such as the "shopping basket," "rice bag," and 
"stove," which account for a relatively big proportion of 
residents' expenditure. Changes in the prices of these 
commodities and services have already become a focus of concern 
among the masses. To stabilize the prices of basic necessities 
and services for residents, the party and government have 
already adopted a series of measures, such as increasing 
effective supply, strengthening macro regulation and control, 
and, in particular, grasping agriculture and the "shopping 
basket" project. This time, the State Council has decided to 
carry out supervision and examination of the prices of 20 
commodities and services, and this is another practical thing 
done by the party and government for the masses of people. 
  At present, the prices of an absolute majority of 
commodities 
and services have had restrictions lifted, and this is an 
important achievement of price reform. However, having lifted 
restrictions on prices does not mean that the duty of price 
reform has already been accomplished. According to the goals 
and demands of the reform of the economic system decided at the 
14th party congress, the duty of price reform is to establish 
pricing mechanisms in which prices are mainly formed by market 
on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to establish a sound 
and effective system for the government to regulate and control 
market prices. Although we have done a great deal of work in 
this area over the years, we still lag behind the goals set by 
reform. Recently, the rise in the general level of prices in 
the whole country has been relatively big, and the market price 
order has been chaotic. One of the reasons is because 
corresponding reforms in the macroeconomic regulation and 
control and price regulation and control systems have not 
followed suit, and because there is no effective regulatory and 
control measure to deal with the great increases in commodities 
prices after the lifting of price restrictions. The 
announcement by the State Council on implementing the "circular" 
is a measure for the government to guide and moderately 
intervene in market prices after the lifting of restrictions on 
prices, and, with this, to promote and establish a price 
regulation and control system. This is another practical step 
in taking the initiative to adapt to the development needs of 
the socialist market economy and deepen price reform. 
  The price regulatory and control measures mentioned in the 
"circular" have a precondition, that is, respect for 
enterprises' right to decide prices at their own discretion. 
The focus of the supervision and examination is not to stop 
enterprises from exercising their power to fix prices of 
commodities and services which have already had price 
restrictions lifted; it is to carry out appropriate restrictions 
on the strength and frequency of price increases for certain 
commodities within a certain period of time, and the purpose is 
to prevent prices from soaring. The "circular" has set out the 
general principle and demand of when the government carries out 
price intervention, whereas concrete implementation procedures 
will be worked out by local departments in charge of prices 
according to actual conditions in localities and will be 
implemented after securing approval from local people's 
governments. 
  A price regulation and control system adapted to the needs 
of 
a socialist market economy must be perfected step by step during 
the practice of reform. Establishing a system of supervision 
and examination of the prices of basic necessities and services 
for residents is an exploration into establishing a new system 
of price regulation and control. We believe that with common 
efforts by various localities and relevant quarters, and with 
the support of the broad masses of the people, the 
implementation of this system will surely play a positive role 
in deepening reform, stabilizing the overall situation, and 
maintaining people's living conditions.

<F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" by staff reporter Xia Jun (1115 </F>
8823): "Aquatic Industry: Output Ranks First in the World in 
Past Four Consecutive Years"] 
  [Text] "Have fish in your meal" was once a standard for a 
good life for our ancestors. Today, this good life has become a 
reality in China. All year round, live fish and all kinds of 
prawns, shellfish, and aquatic plants are found everywhere in 
city and rural fairs and markets. A dozen years or so ago, 
however, aquatic products had to be rationed with food coupons. 
  In the past 40 years or more since the founding of the PRC, 
China's aquatic products industry has developed roughly this 
way: The 1950's were a period of recovery and speedy 
development; the annual output of aquatic products rose at an 
annual rate of 21 percent, from 450,000 tonnes in 1949 to 3.09 
million tonnes. In the 1960's, owing to the excessive 
extraction of aquatic products, their annual output did not 
increase, but decreased to 290,000 tonnes. The 1970's saw a slow 
annual average increase of 4 percent, with the annual output 
rising to 4.305 million tonnes. The 1980's were a "golden 
period" of brave reforms and speedy growth. By adopting a 
series of important reform measures, such as "paying 
simultaneous attention to the breeding, extraction, and 
processing of aquatic products, with the emphasis on breeding 
and allowing for the emphasis to shift in light of the 
situations of different localities," and removing all 
restrictions on the prices of aquatic products, we ushered in a 
new prospect of extraordinary development. In the past 15 years, 
the China's aquatic products output has seen a 2.8-fold 
increase, and total output for 1993 reached 17.86 million 
tonnes, representing an average annual increase of 9 percent. 
In the eight years since all price restrictions were removed, 
there has been an average annual increase of 1.35 million tonnes 
or more than 12 percent. 
  In addition to the increase in total output, the structure 
of 
the aquatic products industry also has changed in a gratifying 
way. First, the output from sea fishery has decreased, while 
that from inland fishery has risen. The ratio between the 
former and the latter in 1979 was 74:26, but that in 1993 was 
60:40. Second, the output from catching has decreased, while 
that from breeding has risen. The ratio has proceeded from 
72:29 in 1979 to 52:48 at the present time. 
  In the years since 1990, China has ranked first in the world 
in the output of aquatic products and China's proportion in the 
world's total aquatic products output has risen from 1/45 to 
approximately 1/6. 
  Despite the fact China is a world leader in the output of 
aquatic products, the per-capita possession comes only to 14 kg, 
equivalent to only two-thirds of the world's average level. The 
many factors restricting the development of China's aquatic 
products industry remain, but as long as we make efforts and 
struggle unremittingly, China will be a leader, not only in 
total output of the aquatic products industry in the future, but 
also in the conservation and utilization of resources and in 
comprehensive social and economic efficiency.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The people in China 
have planted a total of 18 billion trees since the early 1950s, 
and the man-made afforested area amounts to 33 million ha, 
making it the world leader in this respect, according to the 
"CHINA ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL". 
  Obvious progress has been made in developing the 6.7-million 
ha fast-growing tree base, the northern China shelter belt, and 
the tree belts around the farmlands in the plains areas, on the 
middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River, along the 
coastal areas, in the Taihang Mountains and in arid areas. 
  The professional paper noted that Guangdong, Fujian and 
Hunan 
Provinces have taken the lead in covering their barren mountains 
with trees. 
  The forestry departments, of which the gross output value 
rose from 2.52 billion yuan in 1952 to 140 billion yuan last 
year, offered several billion cu m of timber for national 
economic development, and expanded the afforested areas by more 
than 133 million ha. 
  According to Xu Youfang, minister of forestry, China will 
raise its tree coverage rate from the present 13.92 percent to 
15.3 percent in 1995 and that of cities to 25 percent.

Xiang Xiangbin (0686 4382 2430) and Yan Zebo (0917 3419 3134) 
from Jingshan County in Hubei: "Why Does Grain Price Hike 
Induce Worries?"] 
  [Text] The spring equinox of the Year of the Dog has not 
yet arrived, but the Jingshan County Chemical Fertilizer Plant 
in Hubei Province has already entered its busy season a month 
early. All of the 30,000 tonnes of ammonium bicarbonate in 
stock has been sold out, and the average amount of ammonium 
bicarbonate bought by each peasant household in the county has 
reached about 1 tonne. However, the line of vehicles waiting to 
buy fertilizers at the gate of the plant is still growing. 
  At the Qianchang Town Seed Center, there is also a long line 
of people waiting to buy seeds. The director of the center said 
happily: "At this time last year, not even one catty of grain 
seeds had been sold. This year, 90,000 kg of 135,000 kg of 
hybrid grain seeds scheduled for sale during the whole year have 
been sold." The whole county's situation is even better. The 
accumulated total of grain seeds bought by peasants has exceeded 
500,000 kg, equivalent to over 80 percent of the amount used 
last year. 
  Last winter, although the government adopted measures to 
stabilize and lower grain prices, grain prices still went up to 
a certain extent. This has caused a craze to grow grain, has 
injected vitality into the development of the rural economy, and 
also put forward a new task of readjusting the agriculture 
structure. 
  Pei Lianggeng, a major grain grower in Jingshan, has already 
bought all the grain seeds he needs this year. County and town 
leaders concerned suggested that he should put aside some 
farmland to grow lotus and other cash crops. Pei Lianggeng said 
very reluctantly: "At present, grain prices are so good and you 
are asking me to grow this and to try my luck blindly. I have 
no experience in growing cash crops and even if I have, I am not 
willing to do this. Who does not know that one should grow 
something with a rising price? In Jingshan County, peasants 
with this way of thinking are not in the minority. 
  Jingshan County is famous for growing grains and the per 
capita grain sold and its percentage of commodity grains have 
ranked first in the province for 10 consecutive years. Last 
year, the output value of grain, cotton, and edible oil was more 
than that of diversified management for the first time. Will 
this percentage be reversed this year? Duan Xianbin, deputy 
secretary of the Jingshan County CPC Committee and who is in 
charge of agriculture, said with a heavy heart: "The rise of 
grain prices has given a guide to the peasants. Viewed from the 
situation of the spring farming this year, some peasants have 
staked this year's bumper harvest on growing grains. Some 
peasants who are growing other crops or have engaged in the 
breeding trade also feel regretful and are ready to grow grains 
again." How should we look at this?

<F P=106> [Article from the "How Peasants Head for the Market" column </F>
by Liu Tianyi (0491 1131 5030) from Huating County in Gansu: 
"Which Is the Way to the Market?--Peasants' Confusion Needs To 
Be Cleared Up"] 
  [Text] Since the abolition of the agricultural planting 
plan in 1992, the broad masses of peasants have been attempting 
to head from traditional agriculture to the market. However, 
after weathering storms over the past year or so, many peasants 
have experienced various dilemmas caused by not knowing what 
course to take. 
  One of them is: Who will manage agriculture after the 
peasants head for the market? Since the beginning of last year, 
the whole society has been publicizing leading agriculture to 
the market and letting the peasants grow whatever brings them 
money. However, being accustomed to doing production work 
according to plans worked out by the higher-level authorities 
over the years, the peasants have found it difficult to adapt 
themselves to the new situation overnight. It sounds good to 
grow whatever brings them money, but they do not know what to do 
when they actually try. Growing grain alone will not bring them 
much money, but if everyone rushes headlong into growing cash 
crops, they certainly will not make any money either. It makes 
one's heart ache to think of the fall in the price of apples in 
Gansu, hot peppers in Shaanxi, and water melons, garlic, and so 
on in the provinces of the central plain. Red beans, white 
beans, black beans, and broad beans sold well last year, but who 
can be sure that they will also sell well this year? It is also 
difficult for just one or two households to grow special cash 
crops. Where can they buy the seeds or learn the relevant 
techniques? Where should they sell their products? At present, 
most peasants can only grow enough grain to ensure they have 
enough to eat and resign the rest to fate. 
  The market economy is an economy characterized by economic 
results. It really is a tough job for peasants, who are simple 
and unsophisticated, universally badly educated, and not 
economically minded, to grope for information, carry out market 
analysis on their own, and forecast what crops they should grow 
to make money. 
  Another dilemma is: How can one wade across a river without 
finding stepping stones? Since the peasants cannot clarify the 
market situation, they are compelled to act blindly. However, 
as we all know, agriculture is quite different from other 
sectors. The most distinct characteristic of agriculture is 
that its production cycle is long and its risk index is high. 
The risks are mainly expressed in five aspects. The first is 
the risk of natural disasters. At present, peasants in the 
overwhelming majority of localities depend as much on human 
efforts as on the climate. The second is the risk of pests. 
Many insects' resistance to pesticides has increased, and if 
dosages are not increased or if any mistakes are made in using 
the pesticides, it is possible that nothing will be reaped. The 
third is market risk. The market is like a battlefield in which 
commodity prices are ever-changing. Moreover, cycles of 
production of agricultural and sideline products are long. At 
sowing time, prices may be good, but the prices may change by 
harvest time. The fourth is the risk caused by inferior and 
fake means of production in agriculture. At present, fake 
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds have done serious 
harm to the peasants, and the peasants can do nothing about 
them. The fifth is that inputs to agriculture have decreased 
markedly. Peasants' hidden burdens remain at a high level. All 
this has inevitably caused a sense of misery and hopelessness of 
"finding no stepping stones to cross the river" among more and 
more peasants who have just become involved in the market 
economy. 
  The third dilemma is: High output does not necessarily lead 
to high income. In recent years, peasants' incomes have 
increased slowly mainly because the relative interests of 
agriculture are indeed too low. High output may not necessarily 
lead to higher income, and higher output can even result in 
greater losses. Although in recent years, prices of agricultural 
and sideline products have risen a little, the extent of price 
rises for the agricultural means of production far exceed those 
for agricultural and sideline products. According to 
statistics, since the beginning of last year, price rises for 
various agricultural and sideline products have been less than 
12 percent, but for pesticides, plastic sheeting, chemical 
fertilizers, farm machinery, and so on, the rises are over 20 
percent, and for diesel oil, kerosene, gasoline, and so on, over 
80 percent. The prices of some agricultural means of production 
have even soared or doubled, and this is really dreadful. 
However, peasants cannot do without them. Relatively speaking, 
prices of agricultural and sideline products have apparently 
been on the low side and the scissors difference between the 
prices of industrial and agricultural products is increasing day 
by day. Since peasants' real incomes are not increasing, their 
enthusiasm about farming cannot be aroused. This has compelled 
able-bodied laborers to earn money in other localities and 
farmland being laid waste is unavoidable. No wonder peasants 
have cried out: Where is the way out for peasants? Where is 
the way out for agriculture? 
  The answer is naturally to further deepen reform. How should 
grain production be protected as agriculture moves toward the 
market, especially after restrictions on grain prices have been 
removed? Is it to develop "high output, high efficiency, and 
high quality" agriculture and earnestly increase peasants' 
incomes? Although this has already attracted great attention 
from the CPC Central Committee and governments at all levels, it 
is even more necessary at this time for the whole society to 
show common concern, give support, and carry out studies and 
explorations.

<F P=106> ["Note" by "RENMIN RIBAO editor" from the "How Peasants Head </F>
for the Market" column: "Let Us Join the Discussion"] 
  [Text] The reason for publishing these two articles is to 
draw more attention to contradictions, problems, and 
difficulties which have cropped up in the course of agriculture 
heading for the socialist market economy and to have more people 
explore the issue of a smooth transition of agriculture and the 
rural economy to the socialist market economy. 
  Agriculture, peasants, and the rural economy heading for the 
market is historically inevitable. However, this is not a 
simple thing. Nor can we get the desired results simply by 
removing restrictions. Although the broad masses of peasants 
have been tempered in commodity production for many years since 
the beginning of reform and opening up, and the market is 
playing a more and more important role in agriculture and the 
rural economy, this remains a new task for both the broad masses 
of rural cadres and hundreds of millions of peasants. What are 
the responsibilities of government departments in this process? 
How should they give guidance to the peasants? How should they 
organize people to blaze new trails? How should thousands upon 
thousands of households be merged with the market? Who should 
provide information in a larger scope? How should various kinds 
of risks be shared? All these questions demand exploration and 
prompts answers in practice. 
  In recent years, various localities have gained some 
successful experiences in the transition to the socialist market 
economy, and they also have encountered some new problems. We 
have opened this new column today to report questions on "How 
Peasants Head for the Market" in a concentrated manner. We 
warmly and sincerely welcome articles on successful experiences, 
good methods, feelings, understandings, questions, and even 
perplexity so long as they contribute to mutual exchange and 
mutual enlightenment.

  [Text] Changchun, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Provinces in 
Northeast China have been raising funds from various sources to 
improve their water conservancy facilities. 
  The region, with a population of 110 million, consists of 
Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning Provinces and the eastern part 
of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. 
  Two main river -- the Songhua River and the Liaohe River -- 
flow across the region, and there are three border rivers: the 
Heilong, Yalu and Tumen Rivers. 
  Including 1.43 billion yuan of central government funding, 
the region pooled more than four billion yuan (459.77 million 
U.S. dollars) between 1990 and 1993 to build 73 reservoirs and a 
number of other urban flood-prevention projects and farmland 
water conservancy projects. 
  Newly-built water projects are able to supply 159 billion 
cubic meters of water every year for industrial, agricultural 
and urban use. 
  In addition, the region obtained some 400 million U.S. 
dollars' worth of foreign loans during the past few years for 
seven of its large-scale water projects. 
  Local government sources said that previously water projects 
were paid for solely by the government, which resulted in 
inefficiency in urban flood prevention and shortage of water 
resources. 
  The provincial governments now all encourage enterprises and 
individuals to engage in undertakings related to water 
conservancy projects, which are bound to get profitable returns, 
according to government sources.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Agricultural 
development projects financed by World Bank loans have resulted 
in a great improvement in local farm product conditions and 
farmers' incomes in Baoding Prefecture of north Hebei Province, 
local agricultural officials said. 
  In Gaoyang, Boye and Lixian Counties, where the projects 
have 
been located, the officials said, grain production has increased 
from 81 million kg in 1991 to 165 million kg in 1993, and the 
average income of farmers risen to 710 yuan a year. 
  The three counties used a total 45.5 million yuan worth of 
loans from the World Bank since 1990. 
  With the money, the counties have upgraded 26,600 ha. of 
low-yielding farmland, adding 6,600 ha. to the irrigated area, 
according to the officials. 
  The loans also sponsored the expansion of a cotton ginning 
mill, the completion of which boosted the local processing 
ability by 300,000 kg, and the storage capacity of cotton seeds 
by 600,000 kg, the officials noted. 
  A large part of the loans went on the training of 
agricultural technicians and the setting up of a farm technology 
service network in rural areas. 
  The officials said that so far 26,818 agricultural 
technicians had been trained, and the technological service 
network is covering 40,000 ha of farmland in 20-odd towns and 
villages. 
  Besides providing improved seeds and farm materials to 
farmers, the network also offers services in soil analysis, 
fertilizing, field management and the promotion of new farm 
technology, the officials added.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Wancheng (1728 8001 2052): "We Should </F>
Further Emancipate the Mind in Line With Practical Conditions 
When Developing Market Economy in Cities and the Countryside"] 
  [Text] Instead of being a place where the mountains and 
the rivers end, Jirem League is a place filled with dense willow 
trees and bright flowers. The league should seize the 
opportunity to further emancipate the mind. The league should 
also accelerate reform and opening up and develop the market 
economy in both cities and the countryside. This was stressed 
repeatedly by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party 
committee, during his recent inspection tour of Jirem League. 
  From 25 to 28 January, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional 
party committee, and Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the region, 
led comrades in charge of the pertinent departments and bureaus 
under the regional party committee and the government to conduct 
a four-day inspection of Jirem League. Wang Qun and his 
entourage expressed sympathy and solicitude for the 
disaster-afflicted people in Qiandemen Sumu in Jarud Banner. 
They also convened a forum with the participation of comrades 
in charge of industrial and commercial enterprises, township and 
town enterprises, and monetary units, and listened to the work 
reports of party committees of Jirem League and Tongliao City. 
Wang Qun and some other leading comrades fully affirmed and 
highly appraised the achievements scored by Jirem League despite 
the natural calamities to its agriculture and animal husbandry 
and despite the numerous problems facing the urban economy. 
  Wang Qun stressed that from now on attention should be paid 
to the following five aspects. First, in the light of existing 
difficulties and problems, the league should enhance morale 
instead of feeling discouraged and should approach the situation 
in a correct and all-around manner. As a big agricultural 
league, Jirem League is furnished with good conditions in 
various fields and is provided with the foundation for continued 
development. As a small industrial league, Jirem League should 
depend on development, transformation, and exploitation to 
resolve industrial problems. The league should depend on 
increasing revenues and reducing expenditures and on accelerated 
development, which is most essential, to alleviate its fund 
shortage. The league is vast in territory, rich in natural 
resources, but small in population. Provided with good 
opportunity, topographical advantages, and support of the 
people, the league has great potential in becoming prosperous. 
Agricultural areas should develop the breeding, the pastoral 
areas should develop the feed growing, and the entire economy 
should be oriented to the combination of agriculture, industry, 
commerce, and trade in order to exploit latent advantages. 
Second, all levels of party committees and governments and all 
functional departments should concentrate energies on reform, 
economic development, and national unity, which is the key of 
the present work, in order to ensure the smooth progress of all 
the work of this year. This year, the league should concentrate 
on resolving major contradictions and carrying out reforms in 
rural and urban areas to accelerate development. Reform cannot 
remain in words and in slogans, but should be carried out in a 
resolute, practical, and painstaking manner until practical 
results are achieved. It should strive to improve the economic 
efficiency of rural and pastoral areas and pay attention to key 
projects, rather than undertaking "minor scattered projects." 
Third, to resolve monetary and financial problems, the league 
should depend on boosting the economy. The policies set forth 
by the state should be studies and applied well, and tax work 
should be stressed. Support should be given to the development 
of the tertiary industry, township enterprises, and individual 
and private sectors of the economy. Jirem League is not a place 
where "the mountains and the rivers end" but is a place "filled 
with dense willow tress and bright flowers." It should 
accelerate reform and depend on its own efforts to develop the 
economy. Financial, planning, and tax departments, as well as 
banks, should closely cooperate with one another to halt 
deficits. The league should be good at making and accumulating 
money. It should run mobile corporations that are opened to the 
outside world and are oriented to science and technology. It 
should also run the economic entities that are linked with 
peasant households. Because such economic entities are linked 
with both leading enterprises and numerous households, the 
government should provide them with preferential policies and 
conditions, as well as sufficient land. Cadres in their prime 
should be sent to the first lines to grasp reform and 
development in an effort to build up capable and high-efficient 
leading bodies at all levels. Fourth, the league should 
strengthen the forces of tax, banking, industrial and 
commercial, financial, and political and legal departments, as 
well as corporations and enterprises. As for fund shortage, in 
addition to obtaining more funds from the regional authorities, 
the league should depend primarily on the market economic law to 
control the funds. In the right order of importance and 
urgency, by aiming at ensuring key projects, we should spend 
more limited funds on the enterprises that are the best in terms 
of economic returns. The funds should be distributed in line 
with new ideas and new methods. By adhering to the combination 
of cropping, breeding, and processing and the combination of 
trade, industry, and agriculture (animal husbandry), the league 
should engage in developing large-scale market, major 
commodities, and large-scale circulation. The leading 
enterprises should make great efforts to continuously improve 
their level. The league should set its sights high to build 
itself into the modernized agricultural and livestock product 
base of northeast China. Fifth, the league should strengthen 
party leadership, persist in the principle of taking a 
two-handed approach and being tough with both hands, strengthen 
ideological and political work, manage social order in a 
comprehensive manner, and create a good political and social 
environment for reform and development.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 2 (XINHUA) -- North China's Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region has stepped up implementation of its 
development strategy and a new pattern of opening-up has taken 
shape. 
  The series of preferential policies and deepening of the 
internal reforms of the foreign trade system have effectively 
helped expand the scope of business activities with foreign 
enterprises and regions. 
  By the end of 1993, the number of foreign trade companies, 
border barter-trade companies and export-oriented industrial 
enterprises being granted the managerial rights in imports and 
exports all over the 12 leagues and cities of Inner Mongolia 
exceeded 90, an increase of about 30 percent over the previous 
year. 
  Agency services of the 90-plus privileged economic entities 
have channeled products of thousands of enterprises of Inner 
Mongolia to international markets and introduced foreign 
technology and products to domestic markets. 
  Last year, trade volume of imports and exports of the 
autonomous region reached 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, increasing 
by 28.2 percent over that of the previous year. 
  According to local foreign trade officials, more and more 
foreign investors have recognized the growing importance of 
Inner Mongolia, which set up economic ties with 82 countries and 
regions of the world in the year 1993. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises have mushroomed in fields like 
energy, transportation, machinery, electronics, building 
materials and textiles with capital coming from 31 countries and 
regions including the United States, Russia, Japan and the 
Republic of Korea. 
  International economic and technological cooperation have 
also been expanded. The region has signed contracts for 143 
labor service and construction projects with foreign countries. 
  Domestic enterprises and companies of the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region have also established 83 subsidiaries or joint 
ventures in Russia and Republic of Mongolia.

  [Text] Hohhot, March 2 (XINHUA) -- One day during the 
Chinese traditional Spring Festival, an old Mongolian woman went 
to a post office in Hohhot and dialed to her younger son, who 
was studying in a college in Ulaanbaatar. 
  When she heard his voice on the phone, she was very excited 
as this was unthinkable in the past. 
  The old woman had come from the Ulanqab grassland, in the 
north of Inner Mongolia. She had a good word to say for the 
region's booming telecommunications, and with good reason. 
  With the expansion of the region's transportation and 
telecommunications networks, more than 20 million herdsmen are 
finding themselves closer to the outside world. 
  They can travel by plane and train to other provinces or 
even 
abroad. Through international telecommunications, they speak 
with their overseas relatives and friends, and television 
enables them to obtain all kinds of information without leaving 
home. 
  In Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia, telecommunications 
systems have connected the city with more than 180 countries and 
regions throughout the world. Over 200 phone booths are 
scattered round the city, providing people with domestic and 
international telephone service. 
  Last year, the region's postal and telecommunications sector 
invested 760 million yuan (85 million U.S. dollars) in 
constructing or renovating over 250 telecommunications projects, 
automating all telephone exchange systems in the region's 
counties and cities. 
  Meanwhile, more micro-wave lines and optical fiber cables 
were laid, adding thousands of new long-distance switching 
networks and telephone exchanges. 
  Improved posts and telecommunications enable the region to 
get access to changes in the outside, greatly promoting local 
economy. 
  The region tops the country in its length of micro-wave 
lines, which measure nearly 5,000 kilometers. 
  Over 75 percent of the region is covered by a television 
network. In the region are 28 TV stations and over 800 TV 
transmission stations, as well as over 800 satellite land 
stations. 
  In addition, the region's transportation network has 
improved. 
  Inner Mongolia has now opened 35 commercial air routes, 
carrying more than 100,000 passengers annually. 
  From Hohhot, people can directly reach a dozen major cities 
in and out of the country. 
  The region has expanded seven airports, among which, the 
Baita Airport in Hohhot has been approved by the state as an 
international port. 
  The Manzhouli airport, located at the intersection of 
several 
international lines, is expected to become one of China's major 
international ports and handle all kinds of large cargo and 
passenger planes after being put into use this year. 
  Also in 1993, rail transport in the region was on the rise. 
  Last year, about 100,000 overseas tourists visited Inner 
Mongolia. At the same time, thousands of workers, students, 
technicians, doctors, experts, artists and merchants in the 
region went abroad.

  [Text] Huhhot, March 4 (XINHUA) -- With an investment of 
180 million yuan from state and local governments, a renovation 
project on local airports in north China's Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region was concluded recently. 
  Airports for civilian use in seven local cities have been 
expanded, rebuilt or renovated, with original soil runways 
replaced by cement ones, advanced lightning equipment installed 
and other basic facilities greatly improved. 
  Renovated airports in Huhhot and Hailar can now accommodate 
Boeing-737 and MD-82 airplanes day and night. 
  Along with the improvement of airport conditions, the Inner 
Mongolia subsidiary of Air China has also brought in BAE-146 and 
Boeing-737 jets to replace older and smaller airliners. 
  The increased number of airplanes of varying sizes has 
greatly enlarged total turnover of air transportation in Inner 
Mongolia with today's 15 airline routes of 20,000 kilometers 
long, linking the autonomous region with nine large domestic 
cities, Hong Kong and Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. 
  This new air corridor over the endless grasslands and Gobi 
Desert in northern China has contributed a lot and will 
contribute more to local economic prosperity.

  [Text] The party school of the Tianjin Municipal CPC 
Committee held a ceremony for the beginning of the 1994 spring 
semester on the morning of 1 March. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee and 
president of the party school, attended and addressed the 
ceremony. Fang Fengyou and Zheng Zhiying, standing committee 
members of the municipal party committee, attended the ceremony. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: The municipal party 
committee has attached extreme importance to the cadres' 
training and study work. The party committees at various levels 
across the municipality have paid high attention to the study of 
the Third Volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." The 
broad masses of cadres are enthusiastically engaged in the 
study. An upsurge of studying theories has started in the 
municipality and a gratifying situation has emerged. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: We should firmly grasp the fundamental 
principle of linking theory with practice, pay attention to the 
results of study, and promote the study work. Linking theory 
with practice is a fine style of study that our party has 
consistently encouraged. In the course of study, we should 
proceed from the actual conditions of Tianjin, keep close 
contact with reality, use the vivid facts that the people have 
personally experienced to deepen the (?understanding) about the 
party's basic theories and basic line, and strengthen the 
awareness of firm implementation. The most important factor for 
studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory is to master the ability 
in consciously applying this powerful ideological weapon to 
solve the realistic problems cropping up in the course of 
reform, opening up, and modernization; and to upgrade our 
ideology, understanding, and leadership ability. Only by so 
doing will we able to [words indistinct] and to make real 
results.

  [Text] A few days ago, the municipal government held a work 
conference on deepening the reform of the industrial 
enterprises. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, made a speech at the conference. 
  He stressed in his speech: It is necessary to deepen 
enterprise reform, to make overall improvement, to regard reform 
as motivation and efficiency as a key link, to transform the 
enterprise managerial mechanism, to positively create conditions 
for enterprise reform, to conscientiously implement the system 
of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks, to promote 
package reform with breakthroughs in key aspects, to concentrate 
energy on enlivening industrial enterprises, to change the 
industrial production situation as soon as possible, and to 
rejuvenate Tianjin's industry. 
  In her speech, Li Huifen, vice mayor of the municipal 
government, set forth specific requirements for the reform work 
of the industrial front in 1994. 
  At the conference, the leading cadres at or above the bureau 
level on the industrial front submitted letters of 
responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks to the 
municipal government. The [words indistinct] bureau and the 
[words indistinct] company also introduced their experiences at 
the conference. 
  Gao Dezhan set forth three opinions on reform and 
development 
of industrial enterprises. 
  First, it is necessary to deepen reform, make overall 
improvement, and concentrate energy on enlivening industrial 
enterprises. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The industrial front should adopt major 
measures to change the appearance of the enterprises with 
difficulties; and do a good job in using foreign capital, making 
structural readjustment, strengthening management, developing 
products, conducting technological transformation, and building 
leading bodies. By deepening reform, the industrial front 
should change their mechanisms; increase economic results; and 
ensure to hand over more to finance, to have enterprises obtain 
more profits, and to have the staff and workers gain more 
benefits. We should focus the deepening of enterprise reform on 
changing the managerial mechanisms. It is necessary to continue 
to implement well the enterprise law and regulations; delimit 
small accounting units with enterprises; deepen the reform of 
the employment, labor personnel, and distribution systems; 
simplify organizations; and reform and improve the 
organizational management system. 
  Second, we should conscientiously implement the system of 
responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks and ceaselessly 
improve the leadership level. 
  Gao Dezhan said: On the basis of grasping the work of his 
own department, each and every leading cadre at or above the 
bureau level on the industrial front should assume 
responsibility for the management of two good enterprises and 
two money-losing enterprises. The implementation of the system 
of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks should be 
examined and assessed every quarter and comprehensively be 
assessed at the end of the year. The assessment of the 
implementation of the system should be linked up with the 
assessment of the cadres' political achievements. 
  Third, we should comprehensively carry out the "222" 
project, 
change the appearance of the industrial enterprises as soon as 
possible, and rejuvenate Tianjin's industry. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The second plenary session of the sixth 
municipal party committee stressed the necessity to carry out 
the "222" project. That is, the municipality should grasp two 
large enterprises of key importance, including the vehicle 
industrial corporation and the [words indistinct] company, and 
grasp 20 municipal-level key enterprises; and all levels and 
districts and counties should also grasp 200 key enterprises.

  [Excerpts] Tianjin Municipal Federation of Returned 
Students which aims at uniting students who studied abroad, 
extensively connecting domestic and overseas students, 
colleagues, relatives, and friends, strengthening friendship, 
exchanging learning, providing information and service for 
Tianjin to attract students studying abroad, and promoting the 
development of Tianjin's economic construction, science and 
technology, education and public health, culture and sports, and 
other social undertakings, was established yesterday. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, 
attended and addressed the inaugural meeting. 
  Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee, gave a speech on behalf of the municipal party 
committee and government. 
  Municipal leading persons, including Wang Hongjiang, Wang 
Chenghuai, Qian Qiao, Yu Guocong, and Wang Jitao, attended the 
inaugural meeting. 
  Prior to the inaugural meeting, the Tianjin Municipal 
Federation of Returned Students held a meeting of the board of 
directors to elect Yu Guocong, vice chairman of the municipal 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as 
chairman of the federation. It also elected the hnorary 
chairman, advisers, vice chairmen, and secretary general. This 
federation is an organization to unite Tianjin's returned 
students from all circles. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech, Gao Dezhan said: Returning students have made 
great contributions to Tianjin's reform, opening up, and 
economic construction with great patriotic zeal, intelligence, 
and wisdom. They are worthy of emulation. He ardently hoped 
that the broad masses of returned students will give further 
play to their own distinctive advantages, extensively contact 
and attract more overseas students, colleagues, relatives, and 
friends to return to China and Tianjin to work, and to introduce 
trained personnel, funds, and information to promote Tianjin's 
modernization. He said: The broad masses of intellectuals, 
including the returned students, and all sectors across the 
municipality will surely be able to invigorate Tianjin as long 
as they rally around the party Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, act closely in connection with the 
party's overall situation of "seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability," work with one heart and one mind, 
struggle in unity, and immerse in hard work. The municipal 
party committee and the government will continue to create an 
external environment in which returned students can display 
their intelligence and wisdom and make contributions, will 
continue to earnestly ask for advice from them, and make joint 
efforts to manage Tianjin's work well. 
  In his speech, Li Jianguo extended warm congratulations to 
the federation of returned students on its establishment on 
behalf of the municipal party committee and government. He 
said: Since the founding of China nearly 45 years ago, batches 
of students studying abroad have returned to the motherland and 
Tianjin to participate in the development and played a very 
important role in Tianjin's economy, science and technology, 
education, public health, and various undertakings. Their pure 
heart of cherishing and serving the motherland and their lofty 
spirit of dedicating themselves to science and invigorating 
China have been praised by the party and the people. 
  Li Jianguo said: Tianjin has several hundred thousand 
specialized technical personnel and a group of specialists and 
scholars who have great influence at home and abroad. This 
backbone contingent is Tianjin's precious wealth and great 
advantage and a symbol of Tianjin's status. We must grasp the 
limited time before the end of this century, step up efforts to 
train a new generation of academic and technical leaders and a 
batch of young top personnel of domestic first-grade level and 
international advanced level, and enable Tianjin to continuously 
maintain the advantage of having trained personnel at home by 
the early period of the next century. 
  Li Jianguo said in conclusion: To push the economy forward, 
we must rely on science, technology, and education and give full 
play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of 
intellectuals. We must do a good job in handling work regarding 
returned students. It is hoped that the establishment of the 
Tianjin Municipal Federation of Returned Students will serve as 
a bridge for establishing ties and strengthening friendship with 
the broad masses of returned students, exchanging learning, and 
promoting Tianjin's economic and social development.

  [Text] Johannesburg, March 17 (CNA) -- It is in the "best 
interests" of South Africa to maintain close and steady 
relations with the Republic of China [ROC], President Frederik 
de Klerk said Thursday [18 March]. 
  Refuting rumors that Taipei-Pretoria relations are on the 
brink of break-up, De Klerk reaffirmed South Africa's desire to 
maintain normal diplomatic ties with the ROC. 
  De Klerk made the remarks during an interview with CNA after 
making a campaign speech in Johannesburg. 
  South Africa's first multi-racial election is scheduled to 
be 
held nationwide on April 26-28. The African National Congress 
[ANC] led by Nelson Mandela is expected to win big in the 
elections resulting in the formation of a coalition government 
between the ANC and De Klerk's ruling national party. 
  Mandela and the ANC have strong ties with the Chinese 
Communists and have announced on several occasions that they 
will sever ties with the ROC in favor of Beijing once in power. 
  However, De Klerk is expected to remain an influential 
figure 
in South African politics after the election and has said 
"Pretoria cherishes our relations with old friends."

  [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan's unemployment 
rate stood at 1.44 percent last year, the lowest level since 
1982, the Council for Economic Planning and Development reported 
Thursday [17 March]. 
  Council statistics show that out of an average labor force 
of 
8.87 million in 1993, only 128,000 were unemployed. 
  The labor force includes civilians 15 years of age and over 
who are available for work. 
  Officials said that the relocation abroad of labor-intensive 
industries, an increase in public investment projects, and a 
strong job demand by the service sector were among major factors 
pushing down the joblessness rate. 
  The number of employees in the manufacturing sector shrank 
by 
4 percent to 2.48 million last year mainly due to the relocation 
of labor-intensive industries and the acceleration of production 
automation, while service sector employees increased 4.2 percent 
to 4.32 million, the officials elaborated. 
  In addition, they said, the labor force participation rate 
fell to a 10-year low of 58.82 percent in 1993, indicating that 
Taiwan residents have yet to increase their willingness to work. 
  The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the 
labor force compared to all civilians 15 years of age and over, 
including those who are unavailable for work. Those unavailable 
for work are people such as housewives, students, and senior 
citizens who are not working and are not seeking jobs. 
  Meanwhile, the average monthly salary in Taiwan was 
NT$32,009 
[New Taiwan dollars] (US$1,207.88) last year, up 7.7 percent 
from the previous year. 
  The pay raise rate was the lowest level since 1986, 
indicating lackluster domestic business in 1993, the officials 
noted.

  [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- The production value of 
Taiwan's household products industry has declined 15.8 percent 
over the past five years, according to statistics released by 
the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The total value of household products produced in Taiwan has 
dropped to US$210 billion in 1993 from US$250 billion five years 
ago, the statistics showed. 
  Taiwan's household product industry groups businesses which 
produce shoes, giftware, toys, adhesives and tape, jewelry, 
sporting goods, educational products, and the printing industry. 
  Shoe manufactures registered the largest decline of the 
group, dropping 50 percent from US$110 billion in 1989 to US$55 
billion in 1993. 
  IDB officials attributed the large decline in shoe 
production 
values to the mass relocation of OEM (original equipment 
manufacturing) factories, which in turn decreased export value. 
  Both the giftware and sporting goods industries also showed 
declines of 33 percent and 14 percent respectively. 
  However, the printing and adhesive industries grew 32 
percent 
and 100 percent each during the period. The adhesive industry 
grew from US$5 billion in 1989 to US$10 billion in 1993 while 
the printing industry increased from US$38 billion five years 
ago to US$50 billion, the statistics showed. 
  Increases in domestic demand fueled the growth, the 
officials 
added. 
  The production value of Taiwan's toy industry was also up 21 
percent, totaling US$24.5 billion, the statistics showed. 
  IDB officials said that although the relocation of 
industries 
and increasing production costs undermined competitiveness, 
improvements in the industrial structure and the upgrading of 
technology helped the industry remain profitable. 
  More than 1.32 million people are employed in Taiwan's 
household products industry.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 18 (AFP)--Two illegal immigrants 
claiming to be North Koreans have asked for political asylum in 
South Korea after they were arrested by authorities here when 
they crossed the border from China, a government spokesman said 
Friday. 
  The two North Koreans, one believed to be a scientist, 
arrived in Hong Kong separately on March 11 and 13 from China, 
he said, adding "the matter is now being investigated." 
  They are the first North Koreans to defect in this way. 
  A spokesman for the South Korea consulate here said the two 
could be North Koreans, but added "we don't exactly know what's 
going on as of now. The Hong Kong government has not approached 
us on the matter." 
  The two reportedly walked across the border from China in 
broad daylight and were at first taken for Chinese illegal 
immigrants when they were stopped by border patrols on this side. 
  The Hong Kong Immigration Department was reportedly trying 
to 
assist the two in their application for asylum in South Korea.

<F P=106> [By Xie Zuan (6200 9449): "Lu Ping Says Hong Kong New </F>
Airport Project Talks Should Be Held in Compliance With the 
Memorandum of Understanding"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Lu Ping, 
director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, commented today on Hong Kong's new airport to deputies 
from the Hong Kong and Macao region of Guangdong Province to the 
8th National People's Congress. He pointed out that it is the 
consistent stand of the Chinese Government to build a new 
airport in Hong Kong. Despite the fact that the British side has 
once again complicated the issue deliberately, the Chinese side 
still cherishes the hope that the two sides can continue talks 
on the airport in line with the spirit and principle of the 
Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's New Airport, reach an 
agreement at an early date, and strive to start construction of 
the airport as soon as possible. 
  Lu Ping indicated that the aforementioned Memorandum of 
Understanding is a solemn diplomatic document signed by the 
heads of both the Chinese and British Governments; therefore, 
everything should have been fine after the signing of the 
document. However, the British side has asked us to make our 
position known. The Chinese Government has already declared its 
stance, that is, we support the idea of building a new airport 
at low cost and with high efficiency and demand that it brings 
no financial burden to the future government of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [SAR]. To put it in detailed 
terms, financial reserves of HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars] 
should be set aside for the SAR government and the total debt 
borne by the government should not exceed HK$5 billion. Things 
could begin right then if everyone agreed to act in compliance 
with the Memorandum of Understanding. However, the British Hong 
Kong Government later put forward a financial package in which 
liabilities overran by a large margin the provisions in the 
Memorandum of Understanding. The total amount of liabilities 
set out in the first package stood at over HK$70 billion. Lu 
Ping said that the British side must be kidding if it is indeed 
acceptable for the SAR government to undertake debt of over 
HK$70 billion given financial reserves of just HK$25 billion. 
  Lu Ping noted: The British side put forward a third and then 
a fourth financial package, and the latter still falls short of 
the stipulations of the Memorandum of Understanding. Therefore, 
the British side is to blame for a failure to act in accordance 
with the Memorandum of Understanding. The issue is very simple, 
and they can go ahead without holding discussions with us. The 
reason why the British side wants to hold talks with the Chinese 
side is because nothing can be accomplished if they stick to 
this financial package. They will not be able to raise loans. 
Banks will not grant them loans because the financial package 
raised by the British side does not conform to the Memorandum of 
Understanding. 
  Lu Ping added that the British side is making trouble again. 
Despite this, the Chinese side will not rigidly adhere [si qia 
zhu 2984 1595 0145] to the HK$5 billion ceiling, yet hopes the 
British side can consult the Chinese side if debts exceed HK$5 
billion. The problem now is that the gap is too wide. Lu Ping 
said that at the present stage, the Chinese side is still 
prepared to hold talks with the British side and hopes an 
agreement can be reached at an early date.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (CNS) -- Vice Chairman of the 
Board of Directors of the Bank of China and Director of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Administrative office of the Bank of China, Mr. 
Huang Diyan, speaking today in an exclusive interview with this 
agency, said that the situation in Hong Kong in the next three 
years, the latter transition period of the territory, would be 
more complicated, and a steady transition of the territory and 
maintenance of its prosperity and stability very much relied on 
the efforts of the Chinese people, including those of 
compatriots in the territory. The Bank of China Hong Kong 
Branch had made strict arrangements for its capital, operation 
and management for dealing with any change which would take 
place in the territory. 
  Mr. Huang said that the branch was strengthening its work in 
three ways: first, it will strive to developing itself and make 
itself stronger; second, it will make all preparations such as 
comparatively relaxed conditions for funds arrangement and the 
strengthening of capital circulation; and third, it will unite 
friends, in a broader way, in industrial, commercial and 
financial circles, enhance its cooperation with them and make 
joint efforts with them for a smooth transition of the territory. 
  The branch will, according to the director, issue Hong Kong 
currency on schedule with all preparations needed for this 
matter being ready. The amount of Hong Kong currency to be 
issued from May 2 this year will be HK$3 billion [Hong Kong 
dollars] to HK$6 billion according to demand. 
  Mr. Huang said that since the beginning of the transition 
period, the Bank of China Group had seen rapid development in 
the territory and Hong Kong people's confidence in the group had 
been increasingly enhanced and industrial and commercial 
circles, especially big financial groups, in the territory were 
willing to become more involved with the bank. The bank now had 
over two million customers in Hong Kong. 
  According to Mr. Huang, the Bank of China Group of Hong Kong 
had also seen rapid development of business exchanges with the 
Mainland with over 2,400 items there being directly invested for 
financed by the group for a total of US$9 billion, involving 
items of energy, transport and construction of development 
zones. In addition, the group has also helped Mainland 
enterprises in listing in Hong Kong for the raising of capital.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 16 (XINHUA) -- It is only logical 
and legitimate for the Chinese side to reorganize the three-tier 
councils in Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law and 
decisions of China's top legislative organ after 1997. 
  This was stated by Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the 
Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, at a seminar on 
Tuesday [15 March], which was attended by advisors on local 
district affairs. 
  Owing to sabotage of the British side, it is impossible to 
implement the so-called "through train" arrangements, which 
allows legislators elected in 1995 to remain in office after 
July 1, 1997, when China resumes the exercise of sovereignty 
over Hong Kong, Zheng said. 
  As part of the framework with which Britain ruled Hong Kong, 
the last district boards, the two municipal councils and the 
Legislative Council under the British administration will surely 
terminate along with the colonialist reign, he stressed. 
  As the transfer of power is approaching, Zheng said, "we 
must 
rely on Hong Kong compatriots, including Hong Kong advisors, to 
make good preparations for works in all fields during the 
transitional period and make every possible effort to keep Hong 
Kong stable and prosperous." 
  During the seminar, many Hong Kong district affairs advisors 
threw their support to a motion, proposed by Cheng Yiu-tong, a 
Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), and 
agreed by other 30-odd delegates, on the reorganization of the 
three-tier councils. 
  District affairs advisor Fok Ting-hung deems it necessary 
for 
the NPC, which serves as the highest organ of the state power in 
China, to approve the motion.

  [Text] Soaring property prices in Hong Kong were 
detrimental to social stability and economic viability, senior 
Chinese official Lu Ping said yesterday. He said 
mainland-funded companies were partly to blame for speculation 
in the property market. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office's think-tank would soon look into the problem and study 
ways of maintaining the territory's economic dynamism, said Mr 
Lu. 
  Speaking to a group of Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at a 
closed-door session, Mr Lu said main land-funded firms would be 
stopped from participating in property speculation. He was 
quoted as saying "quite a number" of mainland-funded firms in 
the territory had been speculating and insisted that was not 
good for Hong Kong. Mr Lu said it was unfair to other investors 
because mainland-funded companies were using state funds to make 
profits. "They can push up the prices of property without 
having to bear any responsibility," he said. 
  In a separate meeting with a group of Hong Kong deputies to 
the National People's Congress, Mr Lu said the level of property 
prices had gone beyond what ordinary residents could bear. 
"Many people cannot afford to buy their own flats. This is a 
big problem. It hinges upon people's livelihood. It hinges on 
whether Hong Kong will be able to maintain its status as an 
international financial centre." 
  He said what had made Hong Kong tick over the past decades 
was its low production costs, luring foreign investors. It was 
reported yesterday the international firm, Unisys, is to shift 
its regional centre from Hong Kong to Singapore because of high 
costs in the territory. "This is a big problem," he said. 
  Mr Lu conceded there were various factors behind the surge 
in 
property prices. But he said the Government had the 
responsibility to solve the problem. "If the problem remains 
unresolved, it will affect the post-1997 government and create a 
major burden on it." 
  Mr Lu said the PWC's economic sub-group would soon form a 
team to study the property market. "We will give suggestions to 
the British side. It's a matter for them as to whether to 
accept it. We will also listen to people from all walks of life 
on effective ways to deal with the problem. We will do as much 
as we can." 
  A Hong Kong deputy to the CPPCC, Ho Sai-chu accused some 
property developers of hoarding land in order to seek more 
profits. Mr Ho, a construction company boss, said although 
36,000 flats had been completed last year, only about 28,000 had 
been put on the market.

  [Text] Pro-Taiwan politicians in Hong Hong are joining 
forces with the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) to form a 
new political party. The party calls itself the One Two Three 
Democratic Alliance and the founders say it will be dedicated to 
the unification of Chinese interests in the region. 
  A UDHK member, Sung King-fai, who is a preparatory committee 
member for the new party, explained its name. "One stands for 
one country, Two refers to both sides of the straits, and Three 
means tripartite communications (the mainland, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan)," Sung said. 
  The party will participate in the district board elections 
in 
autumn and municipal council and Legislative Council elections 
next year. It is scheduled to be launched on Sunday with about 
60 founding members. It is understood that more than 10 members 
of the United Democrats will join, since the UDHK allows 
crossparty membership. Most UDHK members are believed to have 
been educated in Taiwan. Several members of two other 
pro-democracy parties, Meeting Point and the Association for 
Democracy and People's Livelihood, are also expected to join the 
new party. 
  The preparatory committee chairman, Ren Shan-ning, was 
reported as saying the new party would be a strong advocate for 
democracy. It would be especially concerned about relations 
between Taiwan and the mainland and how to handle relations 
between Taiwan and Hong Kong after the 1997 handover. 
Pro-Taiwan political activities in Hong Kong are a sensitive 
issues in Beijing. 
  An official from the local office of the New China News 
Agency (Xinhua) warned that the organisation would be "illegal" 
if it was set up with the support and blessing of Taiwan's 
ruling party, the Kuomintang (KMT). He said the Hong Kong 
government had always pledged to prevent the KMT from engaging 
in any form of political activity in the territory. The 
managing director of Chung Hwa Travel Service, the KMT's 
representative office in Hong Kong, John Ni, denied there was 
any link between the KMT and the new party.

  [Text] Macao, March 18 (XINHUA) -- A ceremony marking the 
completion of the artificial island of the Macao International 
Airport was held here today. 
  Costing 5.238 billion Macao patacas (680 million U.S. 
dollars), the artificial island project was signed on January 
18, 1992 and its construction started on March 18 the same year. 
  The 1.5 square kilometer island was built by erecting closed 
dams in the sea and then filling them with sand and stones. 
  The runway of the Macao Airport will be built on the 
artificial island, which was designed to be 3,500 meters long 
and 60 meters wide, and to accommodate B747-400 passenger planes. 
  It was learned that the infrastructural construction in the 
runway area will be started in may this year and is expected to 
be completed in March next year. 
  The surface project of the runway is also expected to be 
finished ahead of schedule to ensure the test flight in next 
June. 
  The Macao International Airport is located at the sea area 
to 
the east of Macao's Taipa and Coloane Islands. With an 
investment of 7.3 billion Macao patacas (940 million U.S. 
dollars), the project was first started in December 1989. The 
airport covers 192 hectares in area.

<F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Qian Qichen says that although 
China's 1994 military budget looks bigger, the increase in the 
budget is only being made to offset inflation. 
  Qian Qichen made the statement at a press conference in 
Beijing on Wednesday [16 March]. Li Peichun has a highlight. 
  [Begin recording] China will spend about 52 billion yuan 
this year on defense, about 20 percent higher than last year. 
But Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this doesn't mean China 
is trying to make itself into a regional power. 
  The foreign minister said in 1993 the inflation rate was 13 
percent and is expected to be 10 percent this year. So actual 
military spending remains the same. The foreign minister said 
China's military budget accounts for 1.7 percent of the gross 
domestic product. He said China's military budget is tiny 
compared to other countries, such as the United States and 
Japan. Qian Qichen said this is proof that China is concerned 
about economic development and not about being a military power. 
  The Chinese foreign minister also said he was a bit 
disappointed with his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher in Beijing last weekend. He said: Although the 
talks produced some agreements on specific measures to eliminate 
problems caused by the human rights issue, China was ready for 
more substantive talks. 
  Qian Qichen said: Beijing invited Christopher in hopes the 
two sides could improve bilateral ties, but the foreign minister 
said there were events just before Christopher's arrival which 
showed that the United States was not being completely sincere. 
The foreign minister said both governments realized that the 
worsening of relations will have adverse effect on their 
economies. Dialogues will continue until June when the Clinton 
administration decides whether or not to renew China's MFN [most 
favored nation] status. Qian Qichen said any specific plan will 
be made in accordance with the wishes of both governments. He 
said neither country should interfere in the other's internal 
affairs. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "All Quarters Show Concern for U.S. Policy </F>
Toward China"] 
  [Text] At a time when Sino-U.S. relations are being 
followed with great interest by the international community, 
U.S. President Bill Clinton delivered a mild sounding speech the 
day before yesterday. He said: There are still weeks for the 
United States to make a decision on the question of the renewal 
of most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment for China. He promised 
he would do his utmost to remove differences between the two 
countries. He went on to say: "Our policy is that human rights 
are important, but so are the other issues." These remarks seem 
to show that there has been some change in the official U.S. 
approach toward China. Hence, it is being followed with great 
interest by all sides concerned. 
  As everybody knows, in recent years, the U.S. Government has 
endlessly brought pressure to bear on China and interfered in 
the latter's internal affairs by using the human rights issue as 
a pretext. While visiting China a few days ago, U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher was all the more fierce and 
overbearing in a vain attempt to compel China to yield on the 
human rights issue. Before that, the U.S. assistant secretary of 
state responsible for human rights made contact with a Chinese 
criminal released on parole without authorization. This was a 
violation of Chinese law. This at least shows that at that 
time, the United States lacked sincerity to improve its 
relations with China. The Chinese side has denounced the United 
States' stand on the human rights issue in stern terms and 
expounded China's attitude toward the issue. As a result, Sino- 
U.S. negotiations on the human rights issue have reached an 
impasse. China has rejected the U.S. threat to revoke MFN 
treatment. 
  Clearly, the human rights demands set by the United States 
on 
China do not correspond to the reality in China. It is even 
more absurd to lump together the so-called human rights issue 
and the MFN issue. Chinese leaders have clearly pointed out: 
Differences between China and the United States should be 
resolved by adhering to the spirit of respecting each other and 
seeking common ground while reserving differences and through 
consultations on an equal footing. At the same time, the 
Chinese also frankly told the Americans that if MFN was revoked, 
not just China would be hurt, and the United States would be 
hurt more than China. It would lose the huge Chinese market. 
  The U.S. policy of bringing pressure to bear on China has 
met 
intense criticism at home and abroad. At a symposium on 
relations between the United States and China in Washington on 
15 March, eminent American scholars, politicians, and 
entrepreneurs urged the Clinton administration one after another 
to continue granting MFN to China. Two former U.S. secretaries 
of states, Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance, opposed linking MFN 
and human rights. Most speakers at the symposium agreed: Once 
the United States revokes MFN, this will surely invite Chinese 
retaliation and lead to a sharp drop in the volume of Sino-U.S. 
trade. This will not only seriously hinder economic relations 
between the United States and China but will also harm political 
relations between the two countries. Using his corporation's 
own experience as an example, a representative of the U.S. 
Boeing Corporation pointed out: In the coming 15 years, China 
will need 800 civilian aircraft, and will thus become the 
world's third largest aviation market. At present, U.S. 
aircraft makers are in a favorable position. If the United 
States revokes China's MFN, European aircraft makers will 
certainly replace it. It is quite natural that they are 
dissatisfied with current U.S. policy toward China. In the 
international community, the U.S. policy of linking human rights 
and MFN has also met universal opposition. Moreover, even its 
allies have not followed suit. The fact that the Canadian prime 
minister announced yesterday that he would visit China soon is 
the latest proof. 
  It can thus be said that it is precisely because U.S. China 
policy has run into snags in China, in the United States, and 
everywhere in the world that President Clinton delivered his 
mild sounding speech on U.S. China policy the day before 
yesterday. While welcoming the speech, people will not be so 
naive as to believe that Sino-U.S. relations will embark on a 
smooth road hereafter. We maintain: First of all, we must 
earnestly observe how President Clinton revises his 
"presidential executive order" on the issue of renewing China's 
MFN and how he handles the issue practically. China sincerely 
hopes to establish a normal, friendly, and cooperative 
relationship with the United States. However, since it differs 
with the latter in ideology and values, China will not expect 
too much or cherish unrealistic illusions.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 KYODO -- Several Chinese victims 
of the war with Japan were detained Friday morning [18 March] as 
they approached the Japanese Embassy to deliver a letter seeking 
an apology from Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa. 
  The elderly Chinese, 60 to 70 years of age, were taken away 
in police vehicles from in front of the Japanese Embassy in 
Beijing's eastern diplomatic area, witnesses said. 
  It was not immediately known where the activists, some of 
them walking with the aid of canes, were taken. 
  Although the contents of the letter are not known, the war 
compensation activists were believed to be seeking an apology 
from the Japanese prime minister who begins a visit to Beijing 
on Saturday and to ask for war compensation for Japanese 
aggression. 
  News of the demonstration began circulating Thursday 
evening, 
leading to speculation that the event was well planned. 
  One middle-aged man, holding a letter with "Hosokawa" 
written 
on it in large letters, arrived at the embassy at 10 A.M. and 
was immediately taken away, witnesses said. Ten minutes later a 
group of elderly men and one woman arrived by minibus and were 
also questioned and taken away by police. 
  The detentions came a week after police rounded up several 
political and labor activists before and during the visit of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher last weekend. 
  A Japanese Embassy spokesman said he was unaware of the 
demonstration and knew nothing of the detentions. 
  The Chinese Government has been sensitive to demanding war 
compensation for civilian casualties from Japan as it is afraid 
it could damage the existing good governmental relations. 
  A group of delegates to the ongoing National People's 
Congress, China's parliament, is presently preparing a motion 
demanding war compensation from Japan, but it is not known 
whether the central authorities will approve such a document.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Beijing by the mainland news </F>
center: "What Did Jiang Zemin Say at the Shanghai Group 
Discussion?"] 
  [Text] Several days ago we heard National People's 
Congress [NPC] deputies talking about Jiang Zemin's and Li 
Peng's different styles at group discussions. Jiang Zemin likes 
to talk endlessly about everything, without keeping to the main 
topic, whereas Li Peng is serious and generally only gives 
simple answers to simple questions. Several days ago in the 
lounge during an interval, we listened to the Shanghai 
delegation's brief explanation of Jiang Zemin's remarks at a 
group discussion. We found out that, as far as "style" is 
concerned, he did not like to make presumptuous remarks. 
<H5>  Talking at Length for More Than Two Hours </H5>
  A provincial delegation asked the Shanghai delegation: "What 
did Jiang Zemin talk about at your group discussion?" The 
Shanghai delegation's answer was a little surprising: "Nothing, 
though he talked at length for more than two hours." The 
province's delegation asked again: "What did talk about?" Thus 
the Shanghai delegation provided a brief explanation. 
  "He talked about the Asia-Pacific Summit in Seattle for more 
than half an hour" "explaining the process but not policy." The 
length of time that Jiang Zemin spent on this issue fully 
suggests the CPC's concern for the Seattle summit. The CPC 
regards the Seattle summit as a major breakthrough in its 
diplomatic relations with the United States. The CPC 
particularly stressed that, during an "informal meeting" between 
Asia-Pacific heads of state, "Chinese and U.S. heads of state 
formally met" -- a turning point in Chinese-U.S. relations. 
During the Seattle summit, Clinton knocked on the gate to 
China's mainland markets, and the sound of the knock boosted the 
CPC leaders' courage. 
<H3>  Jiang Zemin Said That Dealing With U.S. Human Rights 
Diplomacy Was Child's Play [xiao er ke 1420 0334 4430] </H3>
  Therefore it was not strange that Jiang Zemin said dealing 
with U.S. human rights diplomacy was "child's play." Jiang 
Zemin said: Christopher came to China as our guest. We arranged 
for him to stay in the State Guesthouse, but he wanted to stay 
at the China Hotel and use his own car. He wanted to "play 
tricks." While in Seattle, I acted according to my host's 
preference. When Shattock came to China, he met Wei Jingsheng. 
What is Wei Jingsheng? He is a prisoner. According to Chinese 
law, he is on parole, but still serving his prison term. Was it 
not ridiculous that a U.S. official met a Chinese prisoner? So 
it is not difficult to understand why the CPC took so much 
effort to send dissidents away from Beijing to "control" them. 
Since we could not control Christopher, we controlled the 
dissidents. As a matter of fact, the mainland understood that, 
according to the CPC means of control, it was as easy as raising 
a hand to stop Wei Jingsheng from meeting Shattock, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for human rights affairs. The CPC 
did not do that, however, and let the matter proceed naturally. 
Subsequently, the CPC played the card of "Chinese law" at the 
negotiating table. Therefore, it is correct to say that dealing 
with U.S. human rights diplomacy is "child's play." 
<H3>  Jiang Zemin Extraordinarily Praised Yeltsin, and Had Full 
Confidence in Obtaining MFN Status </H3>
  Jiang Zemin said: Some people have suggested that we should 
not meet Christopher, but I said we had better meet him. The 
CPC's recent move on human rights is inseparable from the 
"hardliners' stand." It was not a coincidence that some people 
in the United States proposed that Christopher cancel his 
Beijing tour, because the mainland's human rights record was 
worsening. There were people on both sides who cherished 
wishful thinking. What was Jiang Zemin's inclination? This can 
be judged from his extraordinary praise of Yeltsin, saying that 
Yeltsin was very firm -- after Nixon met the opposition party 
leader in Russia, Yeltsin canceled their appointment. Maybe 
this was the first time a CPC leader spoke highly of Yeltsin on 
a semi-open occasion. Jiang Zemin seemed to have full 
confidence in obtaining most favored nation status. He said: 
Even Chris Patten has taken the same stand as we have, although 
he is making trouble for us on the Hong Kong issue. In 
addition, the CPC is taking a strong attitude toward the United 
States because, apart from U.S. businessmen being eager for 
entry into the mainland market as a result of its rapid economic 
development, there has been a delicate change in U.S.-Russian 
relations recently. Thus, the United States wants to make 
several choices ahead of time for its strategic interests. 

<H3>    He Did Not Care About the Prices of Western-Style But 
Was Very Clear About Egg Prices in Shanghai </H3>
  This Shanghai NPC deputy said with deep feeling: "I did not 
expect that Jiang Zemin would know very much about Shanghai." 
Jiang Zemin said: Eggs were two yuan and 80 fen per jin in 
Shanghai not long ago but now cost two yuan and 70 fen. Why? 
He added: I do not know the prices of Western-style suits, but 
I am concerned about the "vegetable baskets." It was said that 
[Shanghai Party Secretary] Wu Bangguo and [Shanghai mayor] Huang 
Ju immediately explained: Not long ago Zhu Rongji asked them 
about the prices of several kinds of vegetables in Shanghai. 
After they provided some "approximate" figures, Zhu Rongji 
asked: "Are these purchase prices or wholesales prices?" This 
question embarrassed them. They went to a vegetable market and 
found that the retail prices of vegetables were far higher than 
the figures they had provided. Prior to going to Beijing this 
time, Huang Ju purposely went to several vegetable markets to 
familiarize himself with the market situation for fear of being 
asked about vegetable prices. This Shanghai NPC deputy said 
that he himself did not know about egg prices in Shanghai, let 
alone the mayor. 
  It is said that Jiang Zemin has a high regard for singer 
Wang 
Luobin. One night, he was fatigued with work and read a book on 
Wang Luobin. Jiang Zemin said: Popular songs should not be 
prohibited, nor should pop stars from Hong Kong or Taiwan. 
Serious songs should also be supported, but Hong Kong and 
Taiwan pop stars should not be given too much publicity. "What 
`four superstars?'" [reference to Hong Kong's four most popular 
singers] At first, I thought they were the heavenly kings in the 
`Pilgrimage to the West'!" [name of a Chinese fairy tale] Jiang 
Zemin's remarks ended amid laughter. Immediately, press reports 
said the "atmosphere of the discussion was lively." 
  The NPC deputy from the province said: "Only this much? 
This is different from what was published in the newspapers!" 
  This Shanghai NPC deputy said: "Yes. This is what Jiang 
Zemin said. Jiang Zemin said he could talk freely at the 
Shanghai group discussion, without consulting documents, adding: 
`What you will see in the newspapers tomorrow will be different 
from what I am saying here.' On this point, Wu Bangguo and 
Huang Ju hurriedly explained: `There is a connection between 
them, there is a connection between them.'" 
  The province's NPC deputy said: "He had spoken for more than 
two hours, and what would be published the next day would be 
different. The reporters will find it difficult to cope with 
that." 
  The Shanghai NPC deputy replied: "Jiang Zemin had his speech 
notes in hand. I did not see any reporters at all." 
  It has been reported that more than 1,400 reporters are 
covering the NPC session and the session of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference. What were they busy doing?

<F P=106> [News conference by Zhou Zhengqing, Dai Xianglong, and Chen </F>
Yuan with foreign and domestic correspondents at the Information 
Center of the Second Sessions of the Eighth NPC and CPPCC Eighth 
National Committee in Beijing on 17 March -- recorded; from the 
"Special News Program on the Second Session of the Eighth NPC"] 
  [Text] [Moderator, who is not clearly shown and whose 
nameplate cannot be seen] Good Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, 
today the Information Center of the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC] and the Eighth National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] is holding its eighth news conference. We 
have invited the responsible persons of the People's Bank of 
China to answer your questions on reform and development in 
China's banking system. Attending today's news conference are 
Zhou Zhengqing, Dai Xianglong, and Chen Yuan, vice governors of 
the People's Bank of China. 
  [Zhou] Today, I and my colleagues are ready to exchange 
views with you on issues of interest to you and to answer your 
questions. 
  [Unidenified correspondent] I am a reporter from JINGJI 
RIBAO. Governor Zhou [as heard], what do you think of the 
results of rectifying the financial order and of actual 
difficulties currently faced by enterprises? 
  [Zhou] As you know, China's economy began to enter a new 
stage of rapid development in 1992. China's economy grew by 
about 13 percent for two consecutive years, and new progress has 
been made by all sectors of the national economy. Of course, 
some new situations and new problems have cropped up in the 
course of rapid growth. The main problems are as follows: 
investment in fixed assets increased excessively. Moreover, 
the investment structure in this area was irrational. In 
monetary matters, an excessive amount of currency was put into 
circulation. Moreover, irregularities such as indiscriminate 
fund-raising activities and inter-bank lending emerged. As a 
result, the financial order was plagued by chaos. To deal with 
these situations and new problems which emerged in the course of 
economic operations, the party Central Committee and the State 
Council promptly adopted a measure to strengthen macroeconomic 
regulation and control by stressing the method of deepening 
reform and of using economic and legal means to rectify the 
financial order. The chaotic situation in the financial order 
was quickly reversed. The main indications in the reversal of 
the situation are: 1. Excessive issuance of currency was 
effectively checked. The amount of residents' savings deposits 
rebounded quickly and increased considerably. Last year urban 
and rual savings deposits rose by 320 billion yuan; 2. We have 
done well in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control. 
We regulated the structure and use of loans to ensure that 
there was capital for key projects of the national economy. As 
you know, last year there was an ample supply of funds for the 
purchasing of farm and sideline products, and the practice of 
writing IOU's disappeared. Ninety-nine percent of the state key 
projects were ensured of funds. The situation in which large 
and medium enterprises, including those involved in foreign 
trade, were short of working funds was alleviated; 3. The 
exchange rate remained stable. The rate between the U.S. dollar 
and renminbi remained at 8.7 renminbi to the dollar. 4. 
Irregularities such as indiscriminate fund-raising activities 
and inter-bank lending were effectively checked. At the same 
time, various measures for banking reform have been introduced 
gradually, and have been implemented very well. 
  [Unidentified correspondent from DPA in English, fading 
into Mandarin translation] I am a correspondent from Germany. 
Since China unified the exchange rates, some units have raised 
their charges by 50 percent. For example, some telephone 
companies have done so, and the service bureaus for diplomats 
usually charge in U.S. dollars instead of renminbi. I wonder 
whether the officials also justify this. There are now two sets 
of prices in China: one for the Chinese and the other for 
foreigners. This is obviously against the circular issued by 
the central bank. My question is: Whether the People's Bank of 
China has taken some measures to check the practice of two 
prices? 
  [Chen] We maintain that the unification of exchange rates 
has not caused price fluctuations in general, but the problem of 
price hikes did emerge following the unification of exchange 
rates. Government departments concerned are investigating this 
problem to ascertain the situation and will launch necessary 
checks and rectification. Although this problem relates to the 
reform of exchange rates, it is not completely the Central 
Bank's responsibility. We have also received some complaints 
about this problem from foreign banks and organs and have 
addressed their opinions to department concerned. I hope this 
problem will be settled properly while reform proceeds further. 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] I am a correspondent from 
JINRONG SHIBAO [FINANCIAL TIMES]. A package of measures for 
economic reform were presented successively from the end of last 
year to the beginning of this year, and banking reform is the 
most important among them. Vice Governor Zhou, could you 
elaborate on the focal points of this year's banking reform and 
tell us what kinds of difficulties may be encountered in the 
course of implementing the reform? Thank you. 
  [Zhou] The goals for this year's banking reform can be 
generally summed up as establishing three systems and 
accomplishing two tasks in real earnest. The establishment of 
three systems means: 1. Establish a powerful and effective 
macroeconomic regulation and control system governed by the 
central bank; 2. Establish an organizational system with 
state-owned commercial banks as the mainstay, whereas various 
kinds of banking institutions are also included; 3. Establish a 
banking market system that is unified and open, allows orderly 
competition, and is strictly administered. Accomplishing two 
tasks in real earnest means constructing the People's Bank of 
China into a genuine central bank and constructing the existing 
state-owned specialized banks into genuine commercial banks. 
This is certainly the goal of our reform. To attain this goal, 
we should advance step by step and pay attention to three issues 
in the course of proceeding reform: 1. In the course of 
shifting from the old mechanism to the new one, it is necessary 
to control aggregate credit and forestall the cropping up of 
serious inflation. Aggregate credit must be controlled. 3. [as 
heard] Banking reform must closely keep pace with the drafting 
of banking laws and regulations and be carried out in an orderly 
manner. I would like to disclose some information to you: We 
are now working hard to draft and, by going through legal 
procedures, strive for the passage of the central bank law, 
commercial bank law, securities law, law on negotiable 
instruments, insurance law, and a series of banking laws and 
regulations in the second half of this year. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Vice Governor Zhou, I am a Hong 
Kong correspondent. A great quantity of Hong Kong currency is 
circulated in the Zhujiang Delta, particularly in Shenzhen and 
Zhuhai. It has been learned that the People's Bank is going to 
end situation -- to make the Hong Kong currency flow back to 
Hong Kong. Does the People's Bank have any measures in this 
regard now? 
  [Zhou] China has been asserting and reiterating its demand 
in 
the reform of the foreign exchange system that foreign 
currencies may not be used in quoting prices, settling accounts, 
and may not be circulated in Chinese territory. In handling 
some specific problems in localities which have frequent 
contacts with Hong Kong and Macao areas, such as the Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zone, we will take Hong Kong's and Macao's 
economic development into consideration and take some specific 
measures to resolve the problems. Hong Kong's financial 
management authorities have addressed the situation to the 
People's Bank of China. We have been informed. 
  [Unidentified CCTV Correspondent] I am a reporter from the 
Central Television Station. A few minutes ago, Vice Governor 
Zhou said one of the important aspects of the reform of the 
banking system in China is turning existing specialized banks 
into state-owned commercial banks. May I ask how do you 
transform specialized banks into commercial ones? Can you tell 
us some specific methods? 
  [Zhou] In establishing state-owned commercial banks, first 
it is necessary to separate the policy-lending functions 
belonging to state-owned specialized banks. We plan to 
establish three policy-lending banks to undertake the task of 
granting loans allowed by policies. Once the policy-lending 
functions are separated from specialized banks, they should 
operate step by step in line with the principles commonly 
practiced by commercial banks around the world and organize 
their loans and assets in acccordance with the principles of 
fluidity, effectiveness, and safety. Beginning this year, the 
Central Bank has distributed relevant regulations and procedures 
regarding management of the proportions of assets and 
liabilities and management of risks in commercial banks. Now, 
the commercial banks should act upon these requirements. First 
of all, they should start by transforming their operating 
mechanisms and gradually standardize their activities and 
improve their management in accordance with the requirement on 
the management of the proprotions of assets and liabilities and 
the requirement of the risk responsibility system. However, to 
achieve the goal of becoming commercial banks, we should proceed 
step by step. Success cannot come overnight. 
  [JOURNAL OF COMMERCE correspondent in English, fading into 
Mandarin translation] I am a reporter from the JOURNAL OF 
COMMERCE. Last year, you said China carried out macroeconomic 
regulation and control. Is it necessary to further inject money 
into these state-owned enterprises? And if money is injected, 
will this lead to the aggravation of inflation? 
  [Dai] The Central Bank has been pursuing a steady and stable 
monetary policy for years. It has neither adopted a strict 
policy to limit the growth of the money supply nor has it 
adopted an easy money policy to ensure steady economic growth. 
In July and August last year, we adopted a correct policy to 
appropriately increase loans to large and medium-sized 
enterprises to undertake the construction of key state projects. 
As a result, the economy grew steadily. In January this year, 
we succeeded very well in recovering Central Bank loans. As of 
now, nearly 90 percent of the currency issued by the Central 
Bank from 1 January to the Spring Festival has been recovered. 
We expect all can be recovered by the end of March. 
  [XINHUA correspondent] I am a reporter from XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY. Governor Zhou, what specific measures has the People's 
Bank taken to control inflation this year? 
  [Zhou] An important function of the Central Bank is to 
stabilize the value of the renminbi. Therefore, we are paying 
special attention to the current inflationary pressure. To 
preserve the value of the renminbi, I think, it is -- speaking 
of the overall economic situation as a whole -- necessary to 
strictly control the scale of investment in fixed assets. At 
the same time, it is imperative to adhere to the principle of 
taking agriculture as the foundation of the economy and to 
ensure a steady growth in the output of grain, cotton, oil- and 
sugar-bearing crops, meat, and vegetables so as to develop all 
sectors of the rural economy. At the same time, it is also 
necessary to achieve a basic balance between total supply and 
total demand. To ensure that the value of the renminbi remains 
stable, we will adopt four measures: First, we will strictly 
control total credit in society, especially controlling the 
increase in the total amount of loans for use in fixed asset 
investment; no one is allowed to exceed the ceiling prescribed 
by regulations. Second, it is necessary to control the increase 
of the money supply and to make vigorous efforts to recover 
currency from circulation. Third, beginning this year, the 
Central Bank will no longer grant loans to enterprises or 
institutions with financial deficits. Fourth, it is necessary 
to strengthen monetary supervision and management to prevent the 
recurrence of the financial chaos in the first half of last year 
in which indiscriminate fund-raising activities and inter-bank 
lending were rampant. I am convinced so long as the Central 
Bank seriously carries out these four measures, the value of the 
renminbi will remain stable. 
  [Moderator] The news conference concludes here. Thanks to 
all.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (AFP)--China's budget deficit, 
forecast to double in real terms this year to nearly 70 billion 
yuan (eight billion dollars), will continue to grow in coming 
years, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  "My personal view is that in the coming two or three years 
there will be an increase in the deficit," Liu told journalists, 
but expressed confidence the Chinese authorities would be able 
to sell some 100 billion yuan in treasury bonds this year to 
cover the shortfall. Nevertheless, he acknowledged the growing 
deficit was a "headache" for the government. 
  In his budget speech to the National People's Congress on 
Friday, Liu said the deficit would hit 66.9 billion yuan in 
1994, with revenues and expenditures rising 7.7 percent and 15 
percent to 475.9 billion yuan and 542.9 billion yuan 
respectively. The deficit is up from 20.5 billion yuan last 
year, but Liu stressed the leap was partly due to a shift to 
international accounting methods under which income from debt is 
not included in total revenue and debt servicing is removed from 
total expenditure. Based on the new methods, last year's debt 
would have totalled about 30 billion yuan, he said. 
  Liu said he believed this year's treasury bonds would sell 
well, despite the lack of public enthusiasm for an issue of 30 
billion yuan in 1993. 
  Blaming last year's problems on "financial disorder" in 
China, he said the situation now was "quite different," while 
the terms of the bonds were more attractive and the distribution 
system more sophisticated. "So although the figure of the 
treasury bonds issued this year is a little bit larger, it is 
entirely possible that distribution will be smooth," he said, 
denying that individuals had been forced to buy them in 1993. 
  Liu was unable to indicate why urban residents facing 
year-on- year cost of living rises of more than 20 percent 
should show interest in bonds fixed this year about one percent 
higher than the national rate of 13 percent.

<F P=106> [By Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Exert Strenuous Efforts </F>
to Firmly Grasp the Party's Ideological and Theoretical 
Construction and the Building of Leading Bodies To Guarantee a 
Long Period of Peace and Security in China"] 
  [Excerpts] The municipal organizational work conference 
was held yesterday. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal 
party committee, stressed in his speech: We must uphold the 
party's leadership and strengthen party building in the course 
of accelerating reform and development. In this year's 
organizational work, the task of prime importance is to 
continuously exert strenuous efforts to firmly grasp the party's 
ideological and theoretical construction and the building of 
leading bodies and to guarantee the implementation of the 
central authorities' major reform policy decisions and the 
capital's stability and unity. 
  First of all, Chen Xitong fully affirmed the prominent 
achievements in Tianjin's organizational work, and at the same 
time, he pointed out: This is a crucial year for 
comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Making all-out 
efforts to safeguard the capital's political and social 
stability and guaranteeing the smooth implementation of the 
central authorities' major reform policy decisions is a major 
matter of prime importance in the work of Beijing Municipality 
and in organizational work. The organizational work should 
serve this overall situation, and strenuous efforts should be 
made to grasp two basic construction. First, we should pay 
attention to ideological and theoretical construction, 
strengthen study of Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, strive to raise the ideological and theoretical 
level of party-member cadres, formulate plans, and provide 
evaluations. Second, we should pay attention to the building of 
leading bodies, and after selecting a number of outstanding 
young cadres as the new leading bodies during the district and 
county end-of-term elections, be determined to select a number 
of outstanding young cadres for the leading bodies of the 
municipal party committee and of various departments, 
committees, offices, and bureaus of the municipal government, 
and install the echelon well. Meanwhile, it is necessary to 
strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations, with 
an emphasis in consolidating the backward party branches and 
strengthening the building of party branches in three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises, people-run enterprises, high-tech 
enterprises, and various new economic organizations. Chen 
Xitong stressed: Strengthening party building is a fundamental 
task in consolidating the party's leadership and guaranteeing a 
long period of peace and stability in the country and we must 
grasp it firmly and successfully. 
  Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee, delivered a report at the conference. He summarized 
last year's work and put forth this year's tasks. 
  In 1993, in carrying out the municipal organizational work, 
we persisted in emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, 
conscientiously implementing all tasks set forth by the 14th 
party congress and the seventh municipal party congress, 
realized the municipal party committee's demand of 
comprehensively overpassing the work of last year, and achieved 
a series of breakthroughs. 
  Leading cadres enhanced awareness in the study of the theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved 
noticeable results in this aspect; the selection of young cadres 
was strengthened and the structure of leading bodies greatly 
improved; the contingent of reserve cadres was expanded and 
their management strengthened; and the exchange of cadres 
increased, the channels rose in number, and the scope expanded. 
We summarized a number of typical examples in building the 
grass-roots party organizations and consolidated a batch of 
backward party branches; selected "10 outstanding" communist 
party members and cultivated an image of communist party members 
of the new period; and began to conduct organizational reform in 
party and government organs, and achieved progress in 
experimenting with the public service system. 
  The ideas for the municipal organizational work in 1994 are 
to take Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the 
guidance, further emancipate the mind, act in connection with 
the party's central task, strengthen and improve party building, 
strive to make new breakthroughs in strengthening the building 
of leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations and 
expanding strength in reform of the cadre personnel system, and 
provide an organizational guarantee for acccelerating the 
development of the socialist market economy, fulfilling all 
reform and construction tasks of this year, and realizing the 
objective of becoming well-off three years ahead of schedule.

  Wang Tong, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi, and Qiang Wei, member 
of the standing committee of the municipal party committee, and

Commission, attended the conference.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] Two North Korean defectors--one a scientist--have 
sought asylum in Hong Kong, prompting fears they may be the 
first of a wave of refugees fleeing political persecution and 
economic hardship in their country. Hong Kong immigration 
authorities are believed to be assisting them apply for asylum 
in South Korea. 
  But South Korea is already entangled in a diplomatic row 
with 
its northern rival over an increasing flow of defectors heading 
south-- the incidence of which the Pyongyang government 
maintains is being fabricated by South Korea. The Hong Kong 
government has kept a firm lid on details about the two illegal 
immigrants since they were picked up separately by border 
patrols at Sha Tau Kok within two days of each other a week ago. 
  The first was detained last Friday, and the other on Sunday. 
They crossed the border on foot during daylight--one picked up 
at the fence, the other further across the border. Initially 
regarded as illegal immigrants from China, the two revealed 
their identities during questioning. They were then handed to 
immigration authorities, and are being held at an undisclosed 
location. 
  A Security Branch spokesman issued only a brief statement in 
response to questions about the detainees. "We can confirm that 
two illegal immigrants who claim to be from North Korea arrived 
in Hong Kong separately on the 11th and 13th of March," he said. 
"The matter is now being investigated." 
  Security sources have voiced concern that Hong Kong may face 
a wave of refugees from North Korea as Pyongyang wrestles with 
economic hardship and food shortages. The Hong Kong Government 
remains anxious not to disclose details of the detainees in case 
Hong Kong is forced to become a conduit for North Korean 
defectors heading for South Korea. The number of North Korean 
defectors had increased in recent years since Pyongyang's 
European communist allies began disintegrating in 1989. Since 
then, 60 North Koreans have been allowed to enter South Korea, 
mostly through third countries. 
  But South Korea's acceptance of the defectors is 
exacerbating 
tensions between the two Koreas. In fact, South Korea has 
already become a sanctuary for a stream of North Koreans 
defecting from Russia and China. Hundreds of North Koreans are 
reported to be wandering through Russia and China after escaping 
from logging camps in Siberia. South Korea's ambassador to 
Beijing, Hwang Pyong-tae claimed that in China, five or six 
people a week tried to defect to South Korea. 
  Late last year, a young man claiming to be a North Korean 
soldier attempting to obtain asylum in South Korea, was detained 
in Hong Kong after crossing the border from China. He was sent 
back to China when the South Korean Consulate could not verify 
his account.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS) -- Director of the Jiangxi 
Provincial Grain Administration, Mr. Liu Yuzhong, who is now 
attending the National People's Congress's meeting here, said in 
an interview with this agency that the "grain chaos" at the end 
of last year not only revealed intensive contradictions in the 
grain- circulation system but also raised a new issue on how to 
handle well the management of the special commodity of grain, 
important for people's livelihood, under conditions of the 
market economy. 
  According to Mr. Liu, Jiangxi is a big province for grain 
production in the country with some 2 billion kilograms of grain 
being exported to other provinces, autonomous regions and cities 
every year. Mr. Liu said that the wave of a rise in grain 
prices started in mid-November last year and swept across the 
country from south to north with the grain price growth reaching 
50 percent in a matter of a mere two or three days in some 
places, creating much trouble in the country. The grain 
official attributed the chaos to three reasons: First, 
misguidance by the media, leading to panic purchasing of grain. 
Second, imperfections in the macro-control mechanism and the 
non-standardized grain market. Third, the drop in grain 
resources last year, the most basic of the three reasons. 
  Mr. Liu proposed a proper raising of the price of grain and 
an effective curbing of the rise of production means in order to 
protect farmers' enthusiasm for grain production. Failing this, 
even if the price of grain rises continuously, farmers will 
still not benefit from it. He said that the state should in the 
future strengthen its macro-control and regulation in two ways: 
first, funds for risks in grain production should be established 
so that when there is a risk in this sector, the government can 
allocate capital from the funds to protect farmers' interests 
and second, a special grain reserve system should be set up with 
the aim of controlling grain prices while at the same time, the 
grain markets must be standardized, grain prices streamlined, 
control over grain wholesale tightened and grain retailing 
vitalized.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The property 
development sector is in good health in Shanghai's Pudong New 
Area and will make further progress under the continuing 
favorable policies, according to a recent official survey. 
  Zhu Chunhong, one of the survey's sponsors from the 
management committee in the area, said that most of the real 
estate companies are well organised, since qualified 
professionals make up over 70 percent of the staff in 199 
companies out of 205 sampled. Some 80 percent of the firms have 
sound accounts and good management, he said. 
  Housing construction has also kept up a reasonable growth 
rate, he said. 
  In the period from May, 1992, to June, 1993, some 300 such 
projects were approved in Pudong, to cost 16 billion yuan and 
covering an area of 2,000 hectares. 
  So far, 180 projects have started construction, with 
ordinary 
commercial houses making up for 47 percent of the planned floor 
space, and luxury ones, 18 percent. 
  Zhu said that 38 ha. of land belonging to 15 companies has 
been reclaimed by the government, because the projects have 
failed to go into operation within two years.

  [Text] The golden season of afforestation arrives following 
the steps of spring and [words indistinct] of the nature. At 
the opportune moment when the land turns green, with party, 
government, and Army leaders, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee; and Song Qingwei, political 
commissar of the Jinan Military Region, zestfully went to 
Jinan's Qianfuoshan to take part in the tree planting activities 
on the morning of 16 March. 
  Both the eastern and western sides of Qianfuoshan were 
seething with excitement early in the morning on 16 March. 
Thousands of office cadres and commanders and fighters of the 
People's Liberation Army units and the armed police headquarters 
were [words indistinct] here. After planting trees, Jiang 
Chunyun held talks with them on the issue of how to realize the 
province's greenery target. 
  Jiang Chunyun fully affirmed the province's gratifying 
achievements in afforestation made in the past few years. 
Simultaneously, he also pointed out where the province lags 
behind in forestry work, as well as the weak links in forestry 
work. 
  He said: The State Council asked the province to eliminate 
barren hills within this year. This is an extremely glorious, 
urgent, and arduous task. Therefore, the whole party and all 
people of the province should be mobilized, immediately go into 
action, grasp the current opportune moment of spring 
afforestation to start an upsurge of planting trees and 
developing afforestation in the province, to elevate the 
province's forestry to a new height, and to lay a good 
foundation for making Shandong green in the next 10 years. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: The forestry department should regard 
the elimination of barren hills as the primary task and firmly 
attend to it. We should strengthen the sense of mission, the 
sense of responsibility, and the sense of urgency; have the 
greatest determination and daring; adopt powerful measures; and 
mobilize the forces of the whole society to take part in the 
people's war of planting trees and developing afforestation. 
Leaders of the units that fail to fulfill their afforestation 
tasks should be called into account. We should strengthen 
management according to laws, consolidate and develop the 
achievements in afforestation, and ensure that the trees that 
have been planted should survive and be growing into useful 
timber. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should increase the input to 
afforestation and greenery. Particularly this year, we must 
have sufficient human, material, and financial resources to 
guarantee the realization of the target for eliminating barren 
hills and to leap over the historical stage of afforestation and 
greenery. Simultaneously, we should set up, in a step-by-step 
manner, the forestry managerial system suitable to the socialist 
market economy; and rely on reform and policies to mobilize the 
enthusiasm of the state, the localities, the collectives, and 
the individuals. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: The party and government leaders at 
various levels should put the afforestation and greenery work in 
their work agenda, pay high attention to it, carefully and 
realistically organize forces to grasp it, clearly distinguish 
award from penalty, and make new greater contributions to 
comprehensively fulfilling the 1994 target of eliminating barren 
hills and beaches and elevating the forestry to a new height.

  [Text] Qingdao, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The transportation 
sector, which was once controlled completely by the government, 
is now opening to domestic and overseas investors in east 
China's Shandong Province. 
  Some 49 percent of the share ownership of the 
3.1-billion-yuan Jinan-Qingdao Expressway -- one of the 
top-class expressways in China -- will be sold to investors from 
both at home and abroad, sources at the ongoing `94 Qingdao 
Trade Fair said today. 
  Meanwhile, a host of transportation development projects, 
including construction of an expressway, four highways and a 
river navigation lane, as well as a harbor, costing some 15 
billion yuan, are also on offer for investment at the fair. 
  Officials of the provincial communications department noted 
that the winning bidders will enjoy a series of preferential 
policies granted by the government. For instance, they will be 
given priority in developing real estate and other related 
sectors. 
  Zhu Zhenchang, head of the department, told a press 
conference that besides that batch of projects, a succession of 
other transportation projects will be opened to outside 
investors in the future.

<F P=106> [By China Editor Cary Huang in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China's financial trouble-shooter Zhu Rongji will 
stay on at least a year after the legal framework of a 
market-oriented banking system is established, according to 
Chinese sources. Mr Zhu, executive vice premier and head of the 
central bank, has recently accepted a suggestion from his 
advisers not to leave the hot seat until most of the basic laws 
and regulations defining a legal structure for the country's 
banking and financial system have been passed. 
  Chinese economic sources said yesterday Mr Zhu wanted a more 
independent Central Bank immune from government intervention. 
But he acknowledged that his dual role as vice-premier and 
central bank governor contradicted the principle. But he 
believed no one can yet take over his role and steer his radical 
reforms to restructure China's centralised banking system into a 
market-driven one under the current political situation. 
  A senior aid to Mr Zhu defended the leader's dual role by 
pointing out that, under Mr Zhu's leadership, the central bank 
had been released from its former role as financier of the 
government deficit. "It is during his governorship that the 
central authorities made the decision that the central bank 
would be no longer responsible for covering deficit or 
overdrawal of state coffers," deputy governor of the People's 
Bank of China Zhou Zhengging told reporters at a news conference 
at the on-going National People's Congress. 
  Mr Zhou also defended the vice-premier's austerity program. 
He said the reforms "effectively boosted a rapid and healthy 
development of the national economy and controlled the total 
quantity of the monetary supply."

  [Text] Reports have been circulating in Beijing that 
detained Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang may be freed sometime 
soon, perhaps within days. China adviser [on Hong Kong affairs] 
Zhu Zhimin told journalists that Xi was tried and convicted in 
mid-February. He is expected to be given a suspended sentence. 
That would mean that the MING PAO journalist would be freed 
immediately and allowed to return to Hong Kong with his employer 
acting as guarantor. 
  Xi Yang was arrested in Beijing last September and charged 
with stealing state secrets.

  [Text] Prominent dissident and labour activist Liu 
Nianchun was detained yesterday sparking fears the spate of 
arrests that started early this month would at least continue 
until the fifth anniversary of the June 4, 1989 crackdown. 
  A source close to the family of Liu, an unemployed worker 
and 
labour rights advocate in his 30s, said yesterday he was picked 
up for interrogation near his home in western Beijing. "Two 
plain-clothes police and four uniformed police from the local 
police station took him away at about 5 pm today," the source 
said, adding that the police had invoked the "summons and 
investigation" rule to detain him. 
  Liu became the 18th dissident picked up for investigation in 
the last two weeks. Police released most activists after short 
periods in detention centres, but are still holding three of 
Liu's fellow labour rights activists for "anti-government 
activities". Two weeks ago, Liu proposed the creation of a new 
organisation deemed frightening to the Communist Party--a 
quasi-union to protect labour's right to strike and has taken 
his petition to the ongoing session of the NPC. 
  In addition, it was learnt yesterday a leading member of 
China's underground Catholic Church had been secretly detained 
by police less than a year after being released from three years 
in a labour- education camp. Wei Jingyi, who was appointed 
secretary general of the Mainland Council of Bishops after his 
release from jail in March last year was taken into custody on 
January 20 by local public security bureau officers in Xushui 
county, Hebei province. Wei, in his mid-30s, was one of dozens 
of bishops and priests rounded up after the clandestine bishops 
conference in Xian, in November 1989, all of whom [sentence as 
published].

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429) written in Beijing on 13 March 1994: "Inside 
Information on Why China Is Taking a Tough Stand Against the 
United States on the Human Rights Issue"] 
  [Text] In mid-March, Chinese and U.S. leaders carried out 
a face-to-face struggle in Beijing on the human rights issue and 
the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue. In response to U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher's demand that China must make 
marked improvement in the field of human rights in order to meet 
the requirements set forth by President Clinton for extending 
China's MFN status, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen, Premier Li Peng, and President Jiang Zemin all 
explicitly indicated that China resolutely opposes the linkage 
of the human rights issue with MFN. "China and the United 
States can discuss their differences on the human rights issue 
on the basis of equality in order to increase mutual 
understanding, and no one should exert pressure on the other. 
China will never accept the U.S. viewpoint on human rights. If 
the United States rescinds China's MFN status, China will not be 
the only victim, and the losses incurred by the United States 
will not be less serious than those by China. China mainly 
relies on its domestic market, and has a strong ability of 
self-reliance. The United States will lose a huge market. It 
is hoped that the United States will properly handle this 
matter." At the same time, China also detained dissidents such 
as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan for a short time before 
Christopher's arrival, and "invited" them out of Beijing in 
order to prevent the reoccurrence of private meetings between 
U.S. officials and Chinese dissidents. 
  This time, China's tough attitude on the human rights issue 
has deeply perplexed some people overseas. If the United States 
also responds in a tough manner and flatly denies China's MFN 
trading status, would both sides suffer losses? This would 
certainly cause losses to Hong Kong. Did China actually 
consider these consequences? 
  According to sources in Beijing, the Chinese leaders were 
not 
prompted by a sudden impulse to adopt a tough attitude and 
decide not to stoop to compromise; instead, their response to 
the U.S. demand was based on careful consideration, and their 
decision was made after they weighed all the advantages and 
disadvantages. The critical factor was a secret meeting between 
a senior American official and Wei Jingsheng. 
  In February, the United States sent Assistant Secretary of 
State Shattuck to visit Beijing in order to make arrangements 
for Christopher's visit. This was an official visit, and 
Shattuck should have respected diplomatic protocol and arranged 
his schedule and itinerary in coordination with his host. 
However, Shattuck privately met with Wei Jingsheng and other 
dissidents without notifying the Chinese Government and 
consulted the dissidents about whether China's MFN status should 
be maintained. Some of the dissidents demanded that the United 
States rescind China's MFN status, while others asked to meet 
with Christopher. China lodged a protest about this event with 
the United States, but the U.S. side insisted that its diplomats 
had the right to meet foreign citizens as they liked. In these 
circumstances, the Chinese public security authorities summoned 
Wei Jingsheng and other dissidents in early March, and the 
purpose was to give a message to the U.S. authorities and 
Christopher, who would visit China in mid-March, that China was 
not weak or easy to bully and they must not think that China 
would kowtow to the United States on the human rights issue in 
order to keep its MFN status. 
  In view of the action taken by the Chinese public security 
authorities, it was likely that the United States would once 
again threaten to rescind China's MFN status, but China was 
determined to stand firm and not yield. Through its propaganda 
organs (primarily the left-wing newspapers in Hong Kong), China 
explicitly indicated: "A country must safeguard its sovereignty 
and security and guarantee that there is no interference in its 
internal affairs. Foreign countries must not be allowed to 
support the trouble-making activities of domestic political 
dissidents. Moreover, Wei Jingsheng remains a convict on 
parole, who must abide by the parole rules. If he violates 
these rules, the Chinese public security authorities certainly 
have the right to summon him and give warnings to him in 
accordance with the law. The United States tried to interfere 
in China's law-enforcement procedures and parole rules, and such 
behavior violated international law." 
  Furthermore, when meeting with Christopher, Qian Qichen 
blamed Shattuck for "disregarding China's laws and taking 
actions of interfering in China's internal affairs" without 
naming him. Qian said that this "deeply disappointed China." 
Jiang Zemin also criticized the U.S. official without naming 
him when talking with Christopher by saying that, in the United 
States, "some people did not really care about the rights, 
interests, and well-being of the vast number of Chinese people; 
instead, they were only concerned about a very small number of 
people who attempt to subvert the Chinese Government and 
undermine China's stability. This is in fact a political and 
legal issue rather than a human rights issue." The remarks 
uttered by Qian and Jiang made people realize more clearly the 
essence of the United States' "human rights" diplomacy. 
  According to the sources, although China gave the United 
States a message that it would not yield on the human rights 
issue in order to keep its MFN trading status, this did not mean 
that China does not care about the continuation of MFN status. 
Instead, according to their assessment of the current domestic 
and international situation, the Chinese authorities thought 
that the United States would not recklessly rescind China's MFN 
status. 
  According to WAISHI DONGTAI [TRENDS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS], an 
internal newsletter distributed to those cadres engaged in 
foreign affairs, shortly before Christopher's visit to China, a 
Chinese diplomat gave a speech at a seminar in the CPC Central 
Party School and reviewed the Sino-U.S. struggle over the MFN 
issue in the past. He said: "Not only in China, but also in the 
international community, a great deal of research has been done 
on this issue, and all of the researchers reached a common 
conclusion: MFN status must still be given to China, because 
the national strength of the United States has substantially 
declined, and it needs economic cooperation with other 
countries. On many international issues, the United States can 
no longer impose its own ideas on its Western allies. For 
example, in Bosnia and Somalia, the United States ran into snags 
again and again; even when dealing with affairs in Haiti and the 
Philippines, the Unites States can no longer continue its club- 
wielding policy." The diplomat said: First, the recent spy 
scandal caused a rift in U.S.-Russian relations, and Russia 
stopped following every instruction dictated by the United 
States due to domestic pressures; second, there have recently 
been trade frictions between the United States and Japan, and 
Japan has seen rising domestic demand for trade equality, even 
though the United States is using "Super 301" as a heavy weapon 
to force Japan to open its market; third, Clinton himself has 
been seriously plagued by the "Whitewatergate affair," and 
people are watching to see whether he will be forced to step 
down like Nixon in the "Watergate incident." Therefore, some 
people are saying that Clinton is being besieged on three sides. 
If he decides to discontinue China's MFN status, he will 
certainly be facing opposition from U.S. business circles and 
will then be "besieged on four sides." 
  On the other hand, through reform and opening over 15 years, 
China's economy is continuously, rapidly, and stably developing. 
It primarily relies on its domestic market and has a strong 
ability of self-reliance. It will be able to withstand the 
impact of the discontinuation of its MFN trading status in the 
United States. Moreover, China may join GATT within the year, 
and, if this comes to pass, MFN will no longer be an issue. 
Even if the United States does not extend China's MFN status, 
China will not have to endure the unfavorable effects for a very 
long time. 
  The comprehensive analysis shows that both the domestic and 
international situations are favorable to China, and China does 
not have to soften its principle and position on the human 
rights issue for the sake of maintaining MFN trading status. Of 
course, a compromise may still be made on some minor issues so 
that the other side may find it easier to save face, and this 
will help solve the problem in the end. 
  All this shows that the Chinese authorities had made good 
preparations when facing the U.S. challenge this time, and they 
had full confidence in the final results of their plan. 
  The sources also said: Although China is opposed to linking 
human rights with MFN, and the differences between the two sides 
over their approaches to human rights were not narrowed, China 
still expressed its understanding of the U.S. Government's 
situation, in which it must give a report on the number of 
political prisoners to the U.S. Congress. Therefore, without 
giving up its principles, the Chinese side also made certain 
concessions in order to make it easier for the Clinton 
administration to save face. Before leaving Beijing, 
Christopher said at his news conference that China gave him 
detailed information about 235 prisoners and agreed to provide 
information about another 106 Tibetan prisoners in the near 
future. China also agreed to continue discussions with the 
International Red Cross about visiting Chinese prisons, and, for 
the first time, China expressed its willingness to discuss 
putting an end to its practice of jamming VOA broadcasts to 
China with the U.S. side. The five- point cooperation agreement 
reached by the two sides during his visit to China also include 
a statement signed by the two sides on "the memorandum on 
products made with prison labor." 
  China also decided to send a trade delegation, the largest 
one in the past 15 years, to the United States in April to seek 
U.S. investment for nearly 800 industrial and agricultural 
projects. 
  The Chinese side maintained that, if Sino-U.S. economic and 
trade relations can be freed from the interference of the human 
rights issue, not only China will benefit, but U.S. economic 
circles will also meet a rare historic opportunity for 
developing economic and trade cooperation with China.

<F P=106> [Report by Gong Xin (7895 2450): "The Ministry of Public </F>
Security Issues a Circular on China's Criminal Cases in 1993"] 
  [Text] A spokesman of the Ministry of Public Security has 
revealed that, in 1993, the Chinese public security organs 
handled 1.617 million criminal cases and cracked 1.212 million 
which occurred in the same year, up by 2.2 and 12.3 percent over 
the 1992 figure. Meanwhile, over 290,000 cases which had 
occurred before 1993 were also solved in that year. This serves 
to show that the public security organs have enhanced their 
case-cracking capacity and have increased the intensity of their 
struggle against crimes. 
  Among the 1.61 million criminal cases handled by public 
security organs across the country in 1993, 539,000 were major 
and serious ones, representing an 18-percent increase over 1992. 
Of all the major and serious cases, 302,000 robbery cases 
involved an amount of 2,000 yuan and above, a 20.2-percent 
increase over the 1992 figure and accounting for 60 percent of 
all major cases. Moreover, a 23.4- percent increase has been 
registered in the number of major criminal cases cracked by 
public security organs which occurred in the same year, bringing 
the number up to 370,000. 
  The spokesman has also pointed out that the present security 
situation remains grim in a handful of cities and counties, 
where murders, robberies, and "highway and railway lootings" are 
happening all the time. The masses in those areas have 
vehemently condemned the practice. In view of such a situation, 
the Ministry of Public Security has called on public security 
organs in all localities to strike more relentless blows at 
crime and pay special attention to rectifying the social order 
of problem-ridden areas.
