  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The All-China 
Federation of Industry and Commerce will cooperate with the 
government and mobilize initiatives of persons engaged in 
non-public economic sectors to contribute to China's reforms, 
development and stability, a leader of the federation said here 
today. 
  Jing Shuping, chairman of the federation, said that China's 
reforms have entered the stage of "storming the fortified 
positions" as the central government have instituted a series of 
major reform measures in banking, taxation and other key 
economic fields since the beginning of this year. 
  His federation, a non-governmental organization and a 
chamber 
of commerce mainly linking with private and other non-public 
economic sectors, will do its best to facilitate the reforms, he 
said. 
  He noted the herculean task for the taxation reform. For 
instance, though the private sector handed over 29.3 billion 
yuan taxes to the state in 1993, tax evasion was serious because 
of poor taxation awareness among the self-employees and private 
businesses. 
  Jing said that the federation and its subordinates 
throughout 
China will organize publicity of the new tax law among persons 
engaged in non-public sectors. 
  The federation will also encourage private businesses to 
absorb more surplus laborers and help enterprises solve problems 
in social security, labor protection and welfare so as to 
maintain social stability, he said. 
  Jing pledged that the federation will help its members to 
upgrade product quality, improve service, expand exports and 
participate in more international economic activities. 
  The federation will bring into full play its role of 
political consultation and democratic supervision, participate 
in the anti-corruption drive and help persons in the non-public 
sectors abide by law and make contributions to the establishment 
of a socialist market economy.

0013 2638): "False Market Signals--Commenting on Present 
Abnormal Price of Construction Steels (First Installment)"] 
  [Text] Since New Year's Day, the prices of construction 
steels have risen one after another in the markets of various 
localities. Prices of spiral steel, sheet steel, and channel 
iron have increased by 150 yuan per tonne. The demand on wire 
rods is the greatest and some steel works have raised their 
producer prices by 300 yuan at one go. The price of wire rods 
in some futures markets for for transactions to be completed in 
June this year has risen to 3,960 yuan per tonne, and has even 
exceeded 4,000 yuan per tonne. Compared with the price of 3,000 
yuan per tonne at the beginning of this year, this sharp 
increase is over 30 percent. 
  This reporter has been "running round" iron and steel 
enterprises for some time and has recently been asked frequently 
by people: Is it normal or abnormal for prices of construction 
steels to soar at present? 
  My answer can only be regarded as my personal view: Viewed 
from the law of value and from the supply and demand 
relationship, there is no reason for prices of construction 
steels to soar at present or this year. 
  Are soaring prices caused by short supply on the 
market, demand being greater than supply, or a drastic fall in 
stocks? Evidently not. 
  According to an analysis by Wu Xichun, vice minister and 
information spokesman of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, 
this year, forecasted according to the scale of social 
investment in fixed assets and the scale of credit arranged to 
meet the target of an increase in GNP of 9-10 percent compared 
with last year, the increase in the total volume of steel 
consumed for the whole year will be 5.4 to 7.5 percent over the 
actual volume consumed last year. The estimated total volume of 
steel resources for the whole year is: 81 million tonnes 
produced in China, 9 million tonnes of stocks in society, and 
some steels which are in short supply will be imported. This 
means that so long as domestic steel production remains normal 
and the use of 9 million tonnes in stock in society is ensured, 
the supply-demand relationship in the steel market this year 
will be more or less in balance and price rises caused by a 
shortage of supply will not occur. 
  Some people may ask: Will the 9 million tonnes of steels in 
stock in society become the plums one "thinks of in an attempt 
to quench a thirst" or the cake "drawn to allay hunger?" It 
seems quite certain that the answer is also no. Last year, 
China imported a total of 30.26 million tonnes of steel, and 
more than half of that arrived after the State Council 
strengthened macro regulation and control over the economy in 
July, and 4.45 million tonnes arrived in December. According to 
calculations based on the rate of steel consumption during that 
period, it was totally impossible for China's construction, 
machine-building, and electrical industries to have consumed 
more than 20 million tonnes of steel in less than half a year. 
According to statistics from the State Statistics Bureau, steel 
stored by state-owned enterprises at the end of last year was 
about 19 percent more than at the beginning of last year. 
Besides, stocks at various iron and steel works at the end of 
last year were over 150 percent more than at the beginning of 
last year. The above shows that there is a big margin of safety 
in the plan to use 9 million tons of steel stocks in society 
this year. 
  Is will be difficult to turn out 81 million tonnes of steel 
this year since the internal and external conditions for the 
production of iron and steel are not good? They are not. As 
early as the first half of last year, average daily steel output 
for three months was 220,000 tonnes, equivalent to an annual 
output of 80.3 million tonnes. Moreover, in the second half of 
last year and this year, a number of new, renovated, or expanded 
projects were put into operation. The production situation 
since January this year is even better: Compared with the same 
period of 1993, iron output has increased by 369,000 tonnes, or 
5.66 percent; steel output by 558,000 tonnes, or 8.15 percent; 
and output of special steels by 729,800 tonnes or 13.08 percent. 
The range of increase for special steels was wider than that 
for basic steel, which was wider than for iron. This is 
precisely what people engaged in the metallurgical industry want. 
  Is this a chain reaction in the domestic market caused 
by a rise in the price of steel on the international market? It 
is not. 
  The price of steel on the international market inevitably 
becomes an objective standard for the rise and fall of the price 
of steels in the domestic market following the institution of 
the socialist market economy structure. However, the relevant 
data show that the $15 rise for each tonne of hot-rolled sheet 
steel and coated sheet steel on the U.S. market at the beginning 
of this year was caused by anti-dumping policies against steel 
imports implemented by the United States last year, which held 
back imports, and by rising labor costs in domestic steel works, 
whose output could not meet market demand. In Europe, on the 
one hand, low-price Russian steel are being sold on the market, 
and, on the other hand, each country's steel works are finding 
it difficult to realize their wish to raise prices because of a 
slow economic recovery. In Japan, the six major iron and steel 
corporations are suffering losses. They of course want to raise 
prices to some extent, but in the first half of this year, since 
the economic recession had not yet ended and steel exports to 
China had dropped by a big margin, the objective environment did 
not permit rising prices. Viewed then from the major 
steel-producing countries round the world, no considerable rise 
in the price of steel has occurred. Therefore, there are no 
grounds for a big rise in the price of steel in China. 
  Has seasonal demand for steel led to a rise in the 
price of steels? Evidently not! 
  It was extremely cold in January and February, and many 
capital construction projects north of the Chang Jiang had to be 
suspended or slow down their construction progress because of 
the climate. On construction sites south of the Chang Jiang, 
most workers come from other localities, and they made use of 
the New Year-Spring Festival period to go home and see their 
relatives. This objectively led to a "lax season" in the use of 
steel. This can be seen from steel prices in some futures 
markets: prices were not high for January and February, and the 
highest prices are found in June and July. 
  Have readjustments in coal, electricity, and 
transportation prices raised producer price of steel leading to 
a rise in futures prices? Much less is the case! 
  On the whole, producer prices of wire rods from various 
steel 
works at present have recovered slightly compared with the 
fourth quarter, and it should be said that the shadow of an 
abrupt fall in prices last year has just gone. At present, 
various steel works are, in accordance with the demands of the 
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and through the Metallurgical 
Product Price Coordination Committee, seriously summing up 
experiences and lessons of the major fluctuations in prices in 
1993. They have formed a preliminary view: Steel works hope 
the price of steels will not go out of control. This is because 
letting things drift leads to abrupt rises and falls in the 
price of steel, which will not be conducive to the readjustment 
of the structure of the metallurgical industry, the formation of 
a competitive mechanism for the survival of the fittest among 
enterprises, the normal production and operational activities of 
enterprises, the healthy development of other sectors of the 
national economy, and the stability of the entire society. Last 
year, many small unlicensed workshops were set up to produce 
steel and large quantities of poor quality steel were found. 
Over 30 million tonnes of steel was unnecessarily imported, of 
which construction steel accounted for half the total. An 
important reason was that the price of steel was too high and 
immense profits could be reaped. All large and medium sized 
iron and steel works expressed their determination to seriously 
make good use of their rights to set product prices and to 
adhere to four principles in setting prices: ensuring 
reasonable profits for enterprises under normal production 
conditions, giving full consideration to market demand, using 
international market prices as reference, and paying attention 
to maintaining cooperation with major users and long-term users. 
  "How should we look at the rise in construction steel prices 
at present after so much has been said?" 
  In fact, my view is quite clear: There is no shortage of 
steel on the market, demand for steel is not excessive, the 
amount of steel in stock is not small, steel production is 
normal, and increases in the price of steel abroad are not big. 
If the price of steel is artificially raised by means of 
"speculation," such activities can only be called "blind 
activities." As Wu Xichun, vice minister and information 
spokesman of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, put it: 
The emergence of so-called "short supply and soaring prices" in 
the steel market is an abnormal phenomenon and a false market 
signal.

two-billion-yuan chemical fibre base will start within the site 
of the Jinling Petrochemical Company here with the recent 
approval of the State Council. 
  The base, which is to produce acrylonitrile as well as 
acrylic fibres which are badly needed on domestic market, will 
be jointly funded by the China National Petrochemcial 
Corporation, the provincial and Nanjing city governments, 
  The base will produce 50,000 tons of acrylonitrile, 30,000 
tons of acrylic fibres and 2,000 tons of methyl cyanide as well 
as 6,000 tons of thiamine, annually. 
  Official sources said that the annual sales of the base is 
expected to reach about 710 million yuan, and it will be able to 
realize some 230 million yuan of profits and taxes per year. 
  Official statistics show that nearly a quarter of the 
acrylic 
fibres used every year in the country is consumed in Jiangsu, 
one of the economically developed provinces in China.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (XINHUA) -- The rural work 
conference of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CPC) 
of China opened here today. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee 
and Chinese president, and Li Peng, member of the Standing 
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee 
and premier, today delivered important speeches at the meeting, 
which was presided over by member of the Standing Committee of 
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. 
  Jiang said that agriculture and the work in rural areas are 
very important to manage well the relations between reforms, 
development and stability in China. 
  He noted that this year is an important year for China to 
set 
up the socialist market economic structure and to carry forward 
reforms in the sectors of finance, taxation, investment and 
foreign trade. 
  He said that the smooth implementation of the reform 
measures 
depends on a sound economic environment and a stable social 
environment, especially on stability and development of 
agriculture and the rural economy. 
  He noted that stability in rural areas and a strong 
agricultural base will ensure stability in the country, smooth 
reforms and continuous, rapid and healthy development. 
  He pointed out that the general situation in rural areas is 
good, but there are some relatively urgent problems, including a 
decline in grain output in south China, two consecutive years of 
reduction of cotton production, remarkable rises in the prices 
of non-staple foods and slow growth of famers' incomes. 
  Jiang stressed the importance of production and supply of 
grain, cotton, edible oil and vegetables. 
  He said that China has 1.2 billion people and it must be 
self- reliant in grain production and supply. 
  He urged all provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities 
to make investigations and analysis of their grain production 
and supply, and to make an overall check on their grain storage. 
  He said that the reform of the grain sale and purchase 
system 
should be deepened and macro control of the system be enhanced 
so as to ensure state control of necessary grain sources. 
  He said it is an arduous yet important task to increase farm 
income with the development of agricultural production this year. 
  He said that on the basis of raising grain and cotton 
output, 
measures should be taken to readjust industrial setups in rural 
areas, developing high-efficiency agriculture, a diversified 
economy and rural industry. 
  On maintaining the stability of rural areas, he urged the 
leaders at various levels to make a timely disposal of problems 
concerning people's interests, including reducing farmers' 
burdens, dealing with various crimes, checking unhealthy 
tendencies in the party and in society, and aiding the 
development of poverty-stricken areas. 
  On the question of enhancing the party's leadership over 
agriculture and rural work, he said that within the whole 
economic scheme, whether agriculture is given top priority is a 
big issue that concerns setting economic development at the core 
of all work. 
  He said party committees and governments at various levels 
should correctly handle the relations between industry and 
agriculture, that is, under the precondition of sustained, 
steady growth of agriculture, they should establish the 
development scale and rate of growth of the national economy and 
proportionally arrange investment in the first, second and 
tertiary industries. 
  He stressed that both central departments and local 
governments should continue to implement the policies and 
measures issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council. 
  He called on the leaders of provinces, autonomous regions 
and 
municipalities to conduct investigations in the countryside and 
listen to people's opinions and suggestions and make 
arrangements for the work in agriculture and rural areas. 
  Premier Li Peng urged the leading officials at various 
levels 
to take a sober-minded approach to rural work. 
  He said that China has 900 million residents in rural areas 
and that it is the major factor in China's stability. 
  He said that the production and supply of agricultural 
products has a direct bearing on the stability of prices. 
  He called on leading officials to assure bumper harvest in 
agricultural production, especially in grain and cotton 
production. 
  On the major tasks this year, Premier Li Peng called for 
ensuring the growing area for grain, cotton and vegetables. In 
northern China, the grain growing area should be on the 
increase; in southern China and coastal areas, the grain growing 
area should be extended by a large proportion. 
  He also talked about other measures for rural work including 
raising purchase prices of grain and cotton to stimulate 
farmers' initiative; ensuring supply of farming production 
materials; carrying on reforms of the grain purchase system and 
setting up grain risk funds; popularizing science and technology 
in farming; state control of ample grain resources; improving of 
farming production conditions; increasing of investment into 
farming and promoting of the development of rural industry. 
  He stressed that governors, chairmen and mayors should bear 
the responsibility for rural work, and the responsibility system 
must also be carried out with governments at various levels. 
  Other members of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu 
Huaqing and Hu Jintao attended the conference. 
  Among those who attended today's meeting were Ding Guangen, 
Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, Chen Xitong, Jiang Chunyun 
and Qian Qichen.

<F P=106> [24 Mar RENMIN RIBAO Editorial: "Resolutely Give Top </F>
Priority to Agricultural Work This Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (XINHUA) -- No sooner had the "two 
meetings" concluded than the CPC Central Committee called a 
rural work conference to give top priority to agricultural work. 
This fully demonstrates the high importance that the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council attach to agricultural 
and rural work. 
  Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. 
Handling well this year's agricultural and rural work is of 
particularly pressing and practical significance. China truly 
needs a stable social and economic environment since this year 
is an important year for implementing the "Decision" adopted at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and 
for establishing a socialist market economy. Social and 
economic stability depends first of all on the development of 
agriculture and stability in rural areas, on the abundant supply 
of sideline agricultural products, and on achieving market 
stability. Past experience shows that whenever agricultural 
development exists, stability prevails in rural areas, stability 
exists in the entire society, and reform and development can be 
smoothly promoted. Therefore, we should make every effort to 
promote agricultural and rural work. Only when the agricultural 
base is consolidated and when the rural areas enjoy stability 
can there be stability in the entire country, can the reform be 
smoothly carried out, and can the economy develop in a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. 
  Last year, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
adopted a number of important measures whose major aims were to 
solve such problems as the issuance of "IOU's" in the 
procurement of sideline agricultural products and the problem of 
excessive burdens on farmers. Those measures have protected and 
mobilized farmers' enthusiasm for farming and have been 
instrumental in helping maintain excellent development momentum 
for agriculture and the rural economy. At present, the general 
situation in rural areas is good. But we should also know that 
we cannot afford to overlook some problems and contradictions in 
agriculture and rural areas. They include: low efficiency in the 
production of grain; difficulties in fulfilling this year's 
production plan for such staple agricultural products as grain 
and cotton; slow growth in farmers' incomes; and the widening 
income gap between urban and rural citizens. Therefore, the 
entire party and all levels of government departments should 
attach great importance to these problems and contradictions and 
adopt timely measures to solve them. 
  It should be pointed out that definite goals for 
agricultural and rural development have been set, and various 
concrete principles and policies have been adopted. The key now 
lies in effectively implementing them. At present it is 
necessary to implement every concrete measure in a step-by-step 
manner in line with arrangements worked out by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council, to promote this year's rural 
economic development, to increase the income of farmers, and to 
bring social stability to rural areas. This is the basic task 
of this year's agricultural and rural work. First, we must give 
priority to doing a good job in grain, cotton, and edible oil 
production and in the "shopping basket" project; we must 
increase the effective supply of agricultural sideline products; 
and we must contribute to the alleviation of inflation pressure. 
We must maintain stable grain production growth because grain 
is a special commodity and has an important bearing on stability 
in a country. In a big country like ours, we must strive to 
achieve self-sufficiency in grain production and attain a rough 
balance between supply and demand in grain. Major grain growing 
regions should do a good job on grain production. Developed 
coastal regions should also strive to prevent a further 
shrinkage in the acreage of land available for grain production 
and stabilize grain output and the grain inventory. All levels 
of governments should attach great importance to cotton 
production and try for a big increase in cotton production this 
year. Mayors of all large and medium-sized cities should 
include the "shopping basket project" on their major agenda and 
ensure an abundant supply of non staple food and price 
stability. In addition, effective measures should be worked out 
to promote comprehensive development of the rural economy and to 
bring about a large increase in the incomes of farmers. We must 
take the resolute step of developing high-output, high-quality, 
and high-efficiency farming. On the premise of stabilizing 
grain and cotton production, great efforts should be made to 
promote multiple farming operations and to comprehensively 
develop farming, forestry, animal husbandry, agricultural 
sideline products, and fisheries. The development of diverse 
forms of secondary and tertiary industries, including 
agricultural sideline product processing, should be greatly 
encouraged. At the same time, support should be given to 
developing a number of "locomotive" enterprises and businesses 
that integrate trading, industrial, and agricultural operations. 
Separate guidance should be given to village and township 
enterprises according to their lines of operation. Particular 
attention should be given to supporting the development of 
village and township enterprises in central and western regions 
of China. We must continuously do a good job in lightening the 
burdens on farmers and earnestly implement the "State Plan to 
Move 80 Million People Out of Poverty in Seven Years." 
  Promoting further development of the rural economy requires 
the main line of deepening reform to be firmly upheld. The 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
CPC Central Committee's rural work conference last October have 
made arrangements for that. Localities should proceed from 
reality, boldly explore, and carry out promotional work 
vigorously. On the premise of a stable policy, we need to 
improve the basic operating system in rural areas; give vigorous 
support to, offer correct guidance to, sum up the experiences 
of, standardize, and healthily develop the various shareholding 
and cooperation systems. It is necessary to further reform the 
grain procurement system; enhance the state's macro regulation 
and control over grain; ensure grain supply; prevent big 
upheavals in grain price; deepen reform of the financial system 
as well as the supply and marketing system in rural areas; and 
promote development of the rural economy. 
  The strengthening of agricultural status and the development 
of the rural economy are inseparable from the importance 
attached to them by various levels of leading organs. The 
latest CPC Central Committee rural work conference has defined 
responsibility and decided that in assessing future performance, 
agricultural and rural work will be made an important criterion 
in evaluating the political performance of all levels of leading 
cadres. This is an important measure to further enhance the 
leadership of all levels of party committees and governments for 
agricultural and rural work. Tackling agricultural and rural 
work requires not only dealing with economic development, but 
also grassroots organization building, spiritual civilization 
building, and comprehensive management of social order. It is 
our belief that the entire party and society will surely help 
bring about a new and prosperous phase in our country's rural 
areas through their joint efforts.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of speech delivered by Tian Jiyun when meeting </F>
with Chinese and foreign representatives attending an 
"International Symposium on Reform and Development in China's 
Rural Areas in the 1990's": "Great Changes in China's Rural 
Areas"] 
  [Text] Rural reform in China has been carried out for 15 
years. During this period, the changes in China's rural areas 
have been profound and the results obtained remarkable. I think 
that the most important changes in rural areas have been in the 
following aspects: 
  The first change is the change in the form of management and 
the distribution of land. The basic means of production, that 
is to say the production relationship, has been readjusted. In 
essence, the past structure of the so-called people's commune of 
being large in size and collective in nature, eating out of the 
big pot, and egalitarianism has been changed, and various forms 
of responsibility system linking remuneration to output with 
household contracts as the dominant factor have been instituted. 
Management rights over land, a means of production and a basic 
factor of production, have been given to peasants and the idea 
of land to the tiller has been realized. This is the greatest 
and most profound change in China's rural areas during the 
socialist construction period, and it is also the foundation of 
all other changes. This has enabled peasants to have the right 
to make decisions about land management and the right to handle 
most agricultural produce freely. This has given economic 
benefits to the peasants and has greatly aroused their 
enthusiasm for production. Land management rights, the right to 
freely handle one's own produce, and economic benefits are the 
essence of rural change. 
  The second change is that we have gradually abolished the 
long- standing policy of a state monopoly in the purchase and 
marketing of agricultural produce. At present, with the 
exception of a few kinds of agricultural produce, such as 
cotton, cured tobacco, and silk cocoons, which are still under 
state monopoly, price restrictions on all other agricultural 
produce have been basically removed and prices are regulated by 
the market. Restrictions on the price of major agricultural 
produce, such as grains, edible oils, and meat have been removed 
across the country. 
  The third change is that we have used the viewpoint of macro 
agriculture to guide agriculture. In developing planting, we 
have enthusiastically developed forestry, animal husbandry, 
fisheries, and various kinds of sideline production. In the 
1980's and even at the beginning of the 1990's, not just 
planting developed greatly: Forestry, animal husbandry, 
breeding, and various kinds of sideline production also 
developed very fast in China's rural areas. We have corrected 
the long-standing one-sided practice of taking grain as the key 
link and have used the viewpoint of macro agriculture and the 
viewpoint of the comprehensive development of agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries 
to guide agriculture. This is one of the main reasons why our 
rural economy has developed quite rapidly. 
  The fourth important change is that in developing 
agriculture, we have energetically developed township-run 
industry and village-run industry and have encouraged peasants 
to enter the field of commodity circulation and to move toward 
nonagricultural production. I estimate that by the end of this 
year, the total income provided by township and town enterprises 
in China will exceed 2,500 billion yuan, and the number of 
peasants working in these enterprises will be about 110 million. 
Such a rapid development of township and town enterprises 
basically depends on accumulation by the collective economy and 
by the peasants, and the state has invested nothing in them, but 
has only assisted by granting some bank loans and implementing 
some preferential taxation policies. At present, we can say 
that the township and town enterprises have developed into a 
powerful support for the rural economy and have become an 
important part of the whole national economy. I think that they 
will soon constitute half of the entire national economy. 
  Of China's 1.1 billion-strong population, peasants account 
for 800 million. What road should China take to realize 
modernization? The development of township and town enterprises 
has enabled us to view the hope of rural modernization. Since 
the birth of township and town enterprises, they have not 
enjoyed any preferential treatment from the planned economy, but 
have been guided by the market economy. Therefore, they have 
powerful vitality. The development of township and town 
enterprises has not only injected new vitality into the rural 
economy in China, but has also created rich experience for 
reforming state-owned enterprises. I think that if our 
state-owned enterprises can really master the operational 
mechanisms of township and town enterprises and can transplant 
such mechanisms for their own use, reform of our state-owned 
enterprises will make much greater progress and their economic 
results will also be greatly improved. 
  In developing the rural economy, we have also encouraged the 
integration of planting and breeding with the industry of 
processing agricultural produce, the integration of agriculture 
and industry with commerce, and the integration of agriculture, 
science, technology, and education with the improvement of the 
quality of laborers. Of course, we have not yet done sufficient 
work in this respect, and such work should be carried out at a 
deeper level. However, we have made a good start. 
  At the symposium, various specialists and scholars have put 
forward some issues which we should further resolve and should 
pay attention to in the reform and development of China's rural 
areas. I think they are very important and are also important 
issues which we should study and resolve in deepening reform in 
the future. For example, the issue of extending peasants' 
rights to use and manage land is an issue peasants are most 
concerned about. In the beginning, the contract period was 
usually limited to 15 years. Now that 15 years has passed, 
should we fix another time limit or should we state clearly that 
the land is being given to the peasants for their long-term 
management and use. I think this issue is worth studying. I 
think that if we state clearly that land is being given to the 
peasants for long-term management, the peasants will carry out 
intensive and meticulous farming and will pay even great 
attention to inputs to the land. This would also be an 
effective measure to curb the practice of some government 
departments of randomly occupying and misusing land. 
  Another example is that after agricultural produce is 
regulated by the market, the issue of how to maintain steady 
growth in major agricultural produce is also very important. To 
resolve this issue, it may be necessary to adopt measures to 
protect producers and consumers in addition to providing the 
peasants in good time with relatively accurate information on 
market supply and demand. For example, after a bumper 
agricultural harvest, we should set a protective lower limit for 
prices of agricultural produce; and if output of agricultural 
produce decreases and market prices rise abruptly, the consumers 
should be given certain corresponding subsidies. I think that 
after practicing market regulation, it is necessary for us to 
study the adoption of similar measures. 
  Another issue is the rising gap in incomes between urban and 
rural residents. This is also an important aspect affecting the 
peasants' enthusiasm for production. In the early and 
mid-1980's, the increase in peasants' incomes was fast, and the 
gap between urban and rural income was greatly reduced. 
However, by the end of the 1980's and the beginning of the 
1990's, we can say that peasants' income was in a state of slow 
growth. After the gap between urban residents and rural 
residents had been reduced for some time, it became bigger 
again. If such a situation is short and temporary, we need not 
worry. However, if such a situation continues in this way, this 
would be dreadful and will become a factor of social instability. 
  It is very important and necessary to appropriately raise 
agricultural produce prices, but this is not the only way. What 
is important is to readjust the structure of agricultural 
production and to optimize the product mix of agriculture. We 
call it the development of high-output, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture. The third measure is to raise 
labor productivity in agriculture. While energetically 
developing secondary and tertiary industries, we should, in 
localities where conditions are available, energetically promote 
land management on a considerably large scale, including 
household farms, collective farms, and state farms. Besides, I 
quite agree with the viewpoint put forward by various 
specialists. The most fundamental thing in resolving rural 
issues is to improve the quality of rural laborers and to raise 
the educational level of the peasants. I have been in charge of 
agriculture for a long period and have been to many localities. 
I have come to the conclusion that any village which is led by 
a person with a relatively low educational level or without much 
schooling is a relatively backward village, its economy develops 
slowly, and even the problem of food is not completely solved 
there; and any village which is led by an educated person, be he 
a person with a medium educational level, a middle school 
graduate, or an ex- serviceman who has been to other places and 
has wide experience, develops fast. This can be said to be a 
general law. Without energetically improving the cultural 
quality of the peasants, it will be very difficult to turn 
existing and practical science and technology into productive 
forces. 
  Besides what I have mentioned, we have also put forward many 
other good suggestions, such as on the issue of environmental 
protection, the issue of population, and so on. We should 
seriously study all of them. 
  I think that this international symposium is a great success 
and will play a positive role in promoting and deepening rural 
reform.

<F P=106> ["Roundup: How China's Farm Yields Are Raised" -- XINHUA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- An overall 
agricultural development program across China has paid off 
through a decade of practice. 
  Advocated by the Chinese Government since the late 1980s, 
the 
program has focused on building water conservancy projects, 
introducing new and advanced agro-techniques, setting up 
commodity grain production and animal-breeding centres and 
training farmers technically. 
  "It has proved a successful way to rejuvenate China's 
agriculture," a government official in charge of agriculture 
said. 
  With the program, according to a recent survey, China has 
transformed 7.33 million hectares of low-yield farmland into 
high- yield land, reclaimed more than one million hectares of 
waste land, planted trees on 1.04 million hectares, and improved 
306,000 hectares of grassland over the past decade and more. 
  As a result, it has obtained 17.16 billion additional 
kilograms of grain, 2.52 million kilograms of cotton, 700,000 
tons of oil- bearing crops, 9.77 million kilograms of sugar and 
620,000 tons of meat. 
  Farmers in areas included in the program have earned 200 
yuan 
extra per capita a year. 
  One example is the Huanghuaihai Plains, which covers the 
valleys between the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe rivers in part of 
Anhui, Hebei and Shandong provinces. In the past this area was 
frequently hit by natural disasters. By introducing the overall 
agricultural development measures, farmers have transformed 
3.368 million hectares of low-yield fields into high-yield 
farmland, improved water irrigation facilities and introduced 
new farm varieties and scientific farming through five years of 
hard efforts. 
  The grain output in the plains area of Shandong and Hebei 
Provinces now accounts for 33 percent of the provinces' total 
and that in Anhui for 65 percent. 
  Known as a granary, the Northeast China Plain has increased 
its grain output between 2,250 kilograms and 3,000 kilograms per 
hectare as a result of employing scientific farming methods and 
transformation of the lower-yield land. 
  Liaoning Province in northeast China is a key industrial 
centre, which used to buy at least 1.5 billion kilograms of 
grain every year from other parts of the country to feed its 
population. 
  The overall agricultural development has helped this 
province 
to become self-sufficient in grain and non-staple food over the 
past five years. 
  East China has more people with less farmland. 
  With farmland averaging only 0.04 hectares per capita, the 
coastal Zhejiang Province has dammed tidal land to use as 
farmland to boost its grain output over the past five years. 
  Western China, which has adverse natural conditions, has 
built a number of farm capital projects to improve the 
ecological environment. 
  Sichuan Province has improved and expanded irrigation 
facilities; Guizhou and Yunnan provinces built terraced fields; 
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region constructed water pumping 
projects to help transform its poor land; and the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region upgraded its grassland. 
  In addition, all the areas involved have studied 
agro-techniques. 
  One example is the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which 
has earned 7.5 million U.S. dollars by exporting a new variety 
of grape. 
  Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces in the middle and 
lower 
reaches of the Chang Jiang River, have applied more than 3,000 
new techniques and fine varieties to farming in recent years. 
  Training courses and technical schools for farmers are 
mushrooming across the country. 
  A survey shows that China still has 60 million hectares of 
low- yield farmland, 300 million hectares of low-yield 
grassland, 828,000 hectares of low-lying coastal land and 67 
million hectares of sandy wasteland, which are ripe for 
transformation.

<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent Li Jifeng] </F>
  [Text] The four-day provincial party committee propaganda 
and ideological work conference concluded satisfactorily in 
Guiyang on 15 March. Wang Siqi, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, made a concluding speech. Attending 
the closing ceremonies were provincial party and government 
leading members, including Li Wanlu, Wang Shouting, Xia Guohua, 
Huang Yao, Li Ling, Gong Xianyong, and Chang Zheng. 
  Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the current provincial 
party committee propaganda and ideological work conference 
studied and made arrangements for augmenting and improving 
Guizhou's propaganda and ideological work under the new 
situation of building the socialist market economy and in line 
with the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously 
while attaching equal importance to both. 
  In his concluding speech, Wang Siqi, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, indicated that from now on, in our 
propaganda and ideological work it is imperative to accomplish 
eight imperatives in propaganda work: 1) It is imperative to 
grasp firmly the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the basic guidance; 2) It is imperative to 
maintain party spirit; 3) It is imperative to adhere to the 
principle of focusing on construction; 4) It is imperative to 
augment work in mass ideological education; 5) It is imperative 
to further amplify the theme of the times; 6) It is imperative 
to continuously improve ways and methods in work to improve 
propaganda effects; 7) It is imperative to further strengthen 
leadership and to increase input so as to improve work 
conditions; 8) It is imperative to continue to augment building 
the rank and file of propaganda cadres. 
  At the closing ceremonies, Huang Yao, member of the 
provincial party committee standing committee and concurrently 
director of the propaganda department, set out a four-point 
requirement on relaying and implementing the spirit of the 
current meeting: 1) It is necessary rapidly to report the 
spirit of the current meeting to party committees and party 
groups at various levels, and to make suggestions on putting 
this spirit into practice by linking it to the actual conditions 
of various departments; 2) It is necessary to do a good job in 
propagating the spirit of the current meeting so that all of 
society will show concern for, support, and participate in 
propaganda and ideological work; 3) It is necessary to organize 
the cadres of propaganda and cultural departments to earnestly 
study and grasp the spirit of the current meeting, to deepen 
their understanding, to have a clear picture of the situation 
and a clear idea of the tasks, and to brace up and work hard; 4) 
Enterprises, institutions, and institutes of tertiary education 
should do a good job in relaying the spirit of the current 
meeting, and should strengthen propaganda and ideological work 
in enterprises, institutions, and institutions of tertiary 
education in a down-to-earth way.

  [Text] Chongqing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Efforts to use 
high-technology to upgrade traditional industries have begun to 
pay off in this important industrial city in southwest China's 
Sichuan Province. 
  According to local officials, high-technology has injected 
great vitality into a group of old enterprises in the city. 
These enterprises have so far produced high- and 
new-technological products with an output value of 800 million 
yuan. 
  As west China's largest old industrial base, Chongqing used 
to be hampered in its economic development because of the 
dominance of outdated technology and outmoded products. 
  To change this situation, the Science and Technology 
Committee of Chongqing city has encouraged some old enterprises 
to apply high- and new-technology for technical upgrading. 
  While importing equipment and technology from foreign 
countries and promoting the absorption of such technology, local 
enterprises have also paid great attention to the development of 
high- and new-technology, as well as to the adjustment of 
product mix. 
  For instance, the Chongqing No. 5 Pharmaceuticals Factory 
used to be able to produce only a handful of items, such as 
starch and glucose, before 1986. But over the past few years, 
factory leaders have decided to organize researchers to focus on 
the development of new types of antibiotic pharmaceuticals by 
making good use of bio- engineering techniques, and adopted a 
new principle of treating production of nutritious 
pharmaceuticals and base materials for producing antibiotic 
pharmaceuticals as the main tasks. 
  The factory, which is now an important enterprise under the 
state administration of pharmaceuticals, has developed 16 types 
of new products. 
  At the same time, the Science and Technology Committee has 
also encouraged local scientific research institutes and 
colleges to help promote the technical upgrading of enterprises 
in the city.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The Tibetan Autonomous 
Region has taken measures to promote market-oriented livestock 
farming in recent years. 
  As one of the five largest livestock producing regions in 
China, Tibet has 22.8 million head of cattle including yaks and 
sheep. Last year its meat output reached 100 million kilograms 
and dairy products weighed in at 180 million kilograms. 
  There are about 82 million hectares of grassland in Tibet 
with about 52 million hectares of grassland available for cattle. 
  The autonomous region constructed marketplaces in cities, 
counties and towns for farmers' and herdsmen's livestock 
business. 
  In Amdo County in northern Tibet, the local government set 
up 
a live cattle market and the annual transaction value reached 9 
million yuan last year. 
  Tibet is also emphasizing the development of the livestock 
product processing industry. Now the region has eight factories 
engaged in processing wool cushion materials. Last year exports 
of the materials reached 10,000 square meters. 
  Baingoin County last year invested 780,000 yuan in Golmud 
City in Qinghai Province to set up a wool factory. 
  A 2.3-square-kilometer livestock product processing zone has 
been planned in northern Tibet and is expected to be constructed 
soon. 
  Commodity-oriented livestock production has helped farmers 
and herdsmen in Tibet to raise income levels. Last year the 
income per capita of farmers and herdsmen reached 515 yuan, an 
increase of 5.1 percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 23 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region will put more funds into its agriculture and animal 
husbandry this year, a regional government official said. 
  Agriculture and animal husbandry make up 80 percent of the 
region's local output, and this year the regional government 
will carry out a more preferential policy with regard to loans 
to the two sectors. 
  The additional funds will be used mainly to promote the 
development of farmland, grassland, hydropower stations and 
other water conservancy facilities. 
  The government will increase funding by seven million yuan 
(804,600 U.S. dollars) each year in an attempt to spread fine 
strains of crops. Chemical fertilizers will continue to be sold 
with government price support. 
  The region will also appropriate 20 million yuan each year 
to 
ensure the construction of some key or small hydropower 
stations. The funding in animal husbandry will remain at ten 
million yuan a year as before. 
  In addition to the central government's aid to impoverished 
areas, the regional government will expand the scale of loans to 
township and town enterprises to boost their growth.

  The region has opened 5,453 evening literacy schools and 
more 
than 120,000 people have passed literacy tests. 
  According to a survey conducted by the regional government 
recently, the number of illiterates has dropped to 44.43 percent 
from 95 percent before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951. 
  In Shannan Prefecture, about 9,000 illiterates have attended 
evening literacy schools over the past five years and 85 percent 
of the young people have learned how to read and write. 
  Despite the efforts, the illiteracy rate in Tibet is still 
on 
the high side as compared with other parts of the country. 
  Greater efforts are needed to raise the general educational 
level of the farmers and herdsmen, who account for 80 percent of 
the total population of the region, an official from the 
regional government said.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Much headway has been 
made in the improvement of three major highways in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region in southwest China. 
  The highways link the region with Qinghai and Sichuan 
Provinces and Nepal, respectively. 
  The construction of the Heihe-Gamdo Highway has been 
completed, and work is going well on some sections of the 
China-Nepal Highway, upgrading projects on the Qinghai-Tibet and 
Sichuan-Tibet Highways, and the Lhaze Bridge. 
  Highways in Tibet are subject to frozen earth, mud-rock 
flows, snowslides, snow storms, desertification and landslides. 
  Statistics show that such natural disasters have blocked 
highways in Tibet for an average of over 100 days each year in 
the past over 40 years. 
  The Qinghai-Tibet Highway has undergone three large-scale 
improvements. 
  As Tibet is the only region with no railway outlets, the 
Chinese Government attaches great importance to highway 
construction. 
  In the past 40 years the central government has invested 
over 
4 billion yuan (almost 500 million U.S. dollars at the current 
exchange rate) in highway construction. 
  The upgrading and improvement of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway 
started in 1992 and will cost 850 million yuan (about 100 
million U.S. dollars).

  [Excerpts] The Second Session of the Eighth Yunnan

all useful ideas; acted as masters of the country; and 
demonstrated a strong sense of mission. A large number of work 
reports and resolutions have been deliberated on and adopted at 
the current session, thereby affirming our achievements; summing 
up experiences; laying down clear-cut tasks, goals, and work 
measures for this year; and fully embodying the will and

united, truth-seeking, and confidence-boosting meeting, capable 
of mobilizing the people of all nationalities in Yunnan to work 
with one heart and one mind, continually carry out explorations, 
and constantly forge ahead. Now that the current congress 
session has laid down clear-cut goals and tasks for Yunnan's 
reform, construction, and development in 1994, the crux of the 
matter lies in carrying out these goals and tasks to the letter 
and in conducting our work in a down-to-earth manner. 
  Yin Jun concluded his speech by saying: Let us unite more 
closely around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core; hold aloft the great banner of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; and mobilize and unite the people of all 
nationalities across the province to bravely forge ahead to 
build a new socialist economy structure and to fulfill all the 
economic and social development goals set for this year under 
the leadership of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee! 
  He Zhiqiang [governor] also attended this morning's closing 
meeting. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yunnan's border trade has continued to develop, 
with import-export volume increasing by a wide margin. Last 
year, the province's gross import-export volume soared to 2.87 
billion yuan, up 26 percent over the previous year. 
  Yunnan boasts a border that stretches some 3,000 km, and by 
the end of 1993, 17 ports opening up to the world had been 
built. Presently, goods exported through border ports include 
steel products, building materials, electric machinery, articles 
of daily use, light industrial products, foodstuffs and 
beverages, not to mention farm and sideline produce, with the 
trade volume increasing with each passing year. Some of the 
items have become backbone products in border trade. 
  The sites for trade have changed from stalls on the streets 
to large trade cities, shopping malls, and stores. Many ports 
have built comprehensive border trade markets comprising 
transportation, telecommunications, storehouses, catering, 
hotels, and other services.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 KYODO -- China renewed Thursday 
[24 March] its calls for dialogue to solve the nuclear question 
on the Korean peninsula as tensions continued to mount under 
sharpened warlike rhetoric between North and South Korea. 
  "The reason we stand for seeking a solution through dialogue 
is that we believe this issue can be solved through it," a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  Spokesman Wu Jianmin told journalists at his weekly 
briefing, 
"We oppose exerting pressure as this will only serve to sharpen 
the conflict," he said when asked if China would veto UN 
Security Council sanctions. 
  "Exerting pressure is not helpful for carrying out dialogue, 
and we do not wish to see the issue referred to the UN Security 
Council," he said. 
  Wu did not respond to questions on whether Beijing and 
Pyongyang are presently holding consultations. 
  He said despite present difficulties, previous talks had 
progressed and he called on all sides to show patience.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (YONHAP) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said Tuesday that Beijing would draft a resolution stating 
its position on the North Korean nuclear dispute in case the UN 
Security Council takes up the issue. 
  At a press conference after the close of the National 
People's Congress meeting, Li reiterated that China believes the 
problem should be solved through dialogue and negotiation, 
rather than pressure, when asked to comment on recent 
developments. 
  He clearly reaffirmed China's opposition to the UN Security 
Council taking up the problem, because pressuring North Korea 
would not help the security of Northeast Asia but would only 
complicate matters and heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
  He also stressed Beijing's desire for a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula, noting that China as a signatory to the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty would never support an arms race. 
  Li hoped other permanent members of the UN Security Council 
would support China's resolution on the North Korean nuclear 
issue.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 22 (AFP) -- Governor Chris Patten 
on Tuesday defended British changes to Hong Kong's constitution, 
saying any amendments could not come into force without the 
blessing of the colony's legislature. 
  "I think it's a storm in a tea spoon," Patten told reporters 
after Sunday's press disclosure that London had quietly drafted 
key changes to the Letters Patent before the Legislative Council 
had a chance to debate them. 
  "Nothing has been done secretively," he said, adding: "I 
have to say as arguments go, this one is an extremely dead 
sheep." 
  The changes, approved in July by the Privy Council in 
London, 
notably limit the number of directly elected Legislative Council 
seats to 20 in the run-up to Hong Kong's handback to China in 
1997. The change is part of the second and final half of 
Patten's controversial political reform package, which 
legislators are to debate and adopt before mid-July. 
  Several pro-democracy politicians intend to press for a 
greater number of directly elected members -- but by quietly 
changing the Letters Patent, it appeared that London was trying 
to pre-empt them, political observers say. But Patten, in his 
first comment on the issue, said the changes were a necessary 
step in the reform process, "so that the bill could then be 
brought into line with our constitutional arrangements and vice 
versa." 
  He added -- as legal experts already have -- that the 
amendment would only become effective after it is published in 
Hong Kong's official government gazette. He also said the last 
word rested with legislators. 
  "I suppose that the Legislative Council could either amend 
the bill in a way which made it allegedly more democratic or in 
a way which allegedly made it less democratic," he said. 
  Britain and China agree that a new legislature to be elected 
in 1995 will consist of 20 directly elected seats -- with the 
remaining 40 to be filled by an electoral college, special 
interest groups and industrial sectors. But they have fallen 
out badly over the details of the crucial polls, with China 
declaring that it will scrap Patten's reforms in 1997 and hold 
fresh elections based on its own, as yet undefined criteria.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Chen Shao-chiang (7115 </F>
1421 1730): "Li Ziliu Talks About Value-Added Land Tax, Saying 
More Flexibility Should Be Given to Local Authorities"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (HSIN WAN PAO)--Guangzhou Mayor Li 
Ziliu said today that he hoped the central authorities could 
suspend enforcing the value-added land tax law. Moreover, he 
argued that with different situations in all localities, the 
central authorities should grant local authorities more 
flexibility on the question of handling the land tax given the 
premise of resolutely enforcing decrees. 
  This morning, Li Ziliu delivered a speech as an NPC deputy 
at 
a meeting of the Guangdong delegation. He said the question of 
collecting the land tax is still subject to great debate. He 
maintained that if the question is handled improperly, it would 
affect the mainland's economic development and dampen the 
investment intentions of foreign businesses. 
  NPC Deputy Li Ziliu said: It would be best if the land tax 
was postponed for two to three years to ensure the continuity of 
the relevant policies. If the measure has to be implemented 
immediately, then the current tax value ration should be 
carefully considered. Since the land tax is a local tax 
category, it is inadvisable to impose uniformity on all 
localities in light of differences between them. The central 
authorities should grant some flexibility to the localities so 
they can handle different land tax values in a flexible way. 
  Moreover, Li Ziliu also talked about the pressures on 
Guangzhou from large numbers of migrants. He said that the 
migrant population in Guangzhou is estimated to reach more than 
1.7 million, which is creating very great pressure on 
Guangzhou's public order, employment, and other aspects. He 
suggested that the State Council should set up population 
management organizations to coordinate the number of migrants in 
various localities. 
  Speaking on Guangzhou's future economic development, he held 
that it is a policy mistake when a place cannot develop faster 
when it is in a position to do so and should do so. He said 
that Guangzhou is now open in all directions; should act boldly 
with respect to capital, technology, and manpower; should boldly 
"make concessions in regard to markets, shares, and interests"; 
and protect foreign investment.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Tax revenues in 
southern China's Guangdong Province have been going up this year 
as its steady economic growth goes on and with the new taxation 
system which became effective on January 1. 
  This was revealed by a recent provincial taxation 
conference. 
  The province has benefited most from the country's 
opening-up 
policy and reforms since the early 1980s and it has enjoyed 
increasing economic development as well as steady tax and 
revenue growth. 
  Under the new taxation system, taxes are classified and 
collected separately by the central and local governments, 
ensuring that both have stable income sources, with the central 
government gaining a larger share of increased incomes. 
  Last year, the province's total taxation revenue reached 
36.3 
billion yuan, the highest in the country. But its contribution 
to the central government in 1993 amounted to less than six 
percent of the province's revenues. 
  Under the new tax revenue-sharing system, 70 percent of 
increased revenues collected by the provincial government are to 
go to the central government. This means that the province's 
contribution this year will be many times the 2 billion yuan 
(230 million U.S. dollars) handed over the previous year. 
  But leaders at all levels of the province have worked hard 
to 
support the new taxation system in spite of the extra payments 
to Beijing under the new system. 
  By this February, the province's total industrial output 
value had jumped to 54.83 billion yuan, up 19.7 percent on the 
same period last year, and retail sales to 259.2 billion yuan, 
up 32.8 percent. 
  A total of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment 
had also been used, an increase of 47 percent over the same 
period the previous year. 
  The province's tax revenues steadily rose alongside these 
increases. By March 10, this year, the province had collected 
altogether 7.6 billion yuan in taxes from its industry and 
commerce, an increase of 2.11 billion yuan (38.5 percent) over 
the same period last year. 
  In contrast, the province's price hikes showed signs of 
rising less fast: it stood at 18.3 percent in January, 4.1 
percentage points lower than the previous month.

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang 
[KMT] reshuffled the party leadership Wednesday [23 March] for 
the second time in less than a week. 
  The party's [word indistinct] decision-making Central 
Standing Committee at a regular meeting endorsed a proposal that 
James Chu, director of the party's Cultural Affairs Department, 
be promoted to deputy secretary-general. 
  The post vacated by Chu will be filled by Chien Han-sun, now 
the chairman of the KMT Taipei Municipal Committee, and Chien 
will be succeeded by Tiao You-ping, secretary-general of the 
Taipei city government. 
  The KMT also appointed Wu Wan-lan, deputy director of the 
China Youth Corps, the director of the party's Social Affairs 
Department, to replace Chung Jung-chi, who was elevated to the 
post of chairman of the KMT provincial committee after Tu Te-chi 
stepped down last week to placate widespread anger over the 
vote-buying scandal surrounding the March 1 elections for 
speakers and deputy speakers of 21 city and county councils. 
  Local newspapers reported that KMT Secretary-General Hu 
Shui-the started planning the reshuffle soon after his return 
from the Philippines Monday evening. 
  A party worker who requested anonymity said the appointments 
of Tsao and Wu had surprised many party members because neither 
of the two men has held a position in the party before. 
  Chien said at a press conference following the meeting that 
he would dedicate himself to communicating with other political 
parties, "so as to help promote Taiwan's party politics."

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- The second of the eight 
Perry class frigates ordered by the Republic of China [ROC] Navy 
is scheduled to be delivered on Monday [28 March], the China 
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) announced Wednesday. 
  Construction of the frigate, named "Cheng Ho" after a noted 
Ching Dynasty admiral, began on Dec. 21, 1990, and the vessel 
was launched in September 1992. "The ship will be delivered to 
the Navy about five weeks ahead of schedule," a CSBC official 
said. 
  Construction of three other such warships are under way at 
the CSBC's Kaohsiung shipyard, and the last one is scheduled to 
be delivered to the Navy in 1999. 
  The first of the frigates, which are modeled on the US 
Perry- 
class frigates, went into service last May. The 4,200-ton 
frigates have a cruising speed of 27.5 nautical miles per hour, 
according to the CSBC. 
  The ships will be armed with locally-manufactured 
Hsiung-Feng 
ship-to-ship missiles, US standard ship-to-air missiles, [word 
indistinct] submarine torpedoes, and phalanx weapons systems 
built by the General Dynamics Corp. of the United States. The 
weapons system uses a closed-loop radar to spot and track enemy 
missiles and to direct fire from an M-61A1 Gatling gun capable 
of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. In addition, the vessels 
will carry anti- submarine helicopters. 
  The eight vessels, which will eventually cost the Navy more 
than NT$40 billion (US$1.5 billion), are to replace part of the 
Navy's aging fleet. The Navy had 24 destroyers and nine 
frigates as of [word indistinct], according to the International 
Institute for Strategic Studies. 
  The ROC also agreed on a US$4.8 billion deal in 1991 to buy 
16 Lafayette-class frigates from France.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (AFP)--An official report has 
painted an alarming picture of the social challenges facing the 
government this year, warning of a potentially explosive mix of 
inflation, unrest in the fields and factories, and ethnic 
discord. "The authorities are going to have to face very 
serious social tests," the 300-page report by the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences, acquired by AFP, says. The document 
starkly illustrates the worries exercising the communist 
leadership as it grapples with ambitious reforms to transform 
the economy. 
  President Jiang Zemin rammed home the dual message on 
Tuesday, instructing officials to "protect reforms while 
preserving stability" in everything they do. 
  The report, entitled "The Social Situation in China, 1993-4: 
Analyses and Forecasts," looks back on a year of growing 
fragility in Chinese society, as it struggled to cope with 
double-digit economic growth. 
  It confirmed independent reports of unrest in 
Moslem-minority 
regions in western China, the scenes of "the bloodiest unrest" 
in the country in 1993. In May, riots broke out in Kashgar, in 
the autonomous region of Xinjiang, where "separatists carried 
out terrorist acts, causing explosions, and put up reactionary 
posters," it said. In late August and early September, 
"hundreds of thousands of Muslims demonstrated" in western 
China, the academics said. 
  On the industrial front, "strikes and demonstrations 
increased," it said, disclosing that there had been 30 "serious 
incidents" at plants in the eastern city of Ningbo in May alone. 
  As for the cause of the discontent, the report pinned the 
blame on the strains experienced by state firms as they 
struggled with the adjustment to capitalist economics. "More 
and more workers cannot have a normal live because of the 
financial difficulties of state firms," it said, estimating that 
seven million working-class families were living in hardship, 
equal to around 20 million people in all. 
  Turning to 1994, the Academy said that inflation -- 
currently 
running at around 20 percent in the cities -- was "already more 
than alarming. Elements of social instability will increase 
further as economic reforms deepen," it predicted. "The 
possibility of serious unrest in regions experiencing economic 
difficulties cannot be ruled out," the report said, predicting 
an ever-widening rift between the rich eastern coastal provinces 
and the backward regions of the west. 
  Factories would experience greater tension, as there is 
bound 
to be "more unemployed workers, strikes and violence against 
plant officials." The document added that "friction is 
inevitable" between the central government and the regional 
authorities, which would fuel regionalism. A Chinese think-tank 
last year also cited this as a potential cause of a breakup 
after the death of 89-year-old leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  "Numerous acts of sabotage by hostile forces, inside and 
outside the country" could be feared, the report said, making an 
implicit reference to Islamic fundamentalists and Tibetans. 
  Crime, which surged last year, would continue to rise. 
  It called on the government to apply "social measures as 
well 
as economic reforms" not only by attacking basic problems but 
also by stepping up police efficiency and the campaign against 
corruption. 
  But it notably also made a public call on the country's top 
leaders to show greater transparency in their lifestyle and also 
to "listen to public opinion."

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Chinese officials have privately hinted at the 
possibility of more political prisoner releases and have also 
said that other differences with the U.S. over human rights 
could be resolved, according to Hong Kong-based human rights 
activist John Kamm. He said after meetings with State Council, 
Public Security and Supreme Court officials in Beijing, he was 
"reasonably confident there will be some moves in the next few 
weeks". 
  His talks with officials are the first indication that 
despite the tough human rights stance taken by China since the 
visit of American Secretary of State Warren Christopher this 
month, the Chinese leadership might be willing to make 
concessions quietly. 
  Mr Kamm said while Chinese officials repeated the line that 
they were prepared to lose the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) 
status, they were at pains to note prisoners who are sick, or 
who show a good attitude can be released in accordance with 
Chinese laws. They also said other human rights issues could be 
resolved with the United States through discussions based on 
mutual respect. 
  While this is far from a guarantee China will make the 
"significant progress" on human rights required by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton for MFN renewal, Mr Kamm said he was 
encouraged. "They're clearly committed to continuing the 
dialogue on human rights," Mr Kamm said. 
  As proof of that, he noted that all officials he requested 
to 
meet on this trip have agreed to speak to him "I think we'll see 
releases of sick prisoners and others," Mr Kamm said. But he 
added: "I was led to believe such moves could not be made 
immediately after the visit" of Mr Christopher. 
  In stating that Chinese law left room for prisoner releases 
based on humanitarian concerns or signs of good attitude, the 
officials tried to make clear that "we will no do these things 
because of American pressure, but be cause they are in 
accordance with the law," Mr Kamm said. No names or numbers of 
prisoners were discussed but Mr Kamm expects to go over a name 
list with Justice Ministry officials today. 
  Meanwhile, sources in the Chinese dissident community said 
the authorities had not decided whether to take "resolute 
action" against a number of activists who they believed would 
organise protest actions in the run-up to the fifth anniversary 
of the June 4, 1989, crackdown. 
  The sources said aside from the fear of fanning anti-MFN 
sentiment in the U.S. Congress, the authorities were worried 
that an excessive number of arrests would help galvanise the 
dissident movement. 
  In the past month, different groups have sent private 
letters 
to leaders demanding reforms including an end to the 
incarceration of citizens without recourse to the judicial 
process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese </F>
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National 
Committee, by unidentified RENMIN RIBAO reporter in Beijing; 
date not given: "Suiting the New Situation, Exploring a New 
Path, Making Fresh Contributions"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (RENMIN RIBAO)--[RENMIN RIBAO] As 
far as I know, to meet the needs of the new situation and the 
new tasks of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, 
the Eighth National Committee of the CPPCC has energetically 
carried out fruitful explorations over the past year. Please 
tell me about the status of this effort. 
  [Wu] Faced with the constantly developing reform, opening 
up, and socialist modernization, everybody has a sense of 
urgency, and the CPPCC is no exception. How to duly give play 
to its role as an organization of the most extensive patriotic 
united front of the Chinese people and an important organ of 
multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and 
political consultation in developing the socialist market 
economy, promoting the building of socialist democracy, 
deepening reform, and safeguarding social stability is an 
important task before the CPPCC. In the past year, under the 
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as its core, the CPPCC National Committee has seriously summed 
up the past work of several CPPCC National Committees and, on 
this basis, has energetically explored a new path for the work 
of the CPPCC under the new situation. As pointed out by 
Chairman Li Ruihuan: The new situation and the new tasks have 
set new demands on the CPPCC. The new CPPCC National Committee 
should always take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guideline, should 
gain a thorough understanding of the important position and role 
of the CPPCC in the new period, should keep abreast of the new 
situation, should explore a new path, and should make new 
contributions. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] How do you, as a vice chairman of the CPPCC, 
assess the work of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee over the 
past year? 
  [Wu] The Eighth CPPCC National Committee has made a good 
start in this first year. New progress has been made in all 
kinds of work. Many personalities at home and in the 
international community have gained a fresh understanding of the 
CPPCC, and people have begun to attach importance to and pay 
attention to the activities and role of the current CPPCC 
National Committee. All this has created favorable conditions 
for the further development of the CPPCC. It should be said 
that this is the outcome of the concerted efforts of all CPPCC 
units involved and all CPPCC members. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Please detail the new characteristics of the 
CPPCC's work over the past year. 
  [Wu] First of all, the understanding and activities of the 
Standing Committee in discussing and taking part in state 
affairs have been strengthened. Meetings of the CPPCC National 
Committee Standing Committee are the main form for fulfilling 
the duties of political consultation and democratic supervision 
during the adjournment of the plenary sessions and represent an 
important channel for various democratic parties, non-party 
democrats, various people's organizations, and personalities of 
various nationalities and circles to discuss and take part in 
state affairs. Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee 
held five Standing Committee meetings for consultation and 
discussion about the economic situation of the country and the 
measures to be taken, the international situation, establishing 
the socialist market economic structure, strengthening the 
building of honest administration in state organs, punishing 
corruption, and so on. Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, Wei 
Jianxing, and other leading comrades of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council attended the meetings, made 
reports, and took part in the consultations. With a patriotic 
heart toward the state and the people, the members of the 
Standing Committee opened their minds, frankly aired their 
views, contributed excellent measures, and put forward good 
suggestions and proposals. We seriously put these suggestions 
and proposals in order and reported to the relevant departments 
in good time. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
attached importance to the suggestions and proposals. 
  Second, the role of the special committees have been 
strengthened further. The CPPCC special committees are working 
organs for organizing the CPPCC members to carry out regular 
activities and are basic links for fulfilling the duties of 
political consultation and democratic supervision and for doing 
a good job in discussing and participating in state affairs. 
Over the past year, the planning, standardization, timeliness, 
and effectiveness of the work of various special committees have 
been markedly improved, and the initiative and enthusiasm of 
CPPCC members have been further brought into play. Many 
investigation reports provided by the special committees have 
produced good economic results and social benefits. 
  Third, guidance to and cooperation with local CPPCC organs 
have been strengthened to a certain extent. There are 
altogether 3,041 local CPPCC organs with 460,000 members at 
various levels. Closing ties between the CPPCC National 
Committee and the local CPPCC organs is conducive to giving play 
to the strong points of the CPPCC as a whole in jointly 
promoting the development of the CPPCC's cause. Over the past 
year, the CPPCC National Committee has attached importance to 
its ties and cooperation with local CPPCC organs. For example, 
in making study tours of various localities, main leaders of the 
CPPCC National Committee have, without exception, "visited CPPCC 
organs, met CPPCC members, and discussed matters concerning the 
CPPCC"; some special committees have held informal discussions 
on common issues in work and have carried out joint 
investigations and study on some important issues. 
  Fourth, the work of improving organs has been strengthened. 
Over the past year, we have paid attention to strengthening 
work to improve the ideology and work style of the CPPCC organs. 
Everybody has worked hard to bring about the good common 
practice of energetically making progress, stressing efficiency, 
unity, cooperation, honesty, and of being realistic. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] Over the past year, the CPPCC National 
Committee has carried out relatively active friendly exchanges 
with foreign countries. Can you tell me something about this 
situation? 
  [Wu] The CPPCC National Committee's exchanges with foreign 
countries are an important part of China's diplomacy. In 
exchanges with foreign countries, the National Committee can 
give play to its special strength of being both "an official and 
a popular" organization. It can have high-level contacts with 
parliaments of various countries and can also establish ties 
with popular organizations. Since the First Session of the 
Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the CPPCC National Committee 
has energetically widened the scope of its exchanges with 
foreign countries and has developed activities with foreign 
countries. From the end of November to the beginning of last 
December, Chairman Li Ruihuan made an official friendly visit to 
three Southeast Asian countries and achieved complete success. 
Besides, Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Seypidin Aze, Hong Xuezhi, 
Hu Sheng, Qian Weichang, Sun Fuling, and myself also visited 
some countries one after another. In the past year, the CPPCC 
National Committee has also played host to delegations from some 
countries.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
presented the country's highest annual national scientific and 
technological awards to 4,484 scientists and technical experts 
here today. 
  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng met 
representatives 
of the award-winning scientists before the ceremony. The award 
winners, including nine scientists from Hong Kong and foreign 
countries, had between them completed 781 scientific and 
technological projects for the country in 1993. 
  Congratulating the scientists, Jiang said that he hoped the 
scientists will spread the seed of science and technology 
throughout the country and make yet greater contributions to the 
country's economic development and social progress. 
  He said Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking of making science 
and technology the driving force behind production is the 
guiding principle for developing the country's science and 
technology and the national economy as a whole," the president 
said. 
  Jiang asked the scientists to pay close attention to applied 
research and development research while keeping a necessary 
contingent in basic sciences. 
  He said, "the practice of reform and development needs a 
correct theory and rich knowledge." He also urged officials at 
all levels to gain more knowledge of modern science and 
technology, and make new and realistic contribution to the 
country's modernization. 
  The national science and technology awards include natural 
sciences awards, invention awards, science and technology 
progress awards and spark awards. 
  According to professor Zhu Lilan, vice-minister in charge of 
the State Science and Technology Commission, the prize-winning 
projects of 1993 have produced an estimated economic result of 
21.3 billion yuan (2.45 billion U.S. dollars). 
  Projects associated with key industries in the nation's 
economic development plan outnumbered the others in the winners' 
list. 
  The winning projects are concerned with industries and 
transport, agriculture, education, medicine and basic scientific 
research. 
  One project was on research to make pandas give birth to 
twins, conducted by the animal institute of the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences and other research institutes in Chengdu, Sichuan 
Province. 
  Another winner was research into Jurassic dinosaurs in 
Sichuan mountain regions, conducted by the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences and Chengdu Geology College.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (XINHUA) -- The rural work 
conference of the CPC Central Committee opened here today. The 
conference clearly and definitely pointed out that the basic 
tasks of China's agriculture and rural work this year are to 
work under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line; seriously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the October 1993 
central rural work conference; stabilize the party's basic rural 
policies, deepen rural economic structure, and raise the 
comprehensive agricultural productivity; promote economic 
development, increase the incomes of peasants, and social 
stability in rural areas; and create a good economic environment 
and stable social environment to facilitate smooth proceeding of 
major reforms and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee 
and Chinese president, and Li Peng, member of the Standing 
Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
premier, delivered important speeches at the meeting. Present 
at the meeting were other members of the Standing Committee of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Qiao Shi, Li 
Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao. Zhu Rongji, also a member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau, presided over and addressed the meeting. 
  Other attending were Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, 
Zou Jiahua, Chen Xitong, Jiang Chunyun, Qian Qichen, Wei 
Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin, Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Li 
Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Ismail Amat, Peng Peiyun, and Luo Gan; 
the principal people in charge of the party committees and 
governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities, and cities with provincial-level economic 
decision-making authority; and people in charge of departments 
concerned under the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. 
The central topic for discussion at the meeting was arranging 
this year's agricultural production and rural work. The meeting 
called on party committees and government departments at all 
levels to further strengthen their leadership over agriculture 
and rural work, implement the policy measures put forward by 
last year's central rural work conference, and particularly pay 
attention to the production of grain, cotton and oil-bearing 
crops and to the "vegetable basket" project and strive for good 
agricultural harvests this year. 
  In his speech, Jiang Zemin first discussed the emphasis of 
the party's work and present realities in rural areas. He 
explained the purposes of the conference and why it was being 
held less than six months after the last central rural work 
conference. He said: Agriculture and work in rural areas are 
very important to the implementation of the basic principles for 
this year's work set by the central committee, and to the good 
management of relations between reform, development and 
stability. This year is an important year in setting up a 
socialist market economic structure, because we are also 
carrying out reforms in finance, taxation, banking, investment, 
and foreign trade. The smooth implementation of reform needs a 
good economic environment and a stable social environment; and 
it especially needs stability and development of agriculture and 
the rural economy. The key to ensuring supplies and curbing 
inflation lies in doing a good job in grain and non-staple food 
production. Stability in rural areas and a strong agricultural 
base will ensure stability in the country, smooth reforms, and 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
  Jiang Zemin said: The general situation in rural areas is 
good, but there are some relatively urgent problems, including a 
decline in grain output in south China, two consecutive years of 
reduction in cotton production, remarkable rises in the prices 
of non-staple foods, and the slow growth of peasants' incomes. 
In view of this, the central committee deems it necessary to 
make further arrangements for agriculture and rural work. 
  In the second part of his speech Jiang Zemin explicitly 
defined the basic agricultural and rural tasks for 1994. He 
also stressed the need to concentrate on the following current 
tasks: 
  First, we must ensure the production and supply of grain, 
cotton, oil-bearing crops, and vegetables. He said that with a 
population of nearly 1.2 billion people, China had to achieve 
self-sufficiency in grain and a basic balance between supply and 
demand. He called on all provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities directly under the central government to conduct 
a careful investigation and analysis of the production and 
supply of grain in their respective areas, make a thorough check 
of current grain stockpiles in their granaries, and make plans 
to maintain grain growing acreage and to increase per-unit 
yields this year. Not only must major grain- producing areas do 
this, but developed coastal areas must also strive to stabilize 
their grain planting acreage, production, and stockpiles. It is 
necessary to deepen reform of the grain purchasing and marketing 
system and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control to 
ensure that grain sources are under the control of the state. 
Cotton-producing areas should concentrate on cotton production. 
Suburban areas in large and medium cities should carry out the 
"vegetable basket" project successfully in order to guarantee 
the production and supply of non-staple food. It is necessary 
to carefully study and to solve, step by step, the problem of 
the widening gap between the prices of agricultural and 
industrial products so as to encourage farmers to grow grain and 
cotton. 
  Second, it is necessary to develop all sectors of the rural 
economy to increase the income of farmers. Jiang Zemin said 
considerably increasing the income of farmers together with the 
development of production constitutes an important and difficult 
mission in China's agricultural and rural work this year. We 
must, therefore, give equal importance to increasing the income 
of farmers and ensuring an effective supply of farm produce. We 
must steadily and vigorously readjust the industrial setup in 
rural areas by developing farming which stresses high yields, 
high quality, and high efficiency and by developing a 
diversified economy as well as town and village enterprises on 
the basis of guaranteeing a steady increase in the output of 
grain, cotton, and other major farm produce. 
  Third, it is necessary to maintain social stability in rural 
areas. Jiang Zemin called on leading cadres at all levels to 
work conscientiously in discharging their duties so as to 
promptly handle hot issues strongly reflected by the masses: 
  -- Resolutely reduce the burden of farmers. Resolute 
measures should be taken to ensure that no one is allowed to 
continue collecting fees or charges which have been abolished by 
order of the central authorities; no one is allowed to continue 
increasing quotas, which have been abolished by order of the 
central authorities; this year no one is allowed to collect 
money from farmers, and any one who arbitrarily collects money 
from farmers will be made accountable; resolute measures must be 
taken to ban indiscriminate fund-raising, indiscriminate 
collection of fees or charges, and indiscriminate levying of 
fines. 
  -- Effectively improve the comprehensive management of 
public 
security in rural areas. The principal party and government 
leaders in all areas should conscientiously assume 
responsibility to ensure security in rural areas by resolutely 
cracking down on criminal activities, improving the quality of 
judicial and public security personnel, strengthening 
discipline, and enforcing the law. 
  -- Resolutely check unhealthy practices in the party and in 
society which the masses have strongly criticized. Effective 
measures should be taken to stop unhealthy practices such as 
feasting and wining, squandering public money, abusing power to 
carry out extortion, and indulging in boasting by making false 
reports, all of which have been strongly criticized by the 
masses. 
  -- Conscientiously do a good job in assisting poor areas. It 
is necessary to mobilize and organize the masses in impoverished 
areas, disaster-stricken areas, and reservoir areas where the 
residents must be evacuated to free themselves from poverty and 
become better- off by developing production to help themselves. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed the need to resolutely implement the 
principle of "grasping two links simultaneously and attaching 
importance to both" in order to maintain stability in rural 
areas. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen basic-level 
organizations in rural areas. Particular attention should be 
focused on building party branches with the emphasis on 
selecting their secretaries, on building village committees with 
the emphasis on setting up a democratic management system, on 
building village collective economic organizations with the 
emphasis on serving peasant households in a better way, and on 
building youth, women's, and militia organizations. 
  In the third part of his speech, Jiang Zemin focused on how 
to further strengthen the party's leadership over agriculture 
and rural work. He said whether we truly put agriculture at the 
top of the list in guiding our entire economic work is an 
important test of whether we truly regard economic construction 
as the central task. He urged party committees and governments 
at all levels to correctly handle the relationship between 
agricultural and industrial development, and, while ensuring 
sustained and steady agricultural growth, to decide an 
appropriate scale and speed for economic development and the 
proper percentages of funds for primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries. He said China should ensure the needs of 
agricultural development even if it meant fewer projects were 
launched. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: We should unwaveringly carry out the 
policies and measures adopted by the party central committee and 
State Council on stepping up agricultural and rural work. Some 
policies and measures adopted last year have not been carried 
out. Central and local departments at all levels should take 
immediate action to inspect work at every level and carry out 
these policies and measures -- under no circumstances should we 
miss this opportunity. 
  Jiang Zemin emphatically stressed: Party committees of 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must use a 
large portion of their energy on rural work, and prefectural and 
county party committees must put their efforts primarily into 
rural work. In particular, major leaders of party committees at 
all levels should personally get involved in and fully ensure 
that all rural work this year is properly carried out. We 
should use the performance of major leading cadres at all levels 
in agricultural and rural work as an important criterion for 
evaluating their overall performance. Party and government 
cadres at all levels should further improve their work style and 
method. After this meeting ends, major comrades in charge of 
the party committees and governments of all provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities should conduct in-depth 
investigations and studies in rural areas, listen with an open 
mind to the views and wishes of grass-roots cadres and the 
masses, gain a clear idea of how the policies and measures of 
the central authorities have been carried out, have a good 
understanding of the major problems in rural reform and 
development, and seek effective ways to solve these problems. 
Based on this, they should lay down a practical plan for this 
year's agricultural and rural work in their localities. 
  In his speech, Li Peng first analyzed the current rural 
situation and explained the importance of doing good rural work 
this year. He said: The better the situation is, the more 
leading cadres at all levels should stay cool-headed. We should 
not relax for a moment in doing this year's rural work. 
Practice over the years has proved that whenever agriculture 
develops well and the rural situation is stable, the whole of 
society is comparatively stable and reform and development can 
be carried out in a comparatively smooth manner. China has a 
rural population of 900 million; it is the key to maintaining 
social stability. Agriculture affects the national economy and 
people's livelihood; the production and supply of agricultural 
products have direct effects on price stability; price 
stability, to a high degree, depends on whether the supply of 
agricultural products is ample. Li Peng stressed that leading 
cadres at all levels must have a clearer idea of the importance 
and urgency of this year's rural work, should firm up their 
confidence, overcome difficulties, and strive to reap a good 
agricultural harvest this year, especially of grain and cotton. 
  Li Peng said: The major rural work for this year is: First, 
we should strive to ensure a steady agricultural growth and an 
effective supply of agricultural and sideline products; second, 
we should increase the incomes of peasants and strive to meet 
the average annual increase target set in the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan; third, we should properly solve acute problems in rural 
areas to ensure rural social stability. He said: To put it 
specifically, we should ensure success in our work in the 
following 10 areas: 
  -- It is necessary to maintain the acreage available for 
grain, cotton and vegetable production. Stabilization of 
farmland is a basic condition for achieving the goals of 
stabilizing grain output, increasing cotton output, and 
enriching the "vegetable basket." In northern China, the grain 
growing area should be increased; in southern and coastal 
economic developed areas, the growing area for grain should be 
increased by a large proportion. We must maintain the 
availability of farmland for cotton and vegetable production 
this year, and the wanton use of vegetable gardens for other 
purposes should be strictly forbidden. When other use of a 
vegetable garden is unavoidable, we must create new vegetable 
gardens before existing vegetable gardens can be used for 
construction purposes. 
  -- We must raise procurement prices for grain and cotton to 
whip up the enthusiasm of peasants for production. 
  -- We must ensure the supply of agricultural means of 
production and control their prices. We should do a seriously 
good job in agricultural production, transportation, and the 
marketing of agricultural means of production; strengthen 
administration of the market for agricultural means of 
production and crack down on fake and shoddy products; and 
encourage direct procurement and sales between production 
enterprises and farm operators to reduce middle links and 
circulation costs. We must strictly control the prices of 
agricultural means of production. 
  -- We must promote the use of agricultural science and 
technology, and strengthen the training of agricultural 
technicians. Counties and townships should stabilize 
organizations which promote agricultural science and technology, 
take effective measures to increase the number of agricultural 
technicians, and increase funding for the promotion of science 
and technology. We must also do a good job in developing 
education in rural areas. 
  -- The state should control adequate grain sources. This is 
a basic condition for ensuring the supply of food grain to the 
market and keeping prices relatively stable. In addition to 
raising the procurement price of food grain and encouraging 
peasants to sell their products to state grain departments, the 
state should control wholesale markets and play a guiding role 
in the retail selling of food grain. We should continue to 
improve the grain market, establish a market system with 
emphasis on the wholesale market, advocate and support 
large-scale trade of food grain among various regions, and 
maintain the normal operation of urban and rural trade fairs. 
  -- We must reform the procurement and marketing system for 
food grain and set up grain risk funds. We should establish an 
independent state adjustment center for grain reserves. The 
scale of the reserves should be maintained at an appropriate 
level to allow for prompt adjustment of the grain supply. Both 
the central authorities and localities should set up grain risk 
funds which should be included in the central and local budgets. 
  -- We must increase investment in agriculture. We should 
increase the proportion of agriculture in state capital 
construction investment, state budgets, and loan funds. 
Starting this year, the rate of increase agricultural funds 
must not be lower than the rate of increase for revenue. We 
should seriously grasp the building of 500 key commercial grain 
counties and 100 fine cotton producing counties, and establish 
demonstration centers for efficient agricultural production with 
high yield and fine quality. 
  -- We must promote continuous and sound development of 
village and town enterprises. In long-term development, we must 
rely on the development of village and town enterprises to raise 
income levels for peasants, shift surplus workers in rural 
areas, and reasonably settle "migrant workers." At present, we 
should guide village and town enterprises to improve their 
production structure, improve quality, and raise management 
levels and economic efficiency. We should encourage the 
development of village and town enterprises in concentrated and 
adjacent areas, leading to the development of towns and small 
cities. We should provide specific guidance for village and 
town enterprises in different areas and at different levels of 
development. We should encourage village and town enterprises 
in eastern coastal areas to further raise quality, expand the 
scale of production, and develop high-tech and export-oriented 
products. In central and western regions and minority areas, we 
should suit measures to local conditions, give full play to the 
advantages of local resources and labor force, and explore 
effective ways to speed up the development of village and town 
enterprises there. Increased State Council loans for village 
and town enterprises in central and western regions and minority 
areas must be guaranteed in both scale and amount. 
  -- We must improve conditions for agricultural production 
and enhance the overall farming capability. Great efforts 
should be made to launch irrigation and water conservation 
projects to increase effective irrigation acreage. While 
striving to take drought-prevention measures, we should also 
make every preparation to prevent floods. We must persist in 
overall agricultural development and strive to improve low and 
medium yield farmland. We should accelerate afforestation and 
major ecological projects. 
  -- We must properly solve hot issues in rural areas to 
maintain social stability there. 
  Li Peng said emphatically: Now that the tasks and action for 
agricultural and rural economic development have been defined, 
the crucial point is how they should be carried out. He 
continued: Governments at all levels should carry out the 
responsibility system in their rural work. They should have a 
sense of urgency, enhance work efficiency, and conscientiously, 
responsibly, and actively implement these policies and measures. 
  Li Peng reaffirmed: In supporting agricultural and rural 
economic development, the State Council as well as relevant 
ministries and commissions, should be responsible for the 
realization of any policies and measures introduced by the 
central authorities; local governments should resolutely carry 
out the measures adopted by them at the request of the central 
authorities; and local governments at all levels should 
guarantee to carry out the policies and measures formulated by 
themselves. 
  Li Peng stressed: Governors of provinces (chairmen of 
autonomous regions and mayors of municipalities) should bear 
responsibility for the supply of grain and edible oil for areas 
under their jurisdiction. Mayors of large and medium cities 
should be responsible for the supply of non-staple foods. They 
should knuckle down to their duties in carrying out the 
"vegetable basket" project, which is listed as one of their job 
responsibilities. Their work performance should be checked 
annually and reported to the people's congress and to the people 
of their cities. 
  The meeting pointed out that, under the guidance of Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the basic line of the CPC, party committees 
and governments at all levels as well as the State Council and 
all relevant departments, should work together with one will and 
conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of this meeting, so 
as to achieve new success in this year's agricultural and rural 
economic work.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Chen Jinhua, minister 
in charge of China's State Planning Commission, said here today 
that China is giving priority to the development of energy 
industry in drafting its next five-year plan -- the ninth -- and 
a long-term industrial policy. 
  Speaking today at a China petroleum investment conference 
being held here, he said that in the medium to long-term plan, 
China will "take coal as the basis and electric power the focus 
in developing energy resources." 
  At the same time, he said, it is necessary to make great 
efforts to develop fine quality, relatively clean energy sources 
such as oil and natural gas. 
  More than 300 world oil leaders, senior executives, bankers 
and experts attended the two-day conference, the highest ranking 
of its kind so far held in China. 
  Chen said that in order to ensure an average annual growth 
rate of 8-9 percent for China's national economy in the 1990s, 
developing and conserving energy should be equally stressed. 
  By maintaining the energy saving rate at the average annual 
level of 3.6 percent during the 1980s, China's annual energy 
consumption increase in the coming years will be kept below 4 
percent, he added. 
  The minister said that by the year 2000, China is expected 
to 
produce 160-170 million tons of oil and some 30 billion cubic 
meters of natural gas. Last year the production of oil was 150 
million tons and that of natural gas was 16 billion cubic meters. 
  Meanwhile, Chen said, China's electric power output is 
continuing to grow at an average annual rate of more than 8 
percent in the 1990s, with power generating capacity increasing 
by about 15 million kilowatts each year. 
  He pledged that the government will help create a more 
favorable climate for the development of the energy industry 
through deepened reforms and greater openness. 
  China has lifted controls over coal pricing and is adjusting 
the prices of electric power to ensure a reasonable return for 
investors. The prices of oil and natural gas will be gradually 
brought in line with those on the international markets. 
  Chen said that state-owned large and medium-sized energy 
enterprises, the main body of China's energy industry, should be 
introduced to the modern corporate system through a change-over 
of the management mechanism, in order to develop even better in 
a market economy. 
  He said that state development banks will grant preferential 
loans to accelerate the construction of the energy industry. In 
addition, he said, initiatives should be taken to attract local 
funds and socially idle funds to energy investment, by forming 
joint ventures and share-holding companies. 
  He said that the Chinese Government will continue to 
encourage and support the energy industry to open wider to the 
outside world and welcomes international investors to enter 
fields such as onshore oil, offshore oil, petrochemicals, 
electric power and coal. 
  The participants discussed issues concerning joint and 
cooperative exploration of China's oil and natural gas resources 
and voiced their views at the forum aimed to increase 
understanding and exchange information. 
  The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and 
China's four oil and petrochemical giants, ended here today.

  [Text] Seven areas and five provinces and regions 
including Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Tibet, Chengdu, and 
Chongqing are making concerted efforts to acquire and exploit 
markets, so that the vast southwestern region can advance with 
giant strides toward the new socialist market system. 
  The southwestern region is one of the regions in our country 
having the greatest potential for economic development. 
However, in the early 1980's its per capita gross industrial 
and agricultural production output value was 320 yuan less than 
other parts of the country. Since the establishment of 
southwestern economic cooperation in early 1984, the vast 
southwestern region has made great achievements in jointly 
acquiring and exploiting markets. In 1993, gross industrial and 
agricultural production output value of the region was more than 
230 percent higher than 10 years ago. At present, southwestern 
region has become one of the regions in China whose economic 
development is most active. 
  Over the past 10 years, the five provinces and regions and 
seven areas have removed restrictions and customs barriers, and 
opened up their markets to one another. They have cooperated in 
more than 6,000 economic projects of all kinds. In the 
transport and telecommunications field, they made joint 
investments of more than 200 million yuan to build 49 
interprovincial and interregional highways, which are 918 
kilometers in length. They have built 40 gigantic bridges or so 
in Sichuan and other places. They have opened up more than 100 
new provincial-level passenger-cargo transportation routes. 
Thanks to the support unanimously provided by various quarters, 
the projects of electrifying the Chendu-Chongqing, 
Guiyang-Kunming, and Chongqing-Guiyang railways have been 
completed ahead of time. Key postal and telecommunications 
projects, microwave communications station projects in important 
cities like Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming and others, and the 
television satellite communication station project in Tibet have 
been brought into operation. Various parties have also made 
great progress in their joint exploitation of resources.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Jia Zhaoquan (6328 2507 0356) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Ma Xiaochun (7456 2556 2504)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking yesterday to 
high- ranking cadres attending a political work meeting and 
reading class on Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, held by the General Staff Department, Zhang 
Wannian, member of the Central Military Commission and chief of 
general staff, stressed: In theoretical studies, we must 
properly handle the issue of political firmness. The most 
important thing is to unite the thoughts of officers and men on 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
the party's basic line, the party's reform principles, and the 
military commission's policies to ensure that they maintain a 
high degree of unanimity with the party Central Committee and 
the Central Military Commissions at all times and under all 
circumstances. 
  Zhang Wannian said: To quicken the establishment of the 
socialist market economic system, the party and state have 
introduced a series of major reform measures. Deepening reform 
and adjusting interest patterns will definitely arouse different 
reactions from society. Only by deepening the study of Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and mastering 
the key to the correct understanding of various issues can we 
profoundly understand the correctness of central policies, thus 
enabling us to properly handle the pattern of interests and 
adjust relations among different interests, particularly when 
reform measures involve the personal interests of some officers 
and men. Further, only through such measures can we keep the 
fundamental interests of the country and people in mind, 
properly handle and take the overall interest into 
consideration, as well as consciously maintain a high degree of 
unanimity with the party Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commissions on ideology and politics. 
  Zhang Wannian asked leading cadres at all levels to stand 
for 
the party and people. He called on them to, through theoretical 
studies, correctly understand domestic and international 
situations, correctly understand and handle various complex 
social phenomena, strenghten their sense of hardship, always 
maintain a sober attitude, firmly remember the army's 
fundamental functions, steadfastly comply with the command of 
the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and contribute to the 
country's reform, opening up, and stability. 
  Zhang Wannian asked military organizations at all levels to 
vigorously cultivate proper work styles. They should strongly 
encourage healthy trends and combat unhealthy work styles by 
conducting education in revolutionary soldiers' professional 
ethics; education in the army's glorious tradition; discipline 
education; and education in anticorruption and clean 
administration. They should strongly promote the work styles of 
attaching importance to the army's cause and downplaying fame 
and wealth; taking overall interest into consideration and 
safeguarding unity; strictly upholding principle and discipline; 
seeking truth from facts and doing pragmatic work; showing 
friendliness and sincerity toward people; practicing fairness 
and uprightness instead of favoritism; and maintaining unanimity 
in thoughts and actions as well as complete openness. They 
should actively struggle against liberalism, individualism, 
hedonism, and money-worship ideologies. It is necessary to 
respond to President Jiang Zemin's call and enthusiastically 
implement activities for emulating heroic soldier Comrade Xu 
Honggang, further carry forward healthy revolutionary trends, 
and cultivate good morality. It is necessary to strengthen 
training in party spirit, establish a revolutionary outlook on 
life and value standards, and create a good environment for 
satisfactorily completing various tasks entrusted by the party 
Central Committee and the Central Military Commissions.

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- A senior officer of 
the Chinese armed forces today called on all the troops of the 
People's Liberation Army (PLA) to increase production of grain 
and non-staple food so as to improve soldiers' living standards 
and increase the forces' combat effectiveness. 
  Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission and 
director of the PLA General Logistics Department, said today at 
an Army-wide telephone conference on agricultural and side-line 
production that the armed forces' farming effort was significant 
in reducing the burdens on the state, subsidizing supplies to 
the Army, improving the soldiers' living standards and promoting 
the reform and building of the Army. 
  He noted that in recent years, great progress had been made 
in the farming by the armed forces. Last year, he added, the 
whole Army produced 650 million kilograms of grain, 225 million 
kilograms of meat, fish and eggs and 600 million kilograms of 
vegetables, with a total value of 700 million yuan. 
  However, Director Fu pointed out, the prices on the market 
have been rising quickly. So there was still a gap between the 
current board expenses of soldiers and the actual need, although 
the Central Military Commission had decided to raise the level 
of the soldiers' board expenses. 
  In order to narrow the gap, Fu stressed, it was necessary to 
make greater efforts to develop agricultural and side-line 
production so as to raise the forces' self-supply abilities. 
  Director Fu called on the leadership of the armed forces at 
all levels to pay closer attention to and strengthen the 
management of agricultural and side-line production, to raise it 
to a higher level.

  [Editorial Report] Following its 22 February editorial 
entitled "The Times Call Upon Heroes, Bring Up Heroes -- On 
Learning From Xu Honggang," from 23 to 27 February JIEFANGJUN 
BAO carried on page one five 1,500-character commentator's 
articles on emulating Xu Honggang. On 7 March JIEFANGJUN BAO 
published on page one a 1,200-character editorial entitled 
"Tremendous Encouragement, Powerful Push," along with the 
handwritten inscriptions of Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Liu Huaqing, 
and Zhang Zhen, calling on people to learn from Xu Honggang. 
  The 23 February article entitled "What Should We Learn From 
Heroes?" urged all Army personnel to emulate Xu Honggang's 
loyalty to the party, the motherland, and the people. It also 
called on them to emulate his outstanding political dedication 
to the Army's and the state's modernization, his spirit of 
carrying forward the party's and Army's fine traditions, serving 
the people wholeheartedly, and sacrificing for all the people's 
interests. It stated that all Army personnel should adopt his 
moral concepts of constantly forging ahead, cherishing the Army 
and mastering military skills, scrupulously performing his 
duties well, earnestly practicing what he advocates, his strong 
sense of responsibility, and his heroic spirit of having the 
courage to do what is right and make sacrifices and dashing 
forward to lend a helping hand when there are difficulties. 
  The 24 February article entitled "Set an Example of Lofty 
Life" called on young people to learn from heroes, take the path 
of maturity which heroes have charted, and strive to become 
people who have lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a 
sense of discipline. The article criticized some young people 
who are influenced by money worship, hedonism, and egoism for 
admiring and favoring "yuan millionaires [da kuan 1129 2949]" 
and taking delight in talking about singers and film stars while 
not having due interest in heroes. 
  The 25 February article entitled "Educate New People With 
Fine Traditions" quoted Chairman Jiang Zemin as saying that Xu 
Honggang's deeds embodied the Communist Party's tradition, the 
old Red Army's tradition, the tradition of the Army cherishing 
the people and the latter supporting the former, and the Chinese 
nation's traditional virtue. To educate new people with fine 
traditions, the commentator pointed out, it is necessary to know 
and master the fine traditions, grasp their core and essence, 
put them into practice, and pass them down, generation after 
generation. The article urged party committees and political 
offices of all troops to effectively carry out the work of 
creating more socialist people like Xu Honggang. 
  The 26 February article entitled "Temper Oneself Into Steel" 
encouraged all Army comrades to foster lofty ideals, a firm 
conviction, and a correct outlook on life and value. It urged 
Army comrades to temper themselves in their own jobs, in 
military training, and in mastery of scientific theory, and to 
strive to become qualified military personnel. 
  The 27 February article entitled "Let Us Sing the Song of 
Unrighteousness" pointed out that the Army shoulders a heavy 
responsibility in safeguarding national security and social 
stability and that all comrades in the Army must have the 
courage to do what is right, regardless of the consequences, in 
wiping out various ugly social phenomena and evil forces and 
safeguarding social stability. 
  On 7 March JIEFANGJUN BAO published an editorial, along with 
handwritten inscriptions by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Liu Huaqing, 
and Chang Zhen on emulating Xu Honggang, calling the 
inscriptions high praise for Comrade Xu Honggang, a tremendous 
encouragement to officers and men of the whole Army, and a 
powerful push in the vigorous drive to learn from Xu Honggang. 
The editorial called on all Army comrades to conscientiously 
respond to the call of the CPC Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commission to emulate Xu Honggang with greater 
enthusiasm, shape a glorious life with lofty ideals, strive to 
be military personnel who have lofty ideals, moral integrity, 
education, and a sense of discipline, make brilliant 
achievements, and usher in the 21th century with a completely 
new ideological outlook.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Lei Feng Spirit Shines Forever"] </F>
  [Text] Thirty-one years ago today, Mao Zedong and other 
proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation called on 
the whole party, the whole army, and people of all nationalities 
throughout the country to learn from Comrade Lei Feng. Since 
then, Lei Feng, as a glorious paragon of the younger generation, 
and the Lei Feng spirit, as an invaluable component of our 
nation's spiritual wealth, have had a profound influence on the 
healthy growth of successive generations of a new type of 
socialist-minded people. Although 31 eventful years have 
passed, the banner of the Lei Feng spirit, as dazzlingly 
brilliant as ever, still encourages and inspires us to bravely 
forge ahead on the road of socialist modernization. 
  Comrade Lei Feng was an outstanding representative of a new 
generation of people who grew up under the nurturing influence 
of our party, Army, and people. He was an advanced model who 
has had the most extensive, enduring, and profound influence in 
the socialist period. In the vast land of China, Lei Feng's 
name is known to all people, including women and children, and 
his ordinary but great deeds have always been widely read and 
emulated by the people. From Ouyang Hai to Wang Jie and Liu 
Yingjun and from Su Ning and Zhu Boru to Xu Honggang, people 
have drawn tremendous spiritual strength from Lei Feng; from 
thousands upon thousands of learn-from-Lei Feng groups -- which 
are active inside and outside the military barracks -- to the 
"Young Volunteers' Action," which are springing up in large 
numbers throughout the country, they all represent the 
development and expansion of the Lei Feng spirit. Over the past 
several decades, Lei Feng's name has been closely linked with 
the image of the People's Army and the advanced strata of 
society, and the Lei Feng spirit has frequently been accompanied 
by the spiritual outlook of striving for progress and by social 
justice and intuitive knowledge. When a worrisome phenomenon 
emerged in general practices in society, people sighed with 
feeling, "Uncle Lei Feng has disappeared," to emphatically show 
their profound longing and call for the Lei Feng spirit. When 
the social outlook showed signs of healthy improvement, the 
people cheered, "Uncle Lei Feng has returned," to fully express 
their heartfelt pleasure and praise at the rise of the Lei Feng 
spirit. A host of vivid facts proves that the Lei Feng spirit 
has come into being and has developed because the people, 
society, and the age require it. 
  Another reason for the great vitality of the Lei Feng spirit 
is that it has heartily embodied the political consciousness, 
lofty moral character, and lifetime goals that all communists 
and revolutionary fighters should have. They are: Always 
listen to the party, unswervingly follow the party, and be loyal 
to the socialist cause; with the "nail spirit" of assiduously 
studying revolutionary theories, strive to master 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; persist in wholeheartedly 
serving the people and devote our limited lifetimes to the 
unlimited cause of serving the people; conscientiously maintain 
hard struggle, a high standard of work, and a low standard of 
living; love whatever jobs we are given, try to be proficient in 
whatever we do, and strive to perform meritorious deeds and 
train ourselves in our work posts, and so on. Shining with the 
radiance of socialist and communist thought, the Lei Feng spirit 
is the fusion of the spirit of the times and the traditional 
virtues of the Chinese nation; it is the concrete embodiment of 
a revolutionary outlook on life and of revolutionary values. As 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Whoever wants to be a true 
communist should learn from Comrade Lei Feng's moral character 
and style." If our officers and men want to become 
revolutionary servicemen with lofty ideals, moral integrity, 
education, and a sense of discipline, they should 
conscientiously learn from the Lei Feng spirit. If our Army 
wants to stand in the front ranks of society in building 
socialist spiritual civilization, it should vigorously promote 
the Lei Feng spirit. 
  Since the beginning of reform and opening up, earthshaking 
great changes have taken place in our country. The situation 
today is indeed vastly different from what it was when Lei Feng 
was alive. However, the Lei Feng spirit is not outdated. While 
engaging in our modernization drive, we have more great needs 
for advanced ideas to arouse our will to fight. This is because 
Lei Feng spirit is completely in tune with the principal melody 
of the times being promoted. Promoting Lei Feng spirit is not 
only needed in building socialist spiritual civilization but 
also provides a powerful spiritual motivating force for building 
socialist material civilization. The modernization drive 
requires Lei Feng spirit which, in turn, also boosts the 
modernization drive. Only by vigorously promoting Lei Feng 
spirit can we firmly act according to the party Central 
Committee's plans and requirements; cultivate an environment of 
public opinion which is favorable to reform; correctly approach 
the adjustment of interests; consciously work under the overall 
situation; resist and oppose the corrosion of money worship, 
pleasure-seeking, ultra-individualism, and other decadent ideas; 
correctly handle the relationships between state, collective, 
and individual interests; ensure the healthy and orderly 
development of the socialist market economy; and observe market 
economic principles, promote socialist styles, and attain the 
goal of common prosperity by exerting ourselves, getting rich 
through hard work, aiding the poor, and waging struggle in 
unity. Therefore, the more we develop the socialist market 
economy, the more we should promote the Lei Feng spirit. Lei 
Feng's deeds are both ordinary and great and the Lei Feng spirit 
is both plain and lofty. Consequently, it is of universal 
significance and it reflects the higher requirements for 
building socialist spiritual civilization. The strategic 
principle for the new period laid down by the military 
commission requires us to conscientiously study and master 
knowledge in modern science and culture, especially in high and 
new science. If we have the Lei Feng spirit, not only will it 
provide us with a powerful spiritual motivating force to scale 
heights in science, culture, and technology, but it will also 
ensure that we apply what we have learned in serving the people 
and the motherland, exerting our utmost strength for Army 
modernization and contributing to the magnificent edifice of 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Far from rejecting it, 
we need the Lei Feng spirit even more while mastering modern 
scientific knowledge and culture. While striving to raise the 
scientific and cultural levels of officers and men and speeding 
up the process of attaining the magnificent objective of 
building a revolutionary, modern, and regular army, we should 
hold still higher the banner of the Lei Feng spirit. 
  All the leading collectives of the three generations, i.e., 
the party Central Committees with Comrades Mao Zedong, Deng 
Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin as the core, have vigorously advocated 
the Lei Feng spirit and have personally written inscriptions for 
the learn-from-Lei Feng activities. This is an important reason 
why the activities have been so extensive and long-lasting as 
never before. As Lei Feng came from the People's Army, his 
comrades-in-arms should all the more take him as a paragon 
forever, turn the Lei Feng spirit into an enduring action, and 
constantly raise the learn-from-Lei Feng activities and the 
building of spiritual civilization in the Army to a new level. 
  The Lei Feng spirit shines forever!

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "The Key Lies in Leadership"] </F>
  [Text] The objective of a socialist market economic 
structure and how it affects the military in the new period is a 
question currently facing national defense and army building and 
is also a new situation facing military legislation. The key to 
gaining a clear understanding of the new situation, facing up to 
the new topic, and speeding up the pace of military legislation 
lies in leadership. 
  First, we should deepen our understanding, upgrade our 
conceptions, and consider military legislation as an important 
item on the agenda of the party committee. In the course of 
reform, the tried and proven methods of doing things should be 
affirmed in the form of laws, the achievements of reform and 
opening up to the outside world should be consolidated, and 
decisionmaking on reform should be closely combined with 
decisionmaking on legislation. Before establishing or reforming 
things, we should try to enact and apply laws. We should ensure 
the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization, as 
well as laws. To put it another way, we should "enact laws as 
far as possible before we act." This is a major change not only 
in China's legislative thinking but also in its leadership 
conception and method. Military laws and regulations, which are 
the embodiment of the will of the state and the Army, are highly 
authoritative, mandatory, and stable and have great significance 
in guiding, promoting, and ensuring the state and army building. 
Leaders of all departments should regard the enactment of 
military laws and regulations as an important task. 
  Second, we should do a good job of three things: Tasking, 
organization, and ensuring completion of the task within the 
time prescribed by the legislative plans. The Standing 
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress stated: "The 
units assigned the task of drafting laws which failed to 
accomplish their tasks by the scheduled time should promptly 
submit a report to the Standing Committee with explanations." 
This requirement is also applicable to the Army. Once 
legislative projects are determined by the legislation plan, the 
drafting departments should ascertain the task, organization, 
and time limit, play close attention to the drafting of laws, 
and submit the draft laws to the higher authorities for 
examination and approval. Those which fail to do so should 
write a report to the Military Commission with explanations. 
  Third, we should select cadres and assign them the task of 
drafting military laws and regulations and place great stress on 
improving the quality of drafting military laws and regulations. 
Drafting military laws and regulations is an important task 
dealing with theory, practice, policy, and professionalism. The 
drafted articles should be in line with the party's line, 
principles, and policies, complementary to the national 
condition and the reality of the Army, and should be made, as 
far as possible, practical, clear, detailed, and easy to 
implement. As such, the personnel drafting military laws and 
regulations should be strong, have a good mastery of 
professional work, and an intimate knowledge of laws. At the 
same time, they should have a desire to work and be good 
writers. Law drafters should adhere to an important principle: 
Proceeding from the overall situation of national defense and 
army building, submitting local interests to overall interests, 
and conscientiously safeguarding the unity of socialist legal 
system. Some military laws and regulations should remove 
departmental confinement, ensure that one law is enacted for the 
same or similar issues, and refrain from letting departments 
enact their own laws. 
  Fourth, we should place great stress on bringing the role of 
experts into play in legislative work. Military departments 
which have the task of legislation should invite experts to aid 
in the drafting of military laws and regulations and earnestly 
heed their opinions and suggestions. This will help avoid 
detours and improve work efficiency and quality. 
  Fifth, we should strengthen investigation and study, do a 
good job of consultation and coordination, fully understand the 
arduousness of legislation work, and make herculean efforts to 
conduct investigation and study in a down-to-earth manner. For 
some complicated issues, we should conduct repeated 
investigations and study and, for the issues which have to do 
with local authorities, we should conduct investigation and 
study in relevant localities. Meanwhile, the process of 
legislation is also a process of democratic policymaking. When 
it comes to issues which have to do with departments concerned, 
the departments should coordinate with one another. With regard 
to some important and complicated issues, leading comrades 
should take up and solve the issues satisfactorily through 
consultations. Only in this way can the contents of laws and 
regulations be practical and really applicable. 
  Sixth, we should study and use as reference the useful 
experiences of foreign countries and armies in legislation. 
Laws are the common cultural wealth created by mankind. The 
legal systems of some developed countries are relatively sound. 
We can use some of their useful practices to serve our own 
purposes. In the course of drafting military laws and 
regulations, we should extensively collect and sort out the 
legal materials of foreign countries and armies so as to use 
them as a reference in drafting military legislation.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (CNS) -- The improvement and 
further development of relations between China and the United 
States lay in joint efforts by the two sides based on the 
principles of the three Sino-American Joint Communiques, a 
spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this 
afternoon. The achievements reached by the two sides during a 
visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Warren Christopher showed 
such effort being made by the Chinese side. 
  The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, stressed that China did only what 
it was allowed to do by law. He added that the key to good or 
bad relations between two countries did not lie in the same 
ideology or social system but rather in how many mutual 
interests they shared. He noted that following the visit by Mr. 
Christopher both China and the United States knew that the 
interests of the two powers were vast and they shared mutual 
interests in many fields even though they had deep differences 
in some matters. Because of this the future relationship 
between China and the United States in no way merited pessimism. 
  In other developments, Portuguese Prime Minister Mr. Anibal 
Cavaco Silva will pay an official visit to China between April 
10 to 16 at the invitation of Chinese Premier Mr. Li Peng. 
  The 50th annual convention of the United Nations Economic 
and 
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will be held in New 
Delhi, India, between April 5 and 13. Vice Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Mr. Liu Huaqiu will head the Chinese delegation to 
attend the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (CNS) -- China has reiterated 
that it welcomed the involvement of British companies in fair 
competition for the Mainland market, said a spokesman for the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. 
  The spokesman, Mr. Wu Jianmin, noted that an impact had to 
caused to Sino-British relations because of the non-cooperative 
attitude of the British side on the issue of political reform in 
Hong Kong. He added, however, that the Chinese side was willing 
to limit as far as possible the negative effects while British 
companies carried out business in the Mainland. 
  Mr. Wu made the remarks in reply to questions on 
Sino-British 
relations. He said that whether the British Jardine Matheson 
had its listing in Hong Kong was its own business. He added 
that the Chinese side as well as groups of overseas investors 
were confident of the territory's prosperity, stability and 
prospects which Mr. Wu noted were the reasons for the vast 
inflow of capital into Hong Kong and the Mainland. 
  On the matter of the new airport in Hong Kong, Mr. Wu 
stressed that so long as the memorandum of understanding on the 
new airport was strictly observed, talks between the Chinese and 
British sides on the issue could make progress and this the 
Chinese side expected to achieve.

  [Text] Geneva, March 24 (XINHUA) -- China will not be the 
first to use nuclear weapons against other countries and urges 
other nuclear powers to do the same, a Chinese representative 
said here today. 
  Hou Zhitong, head of the Chinese delegation to the 
Conference 
on Disarmament in geneva, told the conference that "China has 
never shirked its responsibility for promoting nuclear 
disarmament." 
  It "has always stood for the fundamental objective of early 
realization of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and has made unremitting efforts and 
important contributions in this regard." 
  "It is known to all that since the first day when it came 
into possession of nuclear weapons, the Chinese Government has 
solemnly declared to the world its unilateral commitment of not 
being the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any 
circumstances," Hou added. 
  He pointed out, "China has on many occasions strongly 
appealed to other nuclear weapon states to undertake similar 
commitments and to conclude an international convention to this 
end." 
  He said that in order to promote the process of nuclear 
disarmament and realize the goal of preventing nuclear war, the 
Chinese Government has recently taken further initiatives. 
  On December 23 last year, the Chinese Government formally 
proposed to the United States, the Russian Federation and other 
nuclear weapon states that negotiations be started among the 
five nuclear weapon states to conclude a treaty on the 
non-first-use of nuclear weapons. 
  "It is the view of the Chinese Government that under the 
present international situation, the condition is ripe for the 
five nuclear weapon states to negotiate and conclude such an 
international treaty," Hou said. 
  China believes, Hou said, the conclusion of this treaty will 
significantly reduce the risk of nuclear war and provide 
security to the five nuclear weapon states, especially the small 
and medium- sized ones among them. 
  He added, "it will also improve mutual trust and contribute 
to the prevention of nuclear proliferation." 
  Hou noted that such a treaty will play an important role in 
realizing a comprehensive nuclear test ban and promoting nuclear 
disarmament. 
  He expressed the hope that countries concerned will give 
positive response to China's initiative and start negotiations 
with a view to concluding a treaty on the non-first-use of 
nuclear weapons as soon as possible. 
  Hou said China "also hopes that the five states will join 
together to promote vigorously the negotiation and conclusion of 
an international legal instrument on not to use or threaten to 
use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or 
nuclear-weapon- free zones, so as to make a decisive 
contribution to freeing mankind from the threat of nuclear war." 
  According to Hou, China has consistently pursued the 
objective of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and stood for the realization of a 
comprehensive ban on nuclear weapon tests within this framework. 
  He said, "proceeding from this fundamental position, China 
has always exercised maximum restraint in its nuclear testing." 
  China has the lowest number of nuclear tests among all 
nuclear powers, he said. 
  "China fully understands the sincere wish of most 
non-nuclear 
weapon states for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test 
ban treaty (CTBT), in the belief that such a treaty will 
contribute to the realization of the objective of complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," Hou 
said. 
  "In view of the above-mentioned considerations," Hou added, 
"the Chinese Government issued a statement on October 5 last 
year, reiterating its relevant principled positions and 
propositions." 
  The statement emphasized that China supports an early 
conclusion of a CTBT and that it will join other countries in 
the negotiation in an effort to conclude such a treaty no later 
than 1996. 
  "It is our opinion that an appropriate solution of the issue 
of security guarantees to the states parties ought to be one of 
the tasks in the CTBT negotiation. 
  "The CTBT is an international legal instrument with a direct 
bearing on the paramount security interests of its states 
parties," he said. 
  According to Hou, just as correctly provided for in the 
mandate of the ad hoc committee, CTBT should promote the process 
of nuclear disarmament and contribute to the strengthening of 
international peace and security. 
  Therefore, Hou said, "for this purpose, the treaty should 
contain provisions for the states parties with nuclear weapons 
to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons 
against states parties which do not possess nuclear weapons." 
  "At the same time," Hou said, "it should also provide for 
the 
states parties with nuclear weapons to undertake not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons against each other." 
  Hou believes that "with all nuclear weapon states 
undertaking 
the above-mentioned obligations, it will add to the substance of 
the CTBT, further the treaty's universality and constitute a 
major contribution to international peace and security."

  549 other American military personnel operating elsewhere in 
the region in support of the Somali operation are scheduled to 
depart by the end of this month, the spokesman also said. 
  A welcome home ceremony will be held at Andrews Air Force 
Base on March 28 and that "marks the completion of the 
withdrawal and the exit of U.S. forces peacekeeping duties in 
Somalia," Boxx said.

Council and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held a conclusive talk 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the State 
Guest House in Beijing. After the one and a half-hour talks, 
Qian Qichen made a speech to Chinese and foreign correspondents, 
summing up the bilateral talks between China and the United 
States, and answered questions from the correspondents. 
  Qian said that the 10-hour-talks between China and the 
United 
States were open, frank and realistic. The two sides 
unanimously agreed that the Sino-U.S. relations are not only 
bilateral, but should also be viewed in a world-wide perspective 
and with thoughts of the future and the 21st century. The three 
joint communiques between China and the United States are the 
cornerstone of the Sino-U.S. relations. China and the United 
States, both big countries with world influence and permanent 
members of the United Nations Security Council, have many common 
interests in global affairs and in safeguarding international 
peace and security. Their stands on safeguarding regional peace 
and stability coincide closely. 
  Qian stressed that during the talks the two sides expressed 
satisfaction with the rapid progress in the fields of economy 
and trade and said that he considers the economic and trade 
cooperation between the two countries to have great potential 
and broad prospects. 
  Qian pointed out that the issues of human rights and most 
favored nation (MFN) trade status were main points of the 
Sino-U.S. bilateral discussions. China opposes linking human 
rights with the issue of the MFN. The issue of human rights has 
two aspects: One is that China and the United States have 
different viewpoints on human rights, and this will remain as a 
long-term fact. Another is that the two countries deal with 
disputes differently. China is of the opinion that the two 
sides can hold talks on the issue of human rights on the basis 
of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs. China can only do things allowed by Chinese 
law. It is futile and damaging to use the human rights issue to 
exert pressure on China. 
  On the concrete achievements of the Sino-U.S. talks, Qian 
listed the following five points: 
  First, the two sides agreed to continue with high-level 
contacts. Chinese State Councillor Song Jian and Minister Wu Yi 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will go to the United 
States in April to attend meetings of the Joint Commission of 
Science and the Joint Commission of Trade separately. 
  Second, the United States reaffirmed its firm support for 
China's reentry into GATT. 
  Third, the two sides have agreed to restore and develop 
military exchanges and have agreed to set up a joint commission 
for defense conversion. 
  Fourth, out of the friendship and humanitarianism it feels 
toward the American people, China has agreed to allow a U.S. 
team to be sent to its territory to survey three Missing In 
Action cases which occurred during the Vietnam War. 
  Fifth, the two sides signed the statement of cooperation in 
implementing the memorandum of understanding on banning the 
import and export of prison labor products. 
  Qian said that the two sides have reached other agreements 
as 
well. He hoped Christopher's visit will enhance mutual 
understanding and improve Sino-U.S. relations. 
  On Sino-U.S. differences on the human rights issue, Qian 
pointed out that the U.S. secretary of state said that he 
intended to link the human rights issue with the MFN because he 
had to implement the U.S. President's executive order and 
observe U.S. laws. This is understandable. The secretary of 
state is a lawyer. Qian said he had told him that neither the 
U.S. President's executive order nor U.S. law can rule China. 
China has no duty to carry them out. The disputes between 
China and the United States can only be resolved through 
consultations. 
  On the issue of the MFN, Qian said that there are different 
opinions within the United States. The U.S. commercial circle 
strongly supports the postponement of China's MFN. There are 
also different views. China and the United States have many 
common interests and also have many differences. This is a 
fact. China will never become the United States. If it were 
required that China accept the U.S. standard and be the same as 
the United States as a precondition to developing trade it would 
be impossible and there would be no trade in the world. Qian 
said he believes that trade between China and the United States 
will continue. 
  Qian said that the secretary of state's visit was of major 
importance to the Sino-U.S. relations. He said that the trend 
shows that to develop Sino-U.S. relations, the two sides should 
carry out the understandings reached by the Chinese and U.S. 
heads of states in Seattle last November. He believed that 
Christopher, during his visit, did attempt to resolve the 
questions and, despite difficulties, the positive trend in 
Sino-U.S. relations will continue.

  [Text] Washington, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Ford Motor Company 
said today it had reached conceptual agreement with China to go 
forward with a vehicle components manufacturing joint venture in 
China as soon as possible. 
  The joint venture between the Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford 
and China's Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) will 
be the first for Ford, which, in 1978, was the first the big 
three automakers to sell vehicles in China after 1949. 
  "We are extremely pleased to have SAIC as a partner," said 
Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and CEO after meeting with 
Shanghai's Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren last week in Dearbon. 
  "We believe that this joint venture will be good for Ford, 
good for our partner and good for China," the chairman stressed. 
  Ford sources said that SAIC's Yan Feng Division and Ford's 
Plastic and Trim Products Division will collaborate to produce 
automotive components including interior trim, seats, instrument 
panels and other plastic parts. 
  Ford, meanwhile, is involved in discussions with several 
Chinese manufacturers that could lead to joint ventures in such 
automotive product areas as glass, electronics, engine mangement 
and air conditioning. 
  The company, Ford sources said, is also interested in 
vehicle 
assembly opportunities in China. 
  Ford has representative offices in Beijing and Shanghai and 
recently established a new Ford China Operations Organization 
headed by James Paulsen. 
  A range of North American-build Ford vehicles, including 
Tempos, has been introduced in China and 10 dealers have been 
located in major Chinese cities.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Frequent contacts and 
cooperation between enterprises of China and the Republic of 
Korea (ROK) will help their development and increase their 
competitiveness on the world market. 
  This is a view shared by the chief representatives and 
managers of the Beijing offices of ROK's Daewoo, Hyundai, 
Lucky-Goldstar and Samsung corporations. In a recent interview 
with XINHUA before ROK President Kim Yong-sam's China visit, 
they said that the two countries are mutually supplementary in 
terms of natural resources, technology and economic structure. 
If the two sides can combine their advantages, their 
enterprises will develop rapidly. 
  Chung Chae-kwan, chief representative of Hyundai 
Corporation's Beijing office, said that as the ROK and China are 
neighbors with a long history of culture exchanges and economic 
and trade contacts, there is a solid foundation for the 
cooperation of the companies of two countries. 
  Since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 
1992, 
he said, many Korean enterprises have come to invest in and 
conduct trade with China, and many Chinese companies have 
entered Korean markets. 
  As a result, Chung noted, the Sino-ROK trade ties have 
enjoyed tremendous development. Last year, the bilateral trade 
volume stood at 8.2 billion U.S. dollars, and ROK investment in 
China reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. 
  S.C. Yi, representative of the Beijing office of Daewoo, 
said 
that since China has rich natural resources and labor, while the 
ROK has accumulated useful experience in its 40-year economic 
development and possesses advanced technology suitable for 
China, the effective cooperation between the two sides will 
create development chances for both sides. 
  Since the late 1980s, Daewoo began to invest mainly in 
China's fields of machinery, chemicals, electrical appliances 
and automobiles. By the end of last year, its investment in 
China had reached 300 million U.S. dollars. Its trade volume 
with China in 1993 was one billion U.S. dollars. Daewoo has 
also set up a joint venture with Chinese companies in the ROK. 
  Business in China has also developed smoothly for Samsung. 
With 10 offices in China, its trade volume with China surpassed 
1.1 billion U.S. dollars last year, ranking first among all ROK 
companies. It has invested more than 100 million U.S. dollars 
to set up an ROK-China joint venture to manufacture electronic 
products and telecommunications equipment. 
  Chun Sung-chin, chief representative of Lucky-Goldstar's 
Beijing office, said that since the enterprises of both 
countries all are facing tense competition in the world, they 
must introduce new technology and expand their production scope. 
The industrial circle of the two countries should strengthen 
their cooperation in this regard. 
  All of the ROK entrepreneurs interviewed stressed that their 
companies have made long-term plans to cooperate with China, 
some of which have been carried out. Daewoo has signed an 
agreement with China to jointly produce automobile parts. The 
Lucky-Goldstar Group has just reached agreements with China to 
invest 400 million U.S. dollars to manufacture electronic 
products. It also plans to move its Asian sub-headquarters from 
Hong Kong to Beijing.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 (XINHUA) -- The visiting South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa agreed today to forge a future-oriented 
relationship by looking correctly at history, Japanese Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  They referred to the Japanese colonization of the Korean 
peninsula before and during World War II. 
  During their talks, Kim told Hosokawa that the 
future-oriented bilateral ties would impose great impact on 
Asian nations as well as the rest of the world. 
  The two leaders also agreed that Japan, South Korea and 
Russia should make efforts to adopt measures to solve the 
problem of returning Koreans left behind on the Russian Far East 
island of Sakhalin to their homeland. 
  They exchanged their views about political and economic 
reform efforts and discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  A second round of talks between Kim and Hosokawa is 
scheduled 
on Saturday. They are expected to discuss economic issues. 
  Later this evening, Kim attended a state dinner hosted by 
Japanese Emperor Akihito. 
  Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, arrived in Tokyo this 
morning for a three-day visit to Japan. 
  He will deliver speeches in the Japanese Diet (parliament) 
and at Wasoda University on Friday.

  [Text] Nanning, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Pingxiang City in the 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, south China, has become one of 
southwest China's most vigorous cities in border trade. 
  Sharing a 97-kilometer border line with Vietnam, the city is 
187 kilometers north of Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, and 231 
kilometers south of Nanning City, capital of China's Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  Now Pingxiang has two import and export posts managed by the 
state and five exit posts managed by local government. 
  Its railway and highway connect with those in Vietnam and 
the 
city now has become one of the major passages from China to 
Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia. 
  In 1992, the State Council approved making the city an open 
city at the border and to set up a border economic cooperation 
zone of 7.2 square kilometers. 
  From 1984 when China and Vietnam began to normalize their 
relations, the border trade between Pingxiang City and its 
Vietnamese counterpart has increased rapidly. 
  The transaction volume of the trade between the two sides 
reached 776 million yuan last year. 
  Moreover, Pingxiang City held a border commodity fair in the 
year, which was attended by about 3,000 Chinese and foreign 
businessmen. The fair's transaction value was about 2.3 billion 
yuan. 
  This July, Pingxiang will also sponsor a national border 
trade fair. 
  It is learned that more than 1,000 units and individuals 
from 
both at home and overseas have sent letters to the organizing 
committee of the fair to register to participate in the fair.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The southwestern 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will develop into another 
outlet of China, besides Guangdong, to Southeast Asian areas and 
the world, chairman of the regional government Cheng Kejie said 
here today. 
  At a press conference held here, Cheng said that the 
development of international port and trade centers in the 
region will benefit 240 million people in a 
23-million-square-kilometer area in southwestern China. 
  He said that the province will provide a shortcut for import 
and export goods from land-locked Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan 
Provinces to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Now the goods mainly 
goes through coastal cities of Guangzhou in the south and 
Shanghai in the east. 
  He said that the central government has adopted preferential 
policies to encourage the locality to expand economic and trade 
links with Southeast Asian countries. The central government 
supports include special loans and funds allocations for 
infrastructure and better-off of the eight million 
poverty-stricken people in the autonomous region. 
  In response to a question about the region's economic 
relations with Southeast Asian countries, he said that many 
countries have shown great interest in investing in the areas 
along the 1,600- kilometer coastal line of the region. 
  Guangxi has a 1,020-kilometer border line with Vietnam, and 
is located near the Laos, Thailand and Myanmar [Burma]. 
  He said that former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew 
visited the coastal city of Beihai in the region last year. Now 
a group of Singapore entrepreneurs are in the city to assess a 
666.7-hectare area to be designated to them by the local 
government. 
  "There is a bright prospect for the project," Cheng said, 
"The two sides are consulting on the industrial structure and 
scale of investment in the area." 
  He said that a number of cooperative projects between the 
autonomous region and Thailand and Malaysia are also in the 
pipeline. 
  Since Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai went to Guangxi 
during his China visit last August, some 18 investment projects 
by the Thai bank have been under discussion. The bank from 
Thailand is also applying to set up a branch in the regional 
capital of Nanning. 
  Cooperative projects under way with Malaysia include a 
seafood processing plant and some 400 luxury villas in Beihai 
city. The city has joined hands with Malaysia to open marine 
tourist routes to Southeast Asian countries. It has placed 
orders for luxury pleasure boats and will soon put them in use. 
  Last year, the region introduced a total of one billion U.S. 
dollars of foreign funds with 2,544 investment contracts signed, 
seeing the fastest growth rate of foreign investment among 
coastal areas of China. 
  Most of the funds come from Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United 
States and Southeast Asian countries. 
  Besides introduction of overseas funds, the region also 
expanded its investment overseas. To seize the opportunity 
emerging in a surge of market-oriented economic reform in 
Vietnam, the region has been seeking to take part in 
technological renovations of a large number of Vietnamese 
enterprises that were built with Chinese aid in the 1950s and 
1960s. 
  "We are planning to send a technological group to these 
Vietnamese enterprises to see what we can do to help," he said. 
  He said that the region has set up a joint-venture 
fertilizer 
plant and a department store in Vietnam since the two countries 
resumed normal diplomatic relations in November 1991. 
  "The two countries have a long history of friendly exchanges 
and cooperation. We can cooperate in many areas, such as trade, 
joint ventures, and tourism," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen stressed here today that the 
profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the Yemeni 
people will never change. 
  Qian made the remark during a meeting with visiting Yemeni 
Vice- Foreign Minister Abdul Kadir. 
  Qian said he was satisfied that the long friendly ties and 
cooperation between China and Yemen had been developed in a 
concrete way after the reunification of the South Yemen and 
North Yemen. 
  He added: "We are very much concerned about the Yemen's 
domestic situation, hoping that the country will realize its 
social stability and enjoy a good environment for its 
construction. 
  "We believe that the Yemeni people will solve their own 
problems by themselves." 
  China and the Yemen, Qian said, share many common points on 
international issues, and their relationship will grow by 
mutually supporting and cooperating with each other. 
  Abdul Kadir said he had come here for the main purpose of 
having political consultations with Chinese colleagues. 
  The Yemen was also satisfied with the growth of traditional 
friendship between the two countries and hoped that such 
relationship would keep growing. 
  Yesterday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei 
exchanged views with Abdul Kadir on bilateral ties and regional 
and international issues of common concern. 
  The two agreed that the political consultations between the 
two Foreign Ministries will be beneficial not only to 
strengthening their cooperation, but also to pushing forward 
bilateral ties. 
  Abdul Kadir arrived here on March 22.

considering to set up a joint venture dairy in China's southern 
city of Nanning with a daily capacity of 50,000-liter liquid 
milk, official sources here said today. 
  The project, with an estimated cost of 1 million U.S.

Development Board Chairman V. Kurien and Managing Director 
Amrita Patel who was in Nanning to attend a seminar on buffalo 
milk production. 
  During their stay in Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang 
Minority Autonomous Region, Kurien and Patel held discussions on 
dairy development based on buffaloes with local Chinese 
officials. 
  The proposal mooted envisages that the Indian side would 
provide design and other administrative knowhow to China, the 
sources said. 
  India is also reportedly to have expressed its willingness 
to 
give 300 elite buffalo embryos and 50,000 doses of frozen semen 
from elite buffalo bulls in order to boost dairy development in 
the region. 
  A diplomat in the Chinese Embassy confirmed that the project 
is still waiting for approval by both the governments.

<F P=106> [By Li Wen: "EU Quotas Enrage Toy Makers"] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou--Toy manufacturers are feeling the sting 
of the European Union's newly-imposed quotas on Chinese toys--a 
decision that one expert predicts will cost the mainland more 
than $500 million. 
  "The quota issue will greatly hurt the Chinese industry and 
our losses are even difficult to estimate," said Albert Su, 
executive director with Jetta Company, a private Hong Kong 
company based in Guangzhou. 
  His company opened 11 years ago with just 25 workers. Like 
many private Hong Kong toy manufacturers, Jetta moved its 
operations to Guangzhou for cheap labour. And it decided 
against investing in other Southeast Asian nations. 
  Now that decision is threatening a large chunk of his 
business--and the livelihood of the 15,000 workers Jetta now 
employs. 
  EU foreign ministers recently voted 7-4 to restrict Chinese 
toys coming into their market. The quota went into effect on 
Tuesday. 
  They allege that the Chinese toy manufacturers are able to 
"dump" their products on the EU market because of government 
subsidies that drive their prices down. 
  "That is completely incorrect," Su said. "For 11 years, 
since 
we set foot in Guangdong, we have never received a penny from 
the Chinese Government; nothing, except a lot support, of 
course." 
  Toys sold to the European market account for 30 per cent of 
Jetta's total exports. And they are not alone. 
  In 1992, China exported $1.14 billion in toys to Europe, 
according to statistics from the Toy Manufactures Europe in 
Brussels. 
  "China's toy industry will lose at least $570 million on 
account of the quota issue this year," Su predicted. 
  The Guangdong Toy Manufacturers' Association called the EC's 
action trade protectionism. 
  The association is blaming the struggling economy as the 
prime reason why European manufacturers have urged the EU to 
shut the door on Chinese goods. 
  Guangdong's Pearl River Delta region, the world's biggest 
toy 
manufacturing base, produces about 50 per cent of the world's 
toys. 
  And they account for two-thirds of the total in China and 
almost all products are sold abroad. 
  The province exported $1.1 billion worth of toys last year, 
ranking second after the $3.6 billion in clothes exports. 
  Over the past 10 years, almost all of the Hong Kong toy 
makers have shifted their plants from the territory to the delta 
region to take advantage of the cheap labour and favourable 
investment environment. 
  There are more than 2,000 Hong Kong toy plants in that area. 
Only America has a larger market for their products than Europe. 
  "Our toys are cheaper because of cheap Chinese labour costs. 
I don't believe any plant here is subsidized," declared Su. 
  EU has imposed quotas on three major categories: Stuffed 
toys, those representing non-humans, and diecast miniatures. 
  Su said many long-term sales agents are advising 
manufacturers to leave China and transfer production to 
Southeast Asia, which means his overseas customers will reduce 
awarding contracts to China-based manufacturers. 
  "Some Hong Kong investors are actively involved in building 
new plants in Thailand, despite the fact that the investment 
environment there is not as good as China," he explained. 
  According to the quota system, further categories will also 
be subject to surveillance. 
  "No quotas have been set for them now but that may be 
possible if we don't make attacking measures," said Su. 
  Manufacturers said that they will ask the Chinese 
authorities 
to allow them to increase domestic sales.

  [Text] Nanjing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Agro-scientists agree 
that coastal Jiangsu Province is taking the lead in China's 
rural modernization. 
  The scientists, from the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural 
Sciences, came to this conclusion based on a survey of southern 
Jiangsu's Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou. 
  According to associate research fellow Huang Wenxin, who was 
in charge of the research project, southern Jiangsu covers an 
area of 17,500 sq km and has a population of 13 million. 
  Its gross domestic product last year jumped by at least 
tenfold over 1979, when China began its rural reform, and its 
economic development speed ranks first among the country's rural 
areas. 
  According to the latest statistics, the proportion of 
industry in this area rose to 90 percent last year and that of 
the non-rural labor force to 80 percent. 
  The annual farmers' income last year averaged more than 
2,000 
yuan per capita, and the standard of farm machinery and 
irrigation in more than one half of the counties and cities had 
already caught up with that of the economically-developed 
countries. 
  At present, southern Jiangsu is promoting its rural 
modernization by setting up more industrial and commercial 
zones, rural residential quarters and farmland-protection areas.

  [Text] Learned by this reporter on 23 March from the 
provincial meeting on management of power departments, the 
province's last 400 administrative villages beyond the reach of 
power supply will all be supplied with power by the end of this 
year. Then, 91 percent of peasant households in the province 
will be accessible by power supply, 88 percent of peasant 
households will be furnished with lighting installation, and 
power price in rural areas will become reasonable. 
  In 1993, power departments in the province increased the 
dynamics of the work of supporting poor areas. As a result, some 
680 villages in the province were newly furnished with power 
supply installations. Zibo, Binzhou, and Jining attained the 
target of making all their villages accessible by power supply. 
Dezhou power supply bureau also completed in advance the work 
of supplying power to 56 villages by 20 March, thus fulfilling 
the task of making all villages accessible by power supply. 
Last year, three 110-kilovolt transformer substations and 12 
35-kilovolt transformer substations were newly built in the 15 
poverty-stricken counties in the province, and, as a result, 12 
poverty-stricken counties fulfilled the task of making all their 
villages accessible by power supply. 
  Vice Governor Chen Jianguo said at the meeting: The 
development of power industry is very uneven in rural areas. 
The framework of the rural power supply network in western 
province remains weak, and the per capita share of power there 
remains very low. This has become the major factor hampering 
the rural economic development in western areas. Accelerating 
the development of power industry in rural areas is a 
fundamental guarantee for invigorating the rural economy of the 
province. For this reason, governments at all levels must 
attach high importance on power industry. Meanwhile, by firmly 
embracing the service purpose of orienting the people's power 
industry to people's needs, rural power management departments 
at all levels should regard it as their own duty to ensure the 
lighting service of rural areas and to help rural areas shake 
off poverty and become rich, and should strengthen management to 
not only ensure power supply to peasants but also make the 
numerous peasants use power in correct way. Rural power 
management departments at all levels should continue to manage 
well power price and resolutely lower the price in rural areas 
to a reasonable level so that they can support agricultural 
production and reduce peasants' burden.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Three U.S. computer 
producers have this month made major moves in Shanghai, causing 
a stir in local economic circles. 
  On March 7, the Hewlett-Packard Company simultaneously 
launched six state-of-the-art computers in the United States and 
Shanghai. On March 17, the China Hewlett-Packard Co. Ltd signed 
contracts with three well-performing South-east Asian 
international computer companies, authorizing them to be special 
retailers in China. 
  On March 10, the Digital Equipment Company, the largest 
computer network producer in the world, signed a long-term 
cooperative memorandum with the Shanghai-based Pudong Software 
Park. 
  On March 18, International Business Machines (IBM) announced 
it was going to donate 5.5 million U.S. dollars worth of 
computer equipment to the Shanghai University of Science and 
Technology and to help it set up a teaching center of computer 
auxiliary software engineering. 
  Late last year, Shanghai declared computers to be one of its 
pillar industries. 
  Overseas computer producers quickly reacted to this 
declaration. Nearly one-third of the world's 100 largest 
computer producers have discussed cooperation with Shanghai. 
  Domestic enterprises are also competing for the market. 
  Changjiang Computer Group, of Shanghai, is planning to 
popularize its computers in such fields as securities, finance, 
posts and telecommunications and commerce. Major Chinese 
computer companies like Legend and Giant are also accelerating 
their pace to step into Shanghai. 
  Recently, the Shanghai Computer Square, sponsored by the 
China Corporation of Science and Technology Books and joined by 
Shanghai Computer Bookstore and Giant and Legend companies, 
opened here. 
  It sells books, provides information and develops software 
and hardware and is open to the whole country.

many foreign businessmen to invest there. 
  First, well-known multinational corporations have come to 
Shanghai to invest in big items with 44 such corporations 
investing there last year alone. To date, 128 such corporations 
have invested in 206 items with contracted investment of 
U.S.$2.5 billion. Of these, American, Japanese and European 
corporations make up over 90 percent of the total. Thirty-five 
of the world's 200 biggest industrial multinational companies 
have investments in Shanghai and items invested by another 15 
are now under examination for approval. 
  Second, three type foreign-funded industrial enterprises are 
playing an important role in the renovation of old enterprises, 
the structural adjustment of industries and the development of 
new and high-tech industries. Foreign-funded items including 
large-scale integrated circuits, optical fibre materials, air 
compressors, digitally-controlled computers, mobile phone bases 
and terminals have become rising pillar industries in the city. 
  Third, tertiary industry has become a new keen sector 
invested by foreign businessmen with 1,037 items introduced in 
Shanghai last year with contracted foreign capital of U.S.$4.44 
billion, making up 28 percent and 68 percent of all 
foreign-funded items and total contracted foreign capital there 
respectively. Foreign business have also made fast progress in 
investment in real estate, the setting up of foreign-funded 
banks and in infrastructural construction. 
  Fourth, Pudong has become the key place for foreign 
investment with 50 complexes already under construction in the 
Lujiazui district. 
  Fifth, three type foreign-funded entrprises in the outer 
suburbs of Shanghai have also developed rapidly with good 
results. 
  Sixth, foreign-funded enterprises there are virtually all 
running well. Among the 7,000 three type foreign-funded 
enterprises approved in Shanghai, some two-thirds of them have 
started production with industrial enterprises among them 
reaching an output value increase of 80 percent last year, far 
more than the average in the municipality of 18.3 percent. Such 
enterprises have also achieved a favourable balance between 
their foreign currency spending and earnings with total foreign 
currency earnings of U.S.$4.254 billion and total spending of 
US$3.988 billion.

  [Text] At a seminar held in Guangzhou yesterday, Yi 
Zhengqiu, director of the Guangdong Provincial Commission for 
Restructuring Economy, told reporters that although the State 
Commission for Restructuring Economy stated recently that the 
issuance of 5.5 billion yuan worth of new stock would not take 
place in the first six months of the year, this would have 
little effect on Guangdong's issuance of new stocks. Yi Zhenqiu 
said that of the number of new stocks the state allowed to 
Guangdong last year, some 90 million yuan worth had not been 
issued. Recently, the provincial commission for restructuring 
economy has drawn up a list of enterprises, which already has 
been submitted to the State Commission for Restructuring Economy 
for its examination and approval. However, the number of 
enterprises and the list itself cannot be published as of today. 
Yi Zhengqiu said the selection of enterprises to be listed this 
year would continue to comply with the national industrial 
policy of focusing efforts on supporting key projects in energy 
resources and infrastructure. It is certain that the method of 
selling application forms for drawing lots in the marketing of 
new stocks will not be repeated. On the issue of Chinese stocks 
to be listed outside the border, Director Yi said that the 
Guangdong Foshan Earthenware Group has been included in the 22 
firms to be listed outside the border, as decided by the central 
authorities; also included are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway 
and the Southern Aviation Company, which are enterprises under 
ministerial jurisdiction. At present, those enterprises 
included on the list are conducting asset assessment.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 15 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--On 3 
March, personnel of the Jiazi Town Public Security Department in 
Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, impounded 10 barges 
manufactured in a local port, thus crushing some smugglers' 
attempt to carry out smuggling on barges. 
  Jiazi Town is located in the southeastern coast of Lufeng 
County, bordering on Hong Kong and Macao. During this year's 
Spring Festival, some smugglers, taking advantage of the festive 
occasion, covertly employed some workers from outside the 
province to manufacture barges in an attempt to "enliven" the 
already-halted smuggling activities. Upon receipt of crime 
reports by some people, the town antismuggling group immediately 
organized personnel, and on 27 February it impounded 10 barges 
being manufactured in the local port and arrested 18 law 
breakers involved in manufacturing the barges. Now this case is 
under further investigation.

  [Text] Forty per cent of foreign owned enterprises in 
Shenzhen will be unionised in a bid to calm industrial disputes. 
And the municipal Government will also set up a fund to protect 
workers against wage defaults. 
  Official figures show that in the past two years, there have 
been 1,100 labour disputes, strikes and go slows, in the Special 
Economic Zone. Ninety per cent of these happened in 
foreign-owned enterprises and non-government-subvented factories. 
  In his report to the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference of Shenzhen delivered yesterday, a senior official of 
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) Huang Jinrong, 
told deputies that labour disputes not only would continue to 
exist, but would appear in new forms with the development of the 
market economy. 
  Mr Huang said that the ACFTU in Shenzhen has planned to 
increase the number of unions in foreign owned enterprises, of 
which more than 40 per cent should be unionised this year. The 
ACFTU also plans to set up a Shenzhen Wage Insurance Fund to 
protect workers from wage defaults. And, a certain proportion 
of the enterprises' total wages, about one or two months of 
workers' salary, would be collected to form this fund, he said. 
  According to surveys, Mr Huang said that low salaries, poor 
social securities, wage defaults, bad monitoring systems and the 
divorce of management and practice are the main reasons behind 
these conflicts. In May last year, 1,300 workers in a 
foreign-owned factory in She Kou went on strike. 
  Mr Huang said that it was discovered that workers were paid 
five to seven yuan (HK$4.44 to HK$6.22) a day, much lower than 
the already demeaning stipulated minimum salary of 11.2 yuan a 
day. Besides setting up more unions, Mr Huang said that 
education for labour legislation should also be strengthened. 
And in a bid to keep a closer control and take prompt action to 
crack down on disputes, the ACFTU would help public securities 
departments to form internal security organisations in larger 
enterprises, he said.

  [Text] Shenzhen, 16 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--With the 
high-speed development of the economy in the special economic 
zone, fake and shoddy commodities have become a public scourge 
in Shenzhen. 
  It was the "International Day of the Rights and Interests of 
Consumers" yesterday. Shenzhen's Industrial and Commercial 
Bureau, Consumers' Committee, and some production enterprises 
took to the streets and shopping arcades to publicize protection 
for the rights and interests of consumers and ways to identify 
fake and shoddy commodities. 
  The Tianhong Shopping Plaza was crowded with people. 
Suddenly someone called out that "Chief Justice Bao [a strict 
and impartial official from the Song Dynasty called Bao Zheng] 
had come." People turned round and actually saw a dark-faced 
"Chief Justice Bao" escorted by "Zhang Long" and "Zhao Hu." It 
turned out that Shenzhen's New Century Drinking Water Science 
and Technology Company Limited had adopted an original approach 
and had invited some actors to play the parts of "Chief Justice 
Bao" and his subordinates to act for the people and to strictly 
enforce the law. The shoppers rushed headlong toward "Chief 
Justice Bao" and complained to him about fake and shoddy 
commodities. 
  According to the latest Shenzhen Consumer's Committee 
statistics, 60 percent of the complaints were about fake and 
shoddy commodities. Nearly all high-grade and brand-name 
commodities in Shenzhen, no matter whether they were imported or 
made in China, including watches, electrical appliances, 
garments, foodstuffs, wines, cigarettes, leather shoes, leather 
bags, and even "mouse detectors [shu biao qi 7857 2871 0892]," 
which most people are not quite familiar with, had counterfeit 
equivalents. "Chief Justice Bao" was invited to protect the 
interests of the consumers and the publicity effects were quite 
good. This shows the deep hatred of the consumers toward fake 
and shoddy commodities. 
  It is learned that Shenzhen City will inspect all imported 
foodstuffs with fixed packaging beginning 1 April and 
anti-counterfeit signs will be stuck on qualified commodities 
before they can be sold. 
  In Shenzhen, 97 activities have been conducted citywide to 
crack down on fake and shoddy commodities beginning late 
December last year. Over 5,650 shops and stalls have been 
inspected, 522 cases of producing and selling fake and shoddy 
commodities have been handled and the people involved punished, 
the operation of 326 shops and plants has been suspended for 
reorganization, 28 illegal plants have been banned, and more 
than 23,000 counterfeit items, under 23 categories and amounting 
to over 530,000 yuan, have been seized.

concluded today, Liang Guangda was reelected as the city's 
mayor. So far, he has remained in this post for 10 consecutive 
years. 
  Liang Guangda, 59, was appointed as Zhuhai mayor in 1984, 
transferring from the Foshan Prefectural Administrative Office. 
Prior to that, he had worked with the Nanhai Sub-branch of the

manager. He later became deputy secretary, and then secretary 
of the Nanhai County CPC Committee, member of the Standing 
Committee of the Foshan Prefectural CPC Committee, deputy 
magistrate of the Foshan Prefectural Administrative Office, and 
director of the prefectural finance office. Between 1982 and 
1983, he studied at the CPC's Central Party School, and then was 
transferred to Zhuhai. In 1986, he was appointed to the 
concurrent post of secretary of the Zhuhai City CPC Committee, 
and holds that office now.

  [Text] On the morning of 19 March, the Guangxi delegation 
to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] held a news briefing in the news center for the two 
sessions in Beijing's International Hotel. Cheng Kejie, NPC 
deputy and regional chairman, Lei Yu, vice regional chairman, 
(Hong Huzhou), director of the regional Planning Commission, and 
(Shuai Liguo), mayor of Beihai City, answered questions from 
Chinese and foreign reporters. 
  [China Huayi Broadcast Company reporter] Guangxi provides 
the most direct passageway to Southeast Asia. In 1992, the 
central authorities stressed that it was necessary to give full 
play to Guangxi's role as a sea passageway in the southwestern 
region. Over the past few years, with this objective in mind, 
Guangxi has strengthened infrastructure construction projects 
and basic industrial projects. Could you tell me the progress 
of these projects? 
  [Cheng Kejie] In 1992, the central authorities decided to 
build Guangxi into a sea passageway in the vast southwestern 
region. Over the past two years, with the help of the central 
authorities, we have done a lot of work. First, we have grasped 
infrastructure projects well, including transportation, energy, 
telecommunications, and so on. We have built or expanded five 
airports. The Guilin Airport project started last year and is 
expected to be completed in October 1995. We are currently 
building Liuzhou and Wuzhou Airports and these two projects will 
be completed this year. In addition, we have expanded Beihai 
and Nanning Airports. We are currently building five railroads: 
The Nanning-Kunming Railroad, Yulin-Wuzhou railway, 
Lihang-Zhangjiang Railroad, Qinzhou-Qinzhou Port Railway, and 
the Qinzhou-Beihai Railroad. The Nanning-Kunming Railroad is 
expected to be completed in 1997. In addition to this, we are 
building two super expressways: The Liuzhou-Guilin totally 
enclosed four-lane expressway and the 
Nanning-Qinzhou-Huangcheng-Beihai six-lane expressway. Power 
supply in Guangxi has been insufficient but efforts are being 
made to speed up hydropower and thermal power plant projects. 
  [China Central Television reporter] Over the past two years, 
Guangxi has imported foreign capital and run foreign-funded 
enterprises. The number of such enterprises has increased. 
Where did the money come from? What are the prospects for the 
future? 
  [Lei Yu] With regard to efforts to promote exports to earn 
more foreign exchange, in 1992, Guangxi's total export volume 
reached $1.108 billion, an increase of 33 percent over 1992. In 
1993, total export volume increased to $1.325 billion, up 19.6 
percent. As far as using foreign capital is concerned, at the 
end of 1991 there were 559 foreign-funded enterprises in Guangxi 
and a total of $63 million in foreign capital was actually used. 
At the end of 1992, there were 1,870 foreign-funded enterprises 
in Guangxi and $246 million worth of capital was actually used, 
an increase of 272 percent. At the end of 1993, there were 
4,368 foreign-funded enterprises and $1 billion worth of foreign 
capital was used in that year, an increase of 305 percent. The 
use of foreign capital has been characterized by great increases 
in recent years. In addition, there are four other 
characteristics: First, investment fields have been expanded; 
second, investment areas have been widened; third, the number of 
investor countries and regions has increased; and fourth, there 
are more big financial groups and large projects. 
  [VNA reporter] Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese 
relations, how have relations between Guangxi and Vietnam been? 
What reasons does Guangxi have to conduct further consultations 
with Vietnam? [Cheng Kejie] Since the normalization of 
Sino-Vietnamese relations in 1991, the development of friendly 
economic contacts between the two countries has been healthy and 
this has benefited the peoples of the two countries. We can 
have better cooperation with Vietnam in many fields, such as 
trade and negotiations on economic projects. Both sides can 
promote their cooperation on the basis of mutual benefits and 
concessions. 
  [Lei Yu] With the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese 
relations, economic cooperation has developed considerably. I 
believed that, encouraged by the two governments, economic 
cooperation between Guangxi and Vietnam will be strengthened. 
  [XINHUA reporter] Not long ago, many experts predicted that 
from the end of this century to early next century, 
international cities will rise in the area of the Gulf of 
Tonkin. It was reported that Beihai City has made some plans 
and studies in this regard. I would like Mayor Suai to tell us 
something about this. 
  [Suai Liguo] Beihai is a sea passageway in the vast 
southwestern region. The city has eight strong points with 
regard to its natural resources, in particular, tourism and 
ports. Beihai City has invested a large sum of money in 
infrastructure and energy projects. We have built Tieshangang 
Highway and more than 10 city highways. We have also 
constructed an airport. We are creating the best investment 
environment to attract investors to come to Beihai to join local 
construction or make investments. We are making efforts to 
build Beihai into an influential and new city. 
  Cheng Kejie, Lei Yu, Shuai Liguo, and Hong Huzhou also 
answered the following questions raised by reporters: How would 
Guangxi strengthen its economic cooperation with the United 
States? How would Guangxi deal blows at activities of illegally 
selling guns? How would Guangxi support the impoverished? How 
would Guangxi develop its electronics and automobile industry? 
What are Lee Kuan Yew's investment intentions in Guangxi?

"Guangxi Government Chairman and Vice Chairman Reveal That 
Guangxi Employed an Additional 700 Policemen To Fight Smuggling 
Last Year and Seized 300 Guns and Some Drugs"] 
  [Text] Deputies to the National People's Congress, Cheng 
Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 
Government, and Vice Chairman Lei Yu revealed here today: Last 
year, the Guangxi Government employed an additional 700 
policemen especially to cope with gunrunners and drug 
traffickers, seizing more than 900 kg of drugs and some 300 guns 
and arresting about 300 drug traffickers. This year, the 
Guangxi Government will continue to crack down severely on drug 
smuggling and trafficking in close cooperation with the Hong 
Kong police. When talking about the illegal entry into Hong 
Kong by Vietnamese refugees, Lei Yu said: Based on statements of 
investigations, at the news conference it held in Hong Kong, the 
UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees clarified that, 
of the refugees who had illegally sneaked into Hong Kong, no 
more than 100 came from Guangxi. At present, the repatriation 
of the refugees is underway. 
  According to Lei Yu, last year the scope of foreign 
investment expanded greatly. Hong Kong businessmen Li Shao-kee 
and Cheng Yu-tong invested in Guangxi and Robert Kwok made large 
investments in Beihai City's Fangcheng Port. This year, Guangxi 
will build the infrastructure on a large scale and strive to 
become the "most convenient thoroughfare" which "with the great 
southwest behind, serves the great southwest and faces Southeast 
Asia, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan." 
  Guangxi leaders made these remarks at today's "News 
Conference on Guangxi's Reform, Opening up, and Economic 
Development." When answering a Hong Kong reporter's question, 
Lei Yu said: Guangxi shares a 1,025-km land frontier and 
1,595-km coastline with its neighboring countries. Making use 
of this long frontier and coastline, many lawless elements carry 
out gunrunning and drug trafficking. The Guangxi Government has 
always adopted severe measures to deal with lawless elements. 
Last year, the government boosted the police force by 700 
personnel to specially cope with gunrunners and drug traffickers 
and seized more than 10 kg of heroin, some 800 kg of opium, and 
about 300 guns (mostly smuggled in from outside the borders), 
and arrested over 300 smugglers (mostly members of gangs 
comprising several persons). The Guangxi leader went on to say: 
We have always maintained close coordination with the Hong Kong 
police. This has been the case in the past and it will remain 
unchanged in the days to come. 
  When briefing the news conference on Guangxi's economic 
construction and the bid to improve its investment environment, 
Cheng Kejie said: In the last two years, we have built or 
extended five airports. For example, Guilin and Beihai Airports 
are international and Liuzhou and Wuzhou Airports are expected 
to be available for operation this year. Moreover, five railway 
lines, two expressways, and hydropower and thermal power 
stations with a total generating capacity of 8.2 million kwh are 
under construction. All these projects will better serve 
Guangxi's and the great southwest's opening up and economic 
construction. According to statistics, last year, Guangxi put 
$1 billion into practical use, had 4,360 foreign-invested 
enterprises, and earned $1.325 billion in foreign currency by 
exporting goods, a big increase on the 1992 figure. The scope 
of foreign investment also expanded remarkably. There was a 
marked increase in the number of investing countries, regions, 
and big financial groups and firms. In June this year, 
Singapore's political celebrity Lee Kuan Yew will hold 
consultations with Guangxi on developing an industrial park in 
Beihai. Thailand's foreign exchange dealers are negotiating 
with Guangxi on 18 projects and applying to set up an office in 
Nanning. Malaysia and Guangxi will open Beihai to Southeast 
Asia sea routes. 
  On the issue of Guangxi shaking off poverty, Cheng Kejie 
said: Ten percent of China's poor households are in Guangxi. 
This being the case, Guangxi's task in shaking off poverty is 
very arduous. Apart from implementing the "87 Program [solving 
the problem of food and clothing for 80 million people in 
poverty-stricken areas within 7 years]" cited in Li Peng's 
Government Work Report, in carrying out the work of shaking off 
poverty, we have worked out a plan to remove 200,000 people from 
the most poverty-stricken areas within 8 years. We began to 
implement the program last year and moved 23,000 people to areas 
where cultivable land and fresh water were available and where 
there are schools and land available for road building. This 
year we plan to move 25,000 people. The main difficulty facing 
the plan is the funds problem. It will take about 6,000 to 
7,000 yuan to relocate an especially poor household. The other 
difficulty is the problem of how to achieve national unity 
between those who are moved out and those who are moved in. The 
State Council has clearly stated that it will give great support 
to Guangxi in terms of finance and credit.

  [Text] Nanning, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Fangcheng, the biggest 
port in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will 
invest one billion yuan to develop a new area, local officials 
said. 
  Construction of the six-sq-km Changshan new area has been 
started. The officials said they plan to complete land 
leveling, roads, water and power supply projects within one year. 
  According to the plan, the new area will be a complex of 
banking, office, shopping, entertainment and residential 
buildings. 
  Administrating three urban districts and a suburban county, 
with a combined population of 700,000, the one-year-old city has 
been working hard to improve its infrastructures. 
  In the past year, the city invested 523 million yuan in 
fixed 
assets construction projects, including five mid-sized berths 
for its port, a 6.7-sq-km landfill project, a 49-km highway, and 
telecommunications networks. 
  In a few years, the city will have a new center on a piece 
of 
seaside wilderness stretching 30 sq km, the officials said.

  [Text] Hunan Provincial CPC Secretary Wang Maolin 
addressed a provincial experience exchange meeting on management 
of rural social order, which ended yesterday. He pointed out: 
Thanks to the management work in the previous two stages, we 
have dealt blows at a large number of local ruffians and 
despots. Social order in our rural area has been considerably 
improved, the masses have a stronger sense of safety and a 
healthy atmosphere prevails while the unhealthy one has been 
checked. However, to ensure a long-term peaceful environment, 
we still face strenuous work in the future. Therefore, during 
the stage of consolidating and imposing restrictions, which 
starts in April, various specific measures for comprehensive 
management must be fully implemented in grass-roots units. 
  Wu Xiangdong, member of the provincial party committee 
standing committee and secretary of the political and judicial 
commission under the provincial party committee, made specific 
arrangements for the work in the next stage. He urged the 
continued strengthening of leadership and establishing and 
improving various responsibility systems for the management of 
public order. He also urged directly linking the work of 
comprehensive management of social order with the assessment of 
work achievement, and with rewards and penalties, so that party 
and government leaders at all levels, and various political and 
judicial departments, will enhance their sense of political 
responsibility for protecting local safety. 
  At the meeting, Comrade Wu Xiangdong also stressed: To 
manage social order in rural areas well, it is necessary to 
strengthen the building of grass roots units and consolidate 
fundamental work at that level. Fourteen prefectures, 
autonomous prefectures, and counties passed on their experiences 
at the meeting, including Changsha, Yueyang, Shaoyang, Lingling, 
Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture, Changde, and others.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wu Yilin (0124 5030 2651): "Support the Work of </F>
Deputies and Welcome Their Supervision"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, the municipal party committee held a 
study and report meeting. Liu Zheng, deputy secretary general 
of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, was 
invited to deliver a report on the study of the "PRC law on the 
people's deputies to the NPC and the local people's congresses 
at all levels." 
  Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, and Wang Daming attended the report 
meeting. Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee, presided over the report meeting. 
  In his report, Comrade Liu Zheng vividly expounded the 
nature, substance, and meaning of the "Law on Deputies" in line 
with China's fundamental political system--the people's congress 
system. He pointed out: The "Law on Deputies" is one of the 
laws related to the people's congress system. This law has 
further defined the legal status of deputies and specifically 
stipulated the work of deputies during the people's congress 
session, their activities after the conclusion of the session, 
and the guarantee for deputies to exercise their duties. The 
promulgation of the "Law on Deputies" has provided a legal basis 
for deputies to exercise their functions, authority, and 
obligation, and to give play to their role. It is also 
conducive to further improving China's people's congress system, 
promoting socialist democracy and the legal system, and 
guaranteeing the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  Addressing the report meeting, Comrade Chen Xitong pointed 
out: In order to promote the study of leading cadres at all 
levels, the municipal party committee has held several study and 
report meetings. To strengthen study, the most fundamental 
thing for the leading comrades to do is to study well Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and Volume No. 3 of "The Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and to conscientiously study the "decision" of the 
third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and a 
series of supporting laws, regulations, and methods related to 
the "decision." Only by conscientiously studying the law can we 
implement it and accelerate the establishment of the socialist 
market economic structure. 
  Comrade Chen Xitong also pointed out: All county and 
district end-of-term elections have ended recently. Leading 
cadres at all levels should pay attention to studying and 
implementing the "Law on Deputies," and the relevant substance 
of the People's Congress system. 
  We must clarify that if party committees and governments at 
all levels want to do their work well, they must respect 
deputies, support their work, and give play to their role. The 
people's deputies represent the interests and will of the masses 
of people. Practice has proved that if greater attention and 
support are paid to deputies, they can carry out their work more 
smoothly and do more things in conformity with the will of the 
people. We should welcome supervision from deputies and regard 
their supervision as their help to the work of the party 
committees and governments at all levels. This will help us to 
do a better job in serving the people and realizing the 
objective of becoming well-off three years ahead of schedule. 
  Leading comrades of the municipal party committee, the 
municipal people's congress standing committee, the municipal 
government, the municipal committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, and the municipal discipline 
inspection commission, principal responsible comrades of 
departments, committees and offices of the municipal government 
and of various districts, counties, and bureaus, and principal 
responsible comrades of the municipal Trade Union Council, the 
Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation also 
attended the meeting.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 23 (XINHUA) -- More than 140 
overseas-funded enterprises have added new investment to their 
original capital in northern China's Tianjin city. 
  The latest statistics show that the newly-added investment 
has totaled 370 million U.S. dollars. Some 10 foreign-funded 
ventures have each poured more than 10 million U.S. dollars into 
their operations. 
  Experts pointed out that high economic returns on 
investments 
and bright investment prospects are the key factors in 
furthering the attraction of overseas investment. 
  The Tianjin economic and technological development zone has 
attracted the largest number of foreign investors in the city. 
So far, some 2,000 foreign-funded enterprises have been 
established in the zone and nearly half of them have started 
operating. 
  Figures show that 85 percent of the operational enterprises 
are showing profits and one-third of them have already recouped 
their investment.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 22 (XINHUA) -- North China's port 
city Tianjin plans to expand ten new high-tech industries in the 
coming five years. Each is intended to have an annual output 
value of at least 500 million yuan (about 57.5 million U.S. 
dollars). 
  Sources from the municipal government indicate that the 
construction of the new project, whose annual output value is 
eventually to total ten billion yuan, has already been started. 
  The move aims to step up the pace of building the city's 
high-tech industrial zones and to boost the new and high-tech 
product growth at a rate of 14.3 percent annually. 
  According to the project designers, in the initial stage of 
the project, priority will be given to development of major 
products such as batteries, educational game machines, special 
materials and new pesticides. 
  With these, the city will add about one billion to its total 
industrial output value yearly.

  [Text] Tianjin looks set to provide the biggest bonanza in 
the current round of massive pay rises quietly being handed out 
to public servants around China. 
  Average pay will rise an unprecedented 60 percent in 1994 
for 
the about 1 million workers in government offices and 
publicly-funded bodies in the city. Average annual pay would 
rise from 2,500 renminbi (about HK$2,200) in 1993 to Rmb4,000 
this year, sources in the municipal government said. 
  China's cabinet, the State Council, ordered all local 
governments to raise public sector pay in a January circular 
that has not been made public in order to avoid arousing 
resentment from workers in state enterprises and the private 
sector. Average public sector pay is expected to rise about 35 
percent this year. 
  The Tianjin party secretary, Gao Dezhan, told delegates at a 
recent municipal people's congress that public sector pay in the 
city, including so-called "grey income", would be raised to 
Beijing levels. 
  "We are so close to Beijing that if we don't pay better, the 
brain drain will worsen," Gao said. 
  Skilled administrators and professionals in the city's 
public 
sector have flocked to Beijing and Guangdong in recent years as 
income gaps widened. 
  An internal study done by the Tianjin government last month 
found that average public sector pay in Tianjin, including 
year-end bonuses as well as various other cash hand-outs, fell 
well below other cities. 
  Taking Tianjin as 1.0, the study rated public service pay in 
Beijing at 1.5, Shanghai 2.0 and Guangzhou 3.0. 
  More than half of the economics department at Nankai 
University had left for other parts of the country in the last 
two years, sources said. 
  To finance the increase in expenditure, the Tianjin city 
government is apparently planning to double the amount of land 
sold this year in the bonded zone near the port and economic 
development zone compared to 1993. 
  "Land prices here are low compared to elsewhere, so we'll 
have to sell a lot of land to finance this," Gao said. 
  In addition, Progressive pay rises would be made steeper, 
with top civil servants and professors able to earn Rmb700 a 
month compared with Rmb400-500 for the previous level.

  [Text] Geneva, March 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan has formally 
protested a Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) decision to change its name in CITES reports on 
wildlife conservation. 
  The Taiwan delegation to a CITES Standing Committee meeting 
here issued a strongly-worded statement Thursday [24 March] 
saying Taiwan is not a province of the People's Republic of 
China and has never been ruled by Beijing. 
  The statement also expressed regret over Beijing's attempt 
to 
"politicize" wildlife conservation issues. "Such 
politically-motivated moves will do no good for wildlife 
conservation and we will never accept the name change," the 
statement said. 
  Under strong Beijing pressure, the United Nations wildlife 
conservation organization decided to refer to "Taiwan" as 
"Taiwan, China" in its reports on wildlife conservation on the 
island. 
  The statement, issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, said Beijing's attempt to downgrade Taiwan's status in 
the international arena would only worsen relations across the 
Taiwan Strait and cannot alter the fact that Taiwan is a 
separate political entity. 
  The English-language statement also said Taiwan will 
continue 
its efforts to eliminate illicit trade in endangered species and 
actively join in world wildlife conservation programs. 
  The statement has been distributed to foreign delegates to 
the CITES Standing Committee meeting, including committee 
Chairman Murray Hosking.

  [Text] Taipei, March 25 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan Friday 
[25 March] expressed regret over a preliminary decision by a 
United Nations wildlife conservation organization suggesting its 
members adopt stricter measures against Taiwan for failing to 
eliminate illegal trade in endangered species. 
  Commenting on reports from Geneva saying the UN's Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has accused 
Taiwan of failing to crack down on illicit wildlife trade in an 
expedient manner, Lien said the allegation was unfair. 
  "Taiwan has not fallen behind world wildlife conservation 
standards," Lien said. "We hope major world wildlife 
conservation organizations can recognize our efforts in this 
regard." 
  The CITES Secretariat Thursday unveiled a package of 14 
suggestions on how to eliminate rhino horn and tiger bone trade 
in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mainland China and Vietnam. 
  The package generally gave positive, lenient assessments of 
wildlife conservation efforts in Hong Kong, South Korea, 
Mainland China and Vietnam, but took a harsher attitude toward 
Taiwan. 
  It said Taiwan has so far failed to update its conservation 
law, complete consolidation of rhino horn and tiger bone 
stockpiles and totally eliminate rhino horn trade. It thus 
recommended that "all CITES parties implement stricter domestic 
measures against Taiwan, including prohibition of trade in 
wildlife species." 
  The CITES Standing Committee, which is meeting in Geneva, 
will continue to discuss the package Friday afternoon and will 
decide whether to formally recommend trade sanctions on Taiwan 
over conservation issues. 
  Local trade officials said if CITES does call on its members 
to ban wildlife trade with Taiwan, the impact would be minimal. 
  Taiwan's wildlife product trade totals about US$20 million 
annually, according to statistics compiled by the Board of 
Foreign Trade. 
  However, the board pointed out that if the United States 
decides to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan in line with the 
CITES recommendation, the effect would be much greater. 
  The US, Taiwan's largest export outlet, could first ban 
wildlife product trade with Taiwan and if Taiwan fails to 
improve crackdowns on illicit wildlife trade within six months, 
the US then could ban imports of other Taiwan products, the 
board said. 
  Meanwhile, Chairman Sun Ming-hsien of the Council of 
Agriculture said Taiwan has made enormous efforts in wildlife 
conservation in recent years. "We'll step up publicity to help 
the world understand our progress in this regard," Sun noted.

  [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- In hopes of speeding 
Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), Premier Lien Chan urged the government to increase and 
coordinate efforts and cooperation with all social sectors. 
  Lien made the remarks on Saturday [12 March] at a briefing 
by 
Vice Economic Minister Sheu Ke-sheng on issues regarding 
Taiwan's GATT membership, such as how membership would affect 
the local economy. 
  Sheu said that if Taiwan fails in its bid to join GATT, it 
will not be able to establish fair and normal trade relations 
with other countries, which would badly hurt the competitiveness 
of local industries in the world market because Taiwan products 
would not be granted lower tariffs by GATT members. 
  Failing to become a GATT member would not only reduce the 
chances of Taiwan's becoming a member of other international 
organizations like the United Nations, World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund, but would also negatively affect 
Taiwan's bid to become an Asia- Pacific operations hub and to 
become a member in full standing of the international community. 
  Sheu cited a report by the Chung-hua Institute for Economic 
Research as saying that Taiwan's gross domestic product and 
export volume would increased by 2.13 percent and 34.7 percent, 
respectively, by 2002 after Taiwan joins GATT. Import volume 
should grow by 58#8 [figure indistinct] percent, and the trade 
surplus should decline about ntgdrtp billion [figure indistinct] 
(US$17 billion), the report said. 
  Stressing that GATT membership is of great importance to 
improving Taiwan's economy, Lien said that all relevant 
government agencies should join forces to facilitate Taiwan's 
entry into GATT. 
  Saying that the government is already taking measures to 
ease 
the impact GATT will have on local industries, Lien asked 
relevant government authorities to work harder to communicate 
with both the private and public sectors with the academic 
community and the legislature in order to prepare Taiwan for 
GATT entry. 
  Meanwhile, Hsiao Wan-chang, the chairman of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, called on all government 
agencies to increase the pace of reforms necessary to fall in 
line with GATT rules. 
  Dismissing rumors that Taiwan's bid to join GATT is 
politically motivated: Hsiao said the government has no choice 
but to become a member of GATT because GATT policies would have 
an influence on government policies whether Taiwan joins GATT or 
not.

  [Text] Geneva, March 23 (CNA) -- Representatives from 
Chile and New Zealand Wednesday [23 March] expressed strong 
support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  They also hoped that Taiwan's GATT entry would help boost 
bilateral trade ties, Huang Yen-chao, director-general of the 
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) told reporters here. Huang is in 
Geneva for a series of bilateral tariff negotiations with GATT 
members. 
  Ernesto Tironi Barrios, Chile's chief negotiator, said he 
supported early GATT entry for Taiwan based on Taiwan's current 
economic and trade situation and its efforts to speed up tariff 
and taxation reforms. 
  Barrios, who asked Taiwan to cut import duties on 27 
agricultural and 37 industrial products, reportedly was pleased 
as most of his requests met with favorable responses from the 
Taiwan delegates. 
  Chile is a major exporter of apples, pears, peaches and 
brass. 
  Chief New Zealand negotiator Alastair Bisley, who issued a 
list of 300 items for tariff reductions, also asked Taiwan to 
levy a single tax on imported beef and eliminate its current 
multi-tier system. 
  Both Barrios and Bisley expressed concern that Taiwan is 
still protecting its agricultural sector by imposing quantity 
controls and area restrictions on farm imports. 
  Although Taiwan has pledged to adhere to GATT's fair-trade 
practices and applied to join GATT as a developed country, 
Huang, leader of the Taiwan delegation, noted that some of 
Taiwan's industries are not fully developed and still require 
some protection. 
  "We hope that Taiwan's non-tariff trade barriers can be 
transferred into tariffication in seven years which complies 
with the free trade spirit of the Uruguay Round trade accord," 
Huang told his counterpart negotiators. 
  Besides Chile and New Zealand, Taiwan officials have 
negotiated with representatives from Hungary and South Africa 
since Monday. 
  Both Hungary and South Africa said Taiwan should eliminate 
non-tariff trade barriers like regional restrictions and 
quantity controls. They added that Taiwan's prohibition on the 
import of red beans, green beans and animal internal organs is 
not acceptable. 
  Taiwan negotiators will meet with officials from Turkey and 
Australia Thursday and Friday for more bilateral tariff talks. 
  According to Huang, 21 countries have requested 
tariff-reduction negotiations with Taiwan. Results of these 
talks will be key to Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based 
world trade body. 
  Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer under the name 
of "the Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" 
in September 1992, is expected to become a full member by the 
end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, March 16 (CNA) -- The Council of Labor 
Affairs will reconsider its decision to suspend imports of Thai 
laborers now that Bangkok has given its assurances that it will 
try to prevent irregularities involved in their hiring, a labor 
administrator said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The council, after consulting with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, decided earlier this month to suspend the hiring of 
Thai workers unless Bangkok took steps to prevent Thai placement 
agencies from exacting unreasonably high brokers' fees or 
illegally sending workers to Taiwan before the start of their 
contracts. 
  The Thailand Trade and Economics Office in Taipei, which 
represents Thai interests here in the absence of diplomatic 
relations between the two countries, sent a letter to the 
council Tuesday expressing the Thai Government's determination 
to resolve all related issues. 
  The Thai representative office said in the letter that the 
Thai Government has revoked business licenses for 40-plus 
manpower brokerage houses that have been charging unreasonably 
high fees for their services. The Thai Government has also 
agreed to sponsor various orientation programs to help its 
nationals intending to work in Taiwan understand Taiwan's labor 
laws and other regulations. 
  A spokesman for the Thai office said Taiwan's manpower 
brokers are also to blame for high brokering fees in the 
importation of Thai workers. "We hope our two countries can 
cooperate to eliminate all irregularities," the official said. 
  Thailand also wants labor administrators from the two 
countries to meet in the near future to discuss the signing of a 
bilateral labor agreement, the official said. 
  More than 60,000 Thai laborers are working in Taiwan, making 
Thailand Taiwan's largest source on alien workers. Thai workers 
are welcome here because they are perceived as being diligent, 
highly skilled, and obedient. If the government suspends entry 
of Thai laborers, labor market sources said, some local 
labor-intensive industries may be affected.

  [Text] The average Hong Konger finds National People's 
congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) proceedings about as interesting as 
Legislative Council meetings -- close to nil. Both only draw 
attention by the theatrical and the penned darts from newspaper 
commentators which generally pass for "public opinion" here. 
  This year's NPC-CPPCC meetings have been extremely dull. But 
there has been no shortage of political "entertainment" for Hong 
Kong people. 
  For sheer pathos, there was nothing to beat Mr Law 
Cheung-kwok's troublesome hand. By his own admission, the 
feeling of nationalism was so overpowering that his hand just 
shot up -- joining a host of others who support a resolution on 
the dissolution of Hong Kong's pre-1997 British-made political 
structure when China resumes sovereignty over the territory. 
  Economist, securities firm director and vice-chairman of the 
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, Mr Law's 
errant hand didn't just raise eyebrows, it also raises some 
important questions about Hong Kong people. 
  The first -- whether he has gone against party policy -- was 
quickly answered by Mr Law himself. He had. Tearfully, he 
explained that he had been so overwhelmed by the nationalistic 
sentiments, he didn't know what he was doing. 
  But somewhat naively, he said he still subscribed to the 
"spirit of the statement". The following day, he denounced the 
CPPCC as a "hand raising machine". If he thought those 
statements would somehow absolve him, he was mistaken. The 
Liberals and the media were after his head. He flew back, 
apologised to all, resigned from his party post and returned to 
the conference -- certain in the knowledge that the media 
commentators would not allow him to put the incident behind 
him...ever. 
  As far as the majority of media are concerned, he can kiss 
goodbye the West Kowloon Legislative Council seat that he's been 
eyeing since 1991. 
  The incident highlighted the extent to which media people 
have become polarised over political reforms and 1997. 
  Mr Law's move also raised the even more important question 
of 
how much the Hong Kong media and the Liberals -- really 
understand China. More than a billion people live across the 
vast expanse of China, for whom Hong Kong is an emotional issue 
of terrifying proportions. Neither the CPPCC nor the NPC, need 
to orchestrate the raising of hands when it comes to adopting 
resolutions on the recovery of Hong Kong, especially when 
accompanied by denunciations of the British. Many of those 
members would be quite prepared to lead a charge across the 
border to reclaim Hong Kong with their bare hands. It is that 
emotional. 
  It is the same emotion which has driven Ms Dorothy Liu 
Yiu-chu all these years -- and partly helped propel her into her 
star turns this year. 
  To say she is angry over the appointment of several people 
to 
various national organisations who had previously served the 
British, is an understatement. She is raving mad about it. 
  So, to wide applause and laughter from Hong Kong, she took 
it 
out on the Chinese leadership. Her first turn was an obvious 
winner as far as the media was concerned. Prevented from 
meeting Hong Kong reporters in her allotted room at the Beijing 
Hotel, she rented another room on a different floor to host her 
own talk-shows. 
  Her next turn, however, didn't bring the house down. People 
thought she had gone a bit too far in making fun of Premier Li 
Peng. Most people recognised that Mr Li's slip of the tongue -- 
for a split second blaming China for the breakdown in 
Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political reforms was only 
all too human. 
  The day after his speech, she turned up at a Hong Kong group 
meeting to say that although the text had correctly blamed the 
British and had been distributed to all deputies in advance, 
most had not read it and had listened to the speech instead. 
  She was aghast that none other than the prime minister 
himself had put the blame oh the nation. Could he clarify? The 
response was stoney silence. Some would probably have thought 
it unbecoming of a daughter of a national hero. 
  Undeterred, she turned on XINHUA's Hong Kong director, Mr 
Zhou Nan. Ever since the establishment of the Preliminary 
Working Committee she had been mad at him. Was it not him and 
Mr Lu Ping who appointed those "turncoats" -- former Executive 
Councillors Ms Rita Fan, Ms Maria Tam and Sir S.Y. Chung -- to 
the PWC and the CPPCC? She didn't quite put it that way. It 
would been too nice. Instead, she told the panel: "In Hong 
Kong, we have someone who behaves like a decadent son of a very 
rich man, wasting away the family treasures." Pointedly, she 
explained that the man who had amassed the family fortune was 
none other than Mr Xu Jiatun. And the wastrel Mr Zhou Nan. 
  Considering that Mr Xu has defected to the United States the 
comparison was devastating. 
  The "fortune" refers to the support gathered by the affable 
Mr Xu. Some of those supporters have been disappointed by Mr 
Zhou, a rigid hard-liner who probably would have nothing to do 
with anyone who had served the British, if not for orders from 
on high and the requirements demanded for a united front. It 
was a terrible slap in the face for Mr Zhou. And it came from 
someone who fully understands how important face is in this 
community. Mr Zhou maintained a stoic silence. It won her top 
marks from the media. 
  She didn't let it rest there. Accosting Mr Zhou in the lobby 
of the Beijing Hotel, surrounded by the a group of Hong Kong 
reporters, she demanded: "Is your appointment legal?" Or words 
to that effect. 
  Some months ago, Mr Xu said in his serialised memoirs from 
California that Mr Zhou's appointment (in the confused period 
after Tiananmen in 1989) had not gone through the formal 
procedures of approval by the NPC. 
  The post of director in Hong Kong is equivalent to that of a 
minister.

<F P=106> [By Gavin Patterson, Deputy Business Editor, and Ming Man] </F>
  [Text] Jardine Matheson yesterday carried out its threat 
to delist its shares from Hong Kong, drawing immediate criticism 
from China and heralding the beginning of the end of British 
rule in the territory. Its shares will cease trading on 31 
December when all transactions will move to London, the home of 
the company's primary listing. 
  Reaction was quick and ranged from anger to regret. 
  A Chinese official in Hong Kong immediately attacked the 
British trading giant for being irresponsible, even though 
Beijing has long targeted the hong [large trading company] over 
its origins as an opium dealer on the mainland. 
  Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the XINHUA News Agency, 
said: "The Chinese side doesn't want to see any company ignore 
Hong Kong's economic development and Hong Kong people's interest 
by doing something extremely irresponsible." But Jardine 
director Sir Charles Powell denied the group was moving out of 
the territory or that it lacked confidence in the future. "In 
no way does this decision mark a withdrawal from Hong Kong," he 
said. "We have full confidence in the future and I would expect 
our business to increase." 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod also dismissed claims 
that the delist ing would affect confidence inthe local business 
community. "I think it's a great pity to see the delisting of 
Jardine. We have had an extended dialogue on the subject. We 
must not exaggerate the effect," Sir Hamish told reporters 
yesterday afternoon. "It is merely a delisting but, 
nevertheless, I think it is a pity and it takes a modest amount 
of capitalisation out of the Hong Kong stock market. 
  "Of course it has been more than compensated by the increase 
in capitalisation over the past year or so, but it is a pity and 
I regret it." 
  Sir Hamish said Jardine had made it clear the company would 
continue to operate and be a major employer and trader in the 
territory. 
  However, Liberal Party legislator Allen Lee attacked the 
decision saying it was irresponsible as the company had made so 
much money out of the territory. "I think it's very 
unfortunate. Jardine has a long history and connection with 
Hong Kong," Mr Lee said. United Democrats legislator Dr Huang 
Chen-ya also took the China line, saying: "It's not very 
responsible." 
  He said the Securities &amp; Futures Commission (SFC) should 
protect the interests of small shareholders. Dr Huang feared 
that small investors might panic and sell their shares off 
cheaply. "They might be afraid that they may not be able to 
trade in these shares properly in the future," he said. 
  Sir Charles said the group had taken great pains in 
explaining its decision to the Chinese and added that the move 
was purely due to regulatory reasons. "To delist is not a 
drama, far from it. It will have no effect on our business, it 
concerns only the details of how we are regulated," he said. 
  The company has fought a long but unsuccessful battle with 
the SFC to avoid being regulated by Hong Kong's code on 
takeovers and mergers after the territory returns to China in 
1997. 
  The SFC said it regretted the decision to delist but added 
it 
would not be justified in granting special treatment to Jardine, 
or any company, by exempting them from the local code.

  [Text] The Hong Kong government does not need the 
Legislative Council's approval to set up a court of final appeal 
as there is already an agreement between Britain and China, a 
senior Chinese official said yesterday. He made the comment as 
the Government has been reminding legislators that time is 
running out for the court of final appeal to be set up before 
the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. But the Chinese official 
said the Govermnent should just set up the court in accordance 
with the 1991 Sino-British secret deal on the composition of the 
court. It stipulates that only one overseas judge out of five 
may sit in the court of final appeal after 1997, a point which 
has been a bone of contention between the two countries. 
  The Legislative Council has passed a motion which stated 
that 
a bill for the court would be rejected. 
  "Everybody knows that the Legislative Council is just a 
consultative body to the Governor, who has the right to withhold 
his consent to Legco decisions," the official said. 
  "It is like the Joint Declaration. Can the Government put 
the Joint Declaration to the Legco? "Is it the case that only 
after receiving the approval from the Legco can the Government 
implement the Joint Declaration?" The comment was echoed by 
Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the New China News Agency 
(Xinhua) yesterday. 
  Speaking at a function, Zhang said that by seeking Legco's 
approval on the issue, the Government was "binding its own hands 
and feet" and "asking for trouble". "Britain and China have 
already reached agreement on the court of final appeal. Britain 
should just act in strict accordance with the agreement," Zhang 
said. "The Legco is being placed by the Government at an 
inappropriately high level." 
  Richard Hoare, the director of administration, called the 
Chinese comments a "misunderstanding". "You can't set up a 
court without legislation. You can't pass legislation without 
putting it to the Legco," said Hoare. He said the Joint 
Declaration certainly did not need to be put to the Legislative 
Council. 
  "But there are a lot of things that come out of the Joint 
Declaration that have to be put to Legco for implemention where 
the change of law is required," he said. He said China ought to 
feel pleased because the Government was not proposing to go back 
on the agreement. 
  "We have drafted the bill on the basis of the composition we 
agreed with the Chinese side," he said. "But we still need to 
pass the legislation. It is not something that you can just set 
up. "You've got to set out the composition of the court, the 
power of the court, the supporting of the court bill, like 
registrar. There are all sorts of things like these which need 
to be clearly specified in the legislation." 
  It is understood that the Government has started lobbying 
legislators to pass the bill once it is approved by the 
Executive Council next month. China will also be consulted on 
the draft bill before it is put to Legco. An appointed 
legislator, Christine Loh, said it would be technically 
incorrect if the court of final appeal was set up without Legco 
approval. 
  "What we are talking about is having legislation to set up 
the court which is something Hong Kong does not have the 
moment," she said. "In our system we need to sever the links 
with the Privy Council and to set up the court. So we need 
legislation. "Perhaps Chinese officials don't understand how 
our system works," she added. "There is nothing the Government 
can do without law giving it power."

<F P=106> [By Gareth Hewett] </F>
  [Text] The final act in the 10-year drama surrounding 
Jardine Matheson's bid to escape Chinese rule was played 
yesterday when the powerful hong announced that its shares would 
not be traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange from December 31. 
  The widely expected move to de-list the stock was announced 
at lunchtime, provoking some rapid reaction from local 
regulators who have been refusing to compromise with the group. 
The move ends a drive by the company to remove itself from Hong 
Kong legal jurisdiction, beginning with its famous shift of 
domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda in 1984. 
  Group managing director Nigel Rich and director Sir Charles 
Powell stressed the group still planned to invest in Hong Kong. 
Sir Charles said: "It is not a drama." 
  Mr Rich added: "While there may be some impact on our 
business in China, we do not think it will be of a significant 
nature." The group does about U.S.$1 billion (HK$7.72 billion) 
of business in gross revenues with China. 
  The decision to de-list the company, with a market 
capitalisation of $38.8 billion representing 1.66 percent of 
total market capitalization, is expected to be followed by the 
similar de-listing of Jardine Strategic Holdings. But the 
Securities and Futures Commission has warned that Jardines will 
still come under its rules, even after the de-listing, because 
it is a public company in Hong Kong. 
  The group, whose interests range from the Mandarin Oriental 
Hotel to Wellcome Stores and Hongkong Land to Jardine Fleming, 
yesterday announced profits up 23 percent last year to 
U.S.$388.8 million. 
  A public statement from the princely hong with 150 years' 
history said they were de-listing because they could not come to 
an agreement with the territory's chief regulator, the 
Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), on exemption from local 
rules involving a takeover code. 
  Chairman Henry Keswick said: "After extensive discussions, 
the SFC has concluded that exemptions or general waivers from 
the Hong Kong code are not appropriate. 
  "In the circumstances, the board [of Jardine Matheson] has 
reluctantly decided that it should terminate the company's 
contractual link to the Hong Kong code by withdrawing its 
secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange." The 
statement triggered a series of quickly arranged meetings and a 
flurry of statements. 
  Jardines shares were suspended from trading on the exchange 
in the afternoon. The stock fell $4.75 to $49.25 in the morning 
session. The Hang Seng Index, after a jittery morning, leapt 
465 points to 9,456. At 3.30 pm Financial Secretary Sir Hamish 
Macleod expressed his regret and sadness at the de-listing 
decision. "Over the past three years, all parties concerned -- 
the company, the SFC and the Government -- have spared no effort 
to address Jardine Matheson's concerns, while at the same time 
ensuring that investors' interests would be adequately protected 
and the integrity of our market would not be compromised," Sir 
Hamish said. 
  Later in the day, a vice-director of local XINHUA (the New 
China News Agency), Zheng Guoxiong, criticized Jardines' move as 
"very irresponsible". "Between now and 1997 and beyond, it will 
take our concerted efforts to maintain Hong Kong's status as an 
international financial centre," said Mr Zheng. 
  "We don't want to see companies failing to take into account 
Hong Kong's economic development and Hong Kong people's 
interests and take very irresponsible action," he added. Senior 
British trade commissioner Francis Cornish said it was a pity 
that agreement over Jardine Matheson's plans could not be 
reached. "But we need to be clear what Jardine are doing. 
  "They are adjusting their listing arrangements. They are not 
pulling out of Hong Kong." 
  At merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, director Andrew Hall said: 
"This is not as critical to Hong Kong confidence as the decision 
to move to Bermuda in 1984 or the decision to have a primary 
listing in London in 1992." In a packed press conference at the 
penthouse suite of Jardine House, Mr Rich and Sir Charles 
defended the move. 
  "This is a decision related to our listing. It does not 
affect our business. It is not a drama," said Sir Charles. 
  After re-domiciling in 1984, the company obtained primary 
listing status in London in 1992 and obtained a secondary 
special status in Hong Kong exempting them from regulation by 
the stock exchange. 
  The SFC remained the chief regulator on takeovers because 
under British law companies domiciled outside the United Kingdom 
are not covered by Britain's Bermuda's takeover code stipulates 
that anyone acquiring 30 percent of a company's shares must make 
a general offer, where as Hong Kong's trigger point is 35 
percent. Jardines is said to believe the Bermudan formula makes 
them less vulnerable to a takeover raid. 
  Jardine Matheson supported the setting up of the takeover 
code in Bermuda and argued this meant they could obtain 
exemption from Hong Kong's code governing such transactions. 
  The SFC could not agree to this and as a public company, 
whether listed or not, maintained that it remained within Hong 
Kong jurisdiction in takeovers and mergers. SFC chairman Robert 
Nottle said takeover regulation from Bermuda was not practical 
because it was the other side of the globe and it did not 
sufficiently protect the interests of shareholders. 
  The request for exemption was to create a unified British 
based system of securities regulations governing the group 
companies. The objective reflects the company's British origins 
and its international character, the company said. 
  Sir Charles denied the decision to de-list was linked to 
fears of what might happen to the group when territorial 
sovereignty goes to China. In his statement, Mr Keswick said: 
"I would emphasise that our decision is related to the 
regulatory position of the company and does not signal any lack 
of confidence in the future of Hong Kong itself." 
  "Now that a new era is beginning we are as confident as ever 
in Hong Kong's future as a special administrative region of the 
Peoples Republic of China. 
  "We are today one of the largest investors in Hong Kong as 
well as being its largest private employer and we wish to 
continue to expand our investment in and business links with 
Hong Kong, China and the whole of Asia Pacific region."

<F P=106> [By Beverly Chau] </F>
  [Text] A Hong Kong businessman plans to sue the Hunan 
authorities for "illegal detention" and withholding his 
passport. Dr Philip Cheng Hui-ho returned to the territory last 
night after having been kept in China for seven months in 
relation to an investment dispute with his Chinese partners. 
  A Chinese American, Dr Cheng said yesterday he wanted to 
clear his name with the Hunan court for detaining him for six 
days under horrid conditions and withholding his passport until 
last Tuesday [22 March]. Dr Cheng, 62, head of the Journalism 
and Communications Department of the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong before he went into business in 1991, said he would sue the 
Hunan court for "illegal detention" for the sake of improving 
China's judiciary system. 
  Dr Cheng said he would seek legal advice in Hong Kong before 
pursuing the case in China. "My case is a cumbersome one, but I 
think a legal issue is at stake. I will pursue it through legal 
proceedings," he said. 
  His wife Marie said yesterday the fact the authorities had 
allowed her husband to leave the country did not mean the case 
was finished. "The authorities have been wrong in this case," 
said Mrs Cheng, adding it was the couple's "legal right" to seek 
justice. Dr Cheng said he would pursue the battle until justice 
was done. "I hope I can do something for the (legal) system. I 
hope my case would make people aware of the problem." he said. 
  Dr Cheng is chairman of Zhuhai Golex, a bicycle-helmet 
factory in Zhuhai. The company was in partnership with a 
mainland company the Hunan Arts and Crafts Import and Export 
Company. Dr Cheng's nightmare started last August as he was 
re-negotiating a business deal with his mainland partner in a 
hotel room in Changsha. Court security guards burst into the 
room and arrested him. His mainland partner accused him of 
misappropriating funds and demanded his investment of US$165,000 
(HK$1,273,000) back. 
  During a three-day interrogation in a guest house which 
doubled as a detention centre, Dr Cheng was told to return the 
sum immediately or face a jail term. His family said Dr Cheng 
was interrogated for three days and nights by as many as a dozen 
officials in a detention centre run by the brother-in-law of Dr 
Cheng's business partner. Dr Cheng, who is diabetic, was denied 
sleep and fainted repeatedly, according to his family. 
  He was released on September 1, six days after his arrest 
but 
was told not to leave Changsha. The US Embassy in Beijing 
intervened on his behalf and Dr Cheng was allowed last October 
to leave Changsha for Zhuhai, where his factory is located. Dr 
Cheng said at one point he was told his passport would be 
returned to him on condition he was to "forget all about the 
months of ordeal" and pledge not to take legal action against 
the authorities. He refused to take up the offer. 
  Last Friday [18 March], the Intermediary Court of Hunan came 
to the conclusion that the Hong Kong businessman "had been 
wrongly arrested". Dr Cheng said his passport was returned to 
him on Tuesday after a civil court in Hunan had examined other 
evidence. 
  The American citizen admitted that he was able to get back 
the passport because of guanxi, a special relationship with the 
authorities. Sounding cheerful yesterday, Dr Cheng said, "I 
feel great. Finally I am free and can be back home."

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The Hong Kong 
Government will make heavy investments to improve road and rail 
links which serve Hong Kong's trade, tourism and investment in 
the Chinese mainland, a government official said. 
  Addressing the Japan Federation of Economic Organization 
(Keidanren) here today, Donald Tsing, secretary for the 
Treasury, said big investment will also be launched to meet the 
everyday needs of the population. 
  A major expansion of the Lowu station would be completed 
early next year, and the government was considering the 
feasibility of a new railway to the border through the northwest 
New Territories to link up with the Chinese national rail 
system, he said. He added that planning for more container 
terminals is under way. 
  He said the government was particularly satisfied that many 
Japanese construction firms had participated in the government 
funded core program projects of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok 
and helped contribute towards the remarkable progress to-date. 
  Opportunities are plenty for private sector participation in 
Hong Kong's major infrastructural projects for the coming years, 
the secretary said. 
  "Hong Kong will continue to prosper as we embark on our 
ambitious but essential works programs to build for the future," 
he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong's trade 
with Germany totalled 80 billion H.K. dollars [Hong Kong 
dollars] (10.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1993, an increase of 12 
percent over the previous year, according to the Trade 
Development Council (TDC) here today. 
  Germany increased its exports to the territory by 14 percent 
last year over 1992 to reach 25 billion H.K. dollars (3.2 
billion U.S. dollars), of which more than half were subsequently 
re-exported to the Chinese mainland and other regional markets. 
  Clothing makes up over two thirds of Hong Kong's domestic 
exports to Germany. Among other major exports were watches, 
office machinery, photographic equipment and jewelry. 
  The TDC released the figures following a recent two-day Hong 
Kong-Chinese mainland business trip by a 24-member delegation 
from the Nuremberg Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Germany. 
  "The Far East and China are the markets of the future. We 
are encouraging our members to seek joint ventures in China 
either directly, or through Hong Kong," said the chamber's 
President Gusti Drechsler was quoted as saying at the end of the 
trip. 
  "Labor costs are high in Germany. Our company is considering 
manufacturing its products in China for sale in the Pacific Rim 
markets. Hong Kong could be conduit for this activity," a 
delegation member William Sell said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Beijing Warns German DER SPEIGEL </F>
Reporter That He Must Bear the Consequences for Illegally 
Contacting Wei Jingsheng"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, an official from the mainland Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs gave a serious warning to Chou Chin-heng, a 
German reporter who frequently contacted Wei Jingsheng, noting 
that the reporter's contact with Wei Jingsheng constituted 
involvement in mainland's politics and also a violation of its 
laws. If he continues to disregard exhortations, he will bear 
all consequences rising therefrom. 
  At an appointment he made with German DER SPEIGEL reporter 
Chou Chin-heng yesterday morning, Han Zuomin, deputy director of 
the Information Department of the mainland Foreign Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, stated: Wei Jingsheng is a criminal released 
on parole. According to law, foreign journalists are not allowed 
to contact criminals released on parole. Han Zuomin went on to 
say: He made the above remark on behalf of Wu Jianmin 
[spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. 
  It has been learned that the reporter of German nationality 
was stationed in Beijing in 1990. After Wei Jinhsheng was 
released from jail, the reporter got acquainted with him. In 
early March this year, on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's visit to Beijing, together with his wife of 
Taiwanese origin and child, the reporter was interrogated by the 
public security organ for an hour and a half. The next day, an 
official from the Information Department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs appeared personally to warn the reporter that, 
according to law, contacting criminals released on parole is a 
violation of law, and Wei Jingsheng is precisely such a 
criminal. He hoped the reporter would understand the point. 
  Early yesterday morning, the mainland Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs again summoned the reporter and warned him not to carry 
out activities in violation of law by making use of his wife of 
Taiwanese origin and son. Immediately after that, the reporter 
issued the above report to various news agencies.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (AFP) -- Zhai Weimin, leader of 
the pro-democracy movement crushed at Tiananmen Square in June 
1989, has been in jail in central China's Henan province since 
his March 6 arrest, his family said Friday. They said he was 
being held at Yeshugou jail, near the city of Xinan in the 
western part of Henan province. 
  The arrest of the 23-year-old dissident came as part of a 
vast security offensive against dissidents in China beginning 
early this month. At least 18 people were picked up. 
  Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, Xinan police said they 
"knew" Zhai but "did not know" where he was. 
  A family member said the dissident was allowed to see his 
youngest sister, Zhai Yujie, on Friday morning, but that the 
police would not divulge the reasons for his arrest. Those 
close to Zhai, however, suspect he will be held at least until 
June 4, the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  Zhai, number six on the "list of most-wanted students" after 
the pro-democracy movement was smashed, was arrested in early 
1990 and spent three-and-a-half years in prison for 
"counter-revolutionary propaganda" before being freed last 
September 13. His release came just a few days before the 
selection of a site for the 2000 summer games. The Chinese 
capital lost out to Sydney, Australia. 
  Three recent arrests of dissident lawyers Zhou Guoqiang, 
Yuan 
Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi have been confirmed by the authorities 
recently. Friends of Yuan and Wang said this week that they had

  [Excerpts] State Council Premier Li Peng arrived at the 
Taiwan Hall in the Great Hall of the People on the morning of 14 
March to listen and participate in the discussion and 
deliberation of the Hainan provincial delegation to the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] on the 
government work report. 
  Premier Li Peng's presence was welcomed by all the deputies. 
The Premier cordially shook hands with them. Ruan Chongwu, 
head of the deletion, told Premier Li Peng of Hainan's primary 
work in 1993 and the conditions of Hainan's national economic 
development. [passage omitted] 
  After earnestly listening to the deputies' speeches, Premier 
Li Peng said that the Hainan Special Economic Zone has its own 
characteristics. Its development should not follow Shenzhen's 
pattern -- characterized by comprehensive development, but 
should focus on certain areas to make breakthroughs in. Hainan 
currently has some difficulties due to its weak economic 
foundation, but it has the advantages of rich resources and 
favorable policies. These benefits must be given full play to 
accelerate the building of Haikou, Yangpu, and Sanya and propel 
the whole province to make progress. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to a report from Beijing by special staff 
reporter Yu Wei, this morning, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, joined a meeting of the Jiangxi delegation to examine 
and discuss the government work report. He said: Jiangxi has 
been developing fairly rapidly in recent years. In particular, 
it has attached importance to educational work. The key to 
economic development and invigoration lies in training qualified 
personnel. The Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee and government 
have firmly grasped education. This will definitely play a very 
positive role in Jiangxi's future development. 
  The full meeting of the Jiangxi delegation, held this 
morning, was presided over by provincial CPC Secretary Mao 
Zhiyong. Huang Zhiquan, Huang Maoheng, Hua Tong, Lu Derong, 
(Liu Yizhong), (Li Lide), Huang Dingyuan, and others spoke. In 
light of Jiangxi's practical reality, they aired their views 
freely on issues such as educational reform, financial and tax 
system reform, foreign trade structural reform, the purchase and 
marketing of grain, special funds for grain storage, the 
development of light vehicles, and strengthening infrastructure 
projects. 
  Vice Premier Li Lanqing fully affirmed those good opinions 
and suggestions made by the people's deputies. He said: It is 
necessary to take effective measures to solve the problem of pay 
and conditions, and housing for teachers. Input for education 
must be increased, and the teachers' law must be enforced well. 
He pointed out: The fundamental solution for education lies in 
reform. It is necessary to adjust well the macrostructure of 
education. First of all, major efforts must be concentrated on 
basic education. This is a matter of vital importance which 
concerns the quality of our nationals as a whole. Furthermore, 
it is necessary to develop vocational education. The majority 
of Chinese youths rely on vocational education to train 
themselves into useful persons. Reform in higher education must 
place its emphasis on improving quality. 
  Financial Minister Liu Zhongli and Minister of Forestry Xu 
Youfang were also present at today's discussion of the Jiangxi 
delegation.

  [Text] According to a special dispatch from Beijing by 
staff reporter Ding Yongsheng, yesterday, Li Lanqing, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of 
the State Council, and Wang Hanbin, executive chairman of the 
Presidium of the Second Session of the Eighth NPC and vice 
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, joined the Yunnan 
delegation to examine and discuss Premier Li Peng's government 
work report. During the discussion, people's deputies were 
enthusiastic in expressing their views. Centering on the 
government work report, they aired their views on further 
speeding up the pace of opening up, conducting scientific and 
technical structural reform well, developing economy and 
education in areas inhabited by minority nationalities, 
safeguarding social order, and other items. 
  While attentively listening to the speeches of people's 
deputies, Li Lanqing and Wang Hanbin took notes from time to 
time, and exchanged views with them on certain issues. After 
the deputies finished making their speeches, Vice Premier Li 
Lanqing said: Last year was a crucial year in which our country 
advanced toward the socialist market economic system. Various 
major reform measures were promulgated. This involved many 
aspects and faced great difficulties. A stable political 
situation and social environment were needed. 
  Li Lanqing stressed: Doing price reform well is a key to 
handling relations between developing reform and maintaining 
stability. Governments at all levels must take practical 
measures to control commodity prices within a scope that the 
masses can bear. In particular, prices of food and vegetables, 
which are closely connected with people's livelihood, must be 
effectively dealt with. Only thus can various kinds of reform 
progress smoothly. Li Lanqing also pointed out: China must 
never rely on foreign countries to solve the problem of feeding 
the people. It is imperative to assign agriculture a most 
fundamental strategic position and develop it well. 
  While talking about the issue of economic development in 
border areas inhabited by minority nationalities, which deputies 
paid close attention to, Li Lanqing emphasized: The central 
authorities have considered the development of areas inhabited 
by minority nationalities as a major strategic issue. Yunnan is 
rich in natural resources, and has many strong points. It is 
necessary to give play to these strong points. First of all, 
efforts must be made to strengthen infrastructure projects such 
as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. We must 
study how to make use of foreign capital for the exploitation of 
natural resources. 
  He fully affirmed our province's achievements in developing 
education for minority nationalities. He said: Many areas in 
Yunan have persisted in developing education despite 
difficulties. They have thus grasped the gist of the problem. 
As long as education is developed and qualified personnel are 
trained, any area can become rich, no matter how poor it is now. 
To get rid of poverty, areas of minority nationalities must 
vigorously develop education. 
  In his speech, Li Lanqing also expressed views on 
transformation of government functions, promotion of clean and 
honest government administration, improvement of social order in 
border areas, and so on.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xien Zuan (6200 9449): "Guangdong Runs Short </F>
of 10 Billion Jin of Grain a Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--At the 
meeting of the Guangdong delegation to discuss the government 
work report and the planning and budget reports, State Councilor 
Chen Junsheng aired his views on the grain issue. He pointed 
out: Although China hit a record high in increased grain output 
in 1993, strains on grain still could be seen in some 
localities. For example, Guangdong is still short of 10 billion 
jin of grain a year. In the days to come, the province must 
strive to raise its level of self-sufficiency in grain. 
  Chen Junsheng remarked: The imbalance in the regional grain 
supply remains a problem. Take Guangdong for example, its 
current grain output is 30 billion jin or so but its grain 
demand is some 40 billion jin, or it is short of 10 billion jin 
a year. It has to buy grain from outside the province. He 
maintained: Guangdong must feed some 10 million people coming 
from other parts of the country. In doing so, it should not just 
rely on buying grain from other provinces. 
  Chen Junsheng stated: Guangdong has provided the country as 
a whole with useful experience in reform and opening up to the 
outside world. Its township and town enterprises have developed 
rapidly. The increased peasant income is achieved mainly by 
developing township and town enterprises. However, on the grain 
issue, Guangdong must work really hard to ensure the area of 
land sown to grain, increase grain output, and give 
consideration to social benefit rather than put exclusive stress 
on economic results. In a word, the province must strive to 
raise its level of self-sufficiency in grain.

People's Congress Standing Committee on Strengthening the 
Inspection and Supervision of the Enforcement of Laws and

People's Congress and approved appointments and removals.

standing committee's work is: Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line as a guide, implement in an all-round way 
the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the 
enlarged Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibetan Regional 
Party Committee; accelerate the building of a socialist market 
economy; maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development

compatible with the reform process, taking into consideration 
the objective requirements of Tibet's reform, opening up, and 
modernization, as well as its practical conditions; 2) give 
prominence to what is important while taking care of matters in 
general; and 3) enact laws on the basis of the Constitution. 
Puqung stressed: We must cultivate new ideas compatible with a 
socialist market economy, take bold steps to explore and 
practice, earnestly carry out the responsibilities entrusted to 
us by the Constitution and other laws, resolve problems 
encountered in legislation with a reformist spirit, bring the 
legislative work in step with reform and opening up, and push 
forward Tibet's socialist democracy and legal construction to 
help win new victories in reform and construction.

the Tibetan Regional People's Government, by unidentified 
correspondents in Beijing; date not given; from the "Regional 
News Hookup" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Video shows Gyaincain Norbu seated on a couch, 
talking to a female reporter holding a microphone] Gyaincain 
Norbu, chairman of the Tibetan Regional People's Government, was 
interviewed by correspondents of this station and the central 
television station in Beijing the other day. Chairman Gyaincain 
Norbu first gave a detailed account of the progress Tibet has 
made over the past year in industry, agriculture, animal 
husbandry, transportation, and communications as well as 
production and livelihood in the cities and countryside. 
[passage omitted] 
  Speaking of the excellent situation of reform and opening up 
in Tibet, Gyaincain Norbu said: 
  [Begin Norbu recording] The volume of import and export last 
year was $100 million, $80 million of which was import and $20 
million export. Tourism also registered marked growth over the 
previous year. The number of tourists from Hong Kong, Macao, 
Taiwan, and foreign countries was 23,000. All in all, progress 
was achieved in industry, animal husbandry, agriculture, 
tourism, and foreign trade. Fairly good progress was also 
achieved in various social undertakings, including public 
health, education, science and technology, sports, and 
television and radio services. [end Norbu recording] 
  Speaking of economic cooperation with coastal regions, 
Gyaincain Norbu stated: 
  [Begin Norbu recording] Tibet abounds in resources. Its 
transportation facilities are relatively backward, and it lacks 
skilled workers. [passage omitted] Last year, either on its 
own or as a joint venture, Tibet established more than 120 
enterprises in fraternal provinces and municipalities, in the 
coastal regions in particular. [passage omitted] [end Norbu 
recording] 
  Looking forward to 1994, Gyaincain Norbu told the 
correspondents with confidence: 
  [Begin Norbu recording] This year will be a crucial one for 
the deepening of reform in Tibet. Following the two current 
sessions [as heard], Tibet has announced measures for reform in 
nine sectors: reform of agriculture and animal husbandry, the 
investment structure, revenues and taxes, the housing system, 
and so forth. These measures have been announced after repeated 
deliberation and taking into consideration the views of various 
sectors. This year, we will be combining package reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas. We must also take Tibet's realities 
into account. We should be bold, but the measures we adopt must 
be well-considered. Under such a guideline, we set an annual 
GNP target of 4,002,000,000 yuan, an increase of 8 percent over 
last year. I believe this target can be reached through the 
concerted efforts of people of all nationalities in the region.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 24 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region has devoted great efforts to protecting the wildlife in 
recent years. 
  To protect wild animals in Tibet, known as "the roof of the 
world", the regional government set up the Tibet Regional 
Association for Wildlife Protection in 1991 and issued "Tibet 
Autonomous Region's Regulations for Implementation of 'The 
Wildlife Protection Law of the People's Republic of China'" in 
1992. 
  An official of the association said that Tibet is one of the 
regions rich in wildlife resources. There are more than 5,700 
plant species, 2,300 species of insects, 64 kinds of fish, 488 
kinds of birds and 142 species of mammals native to the region. 
  Tibet is also the habitat for 125 kinds of rare wild animals 
on the state's list for protection. 
  In recent years, Tibet has set up 13 nature reserves for 
protecting 10,000 wild yaks, more than 50,000 wild donkeys, 
about 50,000 Tibetan antelopes, 650 golden monkeys, 1,500 
black-necked cranes and 3,000 takins, a type of wild cow found 
in Tibet. 
  Liu Wulin, deputy general secretary of the Tibet Regional 
Association for Wildlife Protection, says the effort shows that 
most Tibetans realize the importance of protecting wildlife. 
  He said that with the joint efforts of the government and 
the 
people, the total rare animal resources have increased by 30 
percent.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Lhasa city, capital of 
the Tibet Autonomous Region, will soon start 11 civil 
construction projects so as to improve its investment 
environment. 
  Losang Toinzhub, vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous

number of civil construction projects each year for the benefit 
of the people and domestic and foreign investors. 
  The Lhasa City Planning Commission has set up a "preparation 
program for civil construction" which contains about 50 
projects. Every year, the government will allocate special funds 
for urgent projects selected from the program according to 
people's suggestions. 
  The projects for 1994 include transformation of 30,000 
square 
meters of living space in old residential buildings, 
construction of two streets in Lhasa, planting green areas from 
Qushui Bridge to the city proper, water supply projects to six

  [Text] Yunnan, one of the provinces with the highest 
concentrations of minority nationalities, has firmly grasped 
economic construction and adhered to implementing the principle 
and policy for nationality work and the system of nationality 
regions, thus promoting the consolidation of the frontier, 
nationality solidarity, social stability, and economic 
prosperity. The masses of 25 nationalities live and work in 
peace and contentment. 
  In 1993, the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee made the 
decision to develop productive forces by leaps and bounds in 
nationality, border, and mountainous areas. The new body of the 
provincial government also regarded economic development in 
support of impoverished areas as the immediate goal, focusing on 
tackling bottleneck issues in the most impoverished, remote, and 
backward areas. The Deqen Zang Autonomous Prefecture was slow 
in economic development. Related departments of the provincial 
government allowed it a flexible policy to increase input into 
its infrastructure building, focusing on helping the prefecture 
decide and implement the program of doing away with poverty by 
the year 2000 and the development of township and town 
enterprises. 
  In 1993, Yunnan allotted some 62 million yuan to support the 
development of some 300 projects in nationality areas. The 
provincial government has already planned to invest some 10 
billion yuan in nationality areas in the 1990's to build a 
number of backbone projects in transportation, energy resources, 
and mineral production. Presently, construction of a number of 
large and medium-sized projects including the Deqen Paper Box 
Factory, Nawan Power Station, Zhongdian's Jinshajiang irrigation 
project, Dahaoshan Power Station, and Gaotong Airport are 
underway or completed. Work in supporting the impoverished in 
nationality areas has spread from being conducted in separate 
units to extensive development and regional efforts. The smooth 
implementation of economic construction has promoted the social 
stability of border nationality areas.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 14 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- This 
reporter has learned from the Yunnan Provincial AIDS [acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome] Prevention and Control Office that, 
over the past four years or so, the province has spent over 7.6 
million yuan in the prevention and cure of AIDS, and that the 
amount exceeds 10 million yuan if state appropriations and 
international aid are added. In the meantime, a strict 
monitoring and examination network system has been set up. 
  Yang Qi, who is in charge of the Yunnan Provincial AIDS 
Prevention and Control Office, said: In the past few years, 
Yunnan has done a great deal of work in organizing and managing 
the prevention and control of AIDS, monitoring epidemic 
diseases, making laws and regulations, giving publicity to and 
carrying out education, and in training, researching, and 
gaining international cooperation. A monitoring and examination 
network, which is composed of one monitoring and examination 
center, 10 preliminary screening laboratories, and 34 monitoring 
points, plays an exceedingly important role in the prevention 
and control of AIDS. 
  Yang Qi said that the monitoring of 147,330 highly 
susceptible people in Yunnan shows that HIV-infected persons are 
still mainly concentrated in the western border area of Yunnan. 
As of the end of 1993, there were 977 HIV-infected persons, of 
whom 102 were foreigners. Of these 977 persons, 17 were 
diagnosed as AIDS sufferers, and nine have already died. 
  Yang Qi said: Yunnan keeps files on every HIV-infected 
person and every AIDS patient. Moreover, it follows up on them 
with medical treatment and continuously strengthens education 
for their families and highly susceptible people. Furthermore, 
in addition to the AIDS Prevention and Control Day held once 
each year, Yunnan has printed some 100,000 tracts about AIDS in 
the Dai and Jingpo languages and installed three telephones for 
inquiries. All this plays an effective role in preventing the 
spread of AIDS.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen stressed here today that the 
profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the Yemeni 
people will never change. 
  Qian made the remark during a meeting with visiting Yemeni 
Vice- Foreign Minister Abdul Kadir. 
  Qian said he was satisfied that the long friendly ties and 
cooperation between China and Yemen had been developed in a 
concrete way after the reunification of the South Yemen and 
North Yemen. 
  He added: "We are very much concerned about the Yemen's 
domestic situation, hoping that the country will realize its 
social stability and enjoy a good environment for its 
construction. 
  "We believe that the Yemeni people will solve their own 
problems by themselves." 
  China and the Yemen, Qian said, share many common points on 
international issues, and their relationship will grow by 
mutually supporting and cooperating with each other. 
  Abdul Kadir said he had come here for the main purpose of 
having political consultations with Chinese colleagues. 
  The Yemen was also satisfied with the growth of traditional 
friendship between the two countries and hoped that such 
relationship would keep growing. 
  Yesterday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei 
exchanged views with Abdul Kadir on bilateral ties and regional 
and international issues of common concern. 
  The two agreed that the political consultations between the 
two Foreign Ministries will be beneficial not only to 
strengthening their cooperation, but also to pushing forward 
bilateral ties. 
  Abdul Kadir arrived here on March 22.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 19 (XINHUA) -- India is 
considering to set up a joint venture dairy in China's southern 
city of Nanning with a daily capacity of 50,000-liter liquid 
milk, official sources here said today. 
  The project, with an estimated cost of 1 million U.S. 
dollar, 
was an outcome of a recent China visit by Indian National Dairy 
Development Board Chairman V. Kurien and Managing Director 
Amrita Patel who was in Nanning to attend a seminar on buffalo 
milk production. 
  During their stay in Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang 
Minority Autonomous Region, Kurien and Patel held discussions on 
dairy development based on buffaloes with local Chinese 
officials. 
  The proposal mooted envisages that the Indian side would 
provide design and other administrative knowhow to China, the 
sources said. 
  India is also reportedly to have expressed its willingness 
to 
give 300 elite buffalo embryos and 50,000 doses of frozen semen 
from elite buffalo bulls in order to boost dairy development in 
the region. 
  A diplomat in the Chinese Embassy confirmed that the project 
is still waiting for approval by both the governments.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (CNS) -- The State Statistical 
Bureau warned today that the current economy was still suffering 
from climbing prices, difficulties facing state-owned 
enterprises and overheated investment and it called for great 
concern to be shown and remedies found for such problems. 
  The three main problems covering a wide scope needed urgent 
solutions. First, soaring prices which were already high 
continued to climb. Commodities seeing greater price rises are 
mainly food items, especially poultry and their products, 
aquatic products and vegetables and medical and health care 
service. 
  The problem is attributed to a change in the operation 
mechanism, and during this stage it has no effective control 
over runaway market prices and a price hike resulting from 
speculation and artificial manipulation. National retail prices 
increased by 20 percent last January and February over the same 
period in the previous year. 
  Second, some state-owned enterprises suffered from many 
difficulties in their production and management with economic 
results tending to go downwards. Such enterprises' output grew 
by 1.1 percent in the first two months of this year while 
profits actually dropped and the scale and amount of losses 
expanded. 
  Third, investment again showed overheating with new 
expansion 
of state-owned fixed assets investment made in the first two 
months of this year rising to 77.5 percent from the original 
74.1 percent registered in the same period in the year before. 
New items undertaken in localities grew in great number with 
the proposed investment value increasing by 65 percent over the 
same period in the previous year while some other areas saw such 
growth double.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429): "Zhu Rongji's `Theory of Moderation' Gives People a 
Completely New Impression"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 March -- Zhu Rongji comes fifth among 
CPC top leaders and ranks third in the CPC Central Financial and 
Economic Leading Group. When it comes to the economy, however, 
Zhu Rongji is actually the archenemy. His position and official 
duties can help give authority to his remarks on China's economy 
on one hand, while they easily turn him into a target of public 
criticism on the other. His ability to rein the economy, which 
he displayed last June when he took charge of macroeconomic 
control and regulation, has once again shown his talent in the 
economic field. Up until now, however, he continues to insists 
on carrying out macroeconomic control and regulatory measures, 
remaining firm on his stance even when described unfavorably by 
some local officials as "a man who believes in withdrawing and 
centralizing power." Some important figures at the central 
level have also made veiled criticisms of him, thus adding to 
the pressure on his work. Such a situation is a clear 
indication of the existing divergence between the central 
authorities and local governments on the future direction of 
economic development, especially on the question of whether 
autonomy should be withdrawn from or delegated to lower levels 
and whether we should centralize or decentralize power. Although 
the "50 Provisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee have already answered this question 
through the assertion that only the establishment of a market 
economic structure can solve this problem, friction between the 
central authorities and regional governments are increasing 
during the process of the planned economy's transformation into 
a market economy, and Zhu Rongji is naturally the first to bear 
the brunt. 
  Sources from Beijing have revealed that, in the speech he 
delivered in his capacity as State Council vice premier and 
president of the People's Bank of China at the national 
financial and monetary work conference in mid-January this year, 
Zhu Rongji reaffirmed the results of last year's campaign of 
rectifying the financial and monetary order, stressing the need 
to unremittingly abide by the "three-point law" formulated at 
the previous national financial and monetary work conference in 
July last year. Some local officials do not agree with him, 
however, and have called for "a serious study of last year's 
campaign of rectifying the financial and monetary order and 
stepping up macroeconomic control and regulation." Some have 
even accused Zhu Rongji of being "a man who advocates the 
planned economy under the cover of reform" and "plays a role in 
resuming and reestablishing the planned economic structure." 
<H5>  Suffering New Pressure From the "Eight-Character Canon" </H5>
  What merits special attention is that Tian Jiyun, NPC 
Standing Committee vice chairman, delivered a speech entitled 
"The Eight-Character Canon of 'Reform, Opening up, Delegating 
Greater Power to Lower Levels, and Relaxing Control'" at a 
recent symposium on the study of Deng Xiaoping's market economy 
ideology, which was attended by many famed economists in 
Shenzhen not long ago. In his speech, Tian Jiyun asserted that 
the "Eight-Character Canon" is the only way to promote China's 
market economy, and raises a question on whether we can continue 
to abide by this "Eight-Character Canon." Tian Jiyun's speech 
won the general approval of most participants. The basics of 
the "Eight-Character Canon" include persistent efforts to 
"delegate greater autonomy to lower levels" and oppose the 
"centralization and withdrawal of powers." It is believed that 
such remarks are directed at Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic control 
and regulation, putting new pressure on the man. 
  However, an economist who is in favor of Zhu Rongji's 
economic reform strategies believes that the delegation or 
centralization of power is an inevitable phenomenon under the 
planned economic structure. The "50-clause" policy decision 
made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee is precisely aimed at breaking with the format of the 
delegation or centralization of power so as to establish a new 
market economic structure. Judging by the standards of the 
market economy, the delegation of power is not necessarily the 
synonym of reform, while the centralization of power does not 
necessarily antireform. It will prove more beneficial to the 
establishment of a market economic structure if we can 
centralize the powers that are abused in arbitrary fund 
collection and investment, and concentrate our financial 
strength on infrastructure construction projects, which have a 
great bearing on the national economy and the people's standard 
of living. The macroeconomic control and regulation advocated 
by Zhu Rongji is aimed precisely at achieving this goal. 
<H3>  The Charges Made by Regional Officials Against Zhu Are Not 
Totally Groundless </H3>
  Sources have said that, according to the analysis of some 
economic experts, the charges made by the regional officials -- 
though involving misunderstandings in many areas -- are not 
totally unwarranted. Some local officials believe that the 
enthusiasm displayed by both central authorities and regions 
help form the basis of development, and reform is also aimed at 
bringing the two enthusiasms into full play. All they have said 
is quite right. The most striking feature of mainland China is 
its imbalanced economic development. It is impossible to carry 
out development and reform at the same pace in different 
localities. 
  The forced implementation of a policy or a program 
formulated by the central authorities throughout the country 
will either intensify or suppress the imbalance, both of which 
will have an adverse effect on the entire economy. Therefore, 
uniformity should not be imposed on different localities and 
regions; instead, development plans need to be drawn up in light 
of local conditions. For example, under the new financial and 
taxation system, the central authorities put forward a 
"financial and tax refund" policy, by which the central 
authorities will first centralize local tax revenues and then 
make pro rata refunds to different localities in accordance with 
the basic figures of their financial expenditures. This policy 
is aimed at strengthening the central authorities' ability to 
keep control of the local economies. When it comes to reality, 
however, regional governments feel restrictions in many ways, 
and they all worry about a slowdown in their economy if the 
central authorities fail to keep their promises. What is more, 
with the defects of overcentralization, major waste, high 
accumulation, and poor economic efficiency, the central 
authorities have had hardly any success in the projects that 
they were committed to over the past many years, thus making the 
local government very skeptical about the central authorities' 
capacity to set up a powerful macroeconomic control and 
regulation system, even though they have such major centralized 
financial power in their hands. 
  People from Beijing's economic circles have pointed out that 
Deng Xiaoping once aired his view on protecting the enthusiasm 
of different localities on the eve of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Deng said: "It is necessary 
to strengthen macroeconomic control and enhance the authority of 
the central officials. We should not use the old methods of the 
planned economy to reach our goal, however. The central 
authorities should have a clear idea on what they should or 
should not handle and should never restrain the enthusiasm of 
the localities and enterprises by keeping all power in their own 
hands. To this end, we need to carry out reform and rely on 
reform to build up the central authorities' capabilities in 
macroeconomic control and regulation." Zhu Rongji, who is in 
charge of economic work and macroeconomic control and 
regulation, needs to heed the warning in Deng Xiaoping's 
remarks. The principal officials of the central government must 
pay attention to protecting the enthusiasm of local governments, 
for in this way they can dissolve contradictions between the 
central and local governments. 
<H5>  Raising the "Theory of Moderation" During His Japan Visit </H5>
  Sources have indicated that, despite the local officials' 
misunderstandings and unfavorable comments about Zhu Rongji, the 
CPC top leadership and senior statesmen still affirm and support 
Zhu's work. At the start of last year's campaign of rectifying 
the financial and monetary order, Deng Xiaoping warned "not to 
interfere in Zhu Rongji's work." Recently, Deng Xiaoping again 
affirmed Zhu's accomplishments in rectifying the financial and 
monetary order, saying "To succeed in reform, we must advance in 
an orderly way under leadership" and "successful macroeconomic 
control should be reflected by the authority of the central 
authorities," for "if the party Central Committee and the State 
Council lack sufficient authority, the situation will get out of 
control." 
  On many occasions, Zhu Rongji has stressed the need to 
"carry 
out Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory in a positive, 
comprehensive, and correct way." We should be good at seizing 
favorable opportunities, yet we also need to restrain ourselves 
from making blind moves. Another CPC senior statesman Bo Yibo 
also said recently: "The pace of development and economic 
efficiency must be integrated organically. While speeding up 
the pace of development, we should persistently seek truth from 
facts, proceed in everything from reality, and never compete 
with one another to attain faster growth." He also stressed the 
need to "acquire an accurate and comprehensive understanding of 
Deng Xiaoping's thought." All these represent powerful support 
for Zhu Rongji. 
  However, it has been known to all that one of Deng 
Xiaoping's 
major theories reads "Development is the last word." How will 
Zhu Rongji put this theory into practice? The "theory of 
moderation" that he raised during his visit to Japan in late 
February this year is fresh and new to everyone. Zhu Rongji 
said: "In 1992, China's economy entered a phase of high-speed 
development, and its economic growth rate has gone as high as 15 
percent for two years running. Such rapid growth also resulted 
in an overheated economy, however. The macroeconomic control 
measures we have adopted since last June have helped bring a 
swift and favorable turn to the situation. From this, we have 
realized that we should remain moderate in everything we do. 
Here we emphasize once again that there should not be big 
fluctuations in China's national economic growth, and we should 
maintain sustained, healthy, and rapid economic development. 
Any move to abruptly slow down the speed will prove 
destabilizing to society. Therefore, it is highly essential 
that we maintain a certain speed. This year, China will achieve 
a fairly high economic growth of 9 percent, and we expect to 
maintain this rate in the coming several years. We are all 
oriental countries which believe in the doctrine of the mean, 
and moderation is the essence of the doctrine of the mean." If 
what he says is true, China stands a very good chance of success 
in maintaining healthy economic growth.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jin Xin, deputy director of the State </F>
General Administration of Taxation, by staff reporter Jing Wen 
(4842 2429); place and date not given: "The New Tax System Is 
Operating in a Basically Smooth and Normal Way"] 
  [Text] Recently, our staff reporter interviewed Jin Xin, 
deputy director of the State General Administration of Taxation, 
on some difficult points concerning the operation of the new tax 
system and the reform of the taxation system, which have sparked 
wide concern. 
  [Jing] Starting 1 January this year, full-scale reform was 
introduced in the industrial and commercial tax system of our 
country. Could you please give us an idea how the new tax 
system has been working? 
  [Jin] Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council, the operation of the new 
taxation system has been basically smooth and normal. This 
mainly finds expression in the following phenomena: First, 
commodity prices, which people are most concerned about, did not 
fluctuate wildly because of tax system reform. Second, tax 
revenue has maintained a steady growth. Third, the printing, 
distribution, issuing, and use of invoices used exclusively for 
value-added tax [VAT] did not have much problem. Fourth, on the 
whole, the new tax system did not impact production and 
circulation negatively. Fifth, in the implementation of the new 
tax system, the party and government departments at all levels, 
the broad spectrum of enterprises, and the general public have 
been supportive and the comments it has received from various 
quarters are generally positive. 
  Naturally, we have come across some problems during the 
implementation of the new tax system. Some problems in such 
major reform are inevitable, and we will encounter new problems 
in the future. Among these problems, some are related to 
policies, and others to operation. We have taken steps to solve 
some of them in good time, while vigorous efforts are being made 
to solve some others and the rest are yet to be solved after 
further investigation and study. In a word, we should work hard 
to implement the new tax system, constantly sum up our 
experience, keep improving it, and give full play to the role of 
taxation in pooling revenue and strengthening macroregulation 
and control so as to promote the sustained, healthy, and rapid 
development of the national economy. 
  [Jing] Introducing the value-added tax on a full scale is an 
important aspect of this tax reform. But many people are still 
not very familiar with VAT. Could you please tell us something 
about VAT? 
  [Jin] VAT is a type of circulating tax levied on commodity 
production and circulation, and labor service. "Value added" is 
the incremented value created by the taxpayer through his 
productive or business operation or the added value of 
commodities. It can also be defined as the amount of the 
taxpayer's revenue through the sale of commodities or provision 
of labor service within a given period of time in excess of the 
amount paid in purchasing commodities or labor service. 
  The VAT regime changed the practice of the traditional 
circulating tax regime whereby taxes were levied on all sales 
income at each transaction link, so that duplicate taxation 
could be avoided. Also, it is characterized by an extensive 
scope of taxation; timeliness, balance, and stability in tax 
collection; and fairness of distribution. It is not only 
conducive to the pooling of revenue, but also helps encourage 
enterprises to follow the principle of economic efficiency and 
choose the optimum organizational form for production and 
business operation. It also facilitates total tax reimbursement 
for export commodities in keeping with international practice, 
so as to make our products more competitive on the international 
market. That is why we say this is a scientific and rational 
tax category. 
  [Jing] Could you please explain the scope of collection and 
the range of taxpayers in connection with VAT? What are the tax 
rates? 
  [Jin] VAT is applicable to all produced, wholesaled, 
retailed, and imported commodities, as well as labor service in 
processing, repair, and servicing. All industrial and 
commercial enterprises, as well as other units and individuals, 
that sell taxable commodities or provide taxable labor service 
are payers of VAT. 
  The VAT rates come in three grades: 
  1. The basic VAT rate is 17 percent, applicable to the 
great majority of general commodities and taxable labor service. 
  2. The low VAT rate is 13 percent, applicable to daily 
necessities and agricultural means of production, such as 
grains, edible vegetable oils, tap water, gas, central heating, 
books, newspapers, chemical fertilizers, and farm pesticides. 
  3. A zero rate is applicable to export commodities, 
which means VAT paid will be fully reimbursed after the 
commodities have exited. 
  [Jing] Could you tell us what is meant by taxes not 
included in the calculated prices? Some enterprises have put a 
17 percent VAT on the original prices of their commodities. Is 
this the right practice? 
  [Jin] An important aspect of the reform introducing VAT is 
that the previous practice of including tax in the calculated 
prices has been switched to that of not including tax in the 
calculated prices. In the process of commodity sale in all the 
stages before the retail stage, the receipt should specify the 
price without VAT and the amount of VAT charged. 
  According to a survey, when the old practice of including 
tax 
in calculated prices was in effect, the proportion of tax in 
each 100- yuan price averaged 14.5 percent. After the practice 
of not including tax in the calculated prices was introduced, 
the tax portion should be deducted from the taxable value, and 
therefore the price would be 85.5 yuan, representing a smaller 
tax base. But according to the guideline for the reform which 
requires maintaining the original tax burden on the whole, the 
state must collect 14.5 yuan in tax on the basis of the 
commodity price of 85.5 yuan. Therefore, the original 14.5 
percent tax rate should be converted to a rate not included in 
the calculated prices, i.e., 14.5 divided by 85.5 equals 17 
percent. This way, when a commodity is sold, the specialized 
VAT invoice should contain two separate entries, namely, the net 
price of 85.5 yuan and the tax of 85.5 x 17 percent = 14.5 yuan. 
The total price payable by the buyer remains 100 yuan (85.5 
yuan + 14.5 yuan = 100 yuan). Therefore, the separate 
calculation of VAT does not cause price hikes and it is wrong of 
some enterprises to add a 17 percent VAT to the original 
commodity price, which should be redressed immediately. The 
State General Administration of Taxation [SGAT] has demanded 
that taxation authorities at all levels cooperate with local 
price control departments in checking and penalizing this 
practice. We also hope that all enterprises will 
conscientiously abide by the state tax law and that all circles 
in society will support our work. 
  [Jing] How is payable VAT calculated? Is the 17 percent VAT 
levied on every link of commodity production and circulation? 
Will it cause an overall increase in commodity prices? 
  [Jin] Let me explain and analyze this topic in detail. 
  First, let us find out how the payable amount of VAT is 
calculated. Just now we said that VAT is levied on the added 
value arising from the sale of commodities and provision of 
labor service. But, in economic activity, the added value is 
hard to calculate precisely so as to provide a basis for tax 
calculation. Therefore, the method of indirect calculation is 
commonly used for this purpose, i.e., the sales volume of a 
commodity is first used as a basis for tax calculation, on which 
the applicable tax rate is used and the VAT is levied on the 
buyer. This amount of tax is called sales tax. The balance of 
the commodity seller's sales tax minus the VAT he already paid 
when procuring the commodity (known as the procurement tax) is 
the actual VAT payable by this commodity seller. 
  Next, I will take garment production and the subsequent 
business transactions as an example of how the payable amount of 
VAT is calculated. 
  Given that a textile mill sells 2 million yuan's worth of 
cotton fabric to a garment factory and the sales tax is 2 
million yuan x 17 percent = 340,000 yuan, and that the 
deductible procurement tax already paid is 100,000 yuan, the VAT 
payable by this textile mill will be: 340,000 yuan - 100,000 
yuan = 240,000 yuan. 
  The garment factory sells to a wholesale enterprise the 
garments manufactured from the cotton fabric purchased from the 
textile mill at a price of 4 million yuan. The sales tax is: 4 
million yuan x 17 percent = 680,000 yuan. The deductible 
procurement tax paid is 340,000 yuan. The VAT payable by the 
garment factory will be: 680,000 yuan - 340,000 yuan = 340,000 
yuan. 
  The wholesale enterprise distributes the garments purchased 
from the garment factory to a retail shop at the price of 5 
million yuan. Its sales tax is: 5 million yuan x 17 percent = 
850,000 yuan. The deductible procurement tax paid is 680,000 
yuan. The VAT payable by the wholesale enterprise will be 
850,000 yuan - 680,000 yuan = 170,000 yuan. 
  The retail shop sells the garments purchased from the 
wholesale enterprise to consumers at the price of 6 million 
yuan. Its sales tax is: 6 million yuan x 17 percent = 1.02 
million yuan. The deductible procurement tax paid is 850,000 
yuan. The VAT payable by this retail shop will be 1.02 million 
yuan - 850,000 yuan = 170,000 yuan. According to the existing 
price regime in our country, retail prices contain taxes and are 
the sum of net prices plus sales taxes. In other words, the 
price at which the retail shop sells the garments to the 
consumers is: 6 million yuan + 1.02 million yuan = 7.02 million 
yuan. 
  Though sales tax is calculated according to the sales price 
and the 17-percent tax rate for each taxpayer, because deduction 
of the VAT paid at the previous transaction point is allowed at 
each transaction point, the taxpayer only has to pay the balance 
of the sales tax minus the procurement tax paid, and the tax 
bearing ratio is less than 17 percent. The final tax burden is 
entirely borne by the consumer, the tax bearing ratio being 17 
percent. That is why the actual VAT will not cause duplicate 
taxation, nor will it increase the burden on the taxpayer, still 
less cause overall price hikes. 
  [Jing] What are the VAT-related regulations on small 
taxpayers? 
  [Jin] Considering the specific circumstances of some small 
enterprises and private business operators, in order to 
strengthen the management over tax collection and ensure fiscal 
revenue, we have adopted a simple method of taxation for small 
taxpayers whose annual sales income is below the standard level 
and whose accounting calculation mechanism is not adequately 
developed. By this method, we collect VAT according to their 
sales income and a 6 percent tax rate. 
  Small taxpayers mainly refers to taxpayers who produce 
taxable commodities or provide taxable labor service and whose 
annual sales volume is under 1 million yuan and taxpayers who 
are engaged in the wholesale or retail of taxable commodities 
and whose annual sales volume is under 1.8 million yuan. 
  If a small taxpayer has an adequately developed accounting 
calculation system and is able to accurately calculate payable 
taxes according to the accounting regulations and the 
requirements of the tax authorities, it may, at the discretion 
of competent local tax authorities, pay taxes in the capacity of 
ordinary taxpayers. 
  Some time ago, some small taxpayers complained that, because 
they could not use specialized VAT invoices like ordinary 
taxpayers, their production and business operations were 
negatively impacted. In this regard, we have taken some steps 
and alleviated this problem. For instance, the tax authorities 
in various localities stepped up the classification of taxpayers 
and upgraded to the level of ordinary taxpayers some small 
taxpayers who basically met the requirements of ordinary 
taxpayers. The SGAT specially issued a circular stating that, 
at the discretion of the authorities, the taxation office may 
issue specialized invoices for the goods sold or taxable labor 
service provided by small taxpayers who have been conscientious 
in performing their obligations as taxpayers. 
  Here, I would like to stress that we hope all enterprises 
will develop their accounting system, strengthen financial 
management, and pay taxes according to law. This is very 
necessary for ensuring the revenue of the country, improving the 
management of enterprise operation, and raising economic 
efficiency. 
  [Jing] You just mentioned specialized VAT invoices. What 
are the state regulations in this regard? 
  [Jin] Specialized VAT invoices are not only an important 
type of commercial instrument used in the taxpayers' economic 
activities, but are also legal proofs recording the tax 
obligations of the selling party and the procurement tax of the 
purchasing party. They play an extremely important role in the 
calculation and management of VAT. For this reason, the SGAT 
specially formulated and promulgated "Regulations on the Use of 
Specialized VAT Invoices." 
  Taxation organs at all levels must attach great importance 
to 
the use and management of VAT invoices and should take the 
initiative in obtaining the support of the party and government 
leaderships at all levels, as well as the support and 
cooperation from all relevant departments, such as financial 
departments, banks, auditing departments, industrial and 
commercial administration, public security, courts, and 
procuratorates, in strictly controlling the printing and use of 
special invoices. Those who use them in violation of 
regulations must be immediately stopped and given an appropriate 
penalty. Those who dare to defy the law and forge special 
invoices to evade state taxes and undermine the economic order 
must be sternly punished according to law. 
  In the meantime, we hope all VAT payers will use the 
specialized invoices in strict accordance with the stipulations 
of the tax authorities. This is not only to protect the state 
tax revenue and economic order, but also to safeguard the 
legitimate rights and interests of taxpayers. 
  [Jing] Director Jin, as far as we know, there are still some 
people who are not very clear about the consumption tax. They 
think that it is a new levy on all consumer goods that will 
cause overall price hikes. Could you please explain the 
consumption tax a bit? 
  [Jin] Yes. Consumption tax is a tax levied on specific 
consumer goods. This is a new tax introduced following reform 
in the industrial and commercial taxation system. But in 
essence, consumption tax is derived from the product tax and VAT 
in the original tax system. It is a product of the replacement 
of the old system with the new, not an extra tax levied on 
consumers. 
  The prices of commodities under the consumption tax used to 
contain product tax and VAT (e.g., the product tax rate for 
Grade A cigarettes being 52 percent). Now, after the 
introduction of the uniform 17 percent VAT rate, the tax burden 
on such commodities has been reduced. Compensating such 
reduction by way of collecting consumption tax is to ensure 
fiscal revenue on the one hand and, on the other, adjust the 
consumption structure and guiding consumption orientation. This 
does not increase the overall burden of taxable commodities. In 
other words, the consumer goods subject to consumption tax are, 
on the whole, maintaining their previous levels of tax burden. 
Besides, a consumption tax is not levied on all consumer goods; 
it is applicable only to a small number of consumer goods 
designated by the state. Therefore, introducing a consumption 
tax will not, and should not, cause price increases. 
  Toward the end of last year, rumor had it that the state 
would start levying consumption tax on home appliances and 
therefore the prices of commodities in this category would be 
significantly increased, thus starting a small wave of panic 
purchasing. This was a sheer misunderstanding. In fact, 
commodities under the consumption tax do not include home 
appliances.

<F P=106> [By Lin Ya (2651 0068): "China's Economy Is in a Dilemma-- </F>
Economist Dong Fureng on Economic Situation in 1994"] 
  [Text] In the early half of 1993, China's economy was 
overheated. Although macroscopic regulation was strengthened 
from July and marked results were achieved, the annual national 
retail price index rose 13 percent and residents' cost of living 
expenses rose 14.7 percent, creating problems for the economy in 
1994. 
<H5>  The Growth Rate in 1994 Is Still High </H5>
  This year, the government is in a dilemma over macroscopic 
regulation. It has to maintain rapid economic growth but, on 
the other hand, it must once again keep inflation in check. If 
economic growth is too high, inflation will be exacerbated. If 
the growth rate drops excessively, it will also create problems 
though prices may tend to stabilize. On the one hand, there 
will be less supply but, on the other hand, many enterprises 
will be in a state of halted production or semi-production and 
some workers and staff do not have a sense of security regarding 
their livelihood, thus causing social instability. It is 
necessary to seek a balance of the two and properly handle it. 
  Overall, the rapid growth last year was a trend and there 
will still be a high rate of growth this year. After the 
control over money supply was eased in the latter half of last 
year, the judgment of the economic situation by some localitites 
this year was faulty and they wrongly believed that they could 
arbitrarily increase investment this year. In consequence, the 
price of rolled steel, which had dropped, rebounded to a level 
which is almost as high as that before last July. As a matter 
of fact, it is still necessary to work through better 
macroscopic regulation this year to realize a "soft landing." 
Gradual steps must be taken to control the speed of economic 
growth within the following levels: 
  1. We must be able to integrate readjustment of the 
industrial structure with the speed of economic growth in a very 
good form, thus enabling the industrial structure to sustain 
rapid economic growth. In the first half of last year, the then 
industrial structure could not sustain the high rate of economic 
growth and the bottleneck constraints were aggravated. In this 
way, the high rate of economic growth dropped even though the 
government did not take the initiative to regulate it. This 
year, the speed should gradually drop to a level which the 
industrial structure, with step- by-step readjustment, can 
sustain. 
<H5>  $10-Billion Trade Deficit Seen Last Year </H5>
  Last year, while enhancing macroscopic regulation, we took 
pains to readjust the industrial structure and to integrate 
macroscopic regulation with readjustment of the industrial 
structure, which was the correct direction. Since readjusting 
the industrial structure is a long-term task, this year, we must 
still make great efforts in this respect. Some departments 
should slow down, whereas some others must speed up their 
development, for example, in energy, communications, and raw and 
processed materials. If tangible results are achieved on 
structural readjustment this year, it will create good 
conditions for future economic development because only with a 
coordinated industrial structure can we achieve sustained and 
high-speed economic growth. 
  2. It is necessary to maintain the speed of economic growth 
at a level which foreign exchange reserves can sustain. If the 
speed is too rapid but we do not have sufficient domestic 
resources, we will have to spend a large amount of foreign 
exchange on imports. Last year, we imported a lot and there was 
a $10-billion trade deficit. In the long run, our foreign 
reserves will be exhausted and will not be able to meet the 
needs of repaying foreign debts and stabilizing the exchange 
rate of renminbi. However, if the speed of economic growth is 
too low, the growth of exports will be affected and there will 
be less foreign exchange. 
  3. Our finances must be able to sustain it. Overall, our 
country's economic growth is still mainly an extensive one and 
our country's financial revenue still relies mainly on state-run 
enterprises. If the rate of growth is too low, enterprises will 
have very poor benefits and there will be more financial 
difficulties. 
  4. The pressure of employment must be taken into account. 
There is a very great pressure of employment in our country, 
particularly in cities, and every year, we have two to three 
percent unemployment. If the speed of economic growth is too 
low, it will not only create problems for new employment but 
will also affect the employment of current staff and workers. 
Last year, many enterprises fully or partially halted 
production and some workers and staff took part of their wages 
and lived by selling small articles on the street. Hence, the 
economic growth rate cannot be too low and we have to take the 
pressure of employment into account. 
  5. When taking into account the rate of economic growth, we 
must pay special attention to the issue of controlling 
inflation. Under the current situation, it is unrealistic to 
achieve zero economic growth but, if we can control the economic 
growth rate within a certain limit, that is, the raise in the 
cost of living index not exceeding 10 percent, it will be a 
brilliant achievement. 
  An outstanding issue in this year's economic development is 
how to bring inflation under control. The question now is no 
longer whether or not there is inflation because it has gone 
beyond the limit of mild inflation. If inflation is high for a 
short time, the people can bear it but this is not the case if 
inflation is persistently high. Last year, residents' 
anticipation of changes in prices precisely reflected this 
problem. We must understand that inflation affects various 
strata in different ways. That is, low-income groups and retired 
workers and staff, particularly those from plants which have 
fully or partially halted production, are most affected by 
inflation and their livlihood cannot be guaranteed. 
  This year, the inflation situation is grim. Therefore, when 
taking into account the rate of economic growth, we must have an 
overall viewpoint. The economic growth rate cannot be too low 
and neither can inflation be further exacerbated. This year, 
price raises are determined by several factors: The first is 
the aftereffects of last year's price raises; the second is 
rising costs; and the third is the newly-introduced price 
reform, particularly raises in petroleum, coal, grain, and 
transportation and communications. This year, it will be quite 
difficult to keep the national retail price index below 10 
percent and the raise is expected to exceed 10 percent. 
  According to relevant statistics, due to the aftereffects of 
last year's price readjustment, the cost-of-living index will 
rise 5.5 percent this year; new factors of price readjustment 
this year can cause a two percent rise in retail prices; and the 
fact that total demand is greater than total supply in society 
will cause a four percent raise in retail prices. Merely 
because of these few factors, retail prices this year will 
increase 11.5 percent, whereas residents' expected effect of 
inflation, which may exist, is not included in the calculation. 
<H3>  Seeking Economic Growth As Well As Bringing Inflation Under 
Control </H3>
  As far as the current macroscopic regulation is concerned, 
the government not only has to maintain rapid economic growth 
but also bring inflation under control so that prices will not 
soar. Confronted with this dilemma, the government is likely to 
adopt a policy which alternately tightens and relaxes control on 
the rate of economic growth. When the speed is too fast and 
inflation is exacerbated, controls should be tightened. After a 
certain period of time when the rate slows down and inflation 
eases up, the controls should be relaxed. 
  This year, if we can keep the economic growth rate within, 
or 
slightly outside the limit of 10 percent, and maintain the 
national retail price index within or slightly beyond the limit 
of 10 percent, our economy this year will do quite well. 
However, we cannot sustain it if either the rate of price 
raises is as high as over 15 percent or the economic growth rate 
drops dramatically. The government's art of regulation is 
precisely to strike a balance between moderately rapid economic 
growth and sustainable inflation. With last year's experience in 
macroscopic regulation, we should do better this year in 
gradually slowing down the excessively high- speed economic 
growth, to alleviate inflation step by step and to realize a 
"soft landing."

<F P=106> [By Fan Bi (5400 1801): "How Is the Investment Situation in </F>
1994--A Record of Remarks by Experts and Scholars] 
  [Text] In the year just passed, as a result of an 
excessive and over-vigorous scale of investment, the 
macroeconomic situation has been critical and inflationary 
pressure has increased. What will the investment situation be 
in 1994? We could say that this is a question that all people, 
from top to bottom, are very concerned about, since it is 
related to whether or not the national economy can achieve 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian 
kang di fa zhan 2070 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4104 4099 1455]. 
  In the spring of this year, in a packed meeting room of the 
Investment Research Institute of the State Planning Commission, 
scores of experts and scholars from the Ministry of Finance, the 
People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Domestic Trade, the 
China Materials and Equipment Center, the State Information 
Center, the Quantitative and Technical Economics Institute of 
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and the State Planning 
Commission's General Department of National Economy, Center for 
Economic Research, and China Prices Information Center directly 
participated in a wide-ranging and vigorous discussion on the 
investment situation in 1994. The main views they expressed are 
presented below. 
  The participants agreed that the current economic situation 
as a whole is good, with the economic growth rate reaching 13.4 
percent in 1993 and a comparatively high level expected to be 
maintained this year. In 1993, China's total social investment 
in fixed assets exceeded 1,180 billion yuan, a rise of more than 
50 percent over the previous year, and the greatest increase for 
any year since the introduction of reform and opening up. 
However, if we exclude price rises, the quantity of goods 
produced increased approximately 20 percent, lower than the 23 
percent rate of increase for 1992. From the perspective of the 
economic situation in 1994, since various regions are still very 
enthusiastic in developing the economy, and the numerous new 
projects initiated in the last two years still require 
comparatively great investment for their completion, plus the 
increase in the retail price index of 13.2 percent in 1993, this 
year will be a period of high-speed expansion of the economy and 
we will be faced with the prospect of relatively large 
investment and the pressure of inflation. 
<H3>  Investment Growth Will Remain High and The Investment 
Structure Will Remain Poor </H3>
  According to estimates by Zhang Hanya, a research fellow 
from 
the Investment Research Institute of the State Planning 
Commission, in 1994, to compensate for depreciation, the input 
of capital should not be less than 290 billion yuan; and to 
ensure that the new projects initiated in the last two years are 
completed on time investment must not fall below 790 billion 
yuan--the total of 1,080 billion yuan is the minimum investment 
for 1994. Zhang stated that the level of supply of raw 
materials will limit the total volume of investment, with 
domestic production and financial resources playing a major 
role. Generally speaking, if the GNP increases by 1 percent 
then it could sustain a 1.5 percent increase in investment. It 
is estimated that in 1994 the GNP growth in China will probably 
reach 10 percent, which means that physical quantity investment 
could increase to approximately 15 percent, and will probably 
reach 1,860 billion yuan. If we consider an investment price 
index of 7-10 percent, in 1994 investment currency will increase 
by 23-26.5 percent to between 1,460 and 1,500 billion yuan. 
  The various reform measures to be introduced this year, such 
as reform of the banking system, will also probably influence 
the scale of investment. Comrade Wang Yida of the Comprehensive 
Planning Department of the Ministry of Finance said that the 
Central Bank's method of controlling loans granted to 
specialized banks would be changed from administrative 
distribution to management of asset-to- liability ratio. This 
will reduce the restrictions on loans granted to various 
commercial banks, but there is the possibility that this will 
result in a rapid increase in fixed-asset investment loans and 
thus foster fixed-asset investment inflation. 
  Wang Tongsan, a research fellow from the Quantitative and 
Technical Economics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences, said that at present economic development in China is 
primarily dependent on investment, and that if investment is 
suspended, the economy will not be able to develop as rapidly. 
Of China's enterprises, 80 percent are manufacturing 
intermediate products, and only 20 percent are producing end 
products. If there is not considerable investment then this 80 
percent will be hard- pressed and experience difficulties. In 
1993 the scale of investment was already very high, and it is 
reasonable to forecast that the investment scale will be 
approximately 1,400 billion yuan in 1994. If we can control 
investment within this increased limit, no major problems should 
develop in the economy. If not, then the economy will slide. 
  Comrade Xu Hongyuan from the State Information Center 
pointed out that on the basis of the turnpike theorems [da dao 
ding li 1129 6670 1353 3810], when the per capita GNP reaches 
between $400 and $2,000 a nation should experience a stage of 
high-speed growth. This is the turnpike for economic growth. 
This high-speed growth means that probably within 10-15 years a 
state's industrialization will be completed. According to our 
calculations, China's per capita GNP should be $470. We have 
the necessary conditions to bring about this so-called turnpike 
of high-speed growth. Investment and consumption are the 
driving forces behind economic development, but since we are a 
developing country, consumer goods cannot reach a very high 
level. Because of this the main factor determining growth is 
still investment. The Japanese rate of investment at its 
highest was 47 percent and was maintained at 40 percent for a 
long period of time. The "four little tigers" have also reached 
in excess of 40 percent. Last year China's investment rate 
reached 36-37 percent, which is appropriate. 
  While the total social investment is growing at an 
ultra-high 
speed, there also exist the problems of a nonrational investment 
structure and low returns on investment. Qiu Quanning, an 
associate research fellow from the Investment Research Institute 
of the State Planning Commission, pointed out that: a) There 
has been a comparative reduction in personal investment in 
agriculture; in 1992 there was a negative increase and last year 
the rate of increase was only 10.2 percent--only one-fifth of 
the national average. At the same time, the per capita incomes 
of the close to 80 percent of the population who live in the 
countryside have fluctuated at a low speed for a long time, and 
the gap between their incomes and those of the population living 
in the cities and towns has gradually widened. This serious 
imbalance in the development of the economy has a negative 
impact on the maintenance of sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development, and even on social stability. b) Since 
the beginning of the nineties, the increased investment in 
state-owned units has been constantly higher than the average 
rate for society as a whole. Last year the proportion of 
investment in state-owned units had already reached 70.8 
percent, the highest since reforms were introduced 13 years ago. 
However, in the same year the industrial growth rate in 
state-owned industrial enterprises increased at a rate of only 9 
percent, less than half the average for society as a whole. 
That is to say, state-owned enterprises were set in motion by 
investment higher than the social average, but their output 
yield was much lower than the social average. To centralize 
resources in low-yield sectors goes against market economics, 
and high input but low yield will inevitably result in a great 
wastage of resources. For this reason, the reform should be 
speeded up and investment policy and management structure need 
to be established and perfected, various unregulated government 
actions corrected and overcome, and the wasteful use of 
investment reformed in order to improve the benefits from 
investment. 
<H3>  Although the Channels for Financing Decreased, the Financing 
Volume Was Still Large </H3>
  With regard to the sources of investment funds, Comrade Ma 
Ruohong of the People's Bank of China pointed out that between 
January and November last year, 47.8 percent of the investment 
for capital construction and renovation in state-owned units was 
self- funded, primarily from a large stock of money obtained by 
various means to support investment. After the disorderly 
accumulation of funds was stopped, although the channels for 
financing decreased, the financing volume was still large. In 
the first half of last year, self-funding amounted to 90.1 
billion yuan, an increase of 69 percent over the same period in 
1992. This shows that if there is a large amount of capital and 
household savings, then except when returns from investment are 
lower than the interest rate or when the government uses 
political measures to limit investment, investment will 
otherwise sustain high-speed growth. 
  Jia Fang, deputy leader of the Comprehensive Group of the 
Economic Research Center of the State Planning Commission, 
pointed out that from 1988 to 1991 foreign funds actually used 
averaged just over 10 billion yuan per annum; in 1991 this 
figure reached 11.5 billion yuan; in 1992 it grew to 19.8 
billion yuan; and in 1993 it was approximately 30 billion yuan. 
This is a very influential factor. If the foreign exchange 
rate is calculated at six yuan (to the dollar), foreign funds 
used in 1993 amounted to approximately 180 billion yuan in fixed 
assets. Apart from this, there should also be funds to match 
the foreign currency. It has been estimated that in 1986 one 
dollar of foreign capital required a corresponding one yuan, 
while today one dollar calls for three yuan and in 1993 the 
corresponding capital would have been approximately 100 billion 
yuan. If we take last year's investment at the current 
increased rate of 50 percent, it is close to 300 billion yuan 
and means that China's investment has increased by 16 percentage 
points. The current situation is excellent in terms of 
opportunities in the international arena. At present, overseas 
interest rates have fallen 2-3 percentage points, which presents 
a very good opportunity for a low-income developing nation such 
as China to use foreign capital. 
<H3>  To Reduce the Remaining Inflationary Pressure the Key Is To 
Control Excessive Increases in the Rate of Investment </H3>
  Both the cost-push and demand-pull models of inflation exist 
at the same time, but there is the question of which is the 
principal factor. 
  Analyzed in terms of currency, Comrade Ma Ruohong pointed 
out that the current inflationary pressure is caused by the 
money supply being approximately 600 billion yuan in excess in 
the period from 1990 to 1992. Although the money supply was not 
excessive in 1993, there was no obvious tightening of the money 
supply. Because of this, hidden inflationary pressure continues 
to exist in 1994. If the scale of investment this year remains 
relatively large, the prices of investment products will 
continue to escalate. Added to this will be the concurrent 
influence of a rise in the prices of crude oil and coal and the 
reunification of the exchange rate, which will also in large 
part be reflected in the price of investment commodities. 
Whether or not the inflationary pressures left over from the 
past can be released this year depends on whether the current 
excessive rate of investment in fixed assets can be controlled 
at the reasonable level of approximately 20 percent. The rise 
in the retail commodity price index will depend on whether or 
not in 1994 we can stabilize the consumption behavior of those 
living in the cities and towns in terms of macropolicy. Before 
the rate of inflation can reach a lower level, if a high rate of 
interest can be maintained to stabilize consumption behavior, it 
will still be possible to control the retail price index to 
within single-digit figures. 
  From the perspective of the prices of the means of 
production, Dai Dingyi, deputy director of the China Materials 
and Equipment Information Center, remarked: Now that prices 
have been deregulated, and the channels at home and abroad have 
been opened up, the bottleneck in supplies for building up 
production will be reduced considerably. This bottleneck is 
mainly in communications, and for the most part raw materials 
are no longer the major factor. All we need is money, and then 
we can buy whatever China lacks from overseas. Both circulation 
and materials and equipment enterprises expect that the more 
investment the better. Price rises for the means of production 
are not the main reason for rising prices, but fluctuations in 
the economy have a profound effect on fluctuations in the 
production of capital goods. 
  Based on historical experience, this year's inflationary 
pressure will chiefly have an effect on inflation next year. 
Comrade Wang Yida noted that in 1993 the rate of currency 
circulation was 30 percent in excess, causing the general price 
level this year to rise by more than 8 percent. In terms of 
demand, the inflation caused by demand usually comes a little 
delayed, and the effect of the inertia of high investment in 
1993 will be maintained for a time this year. Approximately 40 
percent of investment will be transferred to consumption funds, 
and this transformation will be reflected in the market. The 
main reason for the nation's economy being currently overheated 
is investment. Even if we adopt macroeconomic regulatory and 
control measures to gradually stabilize the prices of investment 
products and means of production, retail market prices and the 
prices of consumer goods will continue to rise for a time 
because of the costs. However, this year's measures for price 
reform and other reforms will, more or less, directly and 
indirectly, force prices upward. Because of this we must aim to 
control price increases to within 10 percent. Increases in the 
scale of investment must also be maintained within appropriate 
limits in order to ensure the sustained, rapid and healthy 
development of the economy.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "Commodity Exchange Deals </F>
Top $67 Million"] 
  [Text] Beijing Commodity Exchange (BCE) reported a new 
record of daily transaction value on Tuesday with 590 million 
yuan ($67.82 million) worth of contracts clinched. 
  Total trading included 2,080 contracts of corn, 5,400 
contracts of treasury bonds, and 1,874 contracts of sugar. 
  Exchange officials said Tuesday's breakthrough represents 
another big stride for the exchange after its daily transaction 
value topped 300 million yuan ($34.5 million) on March 8. 
  The exchange has experienced steady growth since it opened 
on 
November 18. 
  During the 50-plus trading days, total transaction value has 
topped 5 billion yuan ($574.7 million). 
  Most of the deals took place in corn, sugar, beans, and 
treasury bonds, the exchange said. 
  More than 20 kinds of commodities in four 
sectors--agriculture, metals, energy and chemical products, and 
treasury bonds--are now bartered at the exchange's four pools, 
each with a capacity of 100 members. 
  So far, 225 member companies from the country's 25 [total as 
published] provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are 
conducting business at the exchange . 
  The BCE also boasts the country's biggest trading hall with 
a 
floor space of 1,800 square metres. 
  Meanwhile, with advanced equipment installed, the exchange's 
trading, clearing, risk management and information analyses are 
conducted by computer. 
  In addition, the exchange also releases its quotations to 
international news agencies like the Associated Press, Reuters 
and some Chinese information networks. 
  All of the deals clinched at the exchange are in standard 
contracts. 
  Qiao Gang, president of the exchange, said the final goal of 
the exchange is to develop itself into one of the most important 
futures markets in Asia. 
  The city built the exchange as a key step toward developing 
into an international metropolis and a modern financial and 
trade centre.

<F P=106> [By Zhao Haiyan (6392 3189 3601) from the "Two Sessions </F>
Forum"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Tong Zenyin, 
deputy director of the Securities Commission of the State 
Council and vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory 
Committee, today denied there was a possibility of setting up a 
third securities exchange this year. He said that in view of 
the present situation in China's securities market, the time is 
not right for setting up a third exchange. 
  Tong Zengyin, who is a member of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and 
is attending the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee here, said that the securities market in China is 
still in an experimental stage and the recent situation in the 
stock market is not quite satisfactory. This shows that 
securities markets in China are not yet mature. Under such 
circumstances, it would not be advisable to set up a new 
securities exchange. 
  Tong Zengyin said that as far as the country as a whole is 
concerned, all the securities exchanges are located in the south 
and there is no such market in the hinterland. Their location 
is irrational. He held that viewed from location, the number of 
securities exchanges should be increased, and it is necessary to 
site one in the north. The best way is to have securities 
exchanges in the north, south, east, and west. 
  He said that at present many localities have applied to set 
up a securities exchange, and where the new securities should be 
located depends on timing. When it is the right time to set up 
a new securities exchange, it will be necessary to look at 
market developments and find out what locality has the more 
developed market and needs a securities exchange. Besides, it 
is also necessary to find out whether or not advanced technology 
and telecommunications conditions are available for the 
formation of a market. 
  Tong Zengyin holds that the situation of the two securities 
exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen is not bad and the two 
exchanges are growing very fast. The securities exchange in 
Shanghai in particular has developed to a considerable size and 
is ready to merge with the international market. It has a very 
bright future.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (CNS) -- Vice chairman of the 
State Council Securities Policy Committee, vice chairman of the 
China Supervision and Management Commission and member of the 
CPPCC Mr. Tong Zengyin said that the conditions would not be 
ready for foreign-funded banks to engage in RMB 
[renminbi]-related business until the Chinese commercial banking 
system had been established. 
  Mr. Tong said that China was reforming its banking system 
and 
owing to the state-owned pofessional banks being in the process 
of being switched to becoming state-owned commercialized banks, 
permitting foreign-funded banks to operate RMB-related business 
would be unfair competition prior to the establishment of the 
commercialized bank system in the country because of the great 
discrepancies in ways of management and the tax rate between 
foreign-funded banks and the domestically-funded banks. 
  The opening to foreign banks by any country, he said, should 
be based on its own realities and China, in line with its own 
situation, first permitted foreign banks to operate foreign 
currency business and would later create the conditions for them 
to open to RMB-related business. 
  Such opening, he added, would not be overall at the 
beginning. Places like Shenzhen and Xiamen, however, were 
permitted to open first since the ratio of major state-owned 
enterprises there was small, the economy there mainly dominated 
by the market economy and most of the banks there were 
commercial banks.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (CNS) -- The main task for macro- 
economic regulation of the financial sector set for this year is 
to place strict control of fixed assets investment in accordance 
with the state credit plan, the Vice President of the People's 
Bank of China Mr. Yin Jieyan said in a recent meeting. The 
results of such control, according to Mr. Yin, will be the key 
to development of the national economy this year. 
  The meeting centered on examination work by the banks 
nationwide, confirming that the main theme of financial 
supervision this year would concentrate on inspection of 
financial institutions with strict restrictions on the scale of 
loans for fixed assets investment by those institutions. 
  This year is very important, according to Mr. Yin, as it be 
the time when intensive restructuring of the financial system 
takes place. Following the change of functions by the central 
bank, it should concentrate on supervision and administration of 
financial institutions with strengthened inspection. 
Examination work would guarantee effective implementation of 
the restructuring of the financial system and help financial 
enterprises develop in a healthy way while at the same keeping 
the financial system in order. 
  Mr. Yin stressed that inspection departments of various 
levels of the bank had to gather their strength to launch 
examination work on the control of loans for fixed assets 
investment in the second half of this year. They had to deal 
harshly with excessive releases of loans, loans coming from 
working capital and loans for speculation in real estate shares.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Yueh-ying (0491 4727 3841): "Dai </F>
Xianglong, Vice Governor of People's Bank of China, Speaks on 
the Four Conditions Needed for Foreign Banks To Expand Business 
in China"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government once said that when the 
economy inside the country develops to a certain level, foreign 
banks can come to China in large numbers to set up branches. 
What is the current situation? 
  According to Dai Xianglong, vice governor of the People's 
Bank of China, China has a positive attitude toward foreign 
financial organizations which want to come to China to develop 
business, but because it involves the problem of changing 
China's financial system, many areas have to be considered and 
looked at carefully. 
  Regarding the question of whether foreign banks can also 
engage in renminbi business in China, Dai Xianglong frankly 
pointed out that the branches of foreign banks in China are 
mainly operating foreign exchange business, and that there are 
quite a number of them who have also wanted to operate renminbi 
business, but here several conditions have to be considered: 
  First, the management standard of mainland banks must go 
through a process of improvement and internationalization, and 
speaking in terms of the current conditions, the commercial 
banks inside the country do not have the ability to compete with 
the commercial banks from outside the country. Second, the main 
objects of service of the Bank of China are the enterprises 
which cannot operate completely on their own; when the state 
bank can rid itself of this burden and can release loans at its 
own discretion, it can then compete with foreign banks. Third, 
the tax rate among Chinese banks is different from the tax rate 
among the branches of foreign banks in China, and he said that 
after these three problems are solved, foreign banks can start 
operating renminbi business. "But we have already tried it out 
in Xiamen and some other areas, and we may expand the project in 
the future." 
  In addition, what must be stressed is that when foreign 
banks 
come to China to set up financial organizations, the main 
purpose is to arouse interest among investors in their own 
countries for investment in China, and not to completely rely on 
the operation of renminbi business in China to earn foreign 
exchange. 
  Talking about the intention of Taiwan's financial 
organizations to come to the mainland, Dai Xianglong said that 
in this area, Taiwan funds are somewhat the same as foreign 
funds, and the mainland will still handle Taiwan funds in the 
same way it handles foreign funds. However, a more lenient 
attitude can apply to certain areas; for example, when a foreign 
bank wants to set up a branch in China, it should have 20 
billion [no currency as published] in capital and it will take 
three years for it to set up a representative office. When 
Taiwan's financial organizations come to China to do business, 
these rules can be lifted appropriately. He disclosed that, at 
present, 14 nongovernmental commercial banks in Taiwan have 
expressed an interest in setting up offices on the mainland.

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- China's deficit has 
been within a normal and permissible range, according to a 
Chinese financial expert. 
  "China's total debts for 1994 will come to nearly 130 
billion 
yuan, which seems big," said Zhao Haikuan, honorary director of 
the Finance Institute of the People's Bank of China. 
  "This is the result of a change of accounting methods this 
year, and the change will not affect the actual size of the 
debt," he said. 
  "We formerly regarded what we borrowed as revenue income and 
included expenses on debt servicing in total expenditures; the 
shortfall between revenues and expenditures was regarded as the 
hard deficit," he said, who is also a member of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference. 
  Many experts and scholars at home and abroad expressed 
disagreement with this practice. To more clearly reflect the 
balance between the country's normal revenues and expenditures 
and the scale of debt, starting from this year, the country is 
using a different method of calculating the deficit, Zhao said. 
  Income from borrowing will no longer be included in total 
revenues. The entire deficit will be covered by issuing 
treasury bonds, instead of by loans from banks as was the case 
previously. As a result, the amount of the debt goes up 
accordingly, Zhao said. 
  This year 48.081 billion yuan for servicing domestic and 
foreign debts due for repayment will be covered by issuing 
treasury bonds and 14.245 billion yuan of new foreign loans will 
be used for the construction of key projects. 
  "All these factors lead to a seemingly big increase in the 
total debt," Zhao said. 
  However, Zhao pointed out, due to various factors, deficit 
is 
also a serious problem in China. To some extent, it will have a 
great impact on China's economy, which should be given due 
attention and should never be ignored, he warned. 
  On how to reduce deficit, Zhao said that from a long-term 
point of view it is imperative to bring money supply under 
strict control. Excessive issuing of currency is caused by too 
large an amount of deficit and vice versa. 
  He suggested that the state appropriately slow down the 
economic growth rate, pay more attention to efficiency and 
reduce the scale of investment into fixed assets. 
  In Zhao's view, the country's investment into fixed assets 
is 
not compatible with its national strengthen. 
  In addition, tax collection should be strengthened to avoid 
tax evasion, and administrative spendings should be cut, Zhao 
added.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Lingling: "Inflation Remains the </F>
Country's Economic Scourge"] 
  [Text] Though inflation continued to run loose in 
February, China's central authorities seem confident they can 
tie it down. 
  On Tuesday, Premier Li Peng said the government would do its 
best, with the nation's help, to keep the retail price index 
below the budgeted 10 percent. 
  However, it will be a tough task as the pressure powering 
inflation is growing, and in January and February, retail prices 
rose 20 percent higher than in the same period of last year, 
said the State Statistics Bureau (SSB). 
  So dealing with the problem has become a priority. 
  It will mean sharply cutting investment in fixed assets and 
the strict control of consumer spending, which was agreed at a 
forum on monetary policies held recently in Beijing. 
  The capital's financiers decided the central People's Bank 
of 
China should throttle the broad money supply to deal safely with 
inflation's time bomb. 
  Economists believed runaway inflation inevitably leads to a 
decline in people's living standards and threatens economic and 
social stability. 
  The SSB said people's living standards in some cities 
plunged 
as much as 40 percent last year. 
  And farmers, who make up about 80 percent of the population, 
are no happier than their urban counterparts. 
  The statistics showed their real per capita income remained 
more or less static last year. 
  Most economists said two main factors were causing the 
current rise in inflation. 
  One was hefty investments in fixed assets, the other was the 
explosive increase in consumer spending. 
  Investment in fixed assets grew by 47 percent last year, 
while production advanced only 10 percent, said Yu Tianyi, 
professor from the China Finance Institute. 
  To curb rocketing investment in fixed assets and real 
estate, 
the country put the brakes on the money supply in the second 
half of last year. 
  However, the move failed to retrieve most of the capital 
which had by then become reinforced concrete. Instead, working 
capital was squeezed, slowing the growth in production. 
  Yu said holding down investment in fixed assets would need 
administrative measures backed by stern monetary policies. 
  The government has resolved to slow the country's economic 
growth this year, said Premier Li Peng, in his keynote speech to 
the National People's Congress (NPC). 
  The target is a 9 percent growth rate, four per cent lower 
than the figure for the last two years. 
  To hold down the growth in fixed assets investment while 
maintaining modest economic progress, the central bank should 
impose strict controls over credit and loans, economists say. 
  However, that does not mean shutting down the money supply 
indiscriminately. 
  Nationwide investment should focus on propping up essential 
industries and agriculture and helping loss-making State 
enterprises to improve their technology and production capacity. 
  These targets will only be achieved if governments, State 
enterprises and banks speed up internal reforms and improve 
their management. 
  However, some economists support a more flexible credit 
policy to sustain backing for ailing State enterprises. 
  For their ability to pay back loans may decline if their 
investments reduce sharply said Dai Genyou, an official with the 
People's Bank of China. 
  The other cause of inflation is the huge rise in spending. 
  The tight monetary policies imposed late last year have held 
down the prices of production materials, but had little effect 
on consumer goods, said Dai. 
  Economists trace rising prices to the lifting last year of 
controls on the cost of most consumer goods. The problem has 
been further fueled by people's increased spending power as 
their wages go up. 
  Dai said a third of State enterprises were in the red last 
year despite considerably increased production. Much of their 
cash was used to finance the rapid growth in employee's wages. 
  China should cap pay rises in order to restrain the growth 
in 
the retail price index, said Dai.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "More Sectors Will Open to </F>
Foreign Investors"] 
  [Text] More sectors will be open for foreign capital in 
the future to boost overseas investment in China, a senior 
foreign trade official said in Beijing yesterday. 
  China will admit overseas investors to such sectors as real 
estate, commercial retail sales, finance, insurance, and cargo 
and transportation agency services and consultancies. 
  But such moves must be made on the basis of mutual benefit, 
said Jiao Sufen, director of the foreign investment division 
under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co operation 
(Moftec). 
  Jiao said that foreign-funded projects must be in tone with 
China's economic development. They may be guided into such 
sectors as machinery, electronics, heavy chemicals, new 
materials, automobiles and automation equipment. 
  She called for keen efforts to buoy export-oriented foreign- 
funded firms, transform aged enterprises, upgrade technology and 
equipment, and further improve quality to boost the 
competitiveness of China's products on the world market. 
  Jiao signalled a halt to overseas investment in ordinary 
labour- intensive, simple processing and assembly projects as 
well as those involving products that are difficult to export. 
  Instead, Jiao encouraged overseas investors to develop the 
energy, transport, raw materials and agricultural sectors. 
  The official vowed to further improve China's investment 
climate and provide better services to foreign investors. 
  China encourages trans-national companies to finance the 
country's infrastructure and high-tech industries, Jiao said, 
adding that they could either invest in a specific project or 
get involved by transferring and purchasing State assets, stocks 
and securities. 
  Optimistic about the future of overseas investment, Jiao 
said 
China now enjoys political and social stability, a fast-growing 
economy, and a long-term blueprint for economic development. 
  Since the country opened to the outside world in the late 
l970s, China has approved more than 174,000 foreign-funded 
ventures with contractual investment totalling $221.3 billion 
and real investment hitting $60 billion. 
  Last year alone, the Chinese Government ratified more than 
83,200 foreign-funded enterprises involving $110.5 billion in 
contractual volume and $25.8 billion in real overseas investment.

<F P=106> ["Special feature" by reporter Hong Wen (3126 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 10 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A 
Hong Kong banker pointed out: As the Chinese mainland speeds up 
the pace of financial structural reform, new changes are taking 
place in the mainland's overseas lending activities and the 
traditional policy loans are increasingly giving way to 
commercial loans. Under this tendency, foreign banks' 
traditional practice of getting involved in the mainland's 
lending activities is expected to face a challenge. 
  Wu Lien-feng, deputy general manager of the Nanyang 
Commercial Bank, informed this reporter: In the past, on the 
mainland under the planned economic structure, shortterm 
commercial loans from outside the borders were guaranteed by 
specialized state banks, and foreign banks also used to accept 
loans of this form. Nevertheless, in recent months this 
traditional pattern has been gradually broken. 
  Basing his statements on analysis, he said: China has 
increasingly come to realize that financial structural reform is 
the "dragon head" of transition to a market economy, and in the 
second half of last year, it was determined to carry out reform 
as quickly as possible. The most eye-catching move was to 
transform the four major specialized banks from policy into 
commercial banks. To put in another way, the role of the four 
specialized banks in overseas policy loans as a guarantor will 
be gradually diluted so as to enable them to concentrate their 
resources on businesses as commercial banks. 
  As a Hong Kong bank which was the earliest to set up a China 
internal business department and branches in the mainland's 
special economic zones, the Nanyang Commercial Bank has closely 
watched the relevant changes and adopted active measures to 
participate in the mainland's financial reform, such as 
readjusting its China business strategy and expanding the scope 
of operations. According to Mr. Wu, his bank took the lead in 
organizing a $40-million international syndicated loan with the 
China Ocean Shipping Company acting as a guarantor rather than 
borrowing from any financial institutions on the mainland. 
Moreover, the Nanyang Commercial Bank recently provided 
commercial loans worth millions of U.S. dollars to a car parts 
manufacturing plant in Guizhou Province. This was the first 
batch of commercial loans extended to the province by the Bank 
of China Group. 
  In addition, according to statistics, although China was 
active for a while in extending syndicated loans to outside 
financial institutions in the second half of last year, the 
number of loans with specialized banks acting as a guarantor was 
very limited. They were mostly guaranteed by local financial 
institutions, such as the Guangdong Development Bank and the 
Pudong Development Bank. 
  However, because the credibility ratings of local banks are 
relatively low and their financial strengths are not enough to 
cope with the huge market demands, some bankers are worried that 
the recent briskness will not last long and the lending 
activities of mainland enterprises outside the borders may be 
adversely affected. 
  People in the industry pointed out: Although foreign banks 
universally adopt a careful approach toward the changes, many of 
them are also seeking a breakthrough and making active 
preparations, because from a long-term point of view, China's 
financial reform is conducive to absorbing foreign capital. 
Therefore, it would be better for them to become actively 
involved, promote the changes with good intentions, and expand 
their businesses while adapting themselves to the changed 
situation rather than looking on with folded arms and letting a 
golden opportunity slip by.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The 
advantages of introducing and utilizing foreign capital for 
modernization in China has been acknowledged by people 
throughout the world. However, with the increase in large 
numbers of foreign-invested enterprises, the number of law 
violations related to such enterprises is also increasing. 
Because of this, personalities of economic circles and even of 
academic circles have put forward this question: Are we using 
foreign capital or are we being used by foreign capital? 
  An article entitled "Cool Thinking in Foreign Capital Fever" 
published in the "Economic Square" column of the latest issue of 
ZHONGHUA WENZHAI [China Digest] has incisively raised this 
question, which must not be neglected, urging people to think 
and observe calmly. 
  The article points out that one of the inharmonious shadows 
is "false joint ventures and deceptive practices," that is, some 
enterprises are only joint ventures in name, but are enjoying 
preferential treatment for joint ventures. In recent years, 
many cases of this "false Sino-foreign joint venture disease" 
have been found and the "disease" seems to be spreading. In 
these false joint venture enterprises, the foreign side is 
usually not committed to investing, but collects one-time 
"service charges" or takes in regular "cooperation fees" of a 
certain percentage. What is particularly worthy of our 
attention is that some foreign businessmen with ulterior motives 
have sought "wedding ties" of this kind on their own initiative, 
have gained capital by cheating, and have then fled with the 
money. 
  The second is "exaggerating the amount of investment to 
build 
oneself up." Over a very long period, there has been a 
phenomena of exaggerated investment in the foreigners' visible 
assets -- passing old equipment off as new equipment, inferior 
equipment as superior equipment, and low-price equipment as 
high-price equipment. A foreign businessman negotiated five 
identical joint venture projects with several provinces and 
municipalities in China and imported five sets of equipment at 
$2.4 million each. During the later inspection by commodity 
inspection departments, all these five sets of equipment were 
pieced together abroad, and their total price was only slightly 
over $900,000. 
  The third is "declaring losses instead of profits to evade 
taxes." In recent years, some foreign-invested enterprises have 
resorted to various tricks to evade taxes, the most common being 
is to "declare losses instead of profits." In 1991, a total of 
4,838 foreign-invested enterprises declared losses totalling 
3.66 billion yuan in Guangdong Province, accounting for 53 
percent of enterprises involved in remittance settlement. As a 
result, quite a few joint venture enterprises have emerged which 
"always suffer losses" but will "never close down," and which 
have been constantly expanding their scale of production. These 
enterprises are in reality reaping more and more profits with 
each passing year. 
  Besides, there are numerous other tricks which have appeared 
one after another, such as using foreign capital as a pretext 
for smuggling, making profits by exaggerating the amount of 
capital introduced and covering up the amount of capital taken 
out, fleeing to avoid paying debts, and so on. 
  In conclusion, the article pointed out that the 
participation 
of some foreign businessmen in illegal activities is not 
something new. Such activities have existed for the past 13 
years. They have become especially conspicuous, because the 
number of foreign- invested enterprises has increased greatly. 
Because foreign- invested enterprises are special by nature, 
effective techniques for managing domestic enterprises may not 
work in the management of foreign-invested enterprises. 
Therefore, many urgent problems require a prompt solution by 
the departments concerned, and better regulations and rules 
should be formulated so that the foreign capital fever can truly 
give impetus to rapid economic development in China.

  [Text] Fan Gang, a middle-aged economist who is quite 
famous on the mainland, was appointed vice director of the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Economics Institute a few 
days ago. 
  The Economics Institute is a comprehensive research 
institute 
engaged in research on the macroeconomy. Most of the 
institute's former directors and vice directors have been 
seasoned economists. 
  Fan, 40, went to the Great Northern Wilderness in northeast 
China to join the local production and construction corps in the 
1960's. He was admitted to the Economics Department of Hebei 
University in 1978 and to the Postgraduate Institute of 
Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 1982. He 
then received Master's and doctorate degrees. From 1985 to 
1987, he was at Harvard as a visiting scholar. Since 1988, he 
has worked with the economics institute. 
  Fan's ideas are dynamic and he is an industrious writer. He 
has published many books, of which the important ones are: 
Theoretical Outline of Publicly Owned Macro Economy, 
(he was the principal author of this book); Comparison and 
Synthesis of Three Major Contemporary Economic Theoretical 
Systems; and Progressive Path-- Economic Ideas in 
Economic Reform. He has also published over 100 academic 
papers with two million characters in total, including "Gray 
Market Theories" in JINGJI YANJIU [ECONOMIC RESEARCH] and other 
academic journals. His work has had a rather big impact on 
theoretical circles. In 1992 he was promoted to the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences as a researcher, which was an 
exception to the rule, and was conferred with the title of a 
state-level middle-aged and younger expert, as he had made 
outstanding contributions, and in 1993 he became one of the 
youngest tutors of doctoral students in social science circles. 
  Recently, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has boldly 
promoted a number of middle-aged and younger scholars to 
leadership positions. Li Peilin, 39, was appointed vice 
director of the Institute of Sociology; Cai Fang, 37, vice 
director of the Institute of Population Studies; Zhuo Xinping, 
39, vice director of the Institute of Research on World 
Religions, and Zhao Yifan, over 40, vice director of the 
Institute of Foreign Literature.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Some 25 village and 
township heads have been invited to be consultants to the 
Ministry of Construction on China's village and township 
development. 
  The ministry has invited over 40 local officials whose 
villages and townships rank among the best in construction and 
development to attend a meeting held in Beijing, asking for 
their opinions and suggestions in the field. 
  China has a total of 3.75 million villages and 37,000 
townships. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to 
their construction and modernization in the current reform and 
economic development drive. 
  In recent years the country has seen large numbers of modern 
towns with good layout, environment, and industrial and 
commercial strengths emerge in rural areas. 
  Construction Minister Hou Jie and Deputy Construction 
Minister Mao Rubai have issued letters of appointment to the 25 
consultants. 
  Hou said the booming rural economy has promoted the 
development of township construction. 
  While talking with some village and township heads, Hou 
found 
that many of them have rich experience in local development. 
  The 25 consultants were selected as representatives from 
developed areas in the east, south and coastal regions, and from 
underdeveloped areas of the west, north and central parts of the 
country.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
Center of Chinese Rural Social and Economic Assessment said a 
few days ago that last year, as far as the gross rural social 
output value was concerned, 4,989 townships and towns throughout 
the country exceeded 100 million yuan, including 72 townships 
and towns each earning over 10 billion yuan, and 434 townships 
and towns each earning over 500 million yuan. 
  The 10 best townships and towns according to the total rural 
social output value were in the following order: Caigongzhuang 
Township of Jinghai County, Tianjin Municipality; Qianzhou 
Township of Wexi County, Jiangsu Province; Shengze Town of 
Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province; Beijiao Town of Shunde City, 
Guangdong Province; Guizhou Town of Shunde City, Guangdong 
Province; Ninghai Town of Mouping County, Shandong Province; 
Xinzhaizi Town in Ganjingzi District of Dalian City, Liaoning 
Province; Maqiao Township of Minxing Prefecture, Shanghai 
Municipality; Zhouzhuang Town of Jiangyin City, Jiangsu 
Province; and Luoshe Town of Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province. 
  These townships and towns had the following major 
characteristics: 
  Great rural economic strength. Townships and towns earning 
100 million yuan only accounted for 10 percent of the total 
number of townships and towns of the whole country, and their 
rural population accounted for 20 percent of the national rural 
population, but they created 50 percent of the gross rural 
social output value and two-thirds of the gross rural industrial 
output value of the whole country. 
  A high level of rural industrialization. The nonagricultural 
output value of townships and towns earning 100 million yuan 
accounted for 88.2 percent of the total, which was 24 percent 
higher than the national average. Of this, the nonagricultural 
output value of townships and towns earning over 1 billion yuan 
accounted for 95.8 percent, which was 31 percent higher than the 
national average; whereas the nonagricultural output value 
accounted for 94.5 percent, which was 30 percent higher that the 
national average. 
  Township and town enterprises are the backbone of townships 
and towns earning 100 million yuan. The output value of 
township and town enterprises from townships and towns earning 
100 million yuan accounted for 52.8 percent of the national 
output value of township and town enterprises. The average 
number of personnel working in each of these enterprises was 
8.81, which was 73.8 percent higher than the average national 
level, and the number of personnel working in each of the 
enterprise from townships and towns earning 1 billion yuan was 
25.2, which was 300 percent higher than the national average 
level. The labor force of township and town enterprises from 
townships and towns earning over 100 million yuan created an 
average output value of 27,000 yuan, which was 62.6 percent 
higher than the national average; and every enterprise paid an 
average tax amount of 25,500 yuan, which was 300 percent higher 
than the national average. 
  Townships and towns earning 100 million yuan spread over 
economically developed coastal areas. Viewed from the 
distribution of townships and towns earning 100 million yuan, 
Jiangsu Province ranked first in the country and had 949 such 
townships and towns, which accounted for nearly 50 percent of 
the total number of such townships and towns. The order 
continued: Shandong Province had 892 such townships and towns, 
Zhejiang Province had 538 such townships and towns, and 
Guangdong Province had 425 such townships and towns.

  [Text] Haikou, March 24 (XINHUA) -- China is making a 
breakthrough in setting up a social security system to meet the 
demand of the ongoing market economy reform, an official with 
the Ministry of Labor said. 
  Jiao Kaiping, who is in charge of social security affairs 
under the ministry, made the remarks at a recent international 
symposium held in Haikou, capital of Hainan Province. 
  Jiao said that ever since 1984, China has exerted great 
efforts to establish a social security system concerned with 
pensions, unemployment, medical care and job injuries. 
  Before 1984, the heavy burden of pension insurance was 
shouldered only by enterprises, while at present, the insurance 
premium is pooled from three sources, namely the state, 
enterprises and individuals. 
  By the end of 1993 China had spread an overall pension 
insurance system among state-run and collective enterprises. In 
some economically-active coastal areas, pension insurance was 
instituted to cover employees in various kinds of enterprises 
run by foreign businessmen, private concerns, townships and 
towns. 
  China's unemployment insurance system now covers more than 
74 
million workers in some 470,000 state-run enterprises. 
  In accordance with regulations issued last April by the 
state, the unemployment insurance system will be extended to 
include non- state enterprises. 
  In addition, overall social insurance targeting job injuries 
and medical treatment is being instituted in an attempt to ease 
the burdens of enterprises.

<F P=106> ["Economic commentary" by Shen Gang (3088 6921): "Lifting </F>
the Veil of Mystery -- on the Conversion of China's Defense 
Industry to the Production of Goods for Civilian Use"] 
  [Text] The conversion of the defense industry to civilian 
use has long been a familiar topic in the Chinese media -- the 
process of converting China's defense industry to civilian use 
has continued for 15 years. Today, the experience of China's 
success in converting its defense industry to civilian use is 
drawing worldwide attention. 
  According to the latest statistics by authoritative persons, 
in 1993 the output of goods for civilian use produced by China's 
defense industry increased by more than 30 percent over the 
previous year, or higher than the growth rate of China's 
industrial output, and the proportion of civilian goods in the 
total output value of the defense industry sharply rose from 8.1 
percent 15 years earlier to 77.4 percent. 
  Defense industry technology has passed out of its former 
mysterious colors and is benefiting tens of millions of ordinary 
people. People are enjoying more and more the fruits of the 
peaceful use of defense technology. Today, more than 50 percent 
of China's cameras are produced by defense industry enterprises, 
and 65 percent of bicycles are produced by defense industry 
factories. The "minibuses and cabs" on the streets of Beijing 
already have a bigger transportation capability than the subway, 
and three quarters of these yellow minibuses and cabs were 
produced by munitions factories. By employing nuclear radiation 
technology, China has cultivated 325 new farming species, adding 
an output of 4 billion kg of grain and an output of 200 million 
kg of cotton each year. The shipbuilding industry, which could 
only produce warships and gunboats in the past, can now 
manufacture technologically advanced roll-on, roll-off 
freighters, shuttle tankers, and scientific research ships. The 
annual tonnage of ships manufactured by China already ranks 
fifth in the world. Its aircraft industry not only can produce 
batches of the "Yun-7" and "Yun-11" civilian planes, but is 
successfully cooperating with large multinational corporations 
like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The launching of the 
Australian satellites, in which the Chinese take pride, 
Beijing's electronic collider, and the Yangpu Bridge are all 
good examples of "converting defense industry into civilian 
use." The new Qinshan Nuclear Power Station produced 1.4 
billion kilowatts in 1993, and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station was already put into trial use. 
  In the early 1980's, with foresight toward the changes in 
the 
world situation, China made a historical step in the conversion 
of the defense industry into civilian use. From 1986 onward, 
the conversion of the defense industry into civilian use was 
officially incorporated into the state plan. In the Seventh 
Five-Year Plan and the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the state invested 
over 10 billion yuan in loans and prepared over 700 projects for 
civilian use, with the result that over 70 percent of defense 
industry enterprises now possess their own civilian products. 
At the same time, over 2,000 military technologies had their 
secrecies cracked, some of which have been developed for the 
production of civilian products. 
  Since the beginning of the 1990's, China's peaceful use of 
defense industry technology has already become a world trend. 
In converting defense industry technology into civilian use 
under a market economy, China has new challenges from the 
structure, capital, and the market. 
  China's defense industry enterprises have come out of the 
closed door and are striving for survival and returns. Some 
defense industry enterprises, which "kept foreigners at a 
distance" in the past, have now set up joint ventures with 
foreign enterprises. In Sichuan's Chongqing, Henan's Luoyang, 
and Guangdong's Shenzhen, a number of Sino-foreign-funded 
automobile, motorcycle, and electronic enterprises have imported 
foreign capital and management systems. The joint-stock system 
is beginning to be tried in the defense industry. Following the 
change of the Huanghe Television Factory, the Feiyada Watch 
Factory, and the Guangzhou Shipbuilding Factory to the joint 
stock system on their original foundations, the Hainan Peace 
Industries Limited, a large joint-stock group formed by the 
aeronautic, shipbuilding, aerospace, and nuclear industries and 
banking institutions, has been set up. This type of capital- 
concentrated economic entity, which has been separated from many 
parent enterprises, does not have an administrative supervisor 
and is powerful as a fist, winning huge room and opportunities 
for the development of conversion of the defense industry into 
civilian use. 
  Experts of the state's decisionmaking authorities are 
exploring how to change the passive maintenance of the defense 
industry to its active "downsizing." Leaders of the State 
Council have also proposed considering the idea of concentrating 
the production of military products so that their production is 
to the full capacity, promoting technological progress and the 
improvement of returns, while, on the other hand, doing their 
best to orient the production of civilian goods to the market so 
as to change the current situation in which investment in the 
conversion of the defense industry into civilian use is 
scattered, too wide a scope is embraced, and returns are 
unsatisfactory. In this way, defense industry enterprises can 
maintain their productive vitality and shirk the passivity of a 
heavy burden. At present, people with insight in the 
economically developed areas of the eastern coastal areas have 
already seen the catalyzing role of this idea in economic 
development. They also find the advantages of manpower, 
technology, and equipment in defense industry enterprises. A 
number of cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, and 
Hainan have set up technological and industrial areas for the 
conversion of the defense industry into civilian use. They use 
land, capital, and policies to attract defense industry 
enterprises to go there for the purpose of converting the 
defense industry into civilian use. By utilizing defense 
technology in a peaceful way, China's economy can ultimately 
develop steadily and in a sustained way in the world's economic 
setup.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Shuxi (2621 2885 0823): "The Gold Industry </F>
Is Being Made Part of Market Economy"] 
  [Text] The gold industry, which occupies a special 
position within the economy of our country, has undergone great 
changes and reforms since 1993. Gold enterprises have now left 
the rigid control of the planned economy and the pattern of 
solely relying on state policy for development, and have entered 
the great sea of the market economy. 
  China is a big gold-producing and gold-consuming country. 
Since reform and opening up, our country's gold industry has 
rapidly developed and our gold production ability has increased 
five times. In order to expedite the development of the gold 
industry in our country so as to meet the needs of market 
economy, reform, and opening up, the state has tremendously 
reformed the system of production and management of the gold 
industry. 
  First, reform of the system. The State Administration of 
Gold Control has been abolished, and the management system 
combining the government and enterprises has been changed. The 
China Gold Company, which is now under the leadership of the 
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, has really become an 
economic entity, and "the company has the right to occupy and 
utilize according to law the assets granted to it by the 
ministry for operation and management, as well as the right to 
reap profits from the assets and take disciplinary actions 
regarding the assets." 
  Second, reform of policy. Our country has carried out a 
reform of the pricing system of gold beginning in September 
1993, and the purchasing price of gold inside the country has 
been increased 80 percent in one stroke, so that it matches the 
gold price in the international community. However, the 
preferential policy and favorable treatment provided by the 
state to gold enterprises has been canceled. For example, the 
development of the gold industry no longer enjoys low-interest 
bank loans; gold mines no longer enjoy preferential tax waivers 
or reductions, but must pay value-added taxes, resource taxes, 
and geological resource compensation fees; the system of 
retention of foreign exchange by gold enterprises has been 
abolished, and so on. All of these work to strip gold 
enterprises of their patron saint, so they can only enter the 
market and develop and compete according to market laws. At the 
same time, the state will gradually open up the gold market, and 
gold will gradually lose its original currency role and enter 
the market as a commodity. 
  Third, expand opening up. The state has agreed to let the 
gold industry carry out pilot projects for attracting foreign 
capital to develop China's gold mines, and the Ministry of 
Metallurgical Industry has granted the China Gold Company the 
corresponding rights. A person in charge of the China Gold 
Company told this reporter that the company will first open up 
some low-grade gold mines which require hard effort in ore 
dressing, to carry out limited cooperation with foreign 
businessmen. Foreign businessmen have been responding to the 
idea very enthusiastically and have come to China to discuss 
cooperation. On 20 January, Xu Daquan, vice minister of 
metallurgical industry, said when meeting the gold delegation 
led by former Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney that China 
welcomes powerful foreign companies coming to China for 
cooperation. Cui Lan, chairman of the board of directors of the 
China Gold Company, said during an interview with this reporter 
that, when we attract foreign capital to develop gold resources, 
we are not doing so merely for attracting funds; it is more 
important that we grasp the opportunity to learn advanced 
technology and management experience from developed countries 
through cooperation in development. The company has already 
reached cooperation agreements with some advanced companies from 
abroad. 
  Cui Xiwu, general manager of the China Gold Company, said 
that, along with reforms of the gold price system and industrial 
system, our country's gold production and management system and 
operation strategy will change in five directions: From the 
pattern in which the China Gold Company oversees administration 
and shoulders unlimited responsibilities while its subordinated 
enterprises operate in a scattered manner to the pattern whereby 
the company is a shareholding state company while its 
subordinated enterprises become the main body for production and 
operation; from the pattern in which the company operates mainly 
to discharge government duties and functions to the pattern 
whereby the company completely becomes an enterprise which runs 
the business entities well and realizes consortium-like 
operation; from the pattern in which the company monopolizes 
business and carries out construction with its own funds, to the 
pattern whereby it actively utilizes domestic and foreign funds 
and realizes joint-venture operation with funds from within and 
without the country; from the pattern in which the company only 
engages in gold exploration and dressing to the pattern whereby 
it promotes gold products, develops areas to which gold products 
can be applied, and diversifies operation so as to transcend 
various trades; and from the pattern in which the company uses 
only domestic resources to the pattern whereby it uses both 
domestic and international resources, and walks toward 
internationalized operation incorporating both the domestic and 
international markets.

  [Text] Beijing, March 23 (XINHUA) -- China's banks are to 
pool more money to ensure that agricultural producers have 
enough funds, in good time, to buy the necessary farming 
supplies, according to a new official circular. 
  It was issued jointly by the People's Bank of China, the 
Bank 
of Industry and Commerce, the Agricultural Bank and the Bank of 
China. 
  It urged that steps should be taken to give priority to the 
supply of working capital for farm production necessities such 
as chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 
  The banks should provide the working capital in good time 
for 
the producers and suppliers of fertilizers and pesticides who 
have adequate resources and production environment and whose 
products have gained favor with farmers. 
  Priority should be given to the money supply, including 
foreign currency, for imports of such products approved by the 
State Council. 
  To ensure that farmers can carry out their seasonal work, 
loans to them should also be distributed in good time, the 
circular stated.

  [Text] Kunming, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Lancang River and its valley are being developed into a key 
state production base for energy. 
  "The overall development of the Lancang River and its valley 
is the largest project of Yunnan province and requires the 
efforts of several generations," He Zhiqiang, governor of 
Yunnan, said. 
  According to the governor, geological prospecting in the 
area 
started in the 1950s. 
  According to the blueprint, work on the upper reaches of the 
Lancang River, from Deqin County to Yongping County, will focus 
on the development of mineral resources, and work on the middle 
and lower reaches of the river will concentrate on hydroelectric 
power stations. 
  The largest nonferrous metal industrial production base in 
southwest China is scheduled to be located on the upper reaches 
of the river, where lead, zinc, antimony, copper, asbestos, salt 
and marble abound. 
  Eight hydroelectric power stations and two reservoirs will 
be 
built at different altitudes along the river. 
  Upon completion, these power stations will have a total 
installed capacity of 13.7 million kw and generate 70.9 billion 
kwh a year, making the valley the largest energy production base 
in southwest China. 
  In addition, on the lower reaches of the river tourism 
resources will be developed, together with production bases for 
tropical cash crops and research bases for rare plants and 
animals. 
  The Lancang River rises in the Tanggula Range, Qinghai 
Province, and flows through the Tibet Autonomous Region and 
Yunnan to Laos, Myanmar [Burma], Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, 
and thence to the sea. After it flows out of China, the river 
is called the Mekong River. 
  The basin of the 1,240-km-long section of the river in 
Yunnan 
covers 91,000 sq km, including eight prefectures in the 
southwest China province. 
  Experts here agree that the hydropower potential amounts to 
26 million kw, including 20.73 million kw available for 
immediate development. 
  As early as in 1988 the Chinese Government listed the 
Lancang 
River and its valley as one of the state's 19 major zones for 
development. 
  Through seven years of effort, the first hydroelectric power 
station -- the Manwan Station, with a combined installed 
capacity of 1.5 million kw able to generate 7.9 billion kwh a 
year -- has been erected on the river. 
  Construction of the second one -- the Dachaoshan Power 
Station with an installed capacity of 1.26 million kw able to 
generate 7.5 billion kwh annually -- is in full swing. It is 
expected to go into operation by the end of this century. 
  Preparations for building the Xiaowan Power Station, with an 
installed capacity of 4.2 million kw able to generate 17.8 
billion kwh annually, is well under way. 
  Located 265 km from Kunming, capital of the province, 
construction of the station will start in 1996 and it will go 
into operation in 2007. 
  The project is being built jointly by Yunnan and Guangdong 
Provinces and two state departments. 
  According to the governor, Yunnan will seek multi-sided 
co-operation in constructing the remaining five power stations. 
  Since 1990 China has co-operated with Laos, Myanmar and 
Thailand in surveying and developing the upper reaches of the 
Mekong River.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 23 (XINHUA) -- The inland areas of 
China are extremely valuable for investment due to their large 
territory, rich resources, big population and huge market 
potential, a Hong Kong business V.I.P. told XINHUA recently. 
  Tsui Tsin-tong, chairman of the New China Hong Kong Group 
Ltd., made the remark at a contract-signing ceremony on the 
building of a four-lane 90-km express highway linking Chengdu, 
capital of south-west China's Sichuan Province, with Mianyang 
city. 
  Tsui is also a member of the Standing Committee of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and an adviser on Hong Kong affairs to 
the State Council, China's highest governing body. 
  The Hong Kong company will pay for 60 percent of the nearly 
1.4 billion yuan (about 160.9 million U.S. dollars) total cost 
of the freeway project, which is the largest cooperative project 
between Sichuan and overseas investors. 
  Tsui was of the view that at present most overseas 
businessmen tend to put their money into China's coastal areas, 
and into the real estate sector in particular, and that such an 
investment pattern is improper anyway. It will only result in 
greater discrepancies between rich and poor areas. 
  He believed that responsible and farsighted industrialists 
had better invest in China's broad inland areas to improve local 
infrastructure facilities by building more highways, ports and 
similar facilities, and they would certainly get profitable 
returns. 
  Taking Sichuan as an example, Tsui said that the province 
has 
a population of more than 100 million, and its annual retail 
sales total is only next to Guangdong, one of the economically 
booming provinces in China. In addition, Sichuan has abundant 
mineral resources and various other products, together with an 
industrial, scientific and technological might. An upgraded 
infrastructure would certainly lead to the province's fast 
economic growth. 
  Previously, Mr. Tsui has established an automobile company 
and an investment and development company in Sichuan Province, 
both of which are running well. 
  He said that while investing more in the inland areas of 
China, he will also motivate more other overseas funds to these 
areas. 
  Together with Tsui, an inspection group of some 70 people, 
including 15 representatives of large Hong Kong banking firms, 
showed great interest in investing here.

declared bankrupt by a court recently. This is the first time 
since the implementation of the bankrupcy law for a Sichuan 
court to hand down a bankruptcy order involving such a large sum 
of debts. 
  The dyeing factory went into operation in Neijiang city in 
1987 and it suffered losses because of poor management, 
unsuitable equipment, low grade of products, high costs and a 
continuously weak market for textiles. Not a single improvement 
was seen even though the factory received various kinds of help 
and it was forced to stop production in December, 1992. The 
1,040-strong staff received a minimum monthly wage to meet their 
living expense. The factory saw accumulated losses of RMB 
47,829 million while its fixed assets was put at RMB 56.987 
million with gross liabilities of RMB 104.81 million. The 
factory applied to the court on January 25 this year for 
bankruptcy. 
  The court ruled that the factory was unable to service the 
due debt and a bank loan for the factory was stopped. A 
deferred settlement was considered more damaging to the state 
while the factory met the requirements set out in the bankruptcy 
law. The court finally handed down a bankruptcy order to the 
factory and a clearance team was set up to deal with the debt 
servicing matter. 
  The local labour and employment departments have worked out 
certain measures to settle the situation regarding the workers 
of the defunct factory. They will be entitled to employment in 
the factory after re-organization, to seek jobs in other 
business entities or undertake other kinds of career by 
tendering their resignation from the factory.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- China's water shortage 
has worsened as a result of booming economic and social 
development and pollution, Chinese Minister of Water Resources 
Niu Maosheng said here today. 
  Speaking at a rally today marking the Second Annual World 
Day 
for Water, the minister said that China's per capita share of 
water reserves has been decreasing. 
  In China it amounts to 2,400 cubic meters per head, only 
about one fourth of the world's average and ranking 88th in the 
world, said the minister. 
  He attributed the booming economic and social development, 
population growth and pollution to the decrease. 
  According to the minister, China took the lead in the world 
by mapping out "China's Agenda 21", a national strategy for 
sustainable social and economic development, which gives 
priority to protection and efficient use of water. 
  The strategy was drafted in response to the call made by the 
United Nations Environment and Development Conference held in 
Brazil, which stressed protection of natural resources and 
sustainable development. 
  China has been investing heavily, and will continue to do 
so, 
in water conservancy projects, he added. 
  Work on preparatory projects for the huge Three Gorges Water 
Conservancy Dam on the Chang Jiang River is in full swing. The 
scheme will create the world's most powerful hydro-electric 
plant and a huge reservoir. 
  Work on other large water conservancy projects, such as 
Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai, which it is estimated will cost 
billions of U.S. dollars, has begun or is soon to start. 
  Another costly diversion project has been listed on the 
agenda of the Chinese Government. It is designed to divert 
water from the Chang Jiang River northward to Beijing, Tianjin, 
Hebei Province and Henan Province, which are suffering from 
water shortages. 
  Romulo Garcia, acting resident representative of the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Beijing, said that in 
recent years UNDP had been involved in a number of initiatives 
to assist the government in its water related programs. 
  The programs include the northern China water management 
project, the rural water supply and sanitation in poor and 
remote areas project, and the assessment of China's water sector 
in Guizhou Province and master plan for the development of water 
resources in northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  The United Nations General Assembly resolved last year to 
have March 22 observed every year as the world day for water. 
  The United Nations estimates that 1.2 billion people still 
do 
not have access to safe water, he said. 
  Niu Maosheng added that over 50 countries or regions have a 
shortage of water, and water shortage has become a universal 
problem for cities all over the world.

  [Text] Chongqing, March 23 (XINHUA) -- An advertising 
company has got the go-ahead to put up six huge boardings along 
the Chang Jiang River, in the Three Gorges where a huge dam is 
to be constructed. 
  Earlier this year, the waterways administration of the Chang 
Jiang River agreed to let the use of six signal stations in the 
Three Gorges to the Chongqing-based New Century Advertisement 
Company. 
  The signal stations were built at eye-catching positions in 
the Three Gorges to alert vessels at river bends. 
  When the Chang Jiang River is dammed in 1997 as planned, the 
first of the six signal stations will be submerged beneath the 
waters. The last will be flooded in the year 2003 when the 
first generating unit of the Three Gorges Power Station goes 
into operation. 
  An official of the New Century Company said they would 
choose 
six best-sellers in China's alcoholic drinks industry as their 
clients. 
  The six signal stations will be equipped with aluminium 
dioxide display boards which will have an area of 160-180 sq m 
each, according to the company's plan. 
  The company also plans to put 99 bottles of drinks of the 
six 
enterprises into vessels carrying small signal transmitters, and 
sink them where the river runs relatively slowly. 
  The aim is for them to be salvaged after 100 years, a 
company 
official said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by special commentator: "Reform Enters </F>
Another Spring -- Commentary on the Building of a New Taxation 
System in China"] 
  [Text] The adoption of the "Decision on Several Questions 
Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economy 
Structure" at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and its implementation have enabled reform in China to 
enter another spring and the institution of a new taxation 
system is a beautiful bouquet of flowers in full bloom in the 
garden of reform. This article tends to make brief comments on 
the origin, progress, and characteristics of the new taxation 
system. 
<H5>  Long Consideration, Aiming To Break Through </H5>
  The establishment of a taxation system and operational 
mechanism in conformity with the socialist market economic 
structure in China is not the result of subjective will at all, 
but has been considered over quite a long time. Where water 
flows, a channel is formed; this is inevitable. 
  In the 30 years from the founding of New China to 1978, 
China, being influenced by a highly centralized planned economic 
structure, practiced the "unified collection and unified 
spending" financial taxation system. The system played a 
historic role in pooling financial resources and laying an 
economic foundation for socialist construction. However, it 
also has many negative effects. Therefore, after the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the reform of 
the taxation system in China began to lay stress on arousing the 
enthusiasm of both the central and local governments and on 
handling the relationship between the state and enterprises. 
The reform began with the replacement of profits with taxes 
handed over to the state and developed gradually. 
  Two steps have been taken in replacing profits with taxes 
handed over to the state. 
  The first step (experiments were carried out in 1979 and the 
step was taken in January 1983): Instead of handing over a 
portion of their profits to the state, state-owned enterprises 
paid income tax. Many forms were adopted for the distribution 
between the state and enterprises, such as levying regulatory 
taxes on after-tax profits of enterprises. This move broke the 
long-standing fixed pattern of interest distribution, but the 
situation of the coexistence of taxation and the handing-over of 
profits began to take shape. The second step (in September 
1984): The system of allowing state-owned enterprises to keep 
all the remaining profits after paying income tax enabled the 
enterprises to have greater power in carrying out operations 
independently and to assume greater responsibility for their 
profits and losses. It also created conditions for reforming 
and establishing a system for the management of the budget of 
the central and local governments. However, because things in 
the price system were not yet straightened out, its limitations 
were also very clear. 
  Later, some corresponding readjustments were made in light 
of 
the implementation of the overall financial contract system and 
a complex taxation system with multiple categories of taxes, 
multiple links, multiple tiers, and with the turnover tax and 
the income tax as the main body and other auxiliary categories 
of taxes as a supplement began to take shape. Nevertheless, 
because the new taxation system has not yet been established, 
contradictions between, and problems in, the new and the old 
taxation systems tend to become even more conspicuous. They are 
mainly expressed in: The burden of taxation is not fairly 
shared, two separate taxation systems are used for domestic and 
foreign enterprises, and the burden of taxation for domestic 
enterprises differs greatly because of difference in ownership 
and localities; the relationship of distribution between the 
central and local governments and between the state and 
enterprises is jigsaw-like and is very irregular; the methods 
for tax collection and management are backward and full of 
loopholes, resulting in great losses; and the legal system is 
not sound, and a system in which the legislation, administration 
of justice, and law enforcement related to taxation are mutually 
independent and mutually conditioned has not been formed. The 
deep development of the market economy has called for deepening 
taxation reform. We must take big steps forward and make 
essential breakthroughs in the establishment of a new taxation 
system. 
  Careful Planning, Clear Target 
  Abolishing the old and establishing the new, formulating 
regulations and rules, and constantly perfecting them are 
difficult tasks to fulfill in financial and taxation reform in 
China. 
  Regarding this, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee has clearly put forward three focal points. 
The first is the replacement of the overall financial contract 
system with the tax-sharing system. The second is the reform 
and improvement of the tax collection system. The third is the 
improvement and standardization of the double budgetary system. 
As far as the establishment of the new taxation system is 
concerned, if we say the first and the third points are for 
creating necessary prerequisites and conditions, the second 
point is the main implication and key point in the establishment 
of the new taxation system. In essence, it is also to reform 
the industrial and commercial taxation systems. As viewed from 
the past two months, the Chinese Government has firmly grasped 
these vital points and is providing, and will continue to 
provide, guarantees by means of changing the structure to 
fundamentally solve this focal problem of interest distribution. 
  The plan for the establishment of a new taxation system was 
promulgated a year ago and more than 60 supplementary policies 
have been implemented since 1 January. This shows the planning 
was well made and well publicized. Its guiding ideology, 
principles, contents, and key points can be generalized as 
"unifying taxation laws, fairly sharing the taxation burden, 
simplifying the taxation system, and rationally dividing power." 
  "Unifying taxation laws" means the legislation of sound 
taxation laws and their relevant rules and regulations, putting 
all taxation activities on the orbit standardized by taxation 
laws, paying taxes according to law, and administering taxation 
according to law, so that the role of market mechanism for 
taxation activities will be in keeping with the strengthening of 
macroregulation and control. 
  "Fairly sharing the taxation burden" means gradually 
resolving the issue of having different categories of taxes and 
different tax rates for enterprises of different kinds of 
ownership and in different localities and, through unifying the 
income tax of enterprises and improving the turnover tax, 
enabling a more or less fair taxation burden among different 
kinds of enterprises and creating conditions for competition on 
an equal basis. 
  "Simplifying the taxation system" means adopting relatively 
standardized methods of taking international practices for 
reference, abolishing tax categories which do not conform with 
the development of the market economy, combining duplicate tax 
categories, and levying new categories of taxes which are really 
necessary in a bid to optimize the taxation structure and to 
make operation simple and easy. 
  "Rationally dividing power" means putting in the hands of 
the 
central authorities tax categories which involve the macro 
policies and correspondingly centralizing the power of taxation 
for regulating production and product mix. Taxation power which 
is useful for local governments in regulating local economy and 
organizing income, the power to formulate procedures for tax 
collection and tax management, and the legislation power 
concerning the levying of a small number of local taxes, should 
be given to local governments. 
  At present, China is smoothly carrying out reform of the 
taxation system in several major aspects in accordance with the 
above train of thought. 
  The turnover tax, the main body of the new taxation system, 
is being extended universally to domestic- and foreign-invested 
enterprises. The practices of putting products under taxable 
items and separately fixing different interest rates have been 
abandoned. The new methods are: The value-added tax is 
universally levied in production and circulation and on this 
basis, and the sales tax is also levied on a selected small 
number of consumers' goods; the levying of business tax is 
maintained in providing labor service, the transfer of 
intangible assets, and the sales of fixed assets; the unified 
industrial and commercial tax for foreign-invested enterprises 
is abolished; and the product tax for agricultural, forestry, 
livestock, and aquatic products is replaced by the agricultural 
special product tax and butchering tax. 
  The goal of unifying the income tax of enterprises will be 
realized in two steps. The first step is the institution of the 
unified domestic-invested enterprise income tax system, which is 
being implemented at present. As a result, the method of 
collecting income tax according to the ownership of enterprises 
has been abolished and state-owned enterprises will no longer 
use the method of handing over income tax to the state on a 
contract basis. The second step is the combination of the 
income tax of domestic- and foreign-invested enterprises as the 
occasion demands in a bid to eventually unify the taxation 
system. 
  The basic purpose of levying and readjusting personal income 
tax is to levy tax on people with a relatively high income and 
to exempt or reduce such tax on people with intermediate-level 
income and low income so that the tax burden can be lowered to 
some extent and that some people can become rich earlier than 
others and the gap between the poor and the rich will not be too 
big. 
  The value-added land tax, which has recently been levied, is 
aimed at levying tax on the added value of transferred real 
estate. Taxpayers, irrespective of their economic nature, 
whether they are domestic-funded or foreign-funded enterprises, 
and whether they are specialized or not, have to pay tax on the 
basis of the volume of added value. The general result will 
still be relatively high after-tax profits for real estate 
operators. 
  To promote rational development and utilization of resources 
and to regulate differential incomes, necessary readjustments 
and reform of the resources have also been made. The scope of 
taxation includes all products of mineral resources and the tax 
to be collected is based on the category and quantity. Upper 
and lower limits are set, that is, the amount of tax on products 
of the same category may vary based on the conditions of the 
resources. 
  It is learned that, following the current large-scale 
reform, the number of taxable items will be reduced from 32 to 
18, the taxation structure will become more rational, and a 
highly efficient and simplified taxation system will be realized. 
<H5>  Seeking Truth From Facts, Being Fair and Reasonable </H5>
  In establishing the new taxation system, from planning to 
implementation, China has always adhered to the principle of 
proceeding from the present reality of China and seeking truth 
from facts, and therefore, what has been done is fair and 
reasonable. 
  Advancement as a whole and comprehensive supplementary moves 
have made it possible to make breakthroughs in the establishment 
of the new taxation system. The formulation and implementation 
of "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several 
Questions Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market 
Economy Structure" have undoubtedly provided favorable social 
conditions for the reform of the taxation system and have 
enabled the establishment of the new taxation system to enter a 
new historical stage of being more responsive and ready. 
Although reform of the financial and taxation system is the 
focus and most the important of four major reforms this year, 
the supplementary reforms of the banking, investment, and 
planned systems will be carried out simultaneously and they will 
all give powerful support to the financial and taxation reform. 
Even viewed from a smaller scope, reform of the taxation system 
and reform of the financial system have matched and integrated 
with each other and the target strategies, and the long- term, 
medium-term, and immediate results have all been repeatedly 
planned, expounded, and proved. The process of proceeding at a 
commanding height from the general to the local evidently shows 
a clearer goal and is more conducive to turning possibility into 
reality in the establishment of the new taxation system. 
  Being geared to the future and paying attention to giving 
consideration to various aspects have provided a bridge for 
transition in the establishment of the new taxation system. The 
goal of the reform is clear and we are quite determined to carry 
it out. However, we have to do things step by step. It is 
precisely because of this that China has paid attention to 
adopting some transitional measures in the course of 
establishing a new taxation system. For example, the enterprise 
taxation system must be unified and this direction cannot be 
changed, but we are not impatient and will not try to hit the 
target in one try. Foreign-invested enterprises and foreign 
enterprises continue to pay the original income tax and 
preferential policies have remained temporarily unchanged. The 
additional portion of tax paid after the collection of the new 
turnover tax by foreign-invested enterprises set up before 1 
January this year will be returned to them. The design of all 
important taxation items and categories involving the 
readjustment of interests has taken into consideration the 
circumstances and has given expression to firmness in achieving 
the goal of reform and to flexibility of a progressive 
transition. A careful and safe start will inevitably speed up 
the realization of the goal and the practice of establishing the 
new taxation system in China has proved, or continues to prove, 
the correctness of this conclusion. 
  The integration of the will of the government and that of 
the 
masses of people and the conversion of such will into conscious 
action by the whole society have provided a deep and solid 
foundation for the establishment of the new taxation system. 
Since the latter half of last year, especially since the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Chinese 
Government has paid great attention to regarding the direct 
participation of the grass-roots level and the broad masses of 
the people as indispensable conditions for the establishment of 
the new taxation system. Therefore, it has issued "red-banner 
documents" to define policies and measures and has convened 
meetings for senior officials of departments in charge of 
relevant work to give explanations, to help overcome 
difficulties, or to run study sessions to pass on the essentials 
on operation. The radio, television, newspapers, magazines, and 
other mass media and tools for public opinion have all tried 
their best to publicize and promote reform of the taxation 
system. According to informed sources, in the course of the 
establishment of the new taxation system, efforts made by the 
government in organizing, leading, and publicizing the degree of 
concern and support of the masses of the people, and the 
stability of society have become the solid and firm social 
foundations for achieving comprehensive success in the new 
taxation system. 
  Because of all these, we have full grounds to hope for a 
stronger fragrance from this wonderful blooming flower of the 
new taxation system in China and to invite all people of the 
industrial and commercial circles who want to display their 
skills in China to enjoy the fragrance to the full.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Qingxian (3769 3237 2009) from the "Talks </F>
on Building a Modern Enterprise System" column: "Building a New 
System Requires New Knowledge"] 
  [Text] The government and enterprises are currently facing 
the important task of studying the basic knowledge about the 
modern enterprise system. Establishing the modern enterprise 
system is a new question for study, and most people are still 
unfamiliar with this concept. Establishing the modern 
enterprise system is also the most important "campaign" now that 
economic structural reform in our country has entered the stage 
of "storming the fortifications" [gong jian 2396 1017], so we 
must work very hard to acquire and understand the knowledge in 
this regard. Carrying out reform in this area is a pressing 
task for us. 
  If we say that our previous enterprise reform measures were 
primarily aimed at "destroying the old," then the establishment 
of the new enterprise system will mainly be aimed at 
"establishing the new." The modern enterprise system is not one 
or two specific systems in some areas, but a comprehensive 
institutional system which is related to all aspects of the 
external environment and the internal mechanisms of the 
enterprises. The system should clearly determine the character, 
position, role, and behavior mode of the enterprises. It should 
standardize the basic relationships between the enterprise and 
the investor, between the enterprise and the creditor, between 
the enterprise and the government, between the enterprise and 
the market, between the enterprise and society, between one 
enterprise and another, between the enterprise and the 
consumers, and between the enterprise and its workers. 
Moreover, the modern enterprise system is the result of summing 
up the enterprise reform experience in our country, It is the 
product of the development of socialized mass production and the 
market economy and is based on the integration of the creative 
practice from our country's enterprise reform with international 
and common practices. It is certain that our existing knowledge 
cannot enable us to thoroughly understand all its contents. For 
example, we may now hear quite a few specious comments on the 
modern enterprise system. Some people have said that the modern 
enterprise system was a modernized enterprise system, and the 
first requirement in a modernized enterprise system was to 
realize enterprise modernization. Other people have said that 
the modern enterprise system referred to the conduct of modern 
enterprise management. These were interpretations without real 
understanding and were just based on people's existing 
knowledge. In fact, being a model of the enterprise structure, 
the modern enterprise system is the reflection of the 
relationship of production, and it does not represent the 
modernization level of the equipment in the enterprises and does 
not refer to the modernization of enterprise management. If 
popular understanding remains at such a level, how can they 
establish the modern enterprise system, which is scientific and 
standardized? 
  At present, the relevant central departments and the local 
governments are actively selecting the points for carrying out 
the pilot schemes for the establishment of the modern enterprise 
system. Various provinces are applying for a larger number of 
assignments of such pilot schemes from the central departments 
concerned. Enterprises are also vying with one another to apply 
for carrying out such pilot schemes from the provincial and 
municipal authorities. Such enthusiastic reactions show that an 
extensive consensus of opinion on the establishment of the 
modern enterprise system has been reached, and this is supported 
by localities and enterprises. In such circumstances, we should 
grasp the opportunity and properly adopt various forms to 
organize the local governments and the enterprises to study the 
basic knowledge about the modern enterprise system so that 
people may fully and more deeply understand the modern 
enterprise system. 
  The government departments must make this study 
indispensable 
and must not just carry it out in a formalistic way. Such study 
is necessary for the enterprises; it is not an extra burden 
which disrupts routine operations. Our minds must be armed with 
the new knowledge acquired from the study; otherwise, we may 
lose our bearings and could even go astray in practice. While 
studying knowledge about the modern enterprise system, the 
government departments should more scientifically select the 
points for carrying out the pilot schemes according to objective 
standards so that reform in this regard may be carried out from 
the very beginning in a rigorous and regular way, as opposed to 
a haphazard way based on some people's wishful thinking. 
Through studying the knowledge about the modern enterprise 
system, the enterprises will understand why they can or cannot 
be assigned to carry out the pilot scheme and will thus reduce 
their unnecessary grievances about whether an arrangement is 
fair or unfair. Thus, enterprises that are not selected for the 
pilot schemes will also actively create conditions in order to 
carry out a pilot scheme as soon as possible and to march toward 
the modern enterprise system.

  [Text] The National Work Conference on the Administration 
of Port Cities opened in Nanchang this morning. Attending the 
meeting were Wang Yiping, secretary general of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission; Su Shengyou, member of the 
Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee Standing Committee and 
concurrently vice governor; Ye Jian, of the State Office for the 
Administration of Port Cities; Wang Guoben, vice chairman of the 
Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress; Wu Yongle, vice chairman 
of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference; and Zhong Qing, deputy 
commander of the Jiangxi Military District. 
  State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing sent a letter to the 
conference, expressing his hope that based on existing port 
administration work, all checking and testing units stationed at 
ports will further strengthen coordination, work in close 
cooperation, and make concert efforts to guarantee the soundness 
of their work for the state. 
  Wang Yiping, and Su Shengyou made speeches one after 
another. 
The meeting reviewed the accomplishments China has made in port 
administration in the 15 years since reform and opening up, and 
especially in 1993. The meeting indicated that in the new year, 
it is necessary to further emancipate our minds in port 
administration work; magnify the strength of reform so as to 
bring port administration closer to customary international 
practice; guarantee ports' security, flow, high efficiency, and 
civilization; and give full play to ports' comprehensive 
functions in order to meet the needs of developing the socialist 
market economy. 
  The conference required people's governments at all levels 
to 
strengthen leadership in planning for opening up ports and to 
quicken pace in restructuring port administration. It is 
necessary to unfold sustained, in-depth activities to build 
civilized ports. 
  Participating in the conference were deputies from the port 
administration offices and port joint-examination units of 28 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.

<F P=106> ["Circular of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and </F>
Trade (MOFERT) on Strictly Observing Provisions on Shipping 
Marks for Imports -- Promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, MOFTEC, on 5 October 1993"] 
  [Text] In recent years, after securing approval, various 
ministries, commissions, provinces, and municipalities have 
established many companies for directly operating import 
businesses. These companies have begun to place orders for goods 
from the outside world and to sign contracts with foreign firms. 
Some companies, however, do not understand the provisions 
formulated by this Ministry on shipping marks for imports and on 
the numbers for import contracts, and they have not submitted 
the required applications to the relevant department of this 
Ministry for shipping-mark codes. This situation has brought 
about many difficulties in the work of customs, commercial 
inspection, and transportation departments, and also has 
seriously hindered the prompt transportation of goods, to the 
extent that some cargoes have been piled up at ports and in 
warehouses for a long time. As their owners cannot be found, 
the cargoes cannot be dispatched, and work has been made very 
difficult. 
  In light of this situation and in order to prevent the 
incorrect shipping marks on imported cargoes from affecting 
forwarding work, this Ministry reiterates that both the shipping 
marks on imports and their contract numbers must be printed 
strictly according to our provisions, and that various import 
companies and cargo-receiving departments must submit 
applications to this Ministry for codes allowing them to run 
import businesses and place orders, as well as codes for the 
persons to receive imported cargoes. 
  Various local governments are requested to inspect the 
import 
companies under their jurisdiction, and if they discover 
companies that have not applied to this Ministry for 
shipping-mark codes, please urge them to do so. 
  Please see the annex to this circular for the provisions on 
printing shipping marks and contract numbers on imported cargoes. 
  Annex: Provisions for printing contract numbers and shipping 
marks on imported cargoes. 
  [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 
  16 September 1985 
<H3>  Annex 
Method for Arranging Numbers of Import Contracts and Shipping 
Marks 
When signing contracts with foreign firms, companies that 
operate import businesses should arrange contract numbers and </H3>

shipping marks according to these provisions: 
  I. Component parts of the number of an import contract and 
its shipping mark. 
  According to prevailing international practice; considering 
our country's actual experience over the years in handling 
imports and placing orders for goods; and based on the principle 
of making things simple, easy, and convenient to check and find; 
the following six parts are adopted -- depicted in English 
characters and Arabic numerals -- to form contract numbers and 
shipping marks. 
  1. Number for the year in which an order for goods is 
placed: Contracts signed in 1985 will be represented by "85," 
and other years will follow the same rule. 
  2. Code for a company running import business and 
placing orders for goods: The import business companies having 
permission to directly place orders for goods from the outside 
world and to sign contracts with foreign firms will be given 
codes exclusively by this Ministry for running import business 
and placing goods orders. These codes generally will consist of 
three English characters. 
  3. Code for a unit placing orders for goods (that is, 
the consignee who receives imported cargoes): The Ministry will 
arrange and issue codes to the consignees of imported cargoes 
within the units that place orders for goods. These codes 
generally consist of three English characters. 
  4. Numerals representing commodity categories: Two or 
three Arabic numerals will be used to represent the categories 
of imported commodities. For details, see the List of Numerals 
Representing Categories of Commodities. 
  5. Codes for cargo-supplying countries: Two English 
characters are used to represent each of the countries and 
regions that have already established diplomatic relations and 
have trade interactions with our country. See the list of codes 
for cargo-supplying countries and regions formulated by this 
Ministry on 25 August 1989 [date as published]. 
  6. Serial number of contract: This will be decided by 
the companies that sign contracts on imports and place orders 
for goods, so as to distinguish different contracts. 
  II. Structure in which the codes of an import contract and 
shipping mark are organized. 
  1. For any contract signed with any country or region, 
the codes should be arranged horizontally, and the positions are 
as follows: 
  The first position is the code for the year in which the 
order for goods is placed. 
  The second position is for the code of the company running 
the import business and placing the order for goods. 
  The third position is for the code of the cargoes' 
consignee. 
  The fourth position is for a punctuation code; various 
specialized foreign trade corporations and their branches use a 
"-" [hyphen] code, other companies use a "/" [slash] code. 
  The fifth position is for the commodity category code. 
  The sixth position is for the code for the contract serial 
number. 
  The seventh position is for the code of the cargo-supply 
country. 
  2. Structure for organization of the shipping mark. 
  The shipping mark is organized into two lines, with the 
upper 
line representing the serial number of the import contract, and 
the lower line representing the English name of the port of 
destination of the cargoes as specified by the contract. 
  For example, in 1985 (code is 85), a certain industrial and 
trading company (suppose the code name for it to run import 
business and place orders for goods is AA), is entrusted by a 
certain order- placing department (suppose the code for the 
consignee of the imported cargo is BB), to sign a contract which 
is numbered 003 (the serial number of the contract is 003), with 
Britain (code name is CE) to order some marine equipment (code 
is 382), which will be shipped to the port of Shanghai in China 
(English name is Shanghai China) [preceding two words printed in 
English]. In this case, the code of the contract should be: 
85AABB/382003CE. The shipping mark should be: 85AABB/382003CE. 
SHANGHAI CHINA [preceding two words printed in English]. 
  III. Points for Attention 
  1. To import cargo from any country or region -- 
regardless of whether the cargo is carried to a port of our 
country by sea, land, or air transport; mail; or a combination 
of various forms of transport -- when an order for goods is 
placed with the outside world, it is necessary to strictly 
observe the provisions on the arrangement of the contract code 
and shipping mark. 
  2. When conducting import business negotiations with 
visiting foreign trade delegations and businessmen in various 
trading companies, at the Guangzhou Trade Fair, or on any other 
occasion, and when the commercial organizations, trade 
delegations, or purchasing teams sent abroad by our country 
negotiate import business with foreign businessmen and sign 
agreements and contracts with them, the contract codes and 
shipping marks must be made clear, according to the provisions. 
  3. When various import companies negotiate business 
with foreign businessmen, they should make the following issues 
clear to the other party, the consignor: 
  1) When copying loading lists, rail and air waybills, 
bills of lading, and various kinds of commercial bills, 
completely correct and corresponding shipping marks and contract 
numbers must be written down. 
  2) Regarding the packaging of goods, on two sides of 
every packing case, nonfading pigment must be used to paint a 
complete shipping mark, which must be clear, noticeable, and not 
blurred.

<F P=106> ["Circular of Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic </F>
Cooperation (MOFTEC) and the Finance Ministry on Issues Related 
to Further Strengthening Management Over the International 
Economic Cooperation Fund -- promulgated by MOFTEC on 5 October 
1993"] 
  [Text] To further strengthen management of the 
International Economic Cooperation Fund [IECF] and expedite its 
circulation, an announcement resulting from due deliberations on 
some relevant issues is hereby issued, as follows: 
  1. All borrowings from the IECF must be used for the 
purposes specified. Those that have been transferred to other 
projects or appropriated for other purposes without the prior 
consent of MOFTEC are to be recovered forthwith. 
  2. To expedite its circulation and enhance the 
efficiency of its utilization, from now on the IECF is to focus 
supporting cost- effective foreign projects undertaken by those 
companies that implement foreign transaction policies and obey 
coordination. Under normal circumstances, it will not extend 
loans to investments made by solely foreign-funded or 
joint-venture overseas enterprises. The IECF will channel its 
credit primarily to the circulation of short- term funds during 
the peak period of project funding. 
  3. To support the development of such undertakings as 
contracted foreign projects and cooperation in labor services, 
the annual interest rate for borrowings from the IECF will 
remain as they are, i.e., the annual interest rate for Renminbi 
loans is 4 percent and that for U.S. dollar loans is 5 percent. 
Should a need arise, from special circumstances, for a renewal 
of the loan, the debtor is to file an application one month in 
advance, after which the renewal may be approved by MOFTEC. In 
this case, however, the annual interest rate for Renminbi loans 
is to conform to the interest rate on revolving-fund credit for 
enterprises undertaking foreign contracts set by the General 
Office of the People's Construction Bank of China, while the 
annual interest rate for U.S. dollar loans is to conform to the 
interest rate on revolving-fund credit set by the General Office 
of the Bank of China. Should the renewal need to be repeated, 
at the discretion of the authorities, the management fee is to 
be calculated by the bank credit interest rate, plus 10 percent. 
The renewal may not be repeated more than once. Failure to 
repay the loan on maturity or extending the length of maturity 
without securing prior consent is subject to a penalty of 20 
percent, in addition to the bank credit interest rate. 
  4. A file is to be established for each debtor, into 
which its borrowings from, and repayments to, the IECF are to be 
entered. In future credit management, priority is to be given 
to debtors that have repaid their loans on time and are in good 
standing. Debtors that have failed to repay their loans on time 
and are not in good standing will not be entitled to further 
credit. 
  5. In June and December of each year, each debtor is 
to tabulate the progress in utilization of the IECF borrowings, 
in conformity with the attached sample format, and furnish 
detailed written data describing the returns, experience, and 
issues in relation to the IECF borrowings. Both of these are to 
be submitted to MOFTEC (the Financial Accounting Department and 
the Department of Foreign Economic Cooperation), with a copy 
forwarded to the Finance Ministry (the Finance Department of 
Foreign Currency and Affairs).

the Provisional Procedures for Management of the International 
Economic Cooperation Fund -- Released by the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on 5 October 1993"] 
  [Text] In order to intensify the management of the 
International Economic Cooperation Fund [IECF] and to make still 
better use of it, the following supplement is hereby made to the 
"Provisional Procedures for Management of the International 
Economic Cooperation Fund" jointly promulgated by MOFERT and the 
Ministry of Finance on 24 October 1984. 
  1. Every company applying for a loan from the IECF 
must submit, together with the loan application document, a copy 
of the report on the feasibility study on the project concerned, 
a copy of the economic returns analysis report, and a report on 
the company's capital flow. 
  2. To keep the authorities informed of the spending of 
the loan extended by the IECF, every borrower is to forward in a 
timely manner a report on the spending of the loan extended by 
the IECF and a relevant financial statement to both MOFERT and 
the Ministry of Finance. 
  3. In compliance with the current interest rate for 
bank loans, the annual interest rate for loans extended by the 
IECF is to be readjusted as of 1 April 1989 to 4 percent per 
annum for loans in Renminbi and 5 percent per annum for loans in 
U.S. dollars. Loans granted before 1 April 1989 also will have 
their interest rates readjusted to the above annual rates 
effective 1 July 1989. 
  4. In the case of any debtor failing to repay the loan 
as scheduled for any special reason, it is to apply to MOFERT 
for late repayment one month before the loan is due. MOFERT can 
approve the application for late repayment, provided the 
application is found, on examination, to be justified. However, 
in this case, the interest is to instead be charged on the loan 
according to the annual rates fixed by the Bank of China and the 
Construction Bank of China. Should the reasons given to support 
the late repayment application be found unjustified, no late 
repayment will be allowed, and the interest rate for the loan 
will be readjusted to the annual interest rates fixed by the 
Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China effective on 
the due date of the loan. In addition, an extra 20 percent 
financial service fee will be charged to the debtor.

following the deepening of reform and opening up. However, 
because some departments and units have treated in an improper 
manner enterprises' right to use export commodity trademarks, 
many disputes have occurred concerning trademark use, causing a 
certain amount of confusion in the domestic and international 
markets, damage to the reputations of the relevant trademarks, 
and a negative impact on the relevant enterprises' operations 
and development. To prevent the recurrence of this situation 
in the course of structural change and to make it easier for the 
relevant departments and units to handle the trademark problem 
properly, the following circular is issued: 
  1. Registered trademark proprietors can dispose of the 
use of their trademarks within the framework of the Trademark 
Law and the relevant regulations; no department or unit is 
allowed to interfere. 
  2. If an enterprise establishes another type of 
foreign trade enterprise and wishes to use the registered 
trademarks of others for foreign-related business operations, it 
must obtain approval from the registered trademark proprietors, 
and in accordance with the law, sign contracts approving the use 
of such trademarks. The unapproved use of the registered 
trademarks of others is prohibited. 
  3. Both signatories are responsible for the quality of 
the commodities bearing the approved trademarks. The approved 
enterprise is subject to the coordination, supervision, and 
management by the relevant department and by the approving 
enterprise with respect to sales market, customer, and price. 
  The approved enterprise must have its name shown on the 
packing of the commodities bearing the registered trademarks of 
others. 
  4. In changing its structure or establishing other 
economic organizations, should an enterprise wish to transfer a 
domestically or foreign-registered trademark, it should abide by 
the principle of compensatory transfer (with the exception of 
those having an agreement). 
  5. Enterprise groups or other types of economic 
combination organizations the members of which are independent 
legal persons are not allowed to force these members to transfer 
their registered trademarks, nor is the higher administrative 
department allowed to force them to transfer their registered 
trademarks. 
  6. In principle, an enterprise using its registered 
trademark as investment capital cannot change its status as the 
main trademark proprietor. 
  All levels of administrative departments are required to 
implement these provisions and to mediate in enterprises' 
trademark disputes according to the law in the course of foreign 
trade structural change. Serious violations of the Trademark 
Law and regulations, or infringements of the trademark 
proprietorship of others, must be stopped resolutely. If the 
higher administrative department violates the Trademark Law and 
regulations, or if it interferes in the normal use and 
management of registered trademarks, enterprises have the right 
to ask people's courts for legal protection.

Relations and Trade (MOFERT) on Strengthening Management Over 
Trademarks in the Purchase of Export Commmodities -- released by 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), 
5 October 1993"] 
  [Text] When purchasing goods from production enterprises, 
the negligence of some foreign trade companies in investigating 
the validity of the use of trademarks has resulted in trademark 
violations. In order to strengthen management in this field, 
the following points are defined: 
  First, when foreign trade companies purchase goods from 
production enterprises for export (or for sale on commission), 
they should strictly examine whether the trademark is registered 
and belongs to that enterprise. Goods produced by enterprises 
that misuse the trademarks of others must not be purchased for 
export (or sold on commission). 
  Second, foreign trade companies may not purchase (or sell on 
commission) export goods from production enterprises that use 
trademarks licensed to a registered enterprise that has not 
stipulated clearly in its contract that the production 
enterprise has the right to sell or has only the right to sell 
on the domestic market. 
  Third, without the approval of the foreign trade company 
that 
holds the trademark, export enterprises may not purchase (or 
sell on commission) export goods from enterprises with a 
domestically registered trademark that, for historical reasons, 
is possessed by a foreign trade company -- in addition to the 
production enterprise -- and is registered abroad by the foreign 
trade company. 
  Fourth, foreign trade enterprises may not misuse the 
trademarks of others to export their goods. 
  Fifth, when a trademark-holding foreign trade company 
endorses the use of its registered trademark by production 
enterprises, it should strictly stipulate in the contract the 
terms governing the sale of products abroad, and should 
strengthen management and supervision. 
  When purchasing goods for export (or sale on commission), if 
a foreign trade company infringes upon the rights of another 
party owing to its negligence of trademark ownership or to 
improper management by the trademark holder, the party concerned 
is to undertake administrative and legal responsibility in light 
of the seriousness of the case.

and Trade (MOFERT) on Formalities for the Export of Equipment 
and Materials Related to Contract Projects Abroad -- Released by 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on 5 
October 1993"] 
  [Text] In the wake of the development of contracted 
project business and cooperation in terms of labor services run 
by Chinese companies abroad, many projects run by Chinese 
contractors, especially those with Chinese companies as 
principal contractors, may involve procurement of equipment, raw 
materials and supplies, component parts, as well as machinery 
and tools from China proper. Hence the contracted project 
business will give an impetus to the export of China-produced 
equipment and materials. This will not only help increase the 
country's foreign exchange earnings, but also will reduce 
project construction costs substantially. In order to ensure 
the smooth development of this type of business, some concrete 
operational procedures and methods have been formulated, based 
on practical experience gained over recent years, and a notice 
is hereby served as follows: 
  1. Any company running an international economic and 
technological cooperation project, as a contractor or 
sub-contractor abroad, which needs to procure necessary 
equipment, materials and supplies, as well as machinery and 
tools from the home country, can lodge an application directly 
to and go through export procedures as required with this 
ministry. If the equipment and goods to be exported are subject 
to export license control, the company is to apply to this 
ministry for an export license, by presenting the project 
contract it has signed with the foreign party. 
  2. The company applying for the export of 
China-produced equipment and goods is to submit a photocopy of 
the contract concerned, as well as the application form, in 
duplicate, for the export of equipment and good with relation to 
a contracted project (see Appendix 1), and two copies of the 
detailed list of project- related equipment and goods that are 
to be exported (see Appendix 2). Both the application form and 
the detailed list must be printed on A4-sized paper, as 
prescribed by the appendices. 
  3. The equipment and goods for the export of which an 
international operation company has applied are to be used only 
by the company itself to meet practical needs in the contracted 
works, as declared, and they are never to be used for any other 
purpose, nor are they to be resold. In order to prevent 
overstocks, the equipment and goods needed to run a contracted 
project can be exported in batches and stages so as to keep pace 
with the progress of the project.

Relations and Trade (MOFERT) on Sternly Attacking the Practice 
of Using Counterfeit Export Commodity Trademarks -- Promulgated 
by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
(MOFTEC) on 5 October 1993"] 
  [Text] With a view to implement the spirit of the State 
Council's "Circular on Sternly Checking the Criminal Activities 
of Manufacturing and Selling Fake Commodities," and to prevent 
export enterprises from manufacturing and selling commodities 
using trademarks already registered by others, this circular is 
hereby formulated on the following relevant issues: 
  1. All economic and trade commissions and departments, 
foreign trade bureaus, and relevant units should abide by the 
requirements of this ministry on halting the infringement of 
trademark rights; act in light of local conditions in their own 
localities and units; organize relevant export enterprises, and 
especially the leaders of these enterprises, to study 
conscientiously the circulars of the State Council and the 
Supreme People's Court on dealing relentless blows to the 
production and sale of fake commodities; and enhance their legal 
awareness of trademarks. 
  2. All economic and trade commissions and departments, 
foreign trade bureaus, chambers of commerce, and head offices 
should take responsibility and organize export enterprises in 
their own localities or under their industries and trades to 
conduct overall inspections of the possible manufacture and sale 
of commodities using already-registered trademarks (including 
accepting trademarks designated by foreign clients). Immediate 
action must be taken to redress errors as soon as they are 
uncovered. 
  3. No foreign trade enterprise is allowed to make use 
of sales promotion activities -- such as trade fairs, 
advertisements, and propaganda activities of any kind -- to 
provide conveniences to factories engaged in the production of 
counterfeit goods, including purchasing, exhibiting, 
publicizing, and acting as agents for export commodities bearing 
trademarks registered by others. 
  4. All localities should regard the use of trademarks 
as part of their appraisal of the accomplishments of foreign 
trade enterprises and their leaders. Enterprises that have 
seriously violated trademark rules and regulations in their 
daily operations will be deprived of their right to participate 
in the annual appraisal and selection of outstanding enterprises. 
  5. All economic and trade commissions and departments, 
foreign trade bureaus, chambers of import and export trade, and 
head offices should report to this ministry promptly any case in 
which an export enterprise is punished by judicial or industrial 
and commercial departments for manufacturing and selling 
commodities using the registered trademarks of others, as well 
as for other law-breaking activities concerning trademarks. 
  6. Once export enterprises holding export permits are 
certified guilty of producing and selling quota-administered 
commodities using trademarks registered by others, MOFERT will 
notify the relevant permit-issuing departments to suspend the 
issuance of export and quota permits to such enterprises. 
According to the seriousness of each case, this ministry will 
suspend or annul the enterprise's autonomy in the export of 
relevant commodities, or even terminate its right to handle 
imports and exports. 
  It is a long-term task to eliminate counterfeit commodities 
and halt trademark infringement. All economic and trade 
administrative departments, as well as all relevant units, 
should adopt feasible measures, work in close coordination with 
the departments in charge, reinforce efforts to supervise and 
guide export enterprises, and halt counterfeiting and 
law-breaking activities in foreign trade according to the law. 
This ministry will investigate and affix the responsibility on 
leaders of competent administrative departments for failure to 
take effective measures, for serious dereliction of duty, for 
repeated infringements of rights, and for other serious problems.

`Sharing' the Trademarks of Others" -- Promulgated by the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on 5 
October 1993] 
  [Text] The following circular is specifically for the 
purpose of promoting the smooth development of foreign trade, 
removing the harms of "sharing trademarks," and implementing 
strictly the provisions of the Trademark Act regarding the 
protection of the special rights of trademark registerers. 
  First, whatever its type, no foreign trade or industrial and 
trade enterprise can use a registerer's trademark without his 
permission, with such excuses as having "shared" the use of the 
trademark or having been its goods-supply unit. 
  Second, a trademark registerer must adopt effective measures 
to protect his trademark properly. If he finds his trademark 
rights are being violated, he can -- upon obtaining necessary 
proof -- file a suit with the Administration for Industry and 
Commerce and a law court or with an administrative organ for 
economic relations and foreign trade. 
  Third, all levels of administrative organs for economic 
relations and foreign trade must act strictly in accordance with 
the provisions of the Trademark Act and should render necessary 
support for the complaints lodged by a unit the trademark rights 
of which are violated. They must deal with trademark violators 
sternly, whether they are units that supply trademarked goods, 
or not. Enterprises that abuse the trademarks of others to a 
serious extent or that do not change this practice after 
repeated warnings must be punished. Persons with the main 
responsibility should be given necessary administrative 
punishments.

<F P=106> ["Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Circular </F>
on Carefully Examining Commodity Trademarks When Registering 
Export Enterprises" --promulgated by Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation on 5 October 1993] 
  [Text] In recent years, when some local departments in 
charge of trade and the economy examined and approved 
applications by large and medium enterprises to operate import 
and export businesses, and when they examined and approved 
applications by foreign trade companies and foreign-funded 
enterprises to become established, they neglected the 
examination and investigation of the problem of trademarks used 
by enterprises for importing and exporting commodities. As a 
result, after the enterprises had established themselves, they 
randomly used other people's trademarks and infringed upon the 
rights of the people who had registered the trademarks, to the 
extent that many disputes on use of trademarks have emerged and 
many enterprises fight to sell a commodity with the same 
trademark in the same market, causing chaos, a decrease in 
price, and damage to the reputation of the trademark. 
  In light of the abovementioned situation, various economic 
and trade departments and commissions, as well as foreign trade 
bureaus, are hereby requested to seriously look into the problem 
of the use of trademarks for export goods by enterprises, when 
they declare import and export operation rights for production 
enterprises and approve the establishment of various kinds of 
foreign trade companies and foreign-funded enterprises. 
Regarding: Those production enterprises which have relied on 
the registered trademarks of other people for a long time but 
have been unable to obtain permission from the patent holders of 
the registered trademarks; the trademarks of commodities 
operated by enterprises and causing registration disputes 
between manufacturers and traders inside the country; those 
enterprises which have names the same as the registered 
trademarks of other people and their exports are the same or 
similar to the commodities with trademarks registered by other 
people; and regarding other activities which jeopardize the 
reputation of the registered trademarks of other people, which 
violate the law on trademarks, and which might cause disputes on 
use of trademarks, no declaration, examination, and approval is 
to be carried out. 
  Regarding the disputes on the use of trademarks which have 
already emerged, the departments which gave the original 
declaration and approval should mediate a solution according to 
law. As for the cases which cannot be effectively settled by 
administrative mediation, which cannot be solved for a long 
time, which affect normal operation of enterprises, and which 
disrupt export order, the persons who possess the registered 
trademarks can report to the law enforcement organs for 
arbitration according to law.

Trade on Direct Handling of Procedures for Money Borrowed From

1993)] 
  [Text] The "Provisional Management Method For the 
International Economic Cooperative Fund" promulgated by the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT] and 
the Ministry of Finance on 24 October 1984 stipulates: "MOFERT 
is responsible for the management of the `fund' whereas detailed 
business dealings will be entrusted to the Bank of China and the 
Construction Bank in accordance with the division of foreign 
exchange and renminbi." In the last few years the two banks 
have done a great deal in handling this professional work, 
playing a positive role in promoting China's foreign-related 
labor services. However, viewing the implementation of the 
provisional method, the management of the "fund" seems to have 
been out of line with the detailed handling of loan business, 
making it difficult for MOFERT to know about the use and 
recovery of the funds on loan or the collection of management 
fees for it. To further strengthen the management of the 
cooperative fund, MOFERT has now decided, with the approval of 
the Ministry of Finance, to take direct charge of the "fund's" 
loan business as of 1 January 1991, whereas the "fund's" foreign 
exchange and renminbi deposits will continue to remain in the 
two banks. The funds which are released on loan before the end 
of 1990 will still be handled by the two banks until their 
recovery. [Signed] The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
and Trade, [Dated] 17 September 1990.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Cao Min: "Jobs Probe to Boost the Rights </F>
of Workers"] 
  [Text] The Labour Ministry is to launch a massive 
employment inspection to ensure workers' conditions meet State 
standards, it was revealed yesterday. 
  The inspection will cover all urban and township enterprises 
whether they are Chinese or foreign-funded, a ministry spokesman 
said. 
  And it will run from April 1 until June 30. 
  Among the things labour departments will be checking is 
whether enterprises have violated the law by using child labour 
or making women work in unsuitable jobs, the official said. 
  The inspectors will also check contracts, wages, working 
hours, insurance and welfare treatment, the official added. 
  The imperfect legal system and a lack of government 
supervision have caused a sharp rise in the number of labour 
disputes in China since the beginning of last year, said a 
recent Labour Ministry circular. 
  The Beijing-based China Electronic News said there were more 
than 10,000 disputes last year, and the Labour Bureau in 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone alone reported 2,353 in the first 
half of the year. 
  Some enterprises, particularly those outside State 
ownership, 
have violated labour laws and regulations, infringing workers' 
legitimate rights and interests. 
  The Shenzhen Special Zone Daily said a local joint venture 
hotel owed 238,000 yuan ($27,300) in back salarises to its 
employees in January. 
  Some employers paid little heed to their workers' health and 
made them work prolonged hours. 
  These firms also often ignored workers' safety. 
  Some trade union officials on the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have tabled proposals urging 
better protection for workers, particularly in foreign-funded 
firms, at the current Second Session of the CPPCC Eighth 
National Committee. 
  The government is very concerned about the problems and has 
instructed labour departments to look into them thoroughly, said 
the official. 
  Any illegal practices will be dealt with and those found 
guilty will be warned, fined or may lose their business licence. 
  The Labour Ministry hoped industry, commerce and public 
security administrations plus trade unions and women's and youth 
organizations would work with labour departments during the 
inspection. 
  It has also urged the country's mass media to publicize 
labour laws and regulations and provide consulting services on 
policies and laws.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yan Shigui (7346 0013 6311): "State Council </F>
Approves 1991-2010 General Plan for Beijing's Urban 
Construction"] 
  [Text] Beijing 1 Mar (RENMIN RIBAO)--A few days ago, the 
Beijing Municipal People's Government released to the press the 
State Council's official, written reply dated 6 October 1993 
concerning the "General Plan for Urban Construction of Beijing," 
approving Beijing's 1991-2010 general urban planning which 
Beijing Municipality has worked out on the basis of the specific 
situation of the capital. With the general urban plan as 
guidance and through unremitting efforts, the reply calls for 
building Beijing into a famous city of history and culture and a 
modern international metropolis with a flourishing economy, 
social stability, various public utilities and services, 
infrastructure, and an ecological environment of the highest 
world level. 
  The official written reply of the State Council stresses 
that 
Beijing is the capital of our great socialist motherland and is 
the political and cultural center of the whole country. 
  It is necessary to give prominence to the characteristics of 
the capital, give play to its strong points, energetically 
readjust the structure of production and the layout of land use, 
promote the development of high and new technology and tertiary 
industry, and endeavor to bring about unity in economic results, 
and social and environmental benefits. The State Council 
reaffirmed: Beijing should not develop heavy industry any more, 
especially not industries which consume a lot of power and 
water, take up a lot of land, involve much transportation, lead 
to serious pollution, or cause a lot of troubles for the people. 
  It is necessary to control the population and the scale of 
land use. By 2010, the registered population of Beijing 
Municipality should be limited to around 12.5 million (the 
number of those in the urban area should be limited to around 
6.5 million). The key to control of the population in the urban 
area lies in controlling the increase in the number of people 
moving in. 
  It is necessary to earnestly protect and improve the 
ecological environment of the capital. It is necessary to build 
and perfect the urban greening system, to promptly and strictly 
protect and implement plans for green areas which separate 
groups of urban areas, to ensure sufficient green spaces in 
urban areas, and to form a rational urban framework and 
development pattern. It is necessary to continue to grasp 
firmly work to prevent atmospheric, water, and noise pollution 
and pollution caused by industrial waste and garbage. It is 
necessary to strictly control the development of polluting 
industries in urban areas, especially in water sources and the 
windward side of the city. Regarding existing polluting 
projects in the urban area, it is necessary to make 
readjustments and gradually move them away. It is necessary to 
resolutely meet the requirements set in the plan concerning 
layout structure, density, stringent controls, and so not to go 
beyond the limits set. 
  Beijing is a famous ancient capital and is also a city noted 
for its history and culture. Its urban planning, construction, 
and development must be able to protect the history, culture, 
traditions, and the entire pattern of the ancient capital, and 
to give expression to the organic integration of the national 
traditions, local features, and the spirit of the times. It is 
necessary to make great efforts to raise the level of planning 
and design and to create a good image for the capital of our 
great motherland. 
  It is necessary to speed up modernization of the urban 
infrastructure. The State Planning Commission will take the 
lead in holding joint discussion with departments and localities 
concerned as soon as possible to work out construction plans for 
major projects to lead water from the south to the north; to 
pipe natural gas from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia to Beijing; to 
build the Beijing-Tianjin Canal; and to work out steps for 
implementing these plans. It is necessary to step up 
implementation of the strategy for the development of 
transportation in Beijing, to make great efforts to develop 
underground railways, light railways, and other mass transit 
public facilities, to further improve the expressway system, to 
construct modern transportation facilities, and to form as soon 
as possible a modern, comprehensive transportation network.

  [Text] Millions of coal workers are enduring increasing 
hardships as payment of their wages is held up. The disgruntled 
miners have become a threat to stability, a meeting of China's 
main consultative organ was told yesterday. 
  A democratic party leader, Wu Jing, said about 78 percent of 
workers, or 2.5 million, in the country's 94 major coal mines 
did not receive wages from their coal industry bureaus. The 
total amount of outstanding wages stood at 1.8 billion yuan 
(HK$1.59 billion). Some coal industry bureaus owed workers more 
than four months' back pay, said Mr Wu, a leader of the 
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, one of the 
eight democratic parties. Mr Wu told the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference that this had caused a 
critical drop in workers' living standards. "Elements of 
instability in coal mines and petitions have increased," he 
said. "There are more theft cases. The disgruntled workers 
have worked to rule. The cases of reprisals and assault (by 
workers against cadres) have gone up." He urged the various 
ministries to help retrieve the debts owed by other industries. 
Inconclusive statistics have put the debt total at 19.1 billion 
yuan last year. 
  The "helping hand" given by central leaders last year to 
grant emergency funds only managed to provide superficial 
relief, he said. Mr Wu said the State Council should stop coal 
suppliers to industries which failed to pay their debts to the 
coal companies. 
  The democratic party leader also warned that unauthorised 
coal mining activity in villages and townships had become 
rampant, resulting in more industrial accidents and huge wastage 
of coal resources. More than 80 per cent of the 68,000 coal 
mines in villages and townships did not meet the Government's 
safety standards, Mr Wu said. Aside from these, about 30,000 
coal mines were illegal. Mr Wu said at least 2.4 billion tons 
of coal had been wasted because of the chaotic tapping of the 
resources by unauthorised coal mining companies. 
  A total of 3,697 people died in rural coal mines last year. 
The cost for every one million tonnes of coal produced was 8.5 
lives. 
  Senior Chinese leaders have promised to take immediate 
action 
to solve the problem of coal mine workers' wages at meetings 
with National People's Congress' delegates from Jiangxi, one of 
the major coal mine industry strongholds.

"China's Central Bank To Adopt Measures To Solve Problem of 
Circulation of Hong Kong Currency in Shenzhen and Other 
Localities"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (TA KUNG PAO) -- Three vice 
presidents of the mainland's central bank said at a news 
conference today that, regarding the issue of allowing Hong 
Kong's currency to circulate in Shenzhen and other places, the 
central bank will adopt some specific measures to resolve this 
problem while taking into consideration the economic 
relationships between the Zhu Jiang delta and Hong Kong and 
Macao. 
  They also said that the central bank will not support 
Chinese- funded enterprises engaging in real estate speculation 
in Hong Kong; that foreign banks will be allowed to carry on 
renminbi business once conditions and the climate mature; and 
that, after the foreign exchange trading market begins operation 
on 1 April, foreign banks can participate in the market if they 
are trusted by customers. 
  The above remarks by bank Vice Presidents Zhou Zhengqing, 
Dai 
Xianglong, and Chen Yuan, were made at a news briefing held by 
the "Two-Session" News Center for the People's Bank of China 
[PBC]. 
  Answering a question asked by a reporter about whether Hong 
Kong currency will continue to be used in the Zhu Jiang delta, 
Zhou Zhengqing said: Any sovereign state in the world will not 
allow foreign currencies to circulate in its country. When 
exchange rates were unified in China, the relevant authority 
unequivocally indicated that foreign currencies were forbidden 
from circulation within the borders. As to the specific 
problems encountered by Shenzhen during the transition period, 
as it is a special economic zone which has many contacts with 
Hong Kong and Macao, we will adopt some specific measures to 
resolve them by considering the advantages of economic 
development with Hong Kong and Macao. As to the impact caused 
by the substantial amount of Hong Kong dollars flowing back into 
Hong Kong, Zhou Zhengqing said they were aware of the situation 
as the Hong Kong monetary administrative authority had informed 
China's central bank of the matter. 
  When asked about the central bank's views on Chinese-funded 
organizations which engage in real estate speculation in Hong 
Kong, Chen Yuan definitely said that the central bank opposed 
conducting such speculative activities because China is a 
country which practices exchange control and which is seriously 
short of funds for construction. However, if a few 
Chinese-funded enterprises needed to increase office and 
residential premises because of their business expansion, they 
are allowed to buy some properties so long as they are not 
involved in speculation. With regard to property mortgages 
extended by the Bank of China [BOC] in Hong Kong, Chen Yuan 
disclosed that the BOC conducts its business activities in Hong 
Kong independently without being restricted by the PBC, so it 
may carry on property mortgage business according to the market 
conditions, for which the PBC will not show any special concern. 
  Regarding the issue of allowing foreign banks to carry on 
renminbi business, Zhou Zhengqing said: Taken from the reform 
orientation and from a long-term perspective, it is necessary to 
resolve this issue gradually. However, this requires certain 
conditions. For example: First, it is necessary to ensure that 
after foreign banks carry on renminbi business, they must be on 
an equal footing with the Chinese banks in terms of tax 
requirements so that there is a foundation for equal 
competition. Second, our commercial banks have just been 
established and they need a process of gradual development and 
perfection. Third, our banking laws and regulations are not yet 
sound, and we are now speeding up the formulation of a series of 
banking laws and regulations including the "law on central 
bank," "law on commercial banks," "securities law," "bills law," 
"insurance law," and so on. When these conditions mature, the 
issue of carrying on renminbi business by foreign banks will be 
promptly settled. 
  Discussing the foreign exchange trading market that will 
begin operations on 1 April, Zhou Zhengqing said the 13 domestic 
banks [as published] will all enter this inter-bank foreign 
exchange trading market, and foreign banks, if entrusted by 
their customers, may also enter the market and engage in trading 
according to foreign exchange regulations. 
  Although a well-known economist strongly appealed to change 
the current phenomenon of negative interest rates in order to 
reduce the adverse impact on the economy, Zhou Zhengqing thought 
it better for the mainland's interest rates on deposits to 
maintain stability rather than making readjustments now because 
deposits are still increasing by a large margin and there is a 
favorable situation in the withdrawal of currency from 
circulation in January and February, which is conducive to 
economic development. 
  He stressed that, as the objective of monetary reform this 
year, China will institute three systems and achieve genuine 
results in two aspects. The three systems are: a macroeconomic 
regulation and control system for the central bank which carries 
out monetary policies independently under the leadership of the 
State Council; a monetary organizational system under which 
policy banks are separated from commercial banks and multiple 
financial institutions co-exist, with state-run commercial banks 
as the main body; and a financial market system characterized by 
unified openness, orderly competition, and strict management, so 
that the PBC will be a genuine central bank and the commercial 
banks will be run as genuine commercial banks. 
  He further pointed out: In order to realize the major 
targets for China's macroeconomic regulation and control this 
year, the principal duty of the central bank this year is to 
stabilize the currency. To this end, the central bank will 
adopt the following four measures in 1994: 1) Strictly control 
the increase of total credit volume of the state-owned banks and 
the base currency of the central bank and strictly control loans 
for fixed assets in particular. 2) Strictly control loan supply 
and vigorously organizing withdrawal of currency from 
circulation. 3) As of this year, suspend the overdrafts and 
loans of the Ministry of Finance from the central bank, and from 
this year onward, depend on treasury bonds to make up for the 
balance of financial revenue and expenditure of the central 
bank. 4) Intensify monetary supervision and control and 
maintain normal monetary order. As for the concrete measures 
for controlling inflation, he summed up the following three 
points: 1) Strictly control investment in fixed assets. 2) 
Ensure the comprehensive development of the rural economy, 
particularly the production of daily necessities including 
grain, cotton, edible oil, and so on. 3) Ensure the basic 
equilibrium of total demand and supply. 
  Dai Xianglong said emphatically: Since the second half of 
last year, the central bank has practiced a "steady" monetary 
policy -- neither stringently tightening up money supply nor 
excessively easing it. At present, the ratio of provision in 
commercial banks is relatively high, and there is a fairly large 
scope of credit. The credit scope for the second quarter will be 
fixed and assigned very soon. He added: "In a bid to guarantee 
a steady economic growth, we do not practice a retrenchment 
policy."

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (CNS) -- Deputy of the National 
People's Congress, Mr. Wang Zhongying, who is also a senior 
engineer of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, said 
in an exclusive interview with this agency that by the year 
2000, more than 50 percent of 45 key varieties of mineral 
resources in China will have been exhausted. If the current 
excessive exploitation of such resources continued, the shortage 
of natural resources would further restrict the national economy 
in the next century. 
  According to Mr. Wang, China can be called a big country of 
natural resources, but at the same time it was a small country 
in this sector when such resources were calculated based on per 
capita possession with its per capita water resources accounting 
for only one-eighth of the world average. Owing to 
imperfections of legislation, the destructive exploitation of 
natural resources was rampant in many places in the country. 
The panning of gold, for example, achieved a mere ten percent 
exploitation rate in some places, resulting in great losses. 
  Mr. Wang said that small-sized coalpits accounted for 30 to 
40 percent of the total number in the country, leading not only 
to a low rate of exploitation and usage but also frequent 
accidents. He warned that if there was no improvement in its 
exploitation of coal, China would face a serious shortage of 
such resources by the year 2005, though the country now ranked 
among the leading countries in the world in terms of coal 
reserves. 
  According to this expert, China has 70 to 80 percent of the 
proven rare-earth reserves in the world. He criticized 
Guangdong, Guangxi and Jiangxi, which are rich in this mineral, 
for their mismanagement of exploitation of these natural 
deposits and for their devaluing the export prices of these 
minerals against each other among themselves with rare-earth 
prices dropping to RMB 40,000 per tonne from RMB 80,000 per 
tonne one year ago. 
  Mr. Wang called on all parties concerned to pay greater 
attention to the protection and proper use of the limited 
mineral resources in the country, saying that the resources 
issue should be considered a basic national policy such as the 
population and environment issues.

Xiaoping Issues New Instructions on Work in 1994"] 
  [Text] In 1993, China's GDP reached 3,138 billion yuan and 
GNP exceeded 1,000 billion yuan, an increase of 13.4 percent 
over 1992 and the biggest increase in the world. China hopes to 
see a 9 to 10 percent economic growth rate in 1994 and an 
inflation rate of less than 10 percent. Can these targets be 
reached? How does the political and economic development look 
like in China this year? Various sides have expressed great 
interest. 
  This will be a year of great reform in China. Will the 
reform bring risks and problems? Judged from China's actual 
conditions at this time, the risks will not come from the reform 
itself but from the following several aspects: 
  1. The scale of fixed assets investment is too large; last 
year it reached 1182.9 billion yuan, a 50 percent increase over 
1992. This trend is still strong this year and passing the point 
of what the country can bear. If it is not brought under 
effective control the consequences will be huge. 
  2. The agricultural problem is still pronounced, and 
although last year's farm products harvest was a record and the 
increased value of agriculture for the whole year was 665 
billion yuan, the overall future situation does not allow for 
optimism. 
  3. Some localities have differing opinions from the leading 
departments: "When the upper level has a measure, the lower 
level has a countermeasure," actions are not coordinated, and a 
"local lord economy" has emerged. 
  Quite a number of officials, enterprises, and commercial and 
trading departments compare speed, talk about layout, and opt 
for high consumption, paying no attention to efficiency, cost 
cutting, and stopping losses. They are not interested in 
strengthening management nor have they adequate concern for the 
people's sufferings. 
  4. The anticorruption drive and reform of the public service 
system are also problems. Just as Jiang Zemin said, the 
anticorruption drive must be a persistent battle and must be 
supported by the system, whereas when reforms of several systems 
are carried out simultaneously, the conflicts become more 
pronounced. 
<H3>  Deng Xiaoping Supports Jiang Zemin in Personally Formulating 
the 1994 Reform Plan </H3>
  However, Zhu Rongji said: Reform certainly is risky but not 
carrying out reform carries an even bigger risk. Deng Xiaoping 
expressed great support when Jiang Zemin personally formulated 
the 1994 reform plan, and Deng said: "Do not be afraid to take 
risks, be bolder. If one fears the wolves in front and the 
tigers behind, then one cannot walk." 
<H5>  Reform Is Risky But Not Carrying Out Reform Is More Risky </H5>
  At present, some localities are indeed very rich, while the 
central authorities have experienced a serious revenue drain and 
the state has not been able to settle the deficit for many 
years. If changes are not made, then things will be more 
difficult. 
  In the past two years, China's foreign trade deficit has 
rapidly soared while its exports have decreased. In January 
this year, imports surpassed exports by $900 million; according 
to a calculation based on this figure, the unfavorable trade 
balance will reach $10.8 billion for the whole year. Because 
the unfavorable trade balance will continuously expand every 
year, the state will have less income from foreign exchange, 
capital will drain, and if China does not seriously carry out 
reform of the foreign exchange system, things cannot go on like 
this. 
  Over the past many years, in the tradition of the planned 
economy, the "symptom of being thirsty for investment," which 
was characterized by mutual comparison and ceaseless expansion 
of the investment scale, was banned by repeated orders but it 
was not cured for a long time. It became even more prominent 
and rampant when more efforts were made to tackle it, to the 
extent that output was superficially large, the investment scale 
was even larger, but most projects had poor returns, low 
quality, many loopholes, and shortages of funds. This 
phenomenon was particularly prominent in local provinces, 
cities, counties, towns, and enterprise development zones. If 
control is still not realized in the areas of finance and the 
financial system, it will disrupt China's economic development. 
<H5>  Deng Says: Make Some Adjustments When Problems Are Found </H5>
  For this reason, Deng Xiaoping demanded they "be bold and 
careful, promptly sum up experiences, make some adjustments when 
problems are found to enable things to accord with reality." 
  Responding to the situation, Deng Xiaoping also pointed out 
recently that: "To make the reform a success, it has to be 
carried out in an orderly manner and with guidance; without this 
condition, things become chaotic and people go their own ways. 
Thus, how can things be done?" 
  Deng also said: "The CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council should have authority; without authority they cannot 
control the situation." 

<H3>    Deng Xiaoping Says: "Macromanagement Must Be Embodied 
in the Central Leadership's Ability To Keep Promises" </H3>
  At the same time as China pursues a market economy, it must 
continue to carry out macroregulation and control; according to 
an estimate by the senior level in China, macroregulation and 
control must be continuously carried out for 10 or 20 years. 
Deng Xiaoping said that the most crucial thing is that 
"macromanagement must be embodied in the central leadership's 
ability to keep promises." 
Where Does Enterprise Reform Go From Here? 
  This year, China will implement the "10,000, 1,000, 100, and 
10" "mechanism-changing and system-building" plan. This means: 
Granting 14 kinds of decisionmaking power to 13,000 state-owned 
large and medium enterprises to enable them to really change 
their operational mechanisms and accomplish the work of sorting 
out assets and auditing capital; send supervisory committees to 
1,000 key and backbone enterprises which have a bearing on the 
national economy and the people's livelihood, to supervise 
state-owned assets batch by batch; select 100 state-owned large 
and medium enterprises to try out a modern enterprise system; 
and choose 10 cities to carry out a pilot program to reduce 
unreasonable burdens in enterprises and increase their 
self-owned circulation funds. 
  Li Peng said that at present the first thing to do is to 
organize 100 state-owned large and medium enterprises to try 
things out. The reform of state-owned enterprises is to, first, 
make it conducive to enhancing vitality among state-owned 
enterprises; second, to enable state-owned enterprises to 
preserve their value and increase output value; and third, to 
make it conducive to maintaining social stability. 
  In order to promote technological progress among 
enterprises, 
this year, China will allocate 250 billion yuan for investment 
in technological transformation, to mainly support 100 capable 
and large enterprise groups to establish technology centers; and 
to organize 100 important state technological development and 
industrial experimental projects, 100 key locations for 
promoting and demonstrating new technology, and 10 high-tech 
industrial projects "combining production, study, and research." 
The State Council will also abolish its "Important Technology 
and Equipment Leadership Group," handing its business to the 
State Economic Commission. 
  In future, state-owned enterprises will become independent 
"tax payers" who have rights over property as a legal person and 
who make own decisions on operation and take sole responsibility 
for gains and losses, while the state, as a capital contributor, 
will only enjoy ownership rights proportional to the funds it 
contributes to the enterprises and will shoulder limited 
liabilities. The unitary ownership system among state-owned 
enterprises will be changed and, except for some state-owned 
enterprises, other state-owned enterprises will be allowed to 
absorb nonstate-owned funds as shares, whereas the enterprises 
solely funded by the state or with an absolute majority of 
shares held by the state are considered state-owned enterprises. 
The market law of survival of the fittest will be implemented. 
Enterprises which make losses over a long period of time and 
which have capital smaller than their debts must be declared 
bankrupt according to law.

<F P=106> [By Jin Man: "Against Inflation, Long Odds"] </F>
  [Text] If everything it has up its sleeves works, China 
will have an easy time this year reining in inflation. 
  That's a big if. Last week the country's top bankers 
announced four anti-inflation measures, including nipping 
runaway investment in fixed assets. 
  However, speculative moves have again pushed up the prices 
of 
raw materials beyond their real value. 
  Steel prices, for instance, have risen to around 4,000 yuan 
($459.80) per ton from below 3,000 yuan ($344.83) per ton at the 
end of last year. The prices of crude oil and some other major 
products are also expected to rise soon. 
  The State has budgeted 1.3 trillion yuan ($149.4 billion) 
for 
investment in fixed assets this year, and the People's Bank of 
China, the central bank, has vowed to prevent any violation of 
the ceiling. 
  But others speculate that at least 1.5 trillion yuan ($172.4 
billion) will actually be forked out. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji warns that such speculation could 
well threaten the stability of prices. 
  In January, in fact, inflation in 35 large cities exceeded 
expectations by rising to 23.3 per cent. The government has 
said it wants to contain inflation this year to 10 per cent 
compared with 13 percent last year. 
  A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named says 
two 
basic factors determine inflation. 
  One is the scale of investment in fixed assets. Failure to 
restrain capital spending will lead to excessive growth in the 
money supply. 
  The other factor is the prices of such basic goods as grain, 
cotton edible oil, meat and sugar. 
  "The real threat of inflation does not come from the price 
hikes of the latter, because people's purchasing power will grow 
at the same pace," the economist said. 
  Besides, the State has pledged to stabilize agricultural 
production this year to avert drastic price increases . 
  "What unsettles me most is a possible ballooning of the 
money 
supply," he said. 
  He said inflation may well surpass 10 per cent, but not to 
the point where the economy will collapse. 
  "It will be an uphill battle to fight inflation this year, 
and we need deft direction of the financial ropes and of public 
psychology," he said. 
  In some regions inflation has been pushed up by freewheeling 
price rises in defiance of State orders. Local governments have 
also winked at big wage increases to dilute public fears about 
devaluation. 
  Reliable sources say that despite an impending rise in the 
price of crude oil, the price of oil products must be kept 
stable or even lowered to protect consumers, especially farmers. 
Higher prices for oil products would deal a hard blow to 
farmers, jeopardizing grain output. 
  The State's major tools for curbing inflation include 
controlling wages, restraining borrowing from banks to offset 
budgetary deficits, and bolstering agricultural production.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "China, Low On Jet Fuel, Is Given A </F>
Foreign Lift"] 
  [Text] China will set up a partnership with foreign oil 
firms to ensure enough aviation fuel for its sharply expanding 
air fleets. 
  Years of robust growth in air travel have created a shortage 
not only of pilots and air controllers, but of aviation fuel. 
  Indeed, last year airports in a dozen cities including 
Fuzhou, Harbin and Chongqing had to restrict fuel use, forcing 
flights to be delayed or cancelled. 
  Now, major construction of refueling facilities is under way 
across China to boost aviation fuel supply and shipping 
capacity. And overseas oil investors, eager to pry open the 
lucrative Chinese aviation fuel market, will take an active part. 
  To accomplish this the China Aviation Oil Supply Corp 
(CAOSC), the country's sole supplier of fuel, is preparing to 
turn three of its seven regional branches into Sino-foreign 
joint ventures. 
  Letters of intent were agreed on late last year for setting 
up joint ventures with British Petroleum in North China, 
France's ELF in East China, and the Netherlands' Vitol in 
Central and South China. 
  The three regional branches, which account for 80 per cent 
of 
the corporation's profits and half of its employees, are 
responsible for supplying fuel to China's busiest air traffic 
areas. 
  Bai Zhijian, president of CAOSC told Business Weekly that 
poor refueling capacity and congested railway transport have 
crimped the supply of aviation oil, posing more obstacles to 
speedy development of civil aviation. 
  The CAOSC's bold strategy is imperative if the huge amount 
of 
capital needed to modernize the supply and storage system is to 
be raised, Bai said. 
  Foreign know-how and managerial skills will also help make 
the corporation more competitive, he said. 
  "The co-operation projects will enter the substantive stage 
if we get final State approval," Bai said without elaboration. 
  But he did say that Chinese will control the ventures' 
tangible and intangible assets like market access and good will 
while the foreign firms will put up cash but will hold smaller 
stakes. 
  CAOSC is seeking 4 billion yuan ($460 million) from 
investors 
to upgrade old refueling equipment and build new systems 
throughout China by the turn of the century. 
  Last year, the completion of nine oil depots, like the one 
at 
Beijing Capital Airport, augmented storage capacity by one-third 
to 840,000 cubic metres. New oil pipelines with a total length 
of 37 kilometres were also put into service. 
  "But the current storage capacity is still far short of 
demand," Bai stressed. 
  So high on this year's schedule is construction of bases in 
Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beihai to handle imported fuel, 
which is surging in to fill the gap in domestic supplies. 
  Each base will consist of oil jetties, pipelines and depots, 
and is tailored for the long-term needs of the country's 
northern, eastern, southern and southwestern regions, 
respectively. 
  Bai said that work on the Tianjin base will begin first, in 
June. It will involve building a 140,000-cubic metre oil 
transfer farm in Tianjin Harbour, burying a 52-kilometre 
pipeline to the oil depot at Tianjin Airport, and laying another 
132 kilometre pipeline to Beijing Capital Airport.

<F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Chemical Industry Responding To Demand"] </F>
  [Text] China's chemical industry will focus on 
restructuring its major products this year. 
  This is part of the industry's plan for 1994 released 
recently by the Ministry of Chemical Industry. 
  The ministry also predicted that the industry's annual 
output 
value this year will reach 190 billion yuan ($21.9 billion), up 
8 percent over the previous year, and its export value will 
climb 15 per cent from 1993. 
  The annual output of major chemical products such as 
fertilizer, pesticides, sulphuric acid, caustic soda, soda ash 
and tyres will exceed State targets, the ministry said. 
  And the industry will speed up restructuring its products to 
meet demand. 
  In 1993, the output value of radial tyres, which are needed 
in large numbers by the automobile industry, accounted for 10.7 
percent of the overall total, considerably above the 7.5 per 
cent of 1992. 
  More than 70 kinds of boll-weevil pesticide were used to 
ensure a stable and high production of cotton in l993. The 
figure is 1.3 times that of 1992. 
  The chemical industry's output value last year hit 178.79 
billion yuan ($20.55 billion), 7.2 per cent more than in 1992. 
  Shanghai and the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning 
and 
Guangdong reported total chemical industrial output worth 10 
billion yuan ($1.15 billion). 
  In the first 11 months of 1993, the value of China's 
chemical 
exports reached $9.97 billion, up 27.3 per cent from the same 
period in 1992. 
  Of the exports, the value of fine chemicals and finished 
products rose sharply and surpassed that of materials and 
unfinished products. 
  During the same period, China imported 11.02 billion yuan 
($1.27 billion) in chemical products, 1.6 percent more than the 
corresponding period in 1992. 
  Chemical sales in 1993 jumped 19.3 percent over the previous 
year. And more than 98 percent of the goods manufactured last 
year were actually sold, up 2.16 percent over 1992. 
  During the year, safety was improved with the renovation of 
equipment. The number of accidents reported declined by 10 per 
cent. 
  At the same time, the ministry pointed out that falling 
profits as well as the rising number of debt plagued enterprises 
hindered the industry's development last year. 
  In 1993, the country sold 82.73 million tons of fertilizer, 
18.2 percent less than the previous year. Output fell 6 percent 
to 91 million tons. 
  Last year's declining profits are mainly the result of huge 
increases in the prices of chemical materials, according to the 
ministry. 
  Because of inflation, the cost of materials used to make 
fertilizer rose by 3 billion yuan ($345 million) or 1.36 times 
the industry's total pre-tax profits in 1992.

<F P=106> [By Qu Yingpu: "Statistics: Transport Growth Slows Down"] </F>
  [Text] Transportation, which walked out of two consecutive 
months of the doldrums in January, witnessed a slow-down of its 
growth again last month, according to the latest figures from 
the State Statistics Bureau. 
  Freight transport volume in the first two months of this 
year 
went up only 4.7 per cent, a much slower growth rate than the 
10.9 per cent rise in January, but still far above the 0.2 per 
cent decline for the whole of last year, a report from the 
bureau said. 
  Meanwhile, passenger transportation slumped again. A 2.9 per 
cent decline was reported for the January-February period. The 
drop for January alone was 2.8 percent, while the dip was 11.9 
per cent for last year. 
  Freight transport volume stood at 432 million tons in the 
first two months of this year, the report said. 
  Of the total, rail freight registered a growth rate of 3.8 
per cent to 246 million tons. Last year's total was 1.57 
billion tons, 2.9 per cent more than in 1992. 
  Truck freight in the period slid by 2.2 per cent to 81 
million tons, compared with the decrease of 9.5 per cent last 
year over 1992. 
  Boat freight witnessed a growth of 13.3 per cent in the 
first 
two months, to hit 104 million tons. The growth rate last year 
was only 1.5 per cent. 
  Air freight soared 23.8 per cent to 109,000 tons in the 
January- February period, compared with the 20.9 per cent 
increase registered in 1993. 
  Freight turnover in the two months--an important indicator 
in 
monitoring unit labour productivity and economic efficiency-- 
witnessed a growth of 7.7 per cent to hit 412.21 ton-kilometres. 
(One ton-kilometre is one ton of cargo transported one 
kilometre.) Last year's increase was 2.6 per cent. 
  Of the total, railways reported a 6 percent rise to 188.38 
billion ton-kilometres, while truck freight turnover inched up 
1.9 per cent to 4.71 billion ton-kilometres. 
  Air freight turnover generated 248 million ton-kilometres, a 
20.8 percent jump, and boat freight turnover climbed 9.3 percent 
to 218.87 billion ton-kilometres. 
  Total passenger volume stood at 862 million in the 
January-February period, the report said. 
  Volume breakdown shows 175 million people travelled by rail, 
up 1.2 per cent, while 656 million travelled by buses, down 3.6 
per cent. 
  Some 27 million people travelled by boat, down 13.8 per 
cent, 
while 4.9 million people flew, up a soaring 22.8 per cent. 
  The passenger turnover in the period reported a 3.4 per cent 
decline to 99.26 billion person-kilometres. 
  Of the total, passenger turnover by rail went down 0.9 
percent to 58.87 billion person-kilometres, while bus travel 
turnover dived by 9.9 per cent to 31.13 billion 
person-kilometres. 
  Boat travel turnover slid 21.2 per cent to 2.47 billion 
person-kilometres, while air travel chalked up a 20.8 per cent 
increase to 6.79 billion person-kilometres. 
  In February alone, the railways transported 115 million tons 
of cargo and 88 million passengers. 
  Major coastal ports handled 103 million tons of cargo in the 
first two months of this year, 11.4 per cent more than in the 
same period last year. The growth rate for the whole year of 
1993 was 11.2 per cent. 
  The statistics also indicated that business turnover of 
China's posts and telecommunications registered a sharp rise of 
49.0 per cent in the period to 8.45 billion yuan ($971 million).

  [Text] Shanghai, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Baochang, a 
32-year-old intellectual, believes in luck. 
  Not long after he gained a master's degree specializing in 
high- polymer research at the East China Institute of Chemical 
Technology in 1988, he found a job at a science and technology 
company, which he had hoped for. 
  "I like what I am doing," said Zhang, now serving as the 
general manager of the Huachang Polymeter Company, one of 
China's influential producers of preservative materials. 
  Last year saw his company generate profits totalling six 
million yuan. 
  Zhang himself was commended as an outstanding scientist-cum- 
entrepreneur. 
  "The reason I like to go in for business is that it gives me 
a chance to apply sophisticated science to production and 
fulfill the mission of a Chinese intellectual," Zhang said. 
  "It was this mission that has made me stay in China and 
devote myself to the motherland," the general manager noted. 
  He attributed his company's credit to its high-tech 
products, 
and pledged to generate profits amounting to 10 million yuan 
this year. 
  Zhang Baochang is typical of the young scientists who have 
taken up business in China. 
  According to the latest statistics, there are about 5,000 
non- governmental scientific enterprises, just like the Huachang 
Polymeter Company, on the Chinese mainland. Heads of one third 
of these enterprises are people under 40 years old. 
  Soon after these enterprises came into existence, they 
employed a new operational mechanism to display the talents of 
enterprising young people. 
  One example is Zhang Jianlong, 33, of the Shanghai Stone 
Computer Company. 
  Zhang started as a salesman with the company in 1987. He was 
promoted to head of the components workshop half a year later 
because of his excellent work. He became general manager of the 
company in 1990. 
  The company's sales income expanded from less than 100 
million yuan in 1990 to 150 million yuan last year, developing 
into one of the largest non-governmental scientific enterprises 
in Shanghai. 
  Zhang said, "I am grateful to the company for paving the way 
for me to do something I'd like to do." 
  Many young people share his view. 
  Zheng Baoqi, who has made 25 inventions, is serving as a 
deputy general manager of the Shanghai Feige (Flying Pigeon) 
Telecommunications Equipment Service Department under the 
Shanghai No. 3 Telecommunications Equipment Plant. 
  By granting more autonomy to his employees and applying new 
managerial measures, he made the scientists of the department 
more enthusiastic about their work, and have completed 12 
development projects, bringing in 270,000 yuan in profits a year. 
  In 1991 Zheng headed his department to set up a 
joint-venture 
telecommunications technology company with an American company. 
Zheng became the deputy general manager in charge of the 
development of science and technology and management. 
  His company, with a total of 78 employees, obtained a sales 
income of 30 million yuan last year by developing advanced 
telecommunications equipment. 
  "Only by applying science to production can we display our 
talents properly," Zheng noted. 
  The deputy general manager is determined to compete in the 
international market. 
  A survey shows that the 900,000 science workers in Shanghai 
make about 2,000 research achievements a year, applying many of 
them to production. 
  The output value generated by the 5,000 scientific 
enterprises in the city totalled 20 billion yuan last year, and 
is expected to top 40 billion yuan this year. 
  Xu Kuangdi, deputy mayor in charge of scientific work, said, 
"The city is sure to have more such scientists-cum-entrepreneurs 
as China's social environment further improves."

  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- If we say "food is the 
people's no. 1 need," housing should be as important as food. 
Since the introduction of reform and opening up, China has 
exerted great efforts to build more houses for its people. 
  In the past, investments in public housing construction did 
not yield economic returns. As a result, we ran out of all 
resources for housing development. In recent years, China has 
initiated a new investment and loan system for housing 
development under which the government, units, and individuals 
jointly undertake responsibility for housing construction, 
thereby broadening investment channels for housing construction 
in all sectors and at various levels. 
  According to statistics, since reform and opening up, 
investments in China's urban housing construction have seen a 
momentous increase. From 1979 to 1992, over 400 billion yuan 
was invested in housing development, more than five times the 
total in the first three decades after the PRC's founding; and a 
total of 1.78 billion square meters [sq m] of residences were 
built. The urban construction department's estimate puts the 
present per capita living space of the urban population 
nationwide at 7.2 sq m. Compared with the years before reform 
and opening up, the urban residents' housing conditions have 
been improved markedly. 
  Since the beginning of last year, various localities have 
stepped up efforts to construct housing for middle- and 
low-income urban residents, thereby enabling large numbers of 
homeless households or households living in hazardous quarters 
or quarters with inadequate facilities to move into new houses. 
In the past eight years, housing problems have been solved for 
nearly 6 million urban households throughout the country. 
Chengdu city, after helping 8,361 households solve housing 
problems last year, has recently completed a housing complex 
with complete facilities covering 32,000 sq m of floor space at 
the "Anju Gardens" for 500 lucky households. Fuzhou city, 
promoting housing development in conjunction with housing 
reform, has revamped some 400 blocks of dilapidated houses of 
various sizes; and constructed 5 million sq m of houses of all 
types, 12 10,000-residents compact housing communities, and two 
dozen medium-sized residential villages in as little as three 
years. As a result, over 400,000 households have moved into new 
living quarters while 14,000 households' living conditions have 
been considerably improved. Xian city has achieved notable 
results in revamping hazardous houses in low-lying land over the 
past two years or so; and last year, 10,000 households moved 
from hazardous to new living quarters. Shandong Province built 
11 million sq m of urban houses, thus bringing the per capita 
living quarters to 8.1 sq m. 
  In spite of the efforts, housing shortage remains rather 
acute throughout the country in view of the continuously growing 
demand in material life and population pressures. At present, 
4-5 million households in China live in quarters with inadequate 
facilities, in addition to some 30 million sq m of hazardous 
houses awaiting to be repaired. The Construction Ministry is 
clearly aware of the need to take action. Commenting recently 
on pricing problems in commercial housing construction, Vice 
Minister Li Zhendong said: It is necessary to adopt different 
policies for people with various incomes to solve housing 
problems in a variety of ways, establishing a social 
security-type marketing system of "economy housing" for 
households with medium income, as well as a commercial housing 
marketing system for high-income families, with active 
assistance from the government toward economy housing 
construction. To keep housing construction prices as low as 
possible, especially the construction of housing with complete 
facilities, housing with minimum profits, and housing for people 
living in quarters with inadequate facilities, the government 
will adopt preferential policies to make housing sales prices as 
close to workers' wages as possible, and will provide assistance 
in terms of construction plans, land supply, funding 
arrangements, and loan interest rates. Meanwhile, the government 
will institute a policy-lending mortgage system for individual 
housing sales by providing long-term low- interest loans at 
government designated banks for the sales of housing with 
marginal profits and for people with housing problems. 
  On the quality of housing construction, Construction 
Minister 
Hou Jie recently said: To solve housing problems, it is 
necessary to build more and better quality houses and improve 
the management to provide comfortable, convenient, and 
satisfactory living quarters for people. Housing quality and 
environment should be the top priority in housing construction. 
  At the beginning of this year, the Construction Ministry 
urged all localities to solve housing problems by speeding up 
construction as well as housing and real estate development 
enterprises to concentrate their operations on building 
low-priced economy housing. It will be a year of housing 
construction this year in China and Chinese people's living 
conditions will be further improved.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Excerpt] Central and provincial leaders yesterday held a 
national conference on farming, which is expected to recommend 
measures to boost Beijing's control over the vital sector. And 
major banks announced last night they would earmark special 
funds to help farmers procure raw materials. 
  Chinese sources said in spite of the satisfactory harvests 
last year, the leadership was worried that the desired yields 
for staples such as grain, cotton and other foodstuff would 
gradually fall because of farmers' dwindling enthusiasm for 
these traditional pursuits. A key item on the agenda yesterday 
was the extent to which procurement prices should be raised. 
Moreover, to prevent the recurrence of the peasant riots last 
year, the authorities weighed the possibilities of further 
lowering agrarian taxes. 
  In a circular yesterday, banks, including the People's Bank 
of China and the Agriculture Bank, said they would ensure that 
farmers get enough loans for supplies such as fertilizers and 
pesticides. 
  "To ensure that farmers can carry out their seasonal work, 
loans to them should be distributed in good time," the circular 
added. Analysts said Beijing wanted to reimpose some form of 
production quotas on various provinces with regard to essential 
produce. 
  However, regions, particularly industrialized provinces such 
as Guangdong, had raised objections. Last week, legislators 
from Guangdong were told they should no longer rely on grain 
from other provinces or on imports. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Jia Zhaoquan (6328 2507 0356) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhang Dongbo (1728 2639 3134)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the All-Army 
Telephone Conference on Agricultural and Sideline Production, 
which opened today, Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military 
Commission [CMC] and director of the General Logistics 
Department, demanded that all troops in the entire Army make 
great efforts to develop agricultural and sideline production to 
ensure the living standards of officers and men, enhance 
cohesiveness among troops, and increase fighting capacity. 
  Fu Quanyou noted: Agricultural and sideline production of 
the Army is a component part of the country's agriculture. The 
Army's engaging in agricultural and sideline production plays an 
important role in relieving the state's burden, supplementing 
supplies to troops, improving officers' and men's lives, and 
promoting military reform and building -- this is an important 
matter benefiting the state, the Army, and the people. Over the 
past years, all troops in the Army have conscientiously carried 
out the directives of the CMC and the General Logistics 
Department in increasing agricultural and sideline production 
through hard work and have basically established a production 
structure with military farms as the mainstay, brigade- and 
regiment-run nonstaple food production bases and life service 
centers as the central links, and part-time production of 
companies as the foundation. The infrastructure has been 
gradually improved and the application of science in farming and 
livestock raising has been upgraded constantly; as a result, the 
overall production capacity has remarkably increased and a good 
trend for sustained and stable development has emerged. Last 
year, the entire Army reaped a good harvest in agricultural and 
sideline production, producing 650 million kg of grain; 225 
million kg of meat, fish, poultry, and eggs; 600 million kg of 
vegetables; and 700 million yuan in total profits. This has 
effectively subsidized the lives of troops. Currently, commodity 
prices on the market are rising rapidly; this has greatly 
influenced the military life. Despite the fact that the CMC has 
decided to readjust the standard of military food expenses under 
the condition of a tight budget for military expenditure, there 
is still a large gap between the food expenses and the actual 
prices demanded by the market. To narrow this gap, it is 
necessary to vigorously increase agricultural and sideline 
production and increase the Army's self-supply capacity. 
  Fu Quanyou said: Vigorously increasing agricultural and 
sideline production is the CMC's constant guiding ideology in 
strengthening Army building, the basic demand for 
comprehensively implementing the "Outline for Grass-Roots 
Military Building," and an important measure for maintaining 
military stability. As early as 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
noted: "It is necessary to run Army's agricultural and sideline 
production properly." Comrade Jiang Zemin also stressed: "The 
Army's engaging in agricultural and sideline production is the 
display of the Nanniwan spirit, which should be continued 
persistently." All troops in the Army, particularly leading 
cadres at all levels, must unify their thinking with the CMC's 
decisions, adhere to the orientation of serving life with 
production, and make subsidizing the lives of troops the 
starting point and goal of expanding agricultural and sideline 
production. 
  Fu Quanyou stressed: Party committees and leaders at all 
levels must strengthen organization and leadership, place 
agricultural and sideline production on an important position, 
divide the work and assign special persons to take charge of the 
work, and study and settle problems on a regular basis. Leaders 
at all levels should use reform as the driving force, be 
oriented by the troops' demand and the development in the 
market, deepen reform, and intensify management to promote the 
all-Army agricultural and sideline production to a new level.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- China is to launch a 
national project to help poor farmers for this summer, according 
to a board conference of the China Population Welfare Foundation 
held in Beijing yesterday. 
  The "Happiness Project" aims to help improve the living 
conditions and the health of farmers, particularly those in 
remote and poverty-stricken districts. 
  The welfare foundation, a non-governmental organization 
headed by Chinese celebrities, plans to raise funds from around 
the country and abroad. 
  Donations are to go toward providing equipment and training 
to farmers. 
  The foundation also plans activities to challenge the 
traditional concepts that favor large families and encourage 
rural families to have fewer and healthier children. 
  State Councillor Peng Peiyun, who is also minister of the 
State Family Planning Commission, said the government will 
support the project and called on social institutes and 
individuals to donate or volunteer their time to the effort. 
  Some rural families, especially those in economically 
depressed districts, often have more children, particularly 
boys, to help with field work and support the family. 
  It is a common scene that the poorer a family, the more 
children it has. 
  Peng pointed out that family planning work must be 
integrated 
with improvement of living standards and expansion of social 
welfare services. 
  She said greater publicity and educational activities should 
be carried out to teach farmers about advanced production 
techniques and the state family planning policy.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Feature": "Guangzhou in Green Deficit"] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou, one of 
the Chinese cities with the most dynamic economy, is now in a 
green deficit. 
  While roads are getting wider and skyscrapers are rising 
higher, trees and lawns are becoming rare in this capital of 
south Guangdong Province. 
  Even kapok, the city flower that once bloomed into a 
beautiful vision of red all over Guangzhou, is taking a good 
search to find. 
  Sources from the city bureau of parks and woods said the 
number of kapoks totals a mere 1,200 in the old town. Most of 
them are in streets and lanes too out-of-the-way to be seen by 
visitors. 
  The expansion of Dongfeng Road is regarded as one of the 
biggest and most successful projects in urban construction. It 
now runs from the east to the west end of the city and makes 
traffic much smoother. 
  However, walking, cycling or driving right under the 
scorching summer sun seems to be as irritating as sitting in the 
bygone traffic jams, and makes citizens long for the cool shadow 
of the trees that had lined the road for more than 25 years. 
  The sources said that more than one-third of the trees in 
the 
old town have disappeared in road expansion works in the past 
few years. 
  Experts from the bureau complained that the government and 
city- planners seem to regard trees and lawns as mere decorative 
touches that can be easily obliterated whenever they come into 
conflict with construction. 
  For nearly ten years, the city's annual spending on the 
green 
cause has stagnated between two to three million yuan, which 
falls far short of a reasonable necessity, the experts claimed. 
  Considering that many Chinese cities are facing the same 
problem, the experts urged that China's city-planners and 
officials should learn more from their foreign counterparts, and 
give more space to green land in the concrete jungle. 
  The experts estimate that Guangzhou will need to invest over 
500 million yuan before it can provide each citizen with five 
square meters of green land, as it plans. 
  Understanding that the city government alone can hardly 
supply all of the money, the experts called for all sectors of 
society to take actions before the green deficit becomes a green 
crisis.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Statistics 
from the State Statistical Bureau show that prices for fresh 
vegetables in large and medium cities throughout the country 
have skyrocketed since last winter. 
  In January alone, among the 35 cities, Shanghai, Nanjing, 
Hangzhou, Ningbo, Hefei, Xiamen, Nanchang, and Chongqing saw 
prices for fresh vegetables rise by 50 percent. 
  Surveys have identified the following as the main causes of 
the price hikes: Reduced vegetable farmland -- urban 
development and rapid increases in development zones have taken 
up much of the suburban vegetable farmland; a sharp 
contradiction between demand and supply -- there has been a 
noticeable increase in urban consumers and migrant populations, 
generating an enormous demand for vegetables; increases in the 
cost of growing vegetables -- there have been steep prices 
increases for products that are essential for vegetable 
production; and insufficient regulation and control over 
state-owned vegetable markets. 
  Residents now obtain 98 percent of their vegetables from 
markets. With the transformation of operational mechanisms slow 
in coming, state-owned vegetable markets are lagging behind 
market demand. Overall, the effort to achieve stable 
macro-regulation and control over vegetable prices has run into 
considerable difficulty.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China has carried out 
55 agriculture development programs in the past 15 years with 
economic assistance worth 700 million U.S. dollars provided by 
the World Food Program (WFP). 
  More than 20 million people have directly benefited from the 
schemes. This was revealed at a symposium which concluded here 
today on the subject of WFP assistance for development in the 
Asia- Pacific region. 
  Since 1979, when China first participated in the 
organization, the WFP has supplied great quantities of food, 
including 9.4 million tons of wheat, 45,000 tons of skimmed milk 
powder, 15,000 tons of butter and many advanced facilities to 
China's 55 agricultural development projects, covering 160 
poverty-stricken counties all over the country. 
  Among the projects applauded by local governments and people 
are improvement of dairy products in six large cities, fish 
farming in nine large cities, soil erosion prevention on Loess 
Plateau, protection of pandas in Sichuan Province and production 
of forage grass in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  WFP assistance is mainly utilized for comprehensive 
agricultural development projects and its aid emphasis in recent 
years has been further shifted to areas inhabited by minority 
nationalities and remote mountain areas in north-western and 
south-western China. 
  With 43 projects already completed and 12 others still under 
way, the WFP-assisted schemes have played a positive role in 
improving production conditions and the ecological environment 
and in increasing farmers' incomes.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Try By Every Means To Increase Peasants' </F>
Incomes"] 
  [Text] In his government work report delivered at the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], 
Premier Li Peng emphasized that the interests of the peasants 
and rural economic growth should never be neglected. The supply 
of farm produce is directly related to stable prices and an 
improvement in the people's livelihood, and an increase in the 
peasants' income, is directly related to market development. It 
is the crux of rural work at present and in the future and an 
important and pressing task for the vast numbers of peasants and 
rural cadres to increase the peasants' income. 
  The successes attained in China's agriculture since reform 
are obvious to all. However, the problems exposed in 
development are also worrisome. Of all the problems, the most 
serious ones are the declining efficiency in agriculture and the 
slow growth in the peasants' income. The peasants' income 
increased rapidly at an annual rate of 13.9 percent from 1978 to 
1984. The enthusiasm of the peasants for farming ran 
unprecedentedly high and the output of farm produce increased by 
a wide margin during that period. Take grain output for 
example: The figure rose from 300 billion kg in 1978 to 400 
billion kg in 1984, an increase of 100 billion kg in six years. 
Before rural reform, it took 20 years to get an additional 100 
billion kg of grain. After 1985, however, the peasants' income 
did not increase despite the increase in output, or the output 
increased remarkably but their income increased slightly. In 
the eight years from 1985 to 1993, the peasants' incomes 
increased by an annual rate of only 2 percent. Income fell 
behind production growth. As a result, the annual growth target 
of 5.4 percent required for attaining the comparatively well-off 
goal was out of reach. 
  The main reason for the problem is the irrational price 
relationship between farm and manufactured goods and the low 
economic efficiency of agriculture. On the one hand, the price 
of farm produce, driven by overall price hikes, rose. But the 
extent was still lower than the increase in the price of means 
of production. In other words, the price of products was lower 
than the price of materials and cost, resulting in high input 
but low efficiency. On the other hand, the increase in the 
price of farm produce was far lower than that in manufactured 
goods which used farm produce as materials. As agricultural 
production could not share the average social profits, 
agriculture, which is a basic industry, was thrown into an 
unfavorable position. As a consequence, income from 
agriculture, which constituted 70 to 80 percent of the source of 
peasants' average per capita income, rose at a slow pace, and 
even dropped in some regions. 
  The problems caused by the drop in peasants' income were 
serious: First, the market for rural consumer goods remained 
weak, growth dropped, and consumer goods bought by rural 
inhabitants, who accounted for over 80 percent of the country's 
total population, accounted for 40 percent of total retail 
sales. Second, the input in agriculture decreased. In some 
economically developed regions, the tendency of neglecting 
agriculture was more obvious, the amount of cultivated land and 
sown area of grain decreased while large amount of agricultural 
funds flowed nonagricultural fields. Third, because of the 
irrational prices, the peasants are not enthusiastic to sell 
farm produce to the state. Some are waiting for better prices. 
As a result, the amount of major farm produce including grain, 
cotton, and edible oil possessed by the state decreased, which 
affected its capacity for macroeconomic regulation and control. 
Fourth, the low income of the peasants added difficulties to 
the development of rural social welfare undertakings. As the 
income of most of the peasants is not high and the growth in 
their income has decreased instead of increasing, it will be 
impossible to transform the outlook of the rural areas. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphatically pointed out on numerous 
occasions: "Without rural stability, there will be no stability 
in the overall political situation. If the peasants have not 
extricated themselves from poverty, it means that our country 
has not extricated itself from poverty." "Without the 
enthusiasm of the peasants, it will be difficult for the state 
to develop." Hence, we should look at the peasants' incomes 
from the high plane of social stability, political stability, 
and coordinated development of the national economy as a whole. 
In light of the requirements of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Central Rural Work 
Conference, and the National Agricultural Work Conference, it is 
necessary to stabilize the party's basic policies in the rural 
areas, further deepen rural reform, appropriately settle the 
outstanding problems arising from rural economic development, 
and try by every means to increase the peasants' income. 
  To increase the peasants' income, it is necessary to first 
focus attention on developing production. While ensuring the 
sown area of grain, cotton, and edible oil, we should vigorously 
readjust agricultural production and product mix, develop 
quality, high-yield, and efficient agriculture. Of the growth 
in peasants' income last year, over 30 percent derived from 
township enterprises. This is an important source for increasing 
the peasants' income, which should be firmly grasped. Second, 
it is necessary to gradually readjust the purchase price of farm 
produce and reduce the price scissors between industrial and 
farm products. To stabilize consumption by the inhabitants, it 
is necessary to establish a risk fund and adopt other measures 
to curb price hikes and prevent a price spiral. Third, to 
increase input in agriculture, the state should readjust the 
investment in capital construction, budgetary funds, and credit, 
increase the proportion of investment in agriculture, and 
support agricultural development. Fourth, the circulation for 
farm produce should be unclogged and the rural market should be 
invigorated. The peasants should be organized to enter the 
market, develop production-supply-marketing and trade- 
industry-agriculture integrated organizations, and reduce the 
loss in profits from the intermediate links. Fifth, to increase 
the peasants' incomes, further efforts should be made to 
alleviate the peasants' burden. In places where the peasants' 
burden is lightened and the unreasonable charges are removed, 
these practices should not be allowed to reoccur under any 
excuse. At the same time, it is necessary to implement the 
"help-the-poor scheme" and do well the work of helping the poor. 
  The question of agriculture, rural areas, and peasants has 
always been a fundamental one in China's revolution and 
construction. It is an economic, as well as a political task, 
to try by every means to increase the peasants' incomes. From 
the strategic high plane of rural and social stability and 
promoting the rural economy and sustained, rapid, and healthy 
growth of the national economy, we should seriously do the work 
well so that the peasants' incomes will increase along with 
economic growth and the 900 million peasants will be able to 
attain the comparatively well-off goal at an early date.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (CNS) -- Answering questions by 
journalists at a press conference today, spokesman for China's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mr. Wu Jianmin said that the only 
correct solution to the nuclear inspection issue in North Korea 
was dialogue between the sides involved. China, he added, hoped 
that the issue would not go to the UN Security Council. 
  While some difficulties had appeared in talks on this issue, 
all the parties concerned should show patience and adopt a 
constructive attitude and dialogue should be continued on a 
basis of equality. Neither side should pressure the other as 
this only aggravated the situation and would not help solve the 
problem. 
  The maintenance of peace and stability in the Korean 
peninsula was in conformity with the interests of the Korean 
people and those of the other parties concerned. China would 
not agree to any actions including military manoevres which 
would harm peace and stability there. 
  China's consistent position, he said, was to hope for a 
relaxation of the situation and stability in the Korean 
peninsula. China was for the peninsula to be a nonnuclear region 
and the solving of the nuclear inspection issue through 
dialogue. China had, he added, made every effort for the 
solution of this issue according to the above principles, but 
its role was limited.

strengthening of the science links between China and Australia 
will be beneficial to the economic development of not only the 
two countries themselves but also the Asia Pacific region. 
  During the meeting, Deng briefed Keating on China's plan of 
science and technology development in the 21st century, in which 
Keating expressed his interest.

  The two-member group, headed by President of the Iraqi 
General Federation of Trade Unions Fadhil Mahmoud Gharib, 
arrived here on March 23 at the invitation of ACFTU.

  [Text] Geneva, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The working party on 
China of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) began 
its 16th meeting here today to continue deliberation on resuming 
China's signatory status of the GATT. 
  The four-day meeting is being attended by a Chinese 
delegation led by Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, Gu Yongjiang, and Deputy Minister in Charge of the 
State Commission for Economy and Trade, Yu Xiaosong. 
  Establishing a world trade organization was one of the 
important achievements at GATT's Uruguay Round of talks, which 
concluded last December and in which China participated. 
  Deputy Minister Gu said the meeting of the working party, 
held after the Uruguay Round, has lent new meaning to China's 
reentry into GATT, which would make the country one of the 
founding members of the future trade organization. 
  Under the Uruguay Round agreement, the new organization is 
to 
be established by July, 1995. 
  However, many countries are now asking that this date be 
moved up to next January. 
  Gu said that conditions for Chinese membership in the world 
trade organization have now matured after 15 years of efforts in 
the reform towards a market economy, and the standardization of 
China's foreign trade system in accordance with GATT 
requirements. 
  Delaying China's return to GATT will mean delays in carrying 
out China's commitments made in the Uruguay round, and will not 
help the contracting parties to make use of the opportunities 
offered by China's economic growth, said Gu. 
  He added that any delay would also take away the confidence 
that the Chinese business circle has in GATT. 
  In his speech, Gu gave a detailed report on China's reform 
measures taken since late last year, especially those on the 
regulation system for foreign exchange. 
  Meanwhile, Yu Xiaosong briefed the representatives in detail 
on the measures adopted or soon to be adopted by China in 
reforming its import regulation system, lowering tariffs, and 
reducing non-tariff obstructions. 
  At the meeting this morning, representatives from countries 
including the United States, Japan, and the European Union (EU) 
welcomed China's reform in foreign exchange regulation. 
  The EU representative, praising the reform as "encouraging," 
said that the EU hoped to conclude the working party on China 
with a decision to allow it to soon reenter GATT. 
  Japan, Uruguay and the Nordic countries all expressed the 
same hopes.

  [Text] Xiamen, March 23 (CNS) -- The powers of legislation 
authorized by the second session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress (NPC) to the Xiamen People's Congress and its Standing 
Committee as well as to the Xiamen municipal government for 
enactment of laws and regulations will be beneficial for the 
speeding up of utilization of foreign and Taiwan capital in the 
special economic zone, the Director of the Xiamen Foreign 
Investment Commission Mr Huang Qingquan said today. 
  Xiamen has, since reform and opening to the outside world 
began 14 years ago, approved 2,400 foreign-funded items with a 
total value of US$7 billion. Some 1,000 of the items were 
invested by Taiwan businessmen involving US$2 billion while the 
industrial output value of three-type foreign-funded enterprises 
made up 61.2 percent of the total in the municipality. 
  With the scale of foreign capital introduced into Xiamen 
growing rapidly, matters related to laws and regulations 
emerging from economic activities, especially the investment 
process, are tending to increase. The current laws and 
regulations can no longer meet the needs of the adminstration of 
foreign investment. Laws and regulations on bankruptcy, 
settlement, notes, banking and mortgages have not yet come into 
effect, resulting in an adverse impact on the administration of 
enterprises and imposing direct obstacles to foreign investment. 
  Mr Huang pointed out that with economic exchange and trade 
between Xiamen and Taiwan growing continuously, Taiwan 
businessmen hope for the availability of a corresponding legal 
environment to meet their business development. With regard to 
laws and regulations involving Taiwan, much time is needed to 
make legislation possible in the national legislature. The 
setting-up of Taiwan-funded enterprises, settlement of disputes 
and administration of these enterprises have long been had no 
specific laws and regulations to govern them, causing many 
difficulties to Taiwan- funded enterprises. 
  Mr Huang believes that the authorization of legislation 
given 
to Xiamen by the current NPC session will enable the 
municipality to work out proper corresponding laws and 
regulations of its own to meet the needs based on observation of 
the Constitution and other relevant laws and regulations. 
Backwardness in legislation seen in Xiamen can be improved 
gradually and the municipality can move forward in promoting the 
use of foreign and Taiwan capital.

  [Text] Yesterday morning, State Councillor Chen Junsheng 
stressed in a full meeting of the Guangdong delegation that 
Guangdong must concentrate its efforts on the issue of grain to 
ensure the acreage producing grain, increase grain output, and 
raise the self-support level of grain to guarantee the 
settlement of the issue of feeding Guangdong's people. 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: The key to stabilizing grain 
production and increasing the self-support level of grain lies 
in stabilizing the acreage under grain. He said: Now there are 
too many development zones, and they have occupied a lot of good 
farmland. If the situation remains unchanged, grain output will 
drop. This situation must be changed very rapidly.

10,000 yuan for the first time, reaching 11,490 yuan. It has 
ranked first among 10 major cities in the country for two years 
running. 
  Last year was another year in which Guangzou city took big 
strides in its economic construction, reform, and opening up. 
The majority of its main economic indexes registered 
double-digit increases. Last year, the GDP of the whole 
province reached 71.1 billion yuan, up 23 percent over 1992. 
Over the past three years, its per capital GDP also maintained 
a double-digit increase, and its annual average growth rate was 
20.89 percent, exceeding the former target of 11.8 percent 
annual average growth set to meet the demand of basically 
realizing modernizations in 15 years. Such a growth rate has 
been rare in the Asian region.

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- The Municipal 
Government of Tianjin, a major port city in North China, has 
pledged to speed up the tapping of its rich geothermal power 
resources. 
  According to the "China Geology and Mineral Resources News", 
the city has designated 10 geothermal power resource zone, with 
a total area of 8,700 sq km, accounting for 80 percent of the 
city's total territory. 
  The professional paper noted that the quantity of heat 
available is equivalent to that generated by 18 billion tons of 
standard coal. 
  Wang Hengzhou, head of the Tianjin Municipal Geothermal 
Administration, said the water temperature of the geothermal 
power deposits is as high as 98 degrees centigrade. 
  Thermal energy is used widely in the fields of light 
industry, textiles, chemicals, paper-making, food processing, 
agriculture, aquatic production, medicine, heating facilities 
and tourism.

  [Text] The Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] will 
begin their fourth round of follow-up routine negotiations 
tomorrow [25 March], which will last six days. Hsu Hui-you, SEF 
deputy secretary and Taiwan's major negotiator, and his party 
left for Beijing today. The Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] 
under the Executive Yuan yesterday formally authorized SEF 
negotiators to hold negotiations with the ARATS on repatriation 
of hijackers, fishery disputes, and repatriation of stowaways. 
After agreements on the abovementioned three issues have been 
reached, the two sides may exchange views or hold practical 
talks on other topics prescribed in the agreement reached in the 
Ku-Wang talks, on protection of Taiwan investors in the 
Mainland, and on other relevant economic and science and 
technology issues. The following is a report by He Chien-min: 
  [Begin recording] Beginning tomorrow, the SEF and the ARATS 
will hold the fourth round of routine negotiations in Beijing. 
MAC Chairman Huang Kun-hui held a news conference and issued a 
carefully-worded oral statement today, saying that there is 
still a long way to go to sign an agreement based on the oral 
consensus achieved in the Chiao-Tang talks. It is clear from 
the way he talked that he is not optimistic about these 
negotiations. 
  [Huang Kun-hui] You know we have already put the oral 
agreement down in black and white at previous formal talks, 
however, they called it off at the last minute. That is what 
happened. We did not cancel it. The point is that we need to 
communicate with each other and understand each other's views by 
means of talking. After coming back, we continued to work on the 
agreement and ask departments concerned to do their best to help 
us. Because our government is a democratic one whose work is 
shared and coordinated by various government departments, many 
departments are involved in drawing up this agreement. This 
shows our sincerity in reaching an agreement with the ARATS. 
  [He Chien-min] Chairman Huang emphasized that the first 
thing we should take into consideration while turning oral 
consensuses into a written agreement is the feasibility of its 
implementation. It is reported that the MAC has made a thorough 
evaluation of the consensus on the abovementioned three issues. 
The MAC and relevant ministries and commissions have expressed 
some opinions that articles concerning fishery disputes are not 
applicable to disputes involving official boats, and articles 
concerning the repatriation of hijackers are not applicable to 
criminal offenders. These opinions will have an unpredictable 
influence on this round of negotiations. 
  This has been a report by China Broadcasting Network 
Corporation reporter He Chien-min from the Mainland Affairs 
Council. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A new political row has blown up between China and 
Hong Kong -- this time over plans to dump sewage in Zhuhai 
waters. China said the Government had acted irresponsibly and 
had misled the public over the $12 billion sewage treatment 
project. It said the project should not have been given the 
go-ahead without consultation with the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG). 
  A Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office official said, if it 
went ahead, the urgent task of solving the territory's worsening 
water pollution would run into trouble. "We have already 
demanded the issue be discussed at the coming JLG full meeting," 
he said. 
  "The British side said they can go ahead with phase one of 
the project that will be completed before 1997 and will only 
discuss with us the second phase that straddles 1997. 
  "But does that make sense? The project cannot be cut in two. 
It should be considered as a whole." 
  "We are not trying to block the project. We do want 
immediately to do something to stop further pollution of the 
waters in Victoria Harbour. The worsening pollution has not 
only caused red tide in Hong Kong but also poisoned aquatic 
products in the Pearl River Delta region," he said. "Government 
officials were misleading the public when they said we had no 
dissenting views on the project," the official said. Rather, he 
said, the Chinese were surprised by the decision of the 
Government to launch the project with the recent award of a 
contract involving hundreds of millions of dollars. 
  The Government said yesterday that China had not been 
formally consulted on the project because a preliminary survey 
was being carried out with the help of mainland authorities to 
see whether the project was technically feasible and 
environmentally acceptable. "We are not yet in a position to 
apply to the Chinese side for construction of the second phase 
of the project," said Principal Assistant Secretary for 
Environment Chang King-yiu. 
  If the Government could confirm that there were good grounds 
to go ahead with phase two of the project, it would officially 
apply to the Chinese side to conduct a joint environmental 
impact study. Under the strategic sewage disposal scheme, the 
Government expected the facility to extend beyond the southern 
side of Hong Kong waters. "The final alignment has yet to be 
decided," she said. 
  According to the mainland official, the project envisaged a 
huge marine underwater pipeline with a total length of dozens of 
kilometres to be built linking Stonecutters Island with 
Tangangdao in Zhuhai. At least several hundreds of tonnes of 
sewage would be discharged into the waters off the Tangangdao. 
"Some people in Hong Kong have already criticised that as an 
unethical project. Discharging the sewage water in your 
neighbours' place is simply unreasonable," he said. According 
to international law, a government wanting to build a pipeline 
in another country's waters has to seek that country's consent. 
  The official said the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office has 
organised a team of researchers to examine the issue including 
the hydrology of the Pearl River Delta. Some basic studies on 
the treatment of sewage in the territory have already been 
completed, he said. The official claimed that the Chinese 
Government proposed in August last year the issue of conducting 
a detailed feasibility study on the sewage project and the 
corresponding assessment on its environmental impact be put on 
the agenda of the JLG. He said the British side agreed to do so 
only early this month, but soon granted contracts for the 
project.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Chinese authorities have hinted that Bao Tong, a 
political reformer who once served as an aide to ousted 
Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, could be eligible for 
release from jail on medical grounds, according to John Kamm, a 
human rights campaigner based in Hong Kong. Mr Kamm, who met 
senior officials from the judiciary and other departments this 
week, said the authorities now acknowledged that Bao, who has 
served nearly five years of a seven-year sentence, was ill, 
though they insist his life is not threatened. 
  Formerly, officials did not admit that Bao, 60, was sick, 
despite reports that his health had suffered after his arrest on 
May 28, 1989. By conceding that Bao is ill, the authorities are 
opening the possibility of an early release from jail on medical 
grounds. 
  The officials said Bao was being given special nourishment 
and medical treatment, but there was no suggestion that Bao's 
condition was stabilising under the care of the prison doctor. 
The authorities made their remarks in the context of a 
discussion on the possibility of prisoners being released on 
medical parole. When asked point-blank whether Bao would be 
released, the officials refused to answer directly. 
  "What I'm hoping is that if we can highlight the fact they 
acknowledge he's sick, we can perhaps increase the pressure for 
some sort of parole," Mr Kamm said. "They're telling us they're 
considering releasing people, and that Bao Tong is ill. They 
say he's getting special treatment. They are not saying that he 
has stabilised. If anyone is qualified for parole, he is 
qualified," he said. 
  Bao's son Bao Pu, who has been studying in the United 
States, 
said he saw his father for the first time in more than four 
years on February 17, and again visited him in the Qincheng 
prison about two weeks ago. "I was shocked," said Mr Bao. "His 
face was puffy and swollen." He said his father was wearing a 
padded blue jacket that had not been washed in years. 
  Bao, convicted of "leaking state secrets" and of 
counter-revolutionary activity in early 1989, is being kept in 
solitary confinement. Though his cell faces south, there is no 
window. His cell provides him with enough room to practise 
taijiquan [traditional Chinese shadow boxing]. He is allowed to 
shower once a week and is also permitted to watch television at 
certain hours. 
  Since entering Qincheng, Bao has had 17 polyps removed in 
six 
separate operations. The authorities say the polyps have so far 
been benign. His white blood cell count is well below normal 
and he has thyroid tumours and suffers from salivary gland 
atrophy. "He was fine, in spirit, and still as sharp as I 
remember," Mr Bao said of his father. He added that on his 
second visit, his father appeared to be a bit better, though his 
face was still swollen.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Mammoth projects are 
under construction in southwest China to convert its rich 
hydropower resources into electric power for its own use and for 
the energy-hungry east China. 
  As a result, southwest China is soon to become China's 
premier hydroelectric power base, according to deputies to the 
National People's Congress [NPC] now in session here who hail 
from southwest China's Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces and 
Guangxi Autonomous Region. 
  Sixty-five giant hydropower stations will form "electric 
corridors" along the region's main rivers of Jinshajiang, 
Yalongjiang, Daduhe, Lanchangjiang, Wujiang and Hongshuihe. 
Their power will be fed to a local grid, which in turn will 
transmit power to Guangdong in south China and to east China. 
  Southwest China has exploitable hydropower resources of 194 
million kw, 572000060100f the national total. 
  According to Wang Zhaobang, an NPC deputy from Guangxi and a 
hydropower expert, 11 power stations have been completed or are 
under construction in southwest China, which will generate 51.9 
billion kwh [kilowatt-hours] of electricity a year. 
  Another seven giant stations will be built in the area 
during 
the last five years of this century, he disclosed. Those 
stations will have a combined generating capacity of 20 million 
kw. 
  When all the 65 hydropower stations are completed, they will 
generate 631 billion kwh of electricity a year. 
  One newly-completed station in Guangxi has already started 
supplying power to Guangdong Province, according to He Rong, an 
NPC deputy from Guangxi. 
  "This marks the start of implementing a state plan to 
transmit power from southwest China to east China," he said. 
  Local electric power authorities have opened the door to 
overseas investment in hydropower development. The three 
provinces and one autonomous region have signed a dozen 
contracts with companies from the United States, Thailand and 
Hong Kong on the construction of hydropower stations and power 
grids. They have also received over one billion U.S. dollars in 
loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, 
according to the deputies.

  [Text] Beijing, March 24 (XINHUA) -- The State Council has 
formed two inspection teams, which are expected to be sent soon 
to conduct investigations around China into prices and 
investments in fixed assets. 
  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua reminded the teams today that 
although China's economy has been growing at a rapid speed, 
price rises and high-pressure inflation have arisen as two big 
problems in the country's current economic outlook. 
  "The urgent task is to find a quick solution to the problems 
of a large expansion of investment in fixed assets and a 
relatively backward management system over investments and 
prices, which are the key factors leading to inflation and price 
rises," he said. 
  Timely completion of the inspection work will be helpful 
toward implementing policies the central government has drawn up 
for this year's overall work in 1994 and toward the fulfillment 
of tasks set for 1994 in terms of reform, opening and economic 
development, he said. 
  The price inspections will mark random charges on daily 
necessities like food and cooking oil and extortionary, 
unauthorized price rises which take advantage of market 
monopolies on important productive raw materials such as rolled 
steel, electricity, coal, petroleum and chemical fertilizer, and 
unauthorized extra charges on services. 
  The inspection of investments in fixed assets will focus on 
newly-started projects. The team will make clear the source of 
investment and the extent of funding for national key projects, 
see to the stoppage of some projects that must be suspended or 
stopped, and tend to other matters. 
  The vice-premier called on the members of the inspection 
team 
to make thorough-going investigations and study and report on 
the situation as it is. Moreover, he added, they must also 
abide by laws and regulations and be clean and honest themselves 
in performing their duties. 
  Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning 
Commission, has been appointed head of the price inspection 
team, which is composed of executives concerned with state 
planning, supervision, finance, banking, taxation, auditing, 
industry and commerce and technological supervision. 
  Chen will also head the other team concerning the inspection 
of investment in fixed assets. Its members are drawn from 
departments of the State Planning Commission, the State Economy 
and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank 
of China, the Ministry of Supervision, the State Development 
Bank and the State Statistics Bureau.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Staunching Red Ink an Uphill Fight"] </F>
  [Text] With investment expanding and inflationary 
pressures growing, these are hard times for China to trim its 
budget deficit. 
  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli describes averting a budget 
crunch this year as an uphill battle. 
  Liu puts the fiscal 1994 deficit at 66.919 billion yuan 
($7.69 billion ). 
  If repayment of domestic and foreign debts of 48.081 billion 
yuan ($5.53 billion) and international loans for State key 
projects of 14.245 billion yuan ($1.64 billion) are added, China 
faces a total debt of 129.245 billion yuan ($14.85 billion), 
which is 3.8 per cent of its gross domestic product. 
  This proportion is slightly higher than last year's. 
  Economists have predicted that China's debt is unlikely to 
shrink in the next couple of years. 
  It is especially true since the government must finance a 
large number of infrastructure projects and subsidize teetering 
State enterprises. 
  But the finance minister has masterminded a strategy that 
may 
prevent the debt burden from choking the economic development. 
  "Basically we will follow a two- pronged policy this year to 
control debt," Liu said. 
  One is to put a brake on investment in fixed assets, 
especially real estate. 
  Officials fear that unchecked spending in this sector will 
lead to drastic price hikes for basic construction materials 
such as steel. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has repeatedly cautioned that the 
real estate boom absorbing vast sums of money, is likely to turn 
into a bust, as it did in Japan when the bubble economy burst. 
  Incomplete figures show that about a quarter of last year's 
foreign investment in China ended up in real estate, which does 
not augur well for the economy as it passes through the fragile 
transition from central planning to regulation by market forces. 
  Last year, the real estate boom was largely fueled by local 
governments for local interests. 
  Economists believe this freewheeling spending will end this 
year, since the central government has forbidden local 
governments from incurring budget deficits. The country's first 
budget law, which is expected to come out soon, will stipulate 
that only the central government can have a budget deficit. 
  Despite protests from some regions, the central government 
will proceed with the new law. 
  With more revenue in hand, the central government will be 
able to cut back investment in low-priority projects and 
concentrate on the key ones, such as power stations, railways, 
telecommunications, electronics and agricultural development. 
  Another trump card for containing the deficit is the 
implementation of the tax-sharing system, which apportions 
revenues from the central and local governments. 
  Under this system the central government can pool more money 
and effectively stop the haemorrhage in taxes, which in recent 
years has been condoned by local authorities. 
  The central government will collect some 70 per cent of the 
new tax income of local governments on the basis of the 1993 
level. 
  "But," Liu explained, "this will be a long and gradual 
process." 
  He said the new tax system will not dampen the boom in local 
economies because local governments will be allowed a share of 
the revenue from the value-added tax. 
  Moreover, the central government has decided to let a number 
of inefficient State-owned enterprises go bankrupt this year, 
thus relieving itself of another heavy financial burden. 
  And the State has planned to streamline subsidies to the 
grain sectors by setting up a new purchase and sales system. 
The details are expected to be available soon. 
  But the central government will lose about 30 billion yuan 
($3.45 billion) this year after canceling certain special taxes 
on the State-run enterprises.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Enthusiastically Buy State </F>
Treasury Bonds"] 
  [Text] Beginning 1 April, the state will openly issue 
two-year and three-year state treasury bonds to the general 
public. This is an effective means of supporting reform and 
solving financial problems, and is also an important matter 
concerning this year's overall situation of our work in all 
fields. 
  Issuing national debts to raise funds for national 
construction in a compensatory form is the method that has been 
used for many years in our country since the beginning of reform 
and opening, and this method plays an important role in 
balancing the state's financial budget, supporting reform and 
opening, supporting key construction projects in the national 
economy, and improving the people's livelihood. 
  This year, the issuance of state treasury bonds is of 
greater 
immediate and profound far-reaching significance. As Premier Li 
Peng pointed out in his government work report, the general 
tasks for the whole party and the whole nation are to grasp the 
opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening, promote development, 
and maintain stability. In order to support the fulfillment of 
these general tasks, support reform in various fields this year, 
increase workers' wage income, and support agriculture, science 
and technology, and capital construction at some key points, the 
central government must provide sufficient financial guarantees. 
This will result in increasing expenditures and reducing 
financial revenues in state finances to a certain degree. Thus, 
the financial deficit may become a bit larger. In order to 
strengthen budgetary management and control, beginning this 
year, deficits in central finances will not be made up for by 
means of bank overdrafts in order to prevent the aggravation of 
inflation caused by the deficit-led currency issuance. 
Therefore, in addition to measures for increasing revenue and 
reducing expenditures, the financial deficit of the central 
government will have to be covered by means of issuing 
government bonds. People's active purchase of state treasury 
bonds will be their concrete action of supporting reform and 
opening and supporting key state construction projects. 
  Through purchase of state treasury bonds, part of the 
consumption funds and idle money scattered in society may be 
turned into state's construction funds and used to guarantee key 
state construction projects and economic development. In fact, 
this is structural redistribution of financial resources in 
society. Such practice not only solves financial insufficiency, 
but also prevents excessive increase in the money supply. It 
gives correct guidance to the flow of funds in society, and also 
helps increase the lasting momentum of national economic 
development and mitigates inflation pressure. The people may 
also benefit from such results. Therefore, purchasing state 
treasury bonds is a good thing beneficial to the state and the 
people. 
  In recent years, with the gradual establishment of the 
market 
for government bonds, a favorable tendency to take an active 
part in trading and purchasing state treasury bonds has appeared 
among the masses. People have paid more attention to making 
financial investments, mainly through purchasing state treasury 
bonds. Government bonds not only play a role in raising 
construction funds for the state, but have also become a major 
means of saving and investment. 
  This year, consideration was also given to the personal 
interest of bond purchasers when arrangements were made for the 
issuance of state treasury bonds, and more sales points were set 
up so that purchasers would find it easier to buy the bonds. 
Various specialized banks and post savings offices have set up 
tens of thousands of bond selling points. Securities companies, 
government bond service centers, and the securities departments 
of trust and investment companies also are involved in selling 
state treasury bonds. All relevant sales points should act 
positively and adopt various measures to make things more 
convenient for investors. The masses should be able to feel 
that investing in state treasury bonds will bring stable returns 
to them, and should also be able to feel that it is convenient 
to purchase and resell the bonds. 
  We believe that with the full understanding and great 
support 
of the people throughout the country, with the leadership of the 
people's governments at all levels, and with the joint efforts 
of the institutions involved in the process, the task of issuing 
state treasury bonds this year will certainly be fulfilled.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Economy Up, But Inflation Bolts"] </F>
  [Text] China's economy continued to be brisk during the 
first two months of this year, the State Statistics Bureau said 
yesterday. 
  But swelling inflation and the ballooning investment of 
fixed 
assets continued to pose a threat to sound economic development 
this year, the bureau said in its latest report. 
  Driven by the buoyant domestic market, the country's 
industrial production grew 18.2 per cent during the first two 
months of this year. 
  Inflation, however, was 20 percent during January and 
February, squeezjng domestic industries. 
  And despite the double digit growth, State-run factories 
grew 
only 1.2 percent during the period, the report said. 
  State-owned enterprises have lost money this year due to 
skyrocketing production costs and the erratic market. 
  And despite the central government's call for strict control 
over investment in the fixed assets sector, money invested by 
State units in projects has grown vigorously this year. 
  The bureau's figures showed that State unit investment in 
new 
projects rose 77.5 percent during January and February. 
  The bureau's economists called for the government to 
immediately bring inflation and fixed-assets investment to 
acceptable levels. 
  One of the government's major macrocontrol measures has been 
to ensure that market demand does not outstrip supply, they said. 
  But the report said that during the first two months of this 
year, the banks' net money supply to the domestic market 
increased by 13.7 billion yuan ($159 million) over the same 
period last year. 
  This was mainly due to the salaries rise for State workers 
at 
the start of the year. 
  The report also said that rapidly growing industrial 
production, runaway fixed asset investment, high inflation and 
rising personal incomes contributed to the strong economy during 
January and February. 
  Gross retail sales hit 235.5 billion yuan ($27.4 billion) 
during the period, an increase of 25.9 percent over the same two 
months last year. 
  But the real annual growth of retail sales, after taking 
inflation into account, was only 5 percent.

  [Text] Paris, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Zhu Qizhen, head of the 
Chinese delegation attending the 91th session of the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union here, stressed today that China 
strongly opposes any interference in its internal affairs under 
any pretext. 
  He was referring to the issue of human rights and added that 
China will hold dialogue about any of these issues on an equal 
footing with any other nation. 
  At a general debate about the political, economic and social 
situation of the world, Zhu said that any statement or action 
which interferes in another country's internal affairs should be 
condemned. 
  He pointed out that the Chinese Government has advocated on 
many occasions the establishment of a just and reasonable new 
international political and economic order with peace and 
stability. "Such an order is based on the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence and recognition of the diversity of the 
world's nations," he added. 
  He said China maintains that in the new international 
political order, countries should respect one another, cooperate 
on an equal footing, oppose hegemonism and power politics, 
settle their problems through peaceful negotiation, dialogue and 
consultation and refrain from the use or threat of use of force. 
  Zhu said with the world ushering in a transition towards 
multipolarity, conflicts and problems hidden in the previous 
bipolar structure have become aggravated and hegemonism and 
power politics in international relations are on the increase. 
  He warned that the world is still turbulent and beset with 
many destabilizing factors. 
  Zhu stated that China maintains that all countries, big or 
small, rich or poor, should respect one another, participate in 
handling international economic affairs as equal members of the 
international community and develop their economic relations and 
trade in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual 
benefit. 
  He also said China will never seek hegemonism or become a 
super power and it does not, and will not, station a single 
soldier in any other country, adding that China will be a 
lasting force in keeping world peace instead of posing a threat 
to other countries. 
  Zhu stressed that no matter what changes take place in the 
world, China will adhere to its current foreign policy and 
continue to develop friendly cooperation with other countries on 
the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. 
  The meeting, which began on March 21 and is scheduled to end 
on Saturday, focuses on preventing conflicts, peace-keeping, 
protecting the international environment and the international 
political, economic and social situation.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Youhao (1728 2589 3185)] </F>
  [Text] Paris, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Zhu Qizhen, head of the 
Chinese delegation attending the 91th Session of the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union [IPU] in Paris and also a vice 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Standing 
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, spoke today 
at a general debate of the session on the world's political, 
economic, and social situation. He emphatically pointed out: 
"China will hold dialogues about human rights on an equal 
footing; however, China strongly opposes any country's 
interference in other country's internal affairs under the 
pretext of human rights. Any pressure on other countries under 
the pretext of human rights and any statement or action which 
interferes in another country's internal affairs should be 
condemned." 
  Zhu Qizhen pointed out: "The Chinese Government has 
advocated 
on many occasions the establishment of a just and reasonable new 
international political and economic order with peace and 
stability on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence and of the recognition of the diversity of the world 
and differences among various countries." 
  He said: The world is still turbulent and changeable, beset 
with many destabilizing factors, and is not peaceful. The peace 
and development so cherished by mankind face a serious challenge. 
  Touching on the establishment of a new international 
economic 
order, Zhu Qizhen pointed out: All countries have the right to 
independently choose their own social system, economic mode, and 
ways of development according to their own national situation. 
The developed countries should respect and show concern for the 
interests of developing countries, provide aid to developing 
countries without adding political conditions, strengthen 
dialogues between the North and South, and promote South-South 
Cooperation. 
  Zhu Qizhen briefly introduced China's great achievements 
over 
the past 15 years since the start of reform and opening up. He 
then said: "China is still a developing country with a low 
income. To develop into a mid-level developed country, it will 
require unremitting efforts for several generations. It is 
highly absurd for some people to consider China's economic 
development as a kind of `threat' and to disseminate the 
so-called `China threat.'" 
  When he finished his speech, the audience warmly applauded. 
Delegates from a number of countries came forward to shake hands 
with him and expressed their admiration and congratulations for 
his speech. 
  The current session opened on 21 March and is expected to 
end 
on 26 March.

  [Text] Paris, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Parliamentarians from 
111 countries endorsed a string of resolutions during the 91st 
meeting of the Interparliamentary Union [IPU] here. 
  The 560 representatives passed a plan to remove cultural and 
religious obstacles barring women from participating in politics 
and encouraged women's participation in legislation and 
policy-making. 
  The six-day meeting which ended Saturday also produced a 
declaration providing standards for free and fair elections. 
Such standards, the first the international community has ever 
defined, would serve as a basis for any national election and a 
guide for international observers. 
  The parliamentarians also called on the international 
community to review the structure of the United Nations to give 
it a wider world role and more power to prevent conflicts. 
  The meeting also urged all nations to commit to the cause of 
environmental preservation and the tightening of controls on 
hazardous waste. 
  They also urged efforts toward the overall prohibition of 
the 
production of fissionable materials and nuclear testing. 
  Burundi, Macedonia, the Comoros, Zaire and the Central 
African Republic became members of the Interparliamentary Union, 
enlarging its membership to 129 nations. 
  The next session will be held in Copenhagen this September 
12-17.

  [Text] Geneva, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the floor of the 
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva today, Hou Zhitong, head of 
the Chinese delegation, reiterated the Chinese Government's 
stand and views on nuclear disarmament, nuclear test ban, and 
other issues. 
  Hou Zhitong pointed out: China has never shirked its 
responsibility for promoting nuclear disarmament. China has 
always stood for the complete prohibition and thorough 
destruction of nuclear weapons. Since the first day when it came 
into possession of nuclear weapons, the Chinese Government has 
solemnly declared to the world its commitment of not being the 
first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any 
circumstances. It has also undertaken not to use nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-free zones. 
  He said: In order to promote the process of nuclear 
disarmament and realize the goal of preventing nuclear war, the 
Chinese Government has recently taken further initiatives. On 
December 23 last year, the Chinese Government formally proposed 
to the United States, the Russian Federation, and other nuclear 
weapon states that negotiations be started among the five 
nuclear weapon states to conclude a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use 
of Nuclear Weapons." In early March this year, China again 
urged the four other nuclear states to give a positive response 
to China's initiative, and asked them to send delegations for 
talks in Beijing. It is the view of the Chinese Government that 
under the present international situation, the condition is ripe 
for the five nuclear weapon states to negotiate and conclude 
such an international treaty. The Chinese Government believes 
the conclusion of this treaty will significantly reduce the risk 
of nuclear war and provide security to the five nuclear weapon 
states, especially the small and medium-sized ones among them. 
It will also improve mutual trust and contribute to the 
prevention of nuclear proliferation. Such a treaty will also 
play an important role in realizing a comprehensive nuclear test 
ban and promoting nuclear disarmament. 
  Hou Zhitong expressed the hope that countries concerned will 
respond positively to China's initiative and start negotiations 
with a view to concluding a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use of 
Nuclear Weapons" as soon as possible. After that, they should 
go one step further by negotiating and concluding an 
international treaty on not using or threatening to use nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free 
zones, so as to make a decisive contribution to freeing mankind 
from the threat of nuclear war. 
  On the issue of a nuclear test moratorium, Hou Zhitong said: 
China has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear testing 
and the number of the nuclear tests it has conducted is 
extremely limited. China has the lowest number of nuclear tests 
among all nuclear powers. China believes that an early 
conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty [CTBT] will 
contribute to the realization of the objective of complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. In 
view of the above-mentioned considerations, the Chinese 
Government issued a statement on 5 October last year in support 
of an early conclusion of a CTBT, saying it will join other 
countries in the negotiations in an effort to conclude such a 
treaty no later than 1996. 
  Hou Zhitong pointed out: It is our opinion that an 
appropriate solution of the issue of security guarantees to the 
signatory states ought to be one of the tasks in the CTBT 
negotiation. The treaty should contain provisions for the 
signatory states with nuclear weapons to undertake not to use or 
threaten to use nuclear weapons against signatory states which 
do not possess nuclear weapons. At the same time, it should 
also provide for the signatory states with nuclear weapons to 
undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against 
each other. With all nuclear weapon states undertaking the 
above-mentioned obligations, it will add to the substance of the 
CTBT, further the treaty's universality, and constitute a major 
contribution to international peace and security.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng met 
with Lawrence Weinbach, chief executive of Arthur Andersen &amp; 
Co. 
SC of the United States, here this afternoon. 
  Founded in 1913, the Chicago-based Arthur Andersen Company 
is 
one of the six accounting and consulting giants in the world, 
whose services span the globe. 
  The Chinese premier voiced appreciation for the company's 
vital China business activities in the past 15 years. 
  China's economy is growing rapidly and there is great 
potential for it to expand foreign economic and trade 
cooperation, Li noted. 
  "We welcome direct foreign investment," he said, adding that 
China has advantages in labor, consumer market, resources and 
other aspects. 
  Economic development makes it all the more necessary for 
China to set up a modern enterprise system, Li said. 
  China is ready to draw from advanced foreign experience and 
willing to conduct cooperation with reputable financial, 
accounting and consulting companies, Li said. 
  The country hopes to get their help in asset evaluation, 
accounting and the raising of foreign funds, he noted. 
  During the meeting, Li also briefed Weinbach and his party 
on 
China's stance on Sino-U.S. relations and the issue of the most 
favored nation (MFN) trade status. 
  Weinbach assured Li that no matter what happens, his company 
will not change its commitments to China. 
  China's reform and opening-up and its economy have achieved 
a 
lot, attracting an increasing number of enterprises from all 
over the world to cooperate with China, he said. 
  The U.S. business community holds that it is abnormal for 
the 
U.S. and China, two of the world's most influential countries, 
not to maintain good ties and support the extension of MFN to 
China. They will make efforts to remove obstacles to the 
development of U.S.-China economic and trade ties, he said. 
  His company will continue its support for the improvement 
and 
development of bilateral relations, Weinbach noted.

  [Text] Washington, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Most of the U.S. 
Senators now support renewal of China's most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trade status, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance 
Trade Subcommittee said here today. 
  Senator Max Baucus told reporters that issues of human 
rights 
and trade should not be linked because revoking China's MFN 
status would cause great harm to both the United States and 
China. 
  The linkage policy by the Clinton administration "is fraught 
with confrontation and has achieved minimal success," Baucus 
said. "No other country uses this blunderbuss approach," he 
added. 
  A clear majority in the Senate now supports severing link 
between China's human rights and trade and renewing China's MFN 
trade status, Baucus added.

  [Text] Freed businessman Philip Cheng Hui-ho yesterday 
called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to take China's widespread 
abuses of human rights into consideration when he decides 
whether to renew China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading 
status this June. Dr Cheng who only returned to Hong Kong on 
Thursday after being kept in China for seven months said he 
supported Washington linking human rights with MFN. 
  "I think the U.S. Government will take my case as a 
violation 
of human rights in considering whether to give China MFN status. 
The lack of human rights is just such a big problem in today's 
China," said Dr Cheng, a former head of the Department of 
Journalism and Communications of the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong. 
  Dr Cheng was detained by the Changsha Eastern District 
People's Court, in Hunan Province last August over a dispute 
concerning his joint-venture business in China. He was held for 
two months in Changsha of Hunan Province and his passport was 
taken away. 
  The Chinese partner in his joint venture, the Hunan Arts and 
Crafts Import and Export Corp (HACIEC), wanted to pull out from 
the company and demanded the return of their investment. While 
he agreed to return the money to the HACIEC, he was arrested by 
court officials of the Changsha People's Eastern District Court 
who also took away his passport. 
  At least four Hong Kong residents are still under detention 
in China as a result of business disputes, according to figures 
revealed by the Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey. 
Pro-human rights activist John Kamm said yesterday that he 
believed many other Hong Kong residents faced even longer 
detention or worse treatment than Dr Cheng had experienced. 
  Hoping his case would raise public awareness of the 
mainland's legal system, Dr Cheng plans to file two counter 
charges -- a criminal charge against two Changsha judges for 
alleged illegal detainment and confiscation of his passport 
since August 26. Another civil charge would be filed against 
HACIEC for the economic losses. "Many people chicken out. They 
are so afraid of the mainland authorities that I have to speak 
up as an example myself," he said.

  [Text] A Hong Kong businessman who was detained in China 
for seven months has vowed to take his lawsuit against allegedly 
corrupt Hunan officials all the way to the top. "If I cannot 
get my case handled in a proper way I will go to the Supreme 
Court in Beijing," Dr Philip Cheng said yesterday in his first 
public appearance since returning to the territory on Thursday 
night. "I will fight to the end," he added. 
  Cheng, 64, remained optimistic he would win the civil 
countersuit, launched against a Changsha court official and the 
former general manager of a Hunan trade company. "I got my 
passport back, so I think the court will do justice again," he 
said. "I was involved in a business dispute so it should be 
handled according to legal procedures." 
  Cheng yesterday gave further details of his seven-month 
ordeal, in which he was first held in solitary confinement for 
three days, then locked in a hotel for a week, after which he 
was barred from leaving Changsha for a month and then in effect 
prevented from leaving the country by having his United States 
passport confiscated. 
  Eight local court officials detained Cheng in a Changsha 
hotel last August after the Hunan Arts and Crafts Import and 
Export Corporation accused him of breaking a contract to return 
U.S.$165,000 (HK$1.27m) it had invested in his Zhuhai bicycle 
helmet factory. According to Cheng, the Hunan company's former 
general manager, Liu Xianyou, altered the date of the contract 
to four months earlier and asked a local court official, Shen 
Xiaoguan, to arrest him. "At five o'clock we signed the deal 
and at six o'clock eight uniformed officers barged into the 
hotel room saying I was being detained over a dispute regarding 
the contract." he said. Hunan public security offcers were kept 
out of the hotel by court officials when they came to 
investigate the case, he said. "The court officials said: 
`There's no one here.' And I was in a little room trying to 
call for help," Cheng said. 
  Cheng said he hoped the suit would not be seen as a comment 
on China's legal system or its reform policies. "The foreign 
publicity helped me get out, but it can damage the reputation of 
China and the Chinese people very much," said Cheng, a former 
professor at the Chinese University who became a fulltime 
businessman in 1991. "It is an isolated case perpetrated by a 
small band of individuals who sought to bend the rules of 
justice. What is most perplexing was the lack of influence even 
senior officials in Beijing had over this little fiefdom ... We 
need to examine why local Chinese officials are able to abuse 
their powers to such an extent," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Subtle Moves Toward Separating Human Rights </F>
From MFN Status"] 
  [Text] Since Warren Christopher's China visit, a debate 
has started among U.S. officials handling economic and foreign 
affairs. U.S. officials have thus had a pragmatic change on the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] question. This change is related to 
the idea within U.S. financial and political circles which 
favors separating the human rights issue from the MFN question. 
  The United States' foreign policy today pays more and more 
attention to developing its economic interests. Today, as Asia 
has become the world's fastest growing economic region, the 
United States is attaching still more importance to 
participating in Asia's economic activities. China is the 
largest market in Asia as well as the country with the fastest 
growing economy. U.S. businessmen have always been opposed to 
lumping the human rights issue with granting MFN to China. If 
China's MFN status is canceled, U.S. businessmen will lose the 
large market of China. U.S. policy appears to be very 
contradictory. The United States hopes to gain China's markets 
while wanting to force China to make concessions on the human 
rights issue so that the political changes it desires will occur 
in China. It hopes that China's economy will continuously 
develop so China can import more U.S. merchandise, while fearing 
the rise of a powerful China. Under the control of this 
contradictory psychology, the United States vacillates in its 
policy, does not know whether it is appropriate to advance or 
retreat, and has incorrectly judged and handled the situation of 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Prior to every June, the United States would, as a rule, use 
the MFN question as a big stick to threaten China with. 
However, the United States would convince itself that China had 
already met its requirements and that it had conformed to the 
conditions for granting MFN trading status. There are two 
weaknesses in repeating this practice every year. First, the 
world sees from this that the United States does not have a 
standard for human rights. The fact that the United States 
never uses human rights diplomacy against U.S.-sponsored 
dictatorships reflects that this practice is merely a means of 
power politics. Second, when it is repeated many times, this 
means of blackmail becomes ineffective. 
  Therefore, even Washington officials and Congressmen do not 
feel it is advantageous to repeat the MFN question every year. 
Some suggest settling the MFN question once and for all, 
because if this question remains unsettled for a single day, it 
will be impossible for U.S. businesses to make large-scale 
investments in China, and this will ultimately harm long-term 
U.S. interests gained by opening up China's market. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher recently wrote an 
article in THE WASHINGTON POST in which he defended U.S. policy 
readjustments and refuted hawks who demanded he cancel his 
scheduled 11-14 March visit to China. Christopher stated: "The 
visit is a must for our decision on whether or not to renew 
China's MFN status before 3 June." He noted that China has 
already made some progress with regard to the human rights 
issue. The executive order issued by Clinton last year on 
extending China's MFN status was aimed at resolving two major 
problems: banning the export of prison labor products to the 
United States, and lifting emigration restrictions. He contended 
that he had scored achievements on both issues during his recent 
visit to China. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Lord had previously advocated a 
tough stance on the human rights issue. However, at a recent 
congressional hearing, he appeared optimistic about the issue, 
saying that he believed China "absolutely has the ability and 
measures to win" MFN status. He emphasized that China had 
already done an excellent job in putting an end to exports of 
prison labor products and lifting emigration restrictions. He 
proposed that China should try to "make significant progress" in 
five aspects, saying: So long as China makes continued efforts 
in this connection, the United States will be ready to establish 
more constructive relations with China at any time. The United 
States hopes that MFN will soon cease to be a controversial 
issue affecting the U.S. policy toward China. 
  To gradually disentangle the human rights issue from the 
central theme of MFN is no doubt a pragmatic move. As the 
United States has time and again emphasized that it has no 
intention whatsoever to introduce changes to Chinese society or 
impose its own political standards on China, to force China to 
knuckle under with high-handed measures would certainly run 
counter to this. Along with continued economic growth, China 
will be able to build a better material basis upon which human 
rights can be improved and will be able to quicken the pace of 
improving human rights as well. Nonetheless, China will never 
barter away its principles. The history of Sino-U.S. relations 
contains both successful experiences and negative lessons. The 
United States knows all too well that interference in China's 
internal affairs only adversely affects Sino-U.S. relations. 
  China and the United States are two big countries that have 
shared common interests. Just as Christopher pointed out, China 
and the United States have a basis for cooperation on issues 
like international affairs and regional security. For example, 
China and the United States need to strengthen bilateral 
cooperation on issues like safeguarding stability and security 
in Asia, ensuring that the Korean peninsular remains a 
nuclear-free zone, and so on, as well as on international issues 
like narcotics control, immigration, smuggling, and 
environmental protection. Regarding economic cooperation, 
Christopher called for expanding the U.S. share of the Chinese 
market. The United States has gradually realized that the 
development of Sino-U.S. relations will provide it with more 
advantages than disadvantages. It is precisely for this reason 
that those forces which treasure Sino-U.S. economic cooperation 
have now gained ground. According to a report carried by THE 
NEW YORK TIMES, the U.S. president's economic experts group has 
already reached a consensus: It is no longer appropriate to 
link the human rights issue with MFN status. Eventually, the 
U.S. Congress will also consider measures to remove the annual 
threat of economic sanctions. 
  If all this is true, we will certainly embrace this trend. 
China bases itself on seeking cooperation and improving 
relations with the United States and adopts a positive approach 
to the development of Sino-U.S. relations. However, China has 
also prepared itself for any bad news and is not afraid of 
losing MFN status.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 26 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
Friday [25 March] denied support of Pakistan on Kashmir issue 
and claimed it support India to pursue a political process in 
the region. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel told a 
selected gathering here that "we vigorously oppose outside aid 
to the militants." The people in the valley were "tired of 
fighting and want some kind of reconciliation," she added. 
  Asked about her questioning of Kashmir's accession to India 
recently, she said, "our focus is not on how the kashmir problem 
started, but on how it can be ended." 
  A large number of activists from Indian controlled Kashmir 
staged a demonstration Thursday near the U.S. Embassy to protest 
against her five-day visit to India, describing her recent 
statements amounted to interference in India's internal affairs. 
  She expressed her concern over "credible" reports of human 
rights violations in the region. But she emphasised that U.S. 
always acknowledged that the militants shared responsibility for 
violations with the security forces. 
  She said the costs of continued confrontation vastly 
exceeded 
efforts of those associated with compromise and peaceful 
negotiation in the region. 
  The violence in the region has claimed 8,912 lives including 
3,794 militants and 2,432 civilians till February this year. 
  She felt the foreign secretary-level talks between India and 
Pakistan in January were a positive step and hoped they would 
continue. 
  Raphel also said the U.S. would like India and Pakistan to 
address the problem of nuclear non-proliferation bilaterally.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Canadians Seek To Bolster </F>
Trade"] 
  [Text] A high-level Canadian Government delegation will 
arrive in China on Sunday looking for a bigger share of China's 
lucrative market. 
  The mission, which includes about 30 business people, is led 
by Canadian Minister for International Trade Roy MacLaren. 
  The entrepreneurs represent such industries as 
telecommunications, power generation and aerospace. 
  MacLaren is the first Canadian cabinet minister to visit 
China since the Liberal Party assumed power. 
  "Asia-Pacific is the most dynamic region in the world today, 
with average annual growth rates between 6 and 9 percent," the 
minister said before he left for China. 
  After leaving China on Thursday, MacLaren will visit South 
Korea and Japan. 
  "China, South Korea and Japan are among Canada's top six 
trading partners, together accounting for $20.3 billion worth of 
trade with Canada," he said. "Increasing trade and investment 
with these countries is of vital importance to economic growth 
and job creation in Canada." 
  Canada's Power Corp and two other companies have joined 
hands 
to set up a special $1 billion fund for power projects in China. 
  Canada has also pledged to provide China with close to $2 
billion worth of loans, at favourable terms, for its postal 
service, telecommunications hydraulic power stations, 
petrochemicals, paper-making and urban construction. 
  By September 1993, Canada had promised to invest $1.4 
billion 
in 1,321 projects in China. But the actual amount spent was 
only $177 million. 
  China's actual investment in Canada amounted to $400 million 
by the end of last year. 
  Sui Hui, an official in the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation (Moftec), said MacLaren's visit will send 
bilateral trade and investment to new highs. 
  On his visit, MacLaren will confer with Moftec Minister Wu 
Yi. 
  Wu has expressed hopes that Canada could increase its 
investment in China, which is attracting more capital from many 
other countries and regions. 
  Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju has noted that the city approves an 
average of two foreign-funded projects per day, but so far only 
one Canadian company has invested in the city. 
  Bruised by competition from other international 
corporations, 
Canada's Northern Telecom, which has sales of $300 million in 
China, is negotiating for a joint venture with a Chinese partner 
in Guangdong Province. But the details weren't available. 
  The Quorum Co, which helps finance smaller Canadian 
enterprises that want to enter China's hi-tech markets, is 
scheduled to open investment forums in Beijing, Shanghai and 
Guangzhou in the summer . 
  Sui Hui, the Moftec official, said Canada is China's 13th 
largest trading partner, with $2.57 billion in bilateral trade 
in 1993.

military forces completed their withdrawal from Somalia today, 
Defense Secretary William Perry announced here. 
  "The last C-5 aircraft left Mogadishu at 9:13 A.M. local

the 
withdrawal and the exit of U.S. forces peacekeeping duties in 
Somalia," a Pentagon spokesman said. 
  About 50 American Marines were left in Somalia to guard the 
12 diplomats at the U.S. Liaison Office, and about 13 American 
military men remain at the U.N. forces' headquarters.

  [Text] Moscow, March 25 (XINHUA) -- China and Russia signed 
a protocol here today on cooperation in peaceful use of space, 
laying the basis for extensive bilateral cooperation in the area. 
  The protocol on cooperation in peaceful use of and research 
into space was signed by visiting Deputy Director of the China 
National Space Administration Wang Liheng and director of the 
Russian Space Administration U. Koptev. 
  Wang told a press conference after the signing ceremony that 
a joint working committee with seven people from each side will 
be set up to work out the details of cooperation projects. 
  Noting the good cooperation the two countries have enjoyed 
in 
the past, Wang said the document is a frame agreement to lay a 
basis for extensive Sino-Russian space cooperation. 
  Koptev pointed out that under the protocol, Russia and China 
will cooperate in virtually all fields of space science, 
including communication satellite, satellite television 
broadcast and space technology application. 
  He said that although both countries have collaborated in 
space science for years, the potential for such cooperation are 
far from being fully tapped. 
  Sino-Russian space cooperation is faced with difficulties in 
terms of law, finance and economy, Koptev said, but normal 
cooperation will not be affected. 
  On Russia's plan to build a new space rocket launching 
center 
in the Far East, which is only 100 kilometers away from the 
Chinese border, Koptev said this will create more favorable 
conditions for close Russian-Chinese cooperation in this field. 
  Wang, who led a delegation of China National Space 
Administration, arrived here on Monday [21 March] for a 
week-long visit.

  [Text] Moscow, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that his country may possibly 
join NATO in the future, but that this was not the right time. 
  Touring the northern city of Murmansk together with his 
Norwegian counterpart Bjoern Tore Godal, Kozyrev stressed that 
it is still too early to talk about Russia's full membership in 
NATO. 
  Cooperation between Russia and the NATO countries is the 
only 
issue that should be stressed right now, he added. 
  Moscow has stated its readiness to join NATO's partnership 
for peace program, a step which could finally lead to Russia's 
full membership. 
  However, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev earlier this 
month expressed his opposition to joining the organization, 
although he is in favor of taking part in the Partnership for 
Peace Program. 
  Among other reasons, Grachev fears that Russia may have to 
reconstruct its 2.3-million-strong army if it joins NATO. 
  But the foreign minister did not rule out the possibility. 
  Kozyrev believes that Russia's ties with NATO are growing 
steadily, citing the recent Russia-NATO joint military exercises. 
  For five days Russia held the war games, the first of its 
kind, in the Barents Sea with troops from the United States, 
Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and Norway, with the aim of 
enforcing the U.N.-sponsored sea embargo against former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Further cooperation between Russia and the NATO became the 
main topic of discussions between Kozyrev and his visiting 
Norwegian counterpart in Murmansk. 
  Before his departure, Godal praised Moscow for its 
"constructive role" in resolving various world problems. 
  He welcomed Russia's earlier statement that it would soon 
sign the Partnership for Peace Program, echoing Kozyrev's 
optimistic prediction that the preparatory work was nearly ended. 
  Europe as a whole should draw no new boundary lines, but 
instead cooperation on security should be strengthened, said 
Godal, who left for home Saturday.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 28 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
largest port city has reported a good start in foreign trade 
this year. 
  According to the latest statistics, Shanghai exported 1.075 
billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods in the first two months of 
this year, an increase of 19.3 percent over the same period of 
last year. 
  The number of foreign trade contracts concluded during this 
period was up 17 percent, and the purchase of goods for export 
also registered an increase. 
  A municipal government official is optimistic about 
Shanghai's exports, which are expected to climb to 8.5 billion 
U.S. dollars-worth this year, an increase of 15.4 percent over 
last year and exceeding the city's 12-percent increase in gross 
domestic product. 
  Shanghai exported 7.34 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods 
last year, keeping pace with the development of its gross 
domestic product. 
  While allocating preferential policies to foreign trade, the 
Shanghai Municipal Government has mobilized all efforts to 
ensure exports are steady. 
  The industrial departments have vowed to produce more 
quality-brand products for export. 
  Meanwhile, Shanghai's foreign trade, industrial, commercial, 
agricultural and scientific research departments and 
organizations have opened 420 trading and non-trading 
enterprises in 60 countries and regions.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has recently 
worked out a plan to launch a reform drive in commerce, 
featuring a shift to a modern enterprise system in its ten big 
commercial and service companies. 
  Meng Jianxiong, deputy major of this largest commercial city 
in China, told a local meeting that the drive will stress 
revising the existing management of state-owned property and 
forming a group of powerful corporations. 
  Topping the list of the city's ten main tasks is 
standardizing the management system of the ten nationally known 
commercial and service companies in the city, such as the 
Shanghai No. 1 Department Store and the Hualian Trade Mansion. 
  In addition, the city is to adopt a series of measures to 
promote the drive this year, including establishing ten large 
corporations through mergers and purchasing, improving its 19 
existing joint-stock companies and adding 10 more to the list. 
In addition, initial experiments in handling bankruptcies and 
mergers will be carried out, and 400 small-partnership 
commercial enterprises and 500 chain stores will be set up.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 26 (XINHUA) -- More than 4,000 
foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai have gone into operation 
and most of them are profitable. 
  A survey shows that business people from 54 countries and 
regions have set up 7,547 projects in this, China's largest 
economic center, and 64 percent of them have gone into operation. 
  These projects have a combined investment of 14.9 billion 
U.S. dollars on contract, and actual investment amounts to 5.1 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  In particular, service trade projects are playing an 
important role in Shanghai's municipal economy. 
  Last year saw them deliver 3.8 billion yuan to the municipal 
government in taxes, an increase of 73 percent, or 2.2 billion 
yuan, over the previous year. The proportion of taxes accounted 
for 16 percent of the city's total collected in that year. 
  A local official in charge of foreign investment said that 
exports by foreign-funded enterprises here earned 7.34 billion 
U.S. dollars last year, occupying 21.8 percent of the city's 
total. 
  Economists here agree that Shanghai already has effectively 
combined the use of foreign investment with its development of 
services first, industry second and agriculture third. 
  Of the city's contractual foreign investment, projects 
involved in agriculture account for 0.17 percent, in industry 
for 41.46 percent and in the service trades for 58.37 percent. 
  Shanghai's improved investment environment has drawn the 
attention of noted trans-national corporations. 
  Altogether, 44 trans-national corporations set up 68 
projects 
involving a total investment of 950 million U.S. dollars in 
Shanghai last year. 
  So far, 128 trans-national corporations have launched 206 
projects in shanghai, involving a total foreign investment of 
2.5 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Of the trans-national corporations, at least 90 percent come 
from the United States, Japan and European countries, and 35 out 
of the 200 largest industrial trans-national corporations in the 
world have invested in Shanghai. 
  The official noted that the municipal government approved 
the 
establishment of 205 projects, each with an investment of more 
than 10 million U.S. dollars, last year, an increase of 200 
percent over the previous year. These projects involve a total 
investment of 4.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 220 percent. 
  By the end of February this year the municipal government 
had 
approved 466 projects, each with an investment of at least 10 
million U.S. dollars. These projects, with a total foreign 
investment of 9.7 billion U.S. dollars, accounted for 65 percent 
of the city's total. 
  "The large foreign-funded projects have brought funds and 
advanced international technology, and become backbone 
enterprises of the city," the official said. 
  He disclosed that the foreign-funded industrial projects are 
mainly in the fields of integrated circuits, optical fiber 
communications and equipment, compressor for air-conditioners, 
digital program-controlled telephone exchanges and mobile 
telephone terminal equipment. 
  They have played an important role in helping adjust 
Shanghai's industrial structure, according to the official. 
  One example is the Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation, a 
Sino-German joint venture, which produced 100,000 
Shanghai-Santana cars last year. More than 80 percent of the 
car parts were made in China. 
  With an annual sales output value exceeding 10 billion yuan, 
the corporation has become a key enterprise in Shanghai. 
  Another example is the Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment 
Manufacturing Co. Ltd, also a Sino-foreign joint venture, of 
which the telecommunications products occupy at least one half 
of the Chinese market. 
  The official said that service trades have become favorites 
for foreign investment, which has penetrated the fields of 
banking, real estate trade, commerce, culture and recreation, 
information consultancy, catering, design, education and public 
health.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 26 (XINHUA) -- A special wholesale 
market for products of foreign-funded enterprises is to be 
established soon in Shanghai. 
  The wholesale market, to be located in the Nanfang 
Commercial 
Center in the western part of the city, will cover a floor space 
of 14,000 square meters, the size of the famous Shanghai number 
one department store. 
  It is the first market of its kind in this China's largest 
city. 
  Officials say that all foreign-funded enterprises from 
Shanghai and other parts of the country can open a window at the 
market. It is expected to create an environment for fair 
competition between Chinese enterprises and foreign-funded 
ventures. 
  A model of the market shows that automobiles, garments, 
foodstuffs and household electronic appliances will be on sale 
in one hall while samples and products made by famous 
international ventures will be displayed in another hall for 
order and wholesale. 
  So far, businessmen from Shanghai city, Guangdong, Jiangsu 
and Zhejiang Provinces as well as from Hong Kong, Taiwan and 
Japan have consulted with the market's organizers, asking for 
reserving places, according to Yang Guoqiang, deputy manager of 
the commercial center. 
  The Nanfang Commercial Center, which is expected to be 
completed by 1995, will have a total floor space of 26,000 
square meters. It is near major highways, the subway system, an 
expressway and the Hongqiao International Airport.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Jiang Jian: "Future of 2 Airports Is </F>
Clouded"] 
  [Text] While the country's civil aviation sector reaps 
record investment for capital construction, uncertainties over 
management have plunged Shanghai's airport development plans 
into a heavy fog. 
  At a working conference of the Civil Aviation Administration 
of China (CAAC) held earlier this month in Beijing, it was 
announced that the CAAC plans to invest 3.58 billion yuan 
($411.5 million) this year in improving airports, 59.4 percent 
more than in 1993. 
  The conference mapped out detailed airport construction and 
expansion schemes around the country. But the status of the 
expansion of Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport and construction of a 
second airport in the Pudong New Area were left vague in the 
CAAC's documents, which merely say "preparations should be 
continued." 
  A source at the Hongqiao Airport told Business Weekly that 
airport construction in Shanghai faces two uncertainties that 
may hamper development. 
  First, it is unclear whether expanding Hongqiao or building 
the new airport is more beneficial to the city. 
  Since the chances of starting both at the same time are 
slim, 
supporters are fiercely lobbying for each scheme. 
  Government officials are leaning toward the Pudong airport, 
and Business Weekly has learned that the Japanese Government may 
finance the project. 
  The second uncertainty is over who will take charge of 
Hongqiao Airport. 
  About two years ago, the CAAC decided to hand control of 
airports over to local governments. By gaining full rights to 
administer airports, local authorities also assume 
responsibility for raising construction capital. 
  Progress in this reform has been slow. In Shanghai, in fact, 
the CAAC still manages Hongqiao Airport. 
  Because of this, both the CAAC and the Shanghai government 
hesitate to inject money into airport renovation. 
  Aviation experts don't expect these two uncertainties to be 
resolved for at least half a year. But by then, Hongqiao 
Airport must be operating at full capacity.

  [Text] Shanghai, China, March 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam, winding up his visit to Japan, arrived 
here from Tokyo Saturday [26 March] to begin a five-day tour of 
China that will include talks with President Jiang Zemin. 
  Kim hopes to consult with Jiang and other Chinese leaders, 
including Prime Minister Li Peng, on the North Korean nuclear 
issue and ways to boost economic cooperation. 
  Kim will reportedly request that China, North Korea's only 
major remaining ally, exercise its influence in persuading 
Pyongyang to accept International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  Failing that, Kim will ask the Chinese leaders not to oppose 
any decision the United Nations Security Council makes on North 
Korea. 
  Before going to Beijing on Sunday, Kim, accompanied by his 
wife Son Myoung-sun, will visit the site of the former 
government-in-exile during the Japanese colonial days. 
  He will also tour Luxun Park in Shanghai, where Korean 
patriot Yun Pong-kil bombed Japanese dignitaries celebrating the 
birthday of their emperor, killing Gen. Yoshimori Shirakawa on 
April 29, 1932.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 KYODO -- China's leadership 
remained firm in its desire for a negotiated solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula during talks Monday [28 
March] with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin reiterated the need for 
patience on all sides and added pressure should not be used, 
spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters after a summit meeting 
between the two leaders. 
  Although there has been no breakthrough on easing tensions 
on 
the peninsula, Shen said, "China has its own diplomatic 
relations with the DPRK (North Korea), so the diplomatic channel 
between the two countries is open." 
  "China has made contacts with all the parties directly 
concerned in the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and China 
hopes that all these parties express patience and constructive 
ideas," the spokesman said. 
  It was one of the clearest public statements concerning 
China's involvement in the crisis over North Korea's refusal to 
allow international inspections at areas of two sites suspected 
of being part of a clandestine nuclear weapons program. 
  North Korea again lashed out Sunday at what it calls U.S. 
imperialism. 
  But Shen maintained, "We have made a due effort but China 
can 
only play a limited role." He said the issue should be resolved 
through dialogue between North Korea and its counterparts in 
South Korea, the United States and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
  The two leaders did not discuss the proposed UN Security 
Council nonbinding presidential statement concerning the issue 
and raised Friday in New York, nor did they discuss the 
possibility of hostilities breaking out, Shen said. [sentence as 
received] 
  Concerning the United Nations, he said China's Foreign 
Ministry's position is that "the rhetoric of such a presidential 
statement shall be constructive and shall contribute to the 
resumption of the three bilateral talks involving four parties." 
  "Such talks are the only effective way to settle the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula," he said. 
  When asked about the renewal of Team Spirit war exercises 
and 
the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea, Shen would 
only say China is opposed to "any actions detrimental to the 
deterioration of the situation on the Korean peninsula." 
  In the talks with Jiang, Kim expressed his desire to see the 
issue solved through dialogue, without pressure and China would 
continue to play its role, Shen said. 
  Kim, on the third day of a five-day trip to China, arrived 
in 
Beijing late Sunday and will hold talks with Chinese leaders 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
  Other than the nuclear issue, economic cooperation and trade 
have been high on Kim's agenda with bilateral trade growing to 
more than 9 billion dollars in 1993. 
  Kim is the first South Korean president to go to China since 
former president No Tae-u visited one month after diplomatic 
relations were established in August 1992.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 KYODO -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin reiterated Monday [29 March] that dialogue among North and 
South Korea, the United States and the U.N. nuclear watchdog is 
the only way to resolve the heightening tensions on the Korean 
peninsula, South Korean journalists said. 
  "The only appropriate way that parties directly involved 
will 
resolve the issue constructively is with patience," said Jiang, 
concurrently general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. 
  Jiang was speaking to the Korean reporters for some 20 
minutes after summit talks with South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam. 
  The Chinese leader was quoted as saying there is a limit to 
what China can do. He expressed hope that the nuclear problem 
would be solved through existing channels of dialogue among 
Seoul, Pyongyang, Washington and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), the journalists said. 
  "I discussed the nuclear issue frankly with the South Korean 
side and agreed that a solution through dialogue is the proper 
way," Jiang said. 
  The IAEA referred North Korea's nuclear issue to the U.N. 
Security Council after Pyongyang hampered full inspections of 
its suspected nuclear facilities to verify whether it had 
diverted materials for the development of nuclear weapons. 
  The U.S. has proposed a Security Council resolution urging 
North Korea to agree to follow-up inspections of its nuclear 
facilities within one month. 
  But China, which is eager to keep open the door for dialogue 
with North Korea, has suggested that the Security Council issue 
a nonbinding statement in the name of its president, 
Jaen-Bernard Merimee of France. 
  Jiang also told the Korean reporters that if tensions mount 
on the peninsula, the Korean people will suffer most and the 
situation will not be good for Northeast Asia. 
  In talks with Kim on Monday, Jiang reiterated the need for 
patience on all sides and added that pressure should not be 
used, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  Kim, who flew into Shanghai from Tokyo on Saturday, arrived 
in Beijing late Sunday to meet Chinese leaders to discuss the 
North's suspected nuclear development program and expand Seoul's 
trade ties with Beijing. He will return home Wednesday.

<F P=106> [By reporter Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Mar (XINHUA) -- While holding talks 
with Korean [ROK] President Kim Yong-sam at the Great Hall of 
the People this morning, State President Jiang Zemin said 
emphatically: In developing Sino-Korean relations, we should 
keep in mind peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, 
development and prosperity in the Asian region, and the 21st 
century. 
  Jiang Zemin said: "Although China and Korea established 
diplomatic relations not long ago, relations between the two 
countries have developed rapidly, leading to ever-widening 
fields of exchanges and cooperation, thanks to the joint efforts 
of the two sides. We are pleased with the smooth development of 
relations between the two countries." 
  He said: Friendly relations between China and Korea now have 
a very good foundation. Moreover, they possess the conditions 
and possibilities for further developing these relations. In 
particular, there are good prospects for strengthening and 
deepening mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the 
two countries. The two countries may explore specific industrial 
sectors for cooperation, as well as the forms of cooperation. 
  He said: President Kim Yong-sam's current visit is bound to 
give a positive impetus to further developing relations between 
the two countries. 
  Last November, Jiang Zemin met with President Kim Yong-sam 
in 
Seattle in the United States. He expressed his pleasure at 
meeting with Kim Yong-sam again four months later and at 
exchanging views on relations between the two countries and on 
issues of common interest. 
  Kim Yong-sam expressed great pleasure at having an 
opportunity to visit China. He said: Korea and China enjoy a 
traditional relationship dating back several thousand years. 
Economic cooperation between the two countries is highly 
complementary, and there are quite a few favorable conditions in 
this respect. 
  He said that he had been deeply impressed by his visit to 
Shanghai the day before. There is tremendous potential for 
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. They 
can cooperate in such industrial sectors as aviation, 
automobiles, and electronic program-controlled telephone 
exchanges. 
  Kim Yong-sam noted: Further cementing economic and trade 
cooperation between the two countries will play a tremendous 
role in stabilizing the economy in the Asia-Pacific region, or 
even in the world at large. It will help promote world peace 
and stability. 
  Kim Yong-sam expressed his belief that the visit would 
prompt 
the Korean side to actively encourage its enterprises to invest 
in China so that Korea would become China's reliable partner for 
economic and trade cooperation, and that cooperation between the 
two countries in all fields would be promoted further. 
  Speaking of the situation on the Korean peninsula, Jiang 
Zemin said: The Chinese Government sincerely hopes that 
long-term peace and stability will be maintained on the Korean 
peninsula, and it supports the call for a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula. Without peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, 
there will be no genuine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  He said emphatically: In dealing with the issue of the 
Korean peninsula, one should proceed from the overall 
consideration for maintaining and developing peace and stability 
on the Korean peninsula. The nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula should be resolved properly through dialogue within a 
trilateral framework involving the four sides. 
  President Kim Yong-sam noted: The Korean side also hopes 
that the nuclear issue of Korea [DPRK] will be solved through 
dialogue and negotiation, instead of through pressure, and that 
China will continue to play its role toward this end. 
  He invited President Jiang Zemin to visit Korea at a 
convenient time. Jiang Zemin expressed his thanks and noted 
that relevant specifics would be discussed separately through 
diplomatic channels. 
  During the talks, the two leaders also briefed each other on 
economic development in their countries, exchanging views in 
this regard, and on regional and international issues of common 
interest. 
  Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and 
concurrently foreign minister, and Wu Jichuan, chairman of the 
Chinese Government's reception committee and minister of posts 
and telecommunications, were present at the talks. 
  Also present at the talks were Han Sung-chu, ROK minister of 
foreign affairs, and Kim Chol-su, ROK minister of trade, 
industry, and energy, who are accompanying President Kim 
Yong-sam on his visit. 
  Prior to the talks, President Jiang Zemin hosted a ceremony 
in the central hall of the Great Hall of the People to welcome 
President Kim Yong-sam and his wife on their official visit to 
China. Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, and others attended the ceremony. 
  In the evening, President Jiang Zemin hosted a banquet there 
for Kim Yong-sam and his wife and delegation.

complementary relations of economic cooperation. 
  Kim Yong-sam delivered a speech on Korean-Chinese economic

prosperity in the two countries, as well as in stimulating the

complementary relations of cooperation by further expanding 
joint development and financing for new technology. 
  Kim Yong-sam expressed hope that Korean enterprises would 
actively participate in the Chinese market and seek common 
development with their Chinese counterparts. He said that 
Korean enterprises were capable of becoming good partners to 
their Chinese counterparts. 
  In his speech, Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council 
for the Promotion of International Trade and the China Chamber

cooperation and exchanges, between the two countries. 
  Before the luncheon, Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State 
Council, met Kim Yong-sam and his entourage at the Diaoyutai

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (AFP) -- China has refused to 
pressure North Korea into dropping its nuclear weapons program, 
saying it was against U.S.-South Korean military exercises and 
the deployment of Patriot missiles in the South. 
  "China is not in favour of any action or measures 
detrimental 
to the maintenance of peace and relaxation on the Korean 
peninsula, whether it was military exercise or deployment of 
missiles," said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told 
journalists. [sentence as received] 
  The spokesman, Shen Guofang, said China hoped the nuclear 
issue "shall be settled through patient and constructive talks 
between the parties directly concerned." 
  He made the remarks following a crucial meeting between 
South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Communist Party General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin here Monday.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today conferred with visiting 
ROK (the Republic of Korea) Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, on 
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. 
  Referring to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Qian 
said there were twists and difficulties in the process of 
solving this problem. 
  However, he said it was imperative to see that the general 
trend was advancing, adding that one should be more calm and 
patient at a time when there appeared difficulty in the latest 
development of the situation. 
  Exerting pressure would only intensify contradictions, which 
would be no help in solving the problem, but make it 
complicated, he said. 
  Qian said the tense situation on the Korean peninsula would 
bring no benefit to the countries in this region. Therefore it 
was of vital importance to resume consultations among the four 
parties so as to solve the problem. 
  He said it was China's hope that the parties concerned would 
continue to make constructive efforts for peace to properly 
settle the nuclear issue on the peninsula. 
  Han said the ROK stands for patient dialogue and hoped for 
continuous efforts by the international community to settle the 
problem properly, especially through direct dialogue between the 
parties concerned. 
  But, he said, the window for dialogue is closed now and the 
issue has been raised at the United Nations Security Council, 
adding that the ROK still hoped to find a good solution to the 
issue. 
  This afternoon, Song Jian, China's state councillor and 
minister in charge of the State Science and Technology 
Commission, met with Kim Si-chung, the ROK minister of science 
and technology. The two exchanged views on the further growth 
of bilateral cooperation in science and technology. 
  Wang Zhongyu, Chinese minister in charge of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission, held talks with Kim Chol-su, the 
ROK minister of commerce, industry and resources, during which 
they explored ways and channels for expanding bilateral economic 
cooperation and trade.

  [Excerpts] Today we will start with Chinese Prime Minister 
Li Peng's meeting with foreign and domestic reporters. Chinese 
Prime Minister Li Peng, and four deputy prime ministers, met 
with foreign and domestic reporters in the People's Great Hall 
in Beijing on 22 March. The reporters participated in coverage 
of the Chinese National People's Congress and political 
consultative meeting. Prime Minister Li Peng and deputy prime 
ministers expressed thanks to the reporters for rapid reporting 
of the events during the period of meetings, and answered 
questions raised concerning some issues. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning PRC-U.S. relations, Prime Minister Li Peng said 
that China consistently attached importance to PRC-U.S. 
relations and has always been ready to and has made efforts to 
improve them. China will continually make efforts to do so in 
the future. However, since China is a sovereign state, it will 
not bargain on the basis of certain rule. [passage omitted] 
  Touching on the nuclear inspection issue on the DPRK, Prime 
Minister Li Peng said that China always called for a solution to 
the North Korean nuclear inspection issue through negotiation, 
and that if a step is taken in a manner of applying pressure, it 
will further complicate and strain the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. Moreover, such a step will be disadvantageous to 
peace and security in this region. 
  Prime Minister Li Peng pointed out that the DPRK changed its 
attitude of disagreement concerning inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency to agreement. This proved 
that the two sides can gradually attain their (?purposes) 
through negotiations. 
  He said that in the event that the issue of nuclear 
inspection of North Korea is referred to discussion at the UN 
Security Council, China will maintain its consistent position 
that the problem should be solved in a reasonable manner through 
dialogue and negotiations without applying pressure. [passage 
omitted]

from the United States. 
  Pak Myong-ku said this on his arrival at the Luanda

  He said, "We are ready politically and militarily to deal 
with the United States on our own, and the Americans should know 
this." 
  Pak Myong-ku said his visit to the southern African country 
will "promote the bilateral relations between the two countries."

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (AFP)--China and South Korea 
agreed here Monday to launch a government committee on bilateral 
industrial cooperation to boost the already-booming trade and 
investment between the two countries. The agreement was reached 
at a trade ministers' meeting between South Korea's Kim Chol-Su 
and his Chinese counterpart Wang Zhongyu, Kim told journalists. 
  The industrial committee will have four subcomittees to work 
for cooperation in automobiles, aircraft, electronic phone 
switching systems and high-definition television. The agreement 
was signed during the visit to China of South Korea's president, 
Kim Yong-Sam. The South Korean trade minister said the committee 
would be launched by the end of June. The two trade ministers 
also agreed the two countries would jointly develop mid-sized 
passenger jets with some 100 seats by 2000, and produce auto 
parts before shifting into the manufacturing of cars, Kim 
Chol-su said. 
  In a related development, the South Korean communication 
minister, Yun Tong-yun, and his Chinese counterpart, Wu Jichuan, 
signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to jointly develop 
and market an electronic phone switching system. The MOU also 
calls for South Korean firms to participate actively in various 
telecommunication projects in China, including a 
100-million-dollar plan to link Beijing and Guangzhou with 
optical cables, and a 100- million-dollar computer network for 
post offices throughout China.

<F P=106> [By Hwang Pyong-tae, Republic of Korea ambassador to the </F>
PRC: "Sino-ROK Relations Head Towards a Bright and Glorious 
Future"] 
  [Text] The establishment of diplomatic relations between 
the Republic of Korea and the Peoples Republic of China on 
August 25 1992, was a historical breakthrough in the Northeast 
Asian region. The two countries have eliminated the legacies of 
the past mischievous history during the last 40 years of the 
Cold War confrontation, and are moving ahead hand in hand, 
building a solid basis upon which bilateral friendship and 
cooperation are further strengthened and multilateral peace and 
prosperity are promoted. It was under these sets of 
relationships where active, co-operative exchanges in various 
areas between the two countries has grown by leaps and bounds. 
In 1993, the trade volume between the two countries reached 
$8.2 billion, marking a 52 percent increase from the previous 
year, and the accumulated approved amount of ROK investment to 
the PRC has been doubled each year since 1990, reaching $1 
billion. The same phenomenal exchange took place in cultural as 
well as academic fields . 
  However, our times demand us to do more than what we have 
achieved so far. Both countries have to look forward to the 
coming age of the 21st century and Asia-Pacific cooperation. 
Both countries find themselves at a historical juncture calling 
for not merely promoting horizontal cooperation, but also 
developing a vertical structure of co-operation upon which the 
two countries build a basis for Northeast Asian regional 
cooperation conducive to the Asia-Pacific age of cooperation in 
the 21st century. 
  The visit of President Kim Yong-sam to the People's Republic 
of China is well-timed to witness and review the ongoing flows 
of cooperation the two countries are now pursuing, and consider 
and design the future scheme of joint undertakings the two 
countries will pursue in furtherance of the common interest and 
engagement for a better two-way Sino-ROK relationship and 
expanded East and Asian Pacific multiway co-operation. 
  The visit will provide an excellent occasion for the people 
and business communities of both sides to recognize the 
sentiment of peace and stability prevailing between the two 
countries and among this region. The two countries are destined 
to share fate of partnership in promoting prosperity of people 
and the peace of nations between ROK and China and among the 
East and Asia Pacific countries. 
  I sincerely wish the visit and stay here of President Kim is 
most successful and enjoyable and his meeting and dialogue with 
the leader and the people of the People's Republic of China most 
fruitful and rewarding.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Xingdu: "Closer Ties Draw More ROK </F>
Cash"] 
  [Text] The Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam's 
visit to China will send the flourishing trade to a new high. 
  Kim's visit, which kicked off on Saturday, coincides with a 
new investment boom in China by more ROK companies. 
  Investment by large companies, such as Hyundai, Lucky 
Goldstar, Daewoo and Sunkyoung, has surged in particular. 
  Chances are good that these companies will win bids for 
China's major infrastructure projects. 
  The projects include the Beijing subways, dams on the Yellow 
and Yangtze rivers, railways in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region, telecommunication facilities and offshore oil 
development. 
  Aside from energy, environmental protection and 
pharmaceutical sectors, ROK companies are also competitive in 
electronics and machinery industries. 
  The two countries still enjoy good co-operation in the 
aerospace industry. 
  The Republic of Korea has listed 36 products as its top 
exports, which include freight cars, auto parts and 
refrigerators. 
  In September last year, the two countries convened a 
high-level meeting to discuss the reduction of tariffs on ROK's 
exports to China and the proportion of products by joint 
ventures to be sold back to ROK markets. 
  The meeting paved the way for more ROK investment in China's 
technology and capital-intensive projects. 
  The two sides also have agreed to set up a special work 
panel 
to oversee co-operative plans. 
  According to the agreement, ROK is responsible for 
industrial, commercial, joint venture and energy projects, while 
China takes on technology, information and market development. 
  Despite this progress, China has suffered a deficit in the 
past few years, as much as $2.5 billion in 1993. 
  Chinese officials have complained that while ROK exports to 
the mainland enjoy favourable terms, Chinese exports face 
deteriorating conditions. 
  ROK has restricted imports of grain and other agricultural 
products from China to protect its domestic market from being 
squeezed. 
  And it still restricts Chinese business people from entering 
its territory. 
  But on the Chinese side, the undesirable trade systems have 
yet to be improved to further meet international demands. 
  China has in many cases imposed non-tariff measures to limit 
imports, and such measures are not known to the outsiders. 
  But China has agreed to make public all its regulations to 
rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this 
year. 
  It has become the largest overseas market for ROK 
investment. 
Most of the investment has ended up in shoes, leather, garments, 
furniture, electronics and building materials sectors.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) asked the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) on Thursday [24 March] to cancel its 
resolution on the nuclear issue which urges the nation to accept 
another inspection. 
  A spokesman from the DPRK's General Bureau of Atomic Energy 
stressed that the nuclear inspections his country received in 
early March "had been fully proved the peaceful aim of the 
DPRK's nuclear program." 
  But, the IAEA's Board of Governors adopted a resolution on 
March 21, claiming that its inspections over the DPRK's 
suspected nuclear facilities early this month could not prove 
whether it was using its nuclear material for military purposes 
or not. 
  It also threatened to refer the DPRK nuclear dispute to the 
United Nations Security Council. 
  Today's official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" also quoted the 
spokesman as saying that the DPRK had no obligation to accept 
IAEA's regular or irregular inspections because it had promised 
not to withdraw from the international Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty at present. 
  Under such special conditions, the DPRK could only accept 
inspections aimed at safeguarding the consistency of its nuclear 
security, the spokesman added. 
  He also criticized the IAEA Secretariat for its unfair 
stance 
towards DPRK's nuclear development program, demanding that the 
Secretariat should suspend the resolution based on what he 
described as its "wrong appraisal." 
  The newspaper also warned that the DPRK would pull out of 
the 
international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the end if the 
United States kept pressuring it over the nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Isolating the DPRK Will Not Work"] </F>
  [Text] In the past week, the situation on the Korean 
peninsula has been escalating to a military confrontation. ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam called an emergency cabinet meeting and 
declared that the ROK's 600,000-strong armed forces were on war 
alert. Immediately responding to the ROK's request, the United 
States started deploying Patriot missiles in the ROK and 
preparing for the resumption of U.S.-ROK joint military 
exercises. U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said that the United 
States had delivered 160 Patriot missiles to the ROK, and if the 
United Nations adopted a resolution of sanctions against the 
DPRK, the United States would deliver more armed forces and 
weapons to the ROK. 
  The escalation of the military situation is mainly due to 
man- made factors. Over the past year, the Korean situation 
alternated between tense and relaxed situations. Last March, 
the DPRK abruptly announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty to oppose the "Team Spirit 93" joint 
military exercise held between U.S. and ROK armed forces, thus 
causing concern among the international community. The DPRK 
also carried out frequent air defense maneuvers and proclaimed 
blackouts. As a consequence, both the ROK and the DPRK were 
almost on war alert. Later, the United States took the 
initiative to negotiate with the DPRK about the differences on 
the issue of de-nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The dialogue 
bore fruit. Last February, the DPRK reached agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the United States 
separately, agreeing to allow personnel dispatched by the IAEA 
to "carry out inspections which intend to guarantee continuous 
nuclear safety." Meanwhile, the DPRK and the ROK held talks at 
Panmunjom from 3 to 16 March to discuss the issue of reciprocal 
envoy visits. Originally, the atmosphere of the Korean 
peninsula can be gradually improved through dialogue. 
  In early March, the IAEA dispatched a six-member nuclear 
inspection team to the DPRK for investigation. They inspected 
seven nuclear facilities, but after returning to Geneva, they 
complained that the DPRK obstructed them from taking away a 
sample from a chemical research institution. As proved by the 
development of events, the fact that the Security Council urged 
the DPRK to let the IAEA "complete all the necessary inspection 
work" implied that the DPRK had opened its seven nuclear 
facilities, but the remaining problem was the DPRK was not 
cooperative enough in obstructing the inspection team from 
taking away a sample. The DPRK defended itself against the 
censure, pointing out that the IAEA had inspected and put a seal 
on the facility as well as installed monitoring instruments 
there, but the inspection team contradicted themselves and it 
was unreasonable for them to insist on tearing off the seal and 
taking away a sample again. 
  It seems that we cannot describe the DPRK as uncooperative 
but we can only say that the DPRK objected to tearing off the 
seal for reexamination. Originally, such differences could be 
settled through talks. However, when the northern and southern 
sides of Korea discussed the matter at Panmunjom, they traded 
vicious remarks against each other, including those concerning 
the issue of U.S.-ROK military exercise. Hence, the situation 
took a sudden turn and the issue of U.S.-ROK military exercise 
escalated to U.S. deployment of more weapons and more troops in 
the ROK. 
  The United States has openly asserted that the DPRK must 
yield to U.S. pressure to accept nuclear inspection, otherwise 
the Security Council will impose sanctions on it. 
  However, the international community does not consent to 
using the Security Council's sanctions to settle the problem. 
The main reason is that since the DPRK does not trade with most 
countries, measures taken by the Security Council to isolate the 
DPRK will not affect the latter very much, but will rather make 
things worse. East Asian countries always seek stability to 
facilitate the peaceful construction of Asia. The United States 
can look on indifferently after making a mess of the situation. 
However, if a war breaks out in the Korean peninsula, refugees 
will flee hither and thither, and Japan, the ROK, China, and 
Russia will bear the brunt of it. The Korean Peninsula issue 
never endangers the security of Western European countries. If 
someone in the Security Council proposes troop deployment, 
Western European countries will not be ready to share the 
military expenditure, whereas Japan will not be eager to worsen 
the situation. At that time, the United States will become more 
isolated. Russia has called for an international meeting 
attended by various sides related to the situation of the Korean 
peninsula, including Russia, China, the United States, Japan, 
the ROK, and the DPRK, to settle the problem. Russia maintained 
that sanctions should not be made a first priority but rather 
political and diplomatic means should be used. Under the 
influence of moderates at home, the ROK's foreign minister also 
said that it was a "bad idea" to impose sanctions on the DPRK 
and that the problem could only be settled with China's 
assistance. 
  Former U.S. President Bush also gave his advice to the 
Clinton Administration: "At present, the most important thing 
is to preserve the U.S. leading position in the world rather 
than to deal with the trade imbalance. If we are worried about 
the Korean peninsula issue and Pyongyang's development of 
nuclear weapons, we need China's help." 
  Various countries in the world do not agree with the U.S. 
suggestion of taking punitive military actions against the DPRK 
because Pyongyang is passively on the defensive and has never 
sent troops to attack the south, whereas the United States has 
exhibited its strength menacingly, and the ROK Radio even 
declared that "Seoul and Washington have drawn up a plan to 
overthrow the DPRK Government." Therefore, various countries 
are not willing to add fuel to the flames and worsen the 
situation, whereas the ROK hopes that China can exert its 
influence on the DPRK so that the latter will take more flexible 
measures. Clinton probably knew that it would be quite 
infeasible to take a hard line on this matter, so he played the 
China card, extending his "thanks to China for striving to stop 
the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons." However, China has 
made its stand very clearly known. China reasserts that the 
problem should be settled through dialogue and that, as proven 
by past facts, exerting pressure on a country by imposing 
sanctions on it can only lead to a tense situation, whereas only 
dialogue can make a breakthrough. In implementing its Asia 
policy, the United States should respect the aspiration of Asian 
countries in seeking peace and stability and make it a basis for 
consultation and cooperation with Asia. The problem cannot be 
settled by isolating the DPRK. Only when we win over the DPRK 
and help it return to the international community, can a more 
constructive situation emerge.

  [Text] In Beijing on the afternoon of 10 March, the 
Guangxi delegates to the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] unfolded deliberations on Premier Li 
Peng's work report. During the deliberations, the Guangxi NPC 
deputies discussed and formulated a new blueprint for Guangxi's 
economic growth in light of the region's realities, exchanged 
views on a series of national issues, and pledged to make 
concerted efforts to grasp each and every opportunity to deepen 
reform and develop the economy. 
  Zhao Fulin [secretary of the regional party committee] 
said: Premier Li Peng's work report embodied the spirit of the 
14th CPC National Congress, realistically summed up the 
country's work over the past year, and laid down encouraging 
tasks for this year's work. Since the First Session of the 
Eighth NPC, the people of all nationalities across Guangxi, like 
people in other parts of the country, have unremittingly taken 
as a guide Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, firmly adhered to the party's 
basic line, and grasped each and every excellent opportunity to 
deepen reform, with the result that Guangxi has enjoyed an 
excellent situation with respect to nationality solidarity, 
social stability, and economic growth. This year, the central 
authorities are expected to unfold a series of reforms. We are 
bound to encounter a host of difficulties and problems in this 
process. In view of the situation, we should show concern for 
the country's overall interests, observe discipline, and work 
harder in a down-to-earth manner. 
  Zhao Fulin stated: In order to implement the spirit of the 
current NPC session to the letter, it is imperative to make a 
success of the following three aspects of work: 1) Deepening 
reform -- In order to make a success of reform in 1994, we 
should further emancipate our minds, transform ideological 
concepts, properly handle ideological issues among cadres and 
the masses, and resolve all types of social contradictions, 
thereby making ourselves more adaptable to the new situation. 
2) Working with one heart and one mind -- To this end, the 
higher and lower levels should share weal and woe, and should 
forge ahead jointly by braving wind and wave in the interests of 
the whole country. The whole country's economic development and 
growing economic strength definitely will push Guangxi's 
economic development ahead, and will raise the Guangxi people's 
living standards as well. To develop the economy, we should 
build more communications and energy projects, establish more 
overseas trade links, construct more infrastructure facilities, 
improve the investment environment, readjust the industrial 
structure, make more use of advanced science and technology, and 
invigorate enterprises, as well as increase economic efficiency. 
3) Strengthening unity within leading bodies, enhancing 
nationality solidarity, intensifying comprehensive social order 
management, persistently furthering the anticorruption struggle, 
successfully carrying out propaganda and ideological work, and 
stepping up legal system building. 
  Cheng Kejie [chairman of the regional people's government] 
stated: Reviewing last year's work and looking forward to this 
year's development, I am convinced that our party and country 
are still full of hope. Last year, the whole country enjoyed 
rapid economic growth, social stability, and improved livelihood 
-- thanks to good leadership, correct policies, and stronger 
efforts. This year, we are going to build more construction 
projects in Guangxi. In view of this situation, apart from 
redoubling efforts in this regard, we should conscientiously 
study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three; arm 
our minds with, and update ideological concepts according to 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory; unify understanding; enhance a 
sense of urgency; treasure and seize each and every excellent 
opportunity to deepen reform; improve the investment 
environment; readjust the industrial structure; and provide more 
assistance to poverty-stricken areas; thereby pushing ahead with 
Guangxi's economic growth and social progress. 
  During the deliberations, Ren Xianchun and Xia Baofang, as 
well as other Guangxi NPC deputies, also spoke one after another 
in light of their respective local realities, putting forward 
work proposals for this year and views on Premier Li Peng's work 
report.

  [Text] At 1500 on 10 March, the first day of the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], the 
Henan NPC Delegation held a news conference at the Guoli Hotel, 
its Beijing residence. 
  Li Changchun -- provincial NPC delegation leader, provincial 
party committee secretary, and provincial people's congress 
standing committee chairman -- took the floor first at the 
conference, briefing reporters from many news units on the 
situation in Henan Province. Li Changchun said: Located in the 
hinterland, Henan is a populous, agricultural, and interior 
province. Since reform and opening up, and especially over the 
past few years, the Henan Provincial CPC Committee and People's 
Government have made unreserved efforts to attain the strategic 
goals of raising Henan's gross national product to a level 
higher than the country's average and of lowering Henan's 
natural population growth rate to a level lower than the 
country's average. They have called on the Henan people to 
follow the Red Flag Canal Spirit of the people of Linxian County 
by carrying out diligent and pioneering work in a down-to- earth 
manner; holding aloft the banner of enhanced unity and constant 
rejuvenation of Henan; inviting advanced foreign technology and 
expertise; and establishing lateral economic associations with 
other provinces and regions. As a result, Henan's economic 
growth has been pushed forward to a large extent, as well as on 
an extensive scale. Now Henan has been rated the ninth largest 
industrial province in the country. Speaking of Henan's 
development prospects, Li Changchun stated: Henan is rich in 
natural resources, boasts convenient communications, and 
promises excellent development prospects. Henan's development 
prospects can be boiled down to good momentum and great 
potential, coupled with enormous difficulties. 
  In answering questions raised by the reporters, Li Changchun 
noted: Henan is a large interior and agricultural province. 
The total population in Henan's old liberated areas, 
mountainous areas, and areas along the Huang He amounts to 7 
million. Henan still lags far behind the country's coastal 
areas in terms of economic development, partly due to the lack 
of good policies, but mainly due to the lack of internal 
dynamism. We hope to be granted more preferential policies so 
as to push forward Henan's economic development. 
  Provincial leaders -- such as Fan Qinchen, Zhang Zhigang, 
Qin 
Kecai, and others -- also attended and answered reporters' 
questions at the news conference.

  [Text] While carrying out an investigation in Xiangfan, 
provincial party committee Secretary Guan Guangfu stressed the 
need to firmly grasp the implementation of various measures to 
maintain the sound momentum of reform and opening up in the 
province since the beginning of this year. Guan Guangfu arrived 
in Xiangfan on 18 March. During his six-day stay, he went down 
to a dozen or so factories and rural areas in Suizhou, Zhouyang, 
Xiangyang, and Yicheng. He talked with the broad cadres and 
masses to find out about the actual conditions, heard their 
opinions and requirements, and discussed with them the major 
plan for accelerating reform and development. 
  Last year, Xiangfan's economic growth rate and returns were 
higher than the average level in the country and the province, 
and fulfilled the Eighth Five-Year Plan two years ahead of 
schedule. This year, Xiangfan has set itself a new target of 
high-rate growth. Encouraged by the strategic decision of the 
provincial party committee on building Xiangfan into a large 
city, people of the whole city are in high spirits, and are 
striving to catch up with and overtake one another. Since the 
beginning of this year, the city's economy has maintained a 
strong momentum of development. 
  Through several days of investigation, Guan Guangfu 
conducted 
a discussion meeting with Xiangfan city and county leading 
cadres. He said: What left the deepest impression on me along 
the way is a precious state of mind. People have emancipated 
their minds; they are bold in exploration; they have united as 
one, from the top to the grass roots; they are going all-out, 
with the focus on accelerating reform, opening up, and 
modernization. That the city set itelf the goal of learning 
from Suzhou, catching up with Xingzhou, aiming high, and 
creating first-rate results, is an expression of voluntarily 
assigning tasks and putting pressure on itself, which embodies 
the high criteria and strict requirements set by Xiangfan's 
communists on themselves. 
  Guan Guangfu said that without the presence of a few 
pillars, 
it would be out of the question for the province to maintain the 
momentum of a high growth rate. Xiangfan should continue to 
play an exemplary role in Hubei, and make concrete the measures 
for achieving the targets this year. He said that today, when 
the market competition is extraordinarily intense, the gap in 
the levels of economic development is actually widening between 
some places. However, we must see that this widening is relative 
when all places are developing simultaneously. Besides, we 
should see that some models typical of developing by leaps and 
bounds have surfaced. Such development by leaps and bounds 
embodies the degree to which enterprises are linking themselves 
to the market, minds are being emancipated, and work is being 
carried out. It is a newborn thing and a fresh experience under 
the conditions of the socialist market economy, and it 
represents the orientation of development. Such models typical 
of developing by leaps and bounds can be found in various 
places. They should be studied and perceived earnestly, and the 
law governing such leaps should be explored and used to educate 
our cadres, complete and perfect our train of thought, and spur 
us on to pursue high-rate growth. 
  On accelerating rural development, Guan Guangfu reiterated 
the need to increase the weight of industrial development in the 
wake of readjusting the ratio between industry and agriculture 
on the basis of stabilizing agriculture. In the wake of 
readjusting the ratio between grain, cotton and edible oil, and 
diversified management on the basis of stabilizing the output of 
grain, cotton and edible oil, the weight of diversified 
management should be increased. That is the inevitable and only 
way to make the county, village, and people rich. 
  In the wake of the provincial party committee making the 
decision on building several large cities in Hubei, Xiangfan has 
regarded this as a very good chance to enhance a city's 
comprehensive ability and develop its staying power. Xiangfan 
was ahead of others in perceiving this point and was quick to 
take action. Guan Guangfu was very happy about this. He said: 
The provincial party committee's decision was an important 
strategic one to insure Hubei's sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development [jing ji ci xu kuai su jiang kang fa zhan], 
it was also the pressing need of Xiangfan in its continuous 
development. In building a modern city system, it is necessary 
to grasp two points: First, the building of large cities, and 
second, paying attention to building of small towns. Only by 
grasping these two points -- while bringing along the middle 
section -- both industry and agriculture, both urban and rural 
areas will be taken care of. 
  Guan Guangfu indicated that at present, various places have 
met difficulties to various degrees, which should be resolved 
through reform, development, and stabilization, and with the 
understanding and support of workers, peasants, and 
intellectuals. The greater the enthusiasm the masses show, the 
more their efforts are prized. Party and government leading 
comrades at all levels should go deep into realities, carry out 
investigation and study, conduct organization with care, work in 
a down-to-earth way, and do a good job in resolving practical 
problems. 
  Accompanying Guan Guangfu in the investigation and study 
were 
Deng Guozheng, member of the provincial party committee standing 
committee, and Yang Binxin, secretary of the Xiangfan party 
committee.

  [Text] Since the 1990's, our province's population 
situation has gradually changed from the previous sustained and 
rapid growth into a low growth stage. According to statistics 
issued by the provincial statistics bureau, the birthrate of the 
whole province in 1993 dropped to 14.08 per thousand, and the 
natural growth rate fell to 6.95 per thousand. Population 
increase rate was more than 50 percent lower the average rate in 
the 1980's. 
  Since last year units at all levels and various localities 
have conscientiously summed up their previous experiences. On 
this basis, they have increased the weight of family planning 
work,and enhanced the scientific level of the work. From the 
highest organizations down to the grass roots, a series of 
guiding principles, policies, and measures which suit the 
present situation have been formulated. The provincial CPC 
committee and government have strengthened their leadership over 
family planning work and provided systematized guidance for 
various prefectures, autonomous prefecture, cities and counties, 
and signed relevant contracts with governments at all levels. 
They assess and examine their goal-direct management 
responsibility system every year. They closely link the results 
of family planning work with the achievements of leaders at all 
levels, main party and government leaders in particular. They 
also link leaders' responsibility with their obligations and 
power. Thanks to persistent efforts to carry out propaganda and 
education on family planning work over the past few years, in 
addition to the gradual development of old-age pension and 
insurance undertakings in rural area related to economic growth, 
peasants have also markedly changed their concept on child 
births. Some 97 percent of peasants maintain that it is best to 
have one or two children. Among those babies born in 1993, 80 
percent were the first child, and only 2 percent were third 
children or more.

  [Text] Changsha, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Science and 
technology are playing an increasing role in Hunan, one of 
China's major agricultural provinces. 
  Last year a total of 100 items of advanced farm technology 
were introduced into the province, remarkably increasing 
agricultural output value. 
  Despite serious natural disasters, this central province's 
total grain output was 26.31 million tons last year, with per 
unit area yields of rice and cotton ranking the highest in the 
country. 
  Its production of pork, oranges, tea and fresh-water fish 
were also among the highest in the country. 
  As the birthplace of hybrid rice, Hunan boasts a large 
number 
of well-known agricultural experts such as Yuan Longping, Li 
Bihu, Zhou Kunlu, Kang Chunlin and Zhou Guangqia, who have 
succeeded in breeding a series of new varieties of three-stage 
hybrid rice after years of efforts. 
  In 1993 the province planted 2.26 million ha. Of hybrid 
rice, increasing rice production by over 1.5 billion kg. 
  And this year it plans to plant 2.4 million ha. Of hybrid 
rice. 
  The experimental planting of "Hengliangyou No.1", a 
two-stage 
hybrid rice, has yielded good results. Its average per ha 
output is over 7,800 kg. 
  Last year, it planted 6,000 ha. of "Hengliangyou No. 1" in 
experiment and plans to grow 53,000 ha. to 67,000 ha. this year. 
  The province has also succeeded in developing two-stage 
wheat, sorghum and crossbred chili, as well as new varieties of 
carp, pigs and cows. 
  Since 1986 the province has had over 500 agricultural 
scientific and technological projects that have won state- or 
province-level awards. They have produced an annually 
additional income of over three billion yuan (about 350 million 
U.S. dollars) for the province. 
  Hunan has nearly 20,000 agricultural experts and technicians 
working at state and collective research institutes, as well as 
435,400 grassroots farm technicians. 
  In recent years the province has set up agricultural science 
and education centers in 2,100 townships, 70 percent of the 
total. They are playing an important role in helping farmers to 
learn new skills and raise their cultural level. 
  The nationally renowned Hunan radio agriculture school has 
enrolled 176,600 students, 56,000 of whom have graduated with 
diplomas of polytechnic school education. 
  The province also attaches importance to publishing and 
spreading new technologies and skills. "HUNAN AGRICULTURE", a 
leading agricultural magazine, has a subscription of 600,000 
nationwide. 
  Agriculture officials say that the majority of farmers in 
Hunan have mastered new techniques for applying fertilizers and 
planting new breeds of grain and cotton. 
  Local peasants have also realized the importance and 
advantages of using new techniques and skills in farm production. 
  At the same time, Hunan has strengthened farm technical 
services and supervision of seed and crop quality.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- During the Second 
Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], Li Ruihuan, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, met and had 
a cordial conversation with [Yaoxi Sulangzhuoma], a CPPCC member 
who was attending the session in Beijing and the mother of the 
Tenth Panchen Lama. 
  Li Ruihuan said: I am very pleased to meet you. The Panchen 
Lama and I were good friends. His death has deprived our 
country of a very prestigious religious leader, and our party 
has lost a good friend. The Panchen made outstanding 
contributions to Tibet's development and stability and to 
China's nationality and religious work. I hope there will be 
more nationality and religious figures like the Panchen, who was 
dedicated to safeguarding the unification of the motherland and 
to promoting national unity and economic development. This is 
the basic guarantee for stability, prosperity, and development 
in the nationality areas. [passage omitted] [Yaoxi 
Sulangzhuoma] said gratefully: I am 78 this year and very 
healthy. I am grateful to the party Central Committee, the CPC 
Central Committee United Front Work Department, and the Tibetan 
and Qinghai authorities for their concern for me. To express 
her gratefulness, she presented a piece of scarf to Li Ruihuan. 
  Present at meeting were Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the 
CPPCC National Committee and director of the CPC Central 
Committee United Front Work Department, and deputy head of the 
department Li Dezhu [Li Dek Su].

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- State Councillor, Ms. 
Peng Peiyun, speaking at the second meeting of the board of 
directors of the China Population Welfare Foundation recently 
held here, said that though there had been a continuous drop in 
the birthrate in recent years, the population in the country was 
still facing grim prospects. 
  According to Ms. Peng, China is seeing over 20 million 
births 
annually with a net growth in the country's population of about 
14 million, causing the absolute number of births in the country 
to still remain very large and putting a heavy burden on the 
country. 
  Ms. Peng said that since there was a big gap between the 
state family planning policy and the desire for having children 
by farmers, the policy on family planning in the country was 
being carried out mainly through powerful executive measures and 
if there was any relaxation in this sector, the birth rate would 
soon deteriorate further. 
  The country has seen a serious problem in imbalance in the 
control of population growth in the country with 
children-bearing women in the 7 provinces and autonomous regions 
of Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet, Ningxia and 
Xinjiang to be in their peak birth state between 1997 and 2000. 
The country is, according to Ms. Peng, aso facing arduous tasks 
in the raising of the quality of population. The country now 
has 51.64 million disabled people, accounting for 2.4 percent of 
its total population, the disabled at the age of 0 to 14 years 
make up 3.66 percent of the total of the same age group, 65.96 
percent of whom are suffering from a mental problem. The rate 
of physical defects in newly-born babies is 1.3 percent of the 
total births in the country with Shanxi having a rate of 2 
percent, ranking the province first in the country. There are 
400 million people living in areas with an iodine-shortage 
problem, making up 40 percent o the total population facing the 
same problem in the world. Illiterate and semi-illiterate 
people in the country are now put at over 180 million with 
females accounting for 70 percent, posing a problem for the 
control of population growth and the raising of quality of 
people. 
  In addition, there are many problems in the population 
structure with boy births far exceeding those of girls. Owing 
to the drop in births and increasing life-span, China will enter 
peak aging society in the next century.

  [Text] Yesterday morning [12 March], State Council Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua attended a panel discussion held by the 
Sichuan delegation to the current Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  During the panel session, Zou Jiahua joined the Sichuan NPC 
deputies in discussing state affairs. He said: We should work 
for common prosperity, attach great importance to the 
development of western China, step up the development of 
Sichuan's communications and telecommunications, and 
successfully and rapidly develop the Sichuan economy. 
  The Sichuan NPC deputies spoke without inhibition, and 
deliberated on Premier Li Peng's work report in a conscientious 
manner. While Chen Guanjun, Wang Rongsheng, and other Sichuan 
NPC deputies were speaking, Zou Jiahua conscientiously listened 
to their views and jotted down some notes. Zou Jiahua also 
exchanged views at the panel discussion with Xie Shijie 
[secretary of the provincial party committee], Xiao Yang 
[governor], and Yang Xizong [chairman of the provincial people's 
congress standing committee]. 
  Zou Jiahua noted at the panel discussion: We should pay 
attention to protecting, guiding, and mobilizing the enthusiasm 
of the masses, and should develop the economy in accordance with 
the law of economic operation, as well as in light of the actual 
local conditions. The construction of the Three Gorges Project 
is of paramount importance. We should conscientiously study and 
tackle problems relating to soil, sand, and silt in the project 
area, as well as the water pollution problem, and strive to make 
a success of water and soil conservation along the upper reaches 
of the Changjiang so as to benefit future generations. 
  At the conclusion, Zou Jiahua stressed: In the course of 
economic development, Sichuan should give top priority to the 
development of communications and telecommunications, these 
being key to Sichuan's overall economic growth. Moreover, 
Sichuan should make full use of the "gold water course" of the 
Changjiang. To this end, the provincial and central departments 
concerned should work out overall arrangements for developing 
Sichuan's communications and should build the relevant 
facilities more rapidly.

  [Text] The Yunnan delegation to the Second Session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held a heated discussion 
on Premier Li Peng's work report in Beijing yesterday. The 
Yunnan NPC deputies mainly discussed issues like grasping 
opportunities; deepening reform; and promoting faster economic 
growth in the border and ethnic minority areas. 
  Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee 
and a Yunnan NPC deputy, was interviewed by this reporter in the 
Yunnan Delegation's Beijing residence yesterday. Pu Chaozhu 
said: I feel deeply that Premier Li Peng's work report has 
comprehensively embodied the spirit of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee. At present we are undergoing a 
strategic transformation, from a planned economy structure into 
a socialist market economy structure. In this process, we 
should implement unswervingly and to the letter a series of 
reform measures promulgated by the central authorities and 
should actively carry out all sorts of work in light of Yunnan's 
actual conditions. 
  Pu Chaozhu noted: Yunnan still implements a unitary 
ownership system, as well as a unitary industrial structure, 
which inevitably have impaired the development of the productive 
forces. In Yunnan's gross national product, the publicly owned 
economy accounts for 89 percent, and the private and individual 
economy, 11 percent. The facts have borne out that the more 
economically and culturally backward a region is, the more 
unitary is the region's system of ownership. Therefore, Yunnan 
should take the road of keeping the public ownership system in 
the dominant position, while at the same time vigorously 
developing divergent economic factors. In this process, we 
should make unreserved efforts to emancipate our minds and 
disentangle ourselves from ideological debates aimed at 
distinguishing socialism from capitalism. As long as we proceed 
in this orientation, we certainly will be able to develop the 
productive forces more expeditiously in a remote and 
ethnic-minority province like Yunnan. 
  Speaking of industrial readjustment, Pu Chaozhu stressed: 
Since 1984, Yunnan has made unceasing efforts to push ahead 
with industrial structural readjustment. After eight to nine 
years of hard work, we finally have succeeded in building a 
batch of superior local industries -- including tobacco, sugar, 
tea, and other industries -- the development of which has helped 
to raise the province's financial revenue from 1.1 billion yuan 
in 1983 to 20 billion yuan in 1993. At present, we are 
undergoing another round of drastic industrial structural 
shakeup. In view of this situation -- in addition to 
successfully building infrastructure facilities and developing 
educational, scientific, and technological undertakings -- we 
should focus on building in some selected areas a batch of 
backbone industries capable of generating 10 billion yuan or 5 
billion yuan in output each, thereby turning Yunnan's unitary 
industrial structure into a strong collective industrial 
structure. In view of the province's conditions and resources, 
as well as its domestic and overseas market demands, we should 
continue to develop Yunnan's superior tobacco industry, and to 
devote greater energy to the machinery and electronics, sugar, 
nonferrous and precious metal smelting and processing, chemical, 
iron and steel, building and building materials, forestry, and 
food and soft drinks industries, as well as tourism, in addition 
to the development of other industries. 
  In conclusion, Pu Chaozhu stressed: In order to accelerate 
Yunnan's economic growth, we should press ahead energetically 
with the reform of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises; gradually implement and develop a joint-stock 
system; vigorously develop town and township enterprises; bring 
about a fundamental revolution in modes of production and 
operation; and strive to push Yunnan's economic growth onto a 
new stage over the next seven to 10 years.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Chengzhi and He Zili: "China's Reform </F>
Proceeds in Atmosphere of Social Stability"] 
  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- After over a decade's 
implementation of reform and opening to the outside world, a 
situation that political stability, reform and development 
promote each other has emerged in China. 
  This was the consensus and a hot topic among deputies at the 
recently closed session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC). 
  Most of the deputies held that the persistence of social 
stability has promoted the reform and economic progress. And in 
return reform and economic progress are helping maintain 
long-term stability in the country. 
  "This is the fundamental experience of the 15 years of 
reform 
and opening to the outside world in China," they said. 
  The maintenance of social stability in this huge country 
with 
a population of 1.1 billion while facing an arduous and 
complicated transfer of the economic system is regarded as a 
miracle by many foreigners. 
  While carrying out the reform, China attaches importance to 
its own conditions and has adopted different methods for 
different stages. 
  The reform first started in rural areas, and new reform 
measures are usually taken after experiments and then spread 
step by step. 
  The pursuit of the reform has never been conducted at the 
cost of lowering the living standards of the people. 
  Over the past 15 years the national economy has made a 
sustained and rapid development. The gross domestic product 
increased from 358.8 billion yuan (about 44 billion U.S. 
dollars) in 1978 to 3,138 billion yuan (about 404 billion U.S. 
dollars) last year. 
  The per capita income of urban residents went up from 343 
yuan a year in 1978 (38.5 U.S. dollars) to 2,337 yuan (262.5 
U.S. dollars) last year; and the per capita income of rural 
residents increased from 145 yuan a year (16.29 U.S. dollars) in 
1978 to 921 yuan (103.48 U.S. dollars) in 1993. 
  Consequently, peasants' living standards have been improved 
greatly. Color TV sets, video-recorders, washing machines and 
refrigerators have become common appliances, no longer luxury 
goods, for most Chinese. 
  The country's markets are brisk, with adequate supplies, and 
the cultural life is now more colorful. 
  With the deepening of economic reform, democracy and 
legislation efforts have been greatly enhanced in state 
political activities. 
  The people's congress and multi-party democratic 
consultation 
systems have been much improved. The Chinese people now enjoy 
much more democracy and freedom. 
  At the recent session of the NPC and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, deputies offered more than 
1,000 proposals and opinions on key state tasks, and political, 
economic, cultural and diplomatic affairs. 
  China's top leaders attended each delegation's discussions 
to 
listen to their opinions and criticisms. 
  The Chinese people are deeply involved in the country's 
reform and construction, and cherish the current social 
stability. 
  1994 is a key year for China to carry out a series of new 
reforms in finance, taxation and enterprises. The Chinese 
Government pledged to adopt measures to ensure the progress of 
reform and economic development under conditions of social 
stability. 
  The Chinese Government has set the economic growth rate at 
nine percent for 1994, in the bid to avoid inflation caused by 
excessive investment and construction scale. 
  The financial reform will be centered on strengthening the 
functions of the central bank. 
  The implementation of the financial reform stage by stage 
will suit the needs of various enterprises, especially state 
major industrial enterprises. 
  China's taxation reform hinges on a tax-revenue sharing 
system between the central and local governments, while carrying 
out readjustment of taxation structure. 
  The tax reform has given full consideration of the interest 
of both the state and enterprises, and the central and 
localities which are supported by some transitional policies. 
  The tax reform is now proceeding very well, said Jin Xin, 
deputy head of the State Taxation Administration. 
  The enterprise reform will lead to corporatization of the 
majority of state-owned enterprises. 
  A number of enterprises will be closed down and merged 
during 
the reform, but that will not lead to widespread unemployment, 
said officials of the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economy. 
  As the country's social insurance system has begun playing 
its role, the unemployed will obtain social relief funds in time 
and get retrained through job centers. 
  Some people were at the first worried about introducing a 
single exchange rate in the country. However, facts have proved 
that after unifying the foreign exchange rate against the 
renminbi, the foreign exchange market has been stable, with the 
U.S. dollar exchanging for about 8.70 yuan. That is about the 
exchange rate at the swap market late last year. 
  China used to have two exchange rates for foreign currency 
-- 
the officials rate and the swap market rate. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of 
economic 
work, said that after a series of reform measures have been 
adopted this year, the prices, markets and society are stable. 
"That has convinced us more about the correctness of the 
direction of reform," he said. 
  Years of practice have proved that development is the 
target, 
reform is the motive and stability is the guarantee and 
prerequisite for China. These three aspects are linked and 
influence each other.

  [Excerpt] Beijing has sent investigation teams to the 
localities to stop the loss of state assets, estimated at nearly 
100 million yuan (HK$88.8 million) [Hong Kong dollars] a day 
late last year. 
  Much of this drain of state property has taken place as 
government-owned firms are partially privatised through being 
converted into shareholding companies. 
  State Council cadres have warned that in their eagerness to 
attract foreign capital to take over unprofitable state 
enterprises, regional officials have undervalued state assets. 
  Informed sources said the teams were also investigating 
allegations of corruption in the many instances in which state 
assets had been transformed into the personal holdings of the 
owners of newly formed shareholding companies. 
  The sources said a team of 30 officials was recently 
dispatched to Guangzhou and Shenzhen to find out why some of the 
most efficient state factories in the two southern cities had 
been sold to private-sector entrepreneurs or converted into 
shareholding units where Hong Kong and overseas companies held 
large stakes. 
  The officials came from central Government units including 
the National Administrative Bureau of State-Owned Property, the 
State Planning Commission and the auditing authorities. In 
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the investigators said the more robust 
units should stay with the state and not be privatised. 
  Economic sources in Shenzhen said central officials were 
also 
concerned about the flow of capital much of it state assets, out 
of the Special Economic Zone into other provinces. 
  Publicly, the Shenzhen leadership has admitted that four 
billion yuan worth of capital had left the zone since 1991. The 
sources said, however, that internal estimates put the drain at 
more than 20 billion yuan. "Much of the funds that have left 
Shenzhen have been invested in new enterprises in inland 
provinces," a source said. 
  "The authorities are worried that in setting up the new 
companies, state asset have been transformed into private 
holdings." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Xia: "Successes Mixed With </F>
Anxiety"] 
  [Text] The distinctive cultures of the 55 minority 
nationalities in China are preserved on paper, stones, wood or 
just plain passed on orally from generation to generation. 
  "This is an indispensable part of the treasure-house of 
China's history, and it is urgent to rescue and protect this 
precious heritage," said Li Dongsheng of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission (SNAC). 
  China has always attached great importance to protecting 
minority culture. 
  As far back as 1952, Premier Zhou Enlai suggested collecting 
and publishing ancient books of ethnic minorities. But due to 
the ensuing political chaos, the work did not start until the 
1980s. 
  In August 1984, upon State Council approval, the 
Nationalities Affairs Commission started to prepare for the 
collection and research of ancient books of minorities published 
before the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). 
  Offices, research centres and publishing houses were set up 
in 24 provinces and autonomous regions, with money coming from 
regional revenue. 
  Generally, ancient books refer to those written before the 
Qing. Since some minorities have a short history, books written 
in their language before 1949 are also included, according to Li. 
  These books cover a wide range of fields: philosophy, 
literature, history, astronomy, medicine, architecture, music 
and painting. 
  Research found that the Yi nationality boasts 10,000 volumes 
of ancient publications. A book on medicine, included more than 
370 prescriptions. Investigations show it was finished 17 years 
earlier than the Compendium of Materia Medica, a world-famous 
book on medicine written by Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty 
(1368-1644). 
  Mongolia and Man nationalities, founders of the Yuan 
11271-1368) and Qing dynasties, left large numbers of official 
documents in addition to folk tales. These documents have 
far-reaching significance in historical studies of the two 
dynasties. 
  The collection and publication of these books help minority 
nationalities better know their own history. 
  It also signifies the equality of all nationalities. 
  "The work, however, is tough and urgent," said Li Dongsheng. 
  Few people are expert at all minority languages. 
  Naxi nationality, scattered in the Lijiang area of South 
China's Yunnan Province, created a hieroglyph called the Dongba 
character. It got its name from its use to record religious 
rites by Naxi celebrants, called Dongba in the local language. 
  Only a few old Dongba can read these pictographic 
characters. 
  In 1981, an institute was established in Lijiang to rescue 
the precious cultural relics of Naxi nationality. The institute 
invited several old Dongba as instructors and provided 10 
university graduates for them. 
  With it the pronunciation and content of more than 1,000 
Dongba books have been recovered and more than 300 books have 
been translated into Mandarin Chinese. The books also disclosed 
eight Dongba rituals. 
  Some minority nationalities, on the other hand, do not have 
written languages. Their history is passed down orally. 
  In the past decade or so, the Snac has invested money and 
manpower to recover their history, legend and folk tales. 
  From 1986 to 1990, more than 1,000 books about 30 
nationalities were published, their academic value attracting 
world attention. 
  Research institutes of Chinese minorities have also been 
established in Japan, the United States, India, Canada and 
Germany. 
  During the past 10 years, more than 1,000 foreigners have 
visited the Dongba culture research institute in Lijiang. Two 
foreign students are studying in the institute for their 
doctor's degree. 
  A national conference on the collation of ancient 
nationality 
books will be held this year, according to Li. At the 
conference, relevant rules and regulations will be worked out to 
provide long-term guidelines for the work. 
  Li said the collection and collation work needs to be 
further 
improved. 
  In the past decade, both the central and local governments 
have provided financial help to the collection and collation of 
these books, Li said. In the future, more money is expected to 
be allocated to meet the increasing need. 
  On the other hand, local research institutes should actively 
tap resources on their own to collect funds, Li suggested. 
  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region set a prime example in this 
regard. In recent years, it has cooperated with the People's 
Republic of Mongolia and Australia on minority nationality 
cultural studies. Many books in the Mongolian language were 
jointly published by them. 
  There is a lack of professional personnel in the collection 
and collation work. Until now, no university has set up this 
major. Only short-term training classes have been opened at the 
Central University for Nationalities, according to Li.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ling Chao: "Campaign To Give Shelter to </F>
Street Kids"] 
  [Text] A national public awareness and fundraising 
campaign aimed at helping the country's 200,000 homeless kids 
will be launched next month in Beijing. 
  The initiative will raise money at home and abroad to 
provide 
shelter and schooling for the homeless street kids. 
  A host of metropolitan and provincial half-way housing 
centres with primary school and practical education facilities 
are in the pipeline according to sources at the Ministry of 
Civil Affairs. 
  Some 200,000 homeless children between the ages of 4 and 11 
have been thrown onto the streets by regional disasters, 
poverty, broken families and inadequate pastoral care. 
  The full extent of the street urchins' plight was revealed 
in 
a recent major survey of over 1,000 street children. 
  The investigation found that: 38 percent of them left home 
when their parents divorced, 23 percent ran away to escape being 
beaten up by relatives for failing to get good school marks, 23 
percent succumbed to the lure of social evils, like gambling or 
stealing, 8 percent were abandoned for being mentally retarded 
and 5 percent were forced onto the streets by poverty. 
  The remainder were made homeless when their parents were 
jailed, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and United 
Nations survey, which was conducted in Shanghai and Hunan, 
Guangdong and Anhui provinces. 
  The kids survive by begging and sleep in the cities wharves 
and railway stations at night, according to investigation, which 
was financed to the tune of $100,000 by the United Nations 
Children's Fund (Unicef). 
  And child homelessness, which is on the up and up, is 
stretching government welfare resources. 
  Local authority camps have been set up offering food, 
clothing and education in the last few years. 
  But much more social support is needed to answer the 
children's needs. 
  Mortality and disability rates among homeless kids are high 
and they are also prey to the temptations of crime, according to 
regional investigators. 
  The Sino-UN investigation focused on how to keep kids off 
the 
streets. It also looked at education and protection of the 
at-risk street children. 
  Similar investigations about street urchins lives have been 
conducted in cities and provinces across the country over the 
last four years or so. 
  In northeastern Jiamusi City, about 600 street children, 20 
percent of the city's total vagrant population, were picked up 
and sent back home by local metropolitan civil affairs agencies 
between 1989 and 1991. 
  But within a year 500 kids below the age of 14 were back on 
the streets again. 
  By the end of 1992 the city, which is in Heilongjiang 
Province, was having to cope with 40 percent more homeless kids 
than the previous year. 
  Shanghai picked up more than 3,000 child vagrants in 1992. 
  And 1,600 cases of juvenile homelessness, with the youngest 
victim only 4-years-old, were reported in Shenyang, the 
provincial capital of northeastern Liaoning. 
  China has over 300 million children.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 27 (XINHUA) -- China's 
pharmaceutical industry is taking its medicine: it is moving 
fast to increase its own development of new medicinal drugs. 
  This was made clear by an official at a conference dealing 
with the industry, which was just closed here in the capital of 
east China's Zhejiang Province. 
  Zhang Heyong, deputy director of the State Pharmaceutical 
Administration, said that the government's grants for research 
in the development of medicines had greatly increased. More 
than 400 such projects applied for approval last year, exceeding 
the total in past years. 
  China has started to adopt the modern enterprise system in 
this realm, to get away from the situation in which research 
institutions can only get funds through one channel -- 
government allocation. 
  The Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in Shandong Province and 
China Pharmaceutical University recently set up a corporation 
and a center for developing medicines, marking big progress in 
the field. 
  China now has 53 independent research and development 
institutions. But many problems still exist, such as 
overlapping functions and separation of research from production. 
  The central government is set to speed up the industry's 
readjustment, with stress on the establishment of advanced 
pharmacy centers. 
  It has made a success in Shanghai, which ranks 
pharmaceuticals among its pillar industries. The city now has 
four bio-engineering centers, with three others on the drawing 
board.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 28 (XINHUA) -- A new law firm run 
by Chinese students returned from overseas, believed to be the 
first of its kind in China, has commenced here recently. 
  The office is to provide legal services for both foreign 
business people who have had investment or wish to invest in 
China, and Chinese enterprises entering the world market. 
  It will also introduce Western law firm management 
expertise, 
said Cai Qing, director of the office, in his office in 
Shanghai's five-star Jinjiang Hotel. 
  Cai obtained a master's degree and then Ph.D in law in the 
United States and was qualified as a practising lawyer in 
Washington State before returning home, majoring in the laws of 
corporation, securities, investment and real estate. Cai's 
colleague Tang Yilin is also a registered practising lawyer in 
the United States. 
  The firm has five members who have settled down in the 
United 
States, and another four coming from the United States and 
Canada are expected to join the firm soon. 
  While mainly employing returned students, the firm is 
planning to recruit foreign lawyers, and it will also help send 
Chinese lawyers to engage in advanced training overseas. 
  Local experts believe there will be more such law firms in 
China along with the country's ongoing reform of the lawyer 
system and the nation's drive to build a socialist market 
economy. 
  China would regulate its lawyer system in line with 
international practice, Gan Jihua, vice-chairman of the 
Beijing-based All-China Lawyers Association, said.

Pi Shuyi (4122 2855 5030): "Curbing Inflation: The Focal Point 
of This Year's Macroregulation and Control"] 
  [Text] In view of the operations of China's economic 
juggernaut, deputies and members of the NPC and CPPCC are filled 
with both joys and worries. 
  They are overjoyed at the 13.4 percent increase in the GNP 
last year, which totalled 3 trillion yuan, but are worried about 
last year's 13 percent rise in retail prices, which are expected 
to go up again in January and February of this year. 
  While pledging to maintain fairly rapid economic growth, the 
encouraging "Report on Government Work" has also urged keeping 
this year's price rise below 10 percent. All NPC and CPPCC 
deputies and members have agreed during the sessions that 
curbing inflation will be the focus of this year's macroeconomic 
control and regulation. 
<H5>  An Imperative Matter </H5>
  Commodity prices are of great importance to the people's 
livelihood and to all sectors of our social life. 
  Shaanxi deputy Pang Jiayu indicated that commodity 
prices are a sensitive issue. Liaoning deputy Bo 
Xilai believed that commodity prices are one of the major 
concerns to the masses. CPPCC member Shi Ningsun 
said: Curbing inflation has become a matter of prime importance 
in our current effort to maintain social stability and to ensure 
healthy national economic development. 
  Though in different terms, they have all revealed the 
urgency 
of curbing inflation. 
  The rapid rise in commodity prices reflects the relatively 
tight conditions of economic operation, and also contains a 
latent crisis of economic turbulence. CPPCC Member Shi Ningsun 
noted: Alarm has been sounded in China's economy, and failure 
in imposing macrocontrol and regulation will probably lead to 
runaway inflation and economic stagnation. 
  Runaway inflation is harmful to the interests of the masses 
and will also give rise to social conflicts. This year is a 
vital year for reform, and there is a great need for a stable 
social environment. CPPCC member Zhao Changbai is 
correct when he says: No matter how good our system and policies 
are, we will find it difficult to push forward reform without a 
stable social environment. 
  The general goal of the government's macroeconomic control 
and regulation is to maintain a balanced supply and demand, 
optimize the economic structure, guide the economy to attain a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development, and bring about 
comprehensive social progress. Under this general goal, the 
focus and concrete targets of macroeconomic control and 
regulation will be different during each period in light of 
different foci of conflicts. We may stress growth during one 
period, and emphasize structural readjustment or curbing 
inflation during another. It is imperative to focus our efforts 
on curbing inflation at present, as the economy has kept growing 
for several years and the threats posed by runaway inflation are 
more alarming. 
<H5>  Meeting Difficulties Head On </H5>
  It is no easy task to keep the price rise below 10 percent. 
  CPPCC member Zhang Shirao considered it a 
formidable task. He cited several factors leading to price 
rises: Commodity prices began to rise since the end of last 
year; a number of new policies have been and will be put 
forward, such as readjustments in grain prices; unpredictable 
factors, for example rises in grain prices also cause rises in 
the prices of over 1,000 commodities; and spontaneous price 
rises. 
  A train running at full speed will produce great inertia. 
CPPCC member Wang Shiying pointed out that 1993's 
newly added investment, new projects, and newly issued 
currencies will continue to cause price rises in 1994. 
  CPPCC member Zhao Haikuan dwelled on the 
difficulty in terms of mechanisms: One, macroeconomically, 
credit funds are growing too fast, while microeconomically, 
firms are still hobbled by clogged mechanisms. As a result, 
everybody is lining up for loans, whether business operations 
are sound or not. Two, the change in government functions is 
yet to have any real effect. With local governments in charge 
of the economy, everybody wants to get ahead as quickly as 
possible, creating enormous inflationary pressure. Three, 
checks on consumption funds remain too soft, and governments and 
enterprises are still spending money as if it were from the 
"same big pot." 
  In a certain sense, checks against inflation are a 
double-edged sword. Liaoning deputy Li Shaozhou 
said: Inflation comes with economic growth and can be said to 
be the price for economic development, and therefore, cannot be 
completely eradicated. If inflation is kept artificially low, 
economic growth will slow, the market will become weak, and 
there will be underemployment and more unemployment, all of 
which are equally bad for social stability. At present, one of 
the keys to curbing inflation is to identify the point of 
critical balance between curbing inflation and maintaining 
economic growth. 
  The "Government Work Report" suggested a 9 percent economic 
growth rate for this year, while stabilizing the inflation rate 
at 10 percent. Some deputies and members agreed that the two 
objectives are reasonable and interconnected. A not-low 
economic growth rate and a not-high inflation rate -- it will be 
remarkable if the state can achieve that. 
  A market economy requires macroregulation and control, which 
demands a great deal of expertise. It differs completely from 
the traditional planned economy and needs to be probed and 
tried. An explicit announcement of stabilizing price rises at 
the 10 percent level indicates government's confidence and 
competence to meet the difficulties head on. 
<H5>  Ready With "Two Hands" </H5>
  Deputies and members were all confident in achieving the 10 
percent target and offered their ideas. 
  The rapid price increases were mainly caused by excessive 
investment and monetary supply. To curb inflation, it is 
necessary to plug this fountainhead, which means strict controls 
over the scale of investment, monetary supply, and credit scale. 
Some deputies and members suggested powerful economic means 
with discretionary administrative means with which to keep these 
three supplies under control. 
  Macroregulation and controls for the market economy do not 
exclude necessary administrative measures, especially at a time 
of "changing rails," when the market mechanism is still unsound 
and a new macroregulatory and control system is not in place, 
occasioning the need for a larger dose of administrative 
measures. Only we must pay attention to the laws of the market 
and refrain from institutionalizing administrative measures. 
CPPCC member Fei Yuefeng said: The primary thing to do in 
curbing inflation is to control the volume of monetary supply, 
though the control must work through the laws of the market 
economy. 
  There is no doubt that the present anti-inflationary 
measures 
still treat only the symptoms. To curb inflation at its root 
cause, we still have to rely on deepening reforms. The 
deep-seated factors responsible for excessive investment and 
monetary supply were caused by irrational investment, finance, 
taxation, banking, and firm structures, restraint-free 
microeconomic behavior, and unscientific macroeconomic behavior. 
  Heilongjiang deputy Lin You believed that macroregulation 
and 
control must be aimed at both symptoms and underlying causes. 
The measures must be firm in treating symptoms and active in 
tackling underlying causes. The attacks on the symptoms and 
underlying causes must reinforce each other. When problems 
worsen, firm measures are called for to deal with the symptoms, 
which incidentally are creating conditions for solving 
underlying causes. We must take on the root causes when the 
symptoms diminish. Only thus can we enjoy long-term stability 
and prevent relapses. 
  This year, the central authorities have not only proposed 
strengthening macroregulatory and control measures, but also 
those for structural reforms in finance, taxation, and banking. 
As long as we can insist on combining the treatment of symptoms 
with that of underlying causes, and economic means with 
administrative measures, there is great hope that we can achieve 
the objective of curbing inflation.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429) 23 March 1994 in Beijing: "Will There Be a Power 
Vacuum After Deng Xiaoping's Death"] 
  [Text] How to maintain lasting order in China is a problem 
Deng Xiaoping has been considering and trying to solve by 
practice since he was reinstated for the third time. During his 
tour of southern China in early 1992, he believed that the key 
to prolonged political stability, in a sense, lies with men, 
urging the central authorities to uphold the basic line of "one 
centre, two basic points" for a long time to come. What counts 
is that the CPC must organize a good political bureau, 
especially a good political bureau standing committee, he 
stressed, adding that so long as there is no problem with this 
link, China will be as stable as Mount Taishan. This is why 
since he established the third generation of the central 
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core after the 4 June 
incident in 1989, and especially since he set up the 
seven-member political bureau standing committee comprising 
Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu 
Huaqing, and Hu Jintao, Deng has repeatedly expressed his 
appreciation for the CPC central leading body with Jiang at the 
core. 
<H3>  Former Politburo Standing Committee Members Sharply 
Criticize "Central Leading Body With Jiang at the Core" </H3>
  CPC elders including Chen Yun, who made a public appearance 
in Shanghai on the eve of the last Spring Festival, and Yang 
Shangkun, Bo Yibo, and Wan Li, who went to various regions on 
inspection tours, praised the central leading body for its 
strong leadership and good performance and told local leading 
cadres at all levels to consciously safeguard the authority of 
the central leading body. The CPC elders' moves show they are 
eager to guarantee political stability after their deaths. 
  However, a Beijing source leaked word that central as well 
as 
local cadres are divided over this appraisal of the central 
leading body's work performance. To have a better understanding 
of the situation, the central authorities called many forums 
from late February to early March this year, namely, before the 
Second Session of the Eighth NPC, to solicit the opinions of CPC 
elders and retired generals and cadres on Premier Li Peng's 
"government work report (draft)" and the CPC Central Committee's 
work performance. 
  As disclosed in a briefing distributed by the CPC Central 
Committee General Office, participants in the forums had 
identical views on some matters and differed on others. And 
some offered sharp criticism. Song Ping, a former CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member, said: 
"The problem at present, which has a direct bearing on the 
destiny of the party and the country, is party building. If 
this problem is not solved, building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics will turn out to be empty talk and a lie." He 
added: "If inflation cannot be brought under control, stability 
will not last. If corruption cannot be eliminated, the party 
will lose its prestige." Yao Yilin, also a former member of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee, said: 
"We should always give top priority to efficiency in economic 
construction. We are now at the initial stage of building a 
socialist market economy; it is not advisable to brag about its 
role and correctness." Song Renqiong, a former vice chairman of 
the Central Advisory Commission, noted the tendency of going 
from one extreme to the other in the political and economic 
fields and in party building. 
  However, former NPC chairman Wan Li, former defense minister 
Qin Jiwei, and former CPC chairman Hua Guofeng praised the 
incumbent central leading body for its ethical integrity, 
decency, pragmatism, competence, vigor, and authority and hoped 
that party members and non-party cadres would unanimously 
support the central leading body. 
  In all fairness, the central leading body should find 
sufficient consolation in the praise accorded by these three 
representative figures. 
  In fact, the central leadership has also realized the 
importance of fostering authority. It was for this purpose that 
Li Peng unprecedentedly quoted Jiang Zemin on three occasions in 
his 1994 government work report. 
<H3>  Different Appraisals of the Central Leading Body Exist 
Within the Party </H3>
  A source said that although the third generation of central 
leadership has done a large amount of work over the last few 
years and earned much praise, some people within the party 
believe it cannot be placed on a par with the first generation 
of the central leadership with "Mao Zedong at the core" or the 
second generation of with "Deng Xiaoping at the core." The 
process of establishing the third generation of CPC central 
leadership points to its inadequate natural endowment in three 
respects. First, the leadership came to power in a hurry when 
the CPC's prestige suffered a great deal because of the 4 June 
incident in 1989, and before this most members of the leading 
body had failed to gain experience in making policy decisions as 
successors to the supreme CPC authority and lacked popular 
support. Second, of the five years they have been in power, at 
least three were spent on improving the economic environment and 
rectifying economic order, namely, they did not make spectacular 
achievements in economic reform and development for about three 
years and bridging the rift between the CPC and the people. 
  And third, the leading body is a product of a compromise 
between various forces within the CPC, and these differences 
were ironed out by several political elders to "maintain unity." 
When these elders pass away in turn, there will be a problem 
with the balance of power. 
  However, some CPC theorists believe the central leading body 
will be able to achieve a smooth transfer of power after Deng's 
death. A commentary entitled: "Will China Avoid Confusion 
After Deng Xiaoping's Death," recently carried by the restricted 
publication CANKAO XIAOXI [REFERENCE NEWS], listed the reasons 
as follows. First, the present successors are different from Hua 
Guofeng, who came to power after Mao Zedong's death. As Hua had 
no real power, there was a power vacuum, but there will be no 
power vacuum in the future because the present central leading 
body has real power. Second, the people wish to maintain 
stability because they have constantly received benefits from 
over a dozen years of reform and the opening up. Third, the 
central leading body is now in a much better position to restore 
the CPC's prestige due to the reorganization decided at the 14th 
CPC National Congress, and it will not go astray politically 
because it has Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as guidance. And fourth, most countries in the 
world, particularly the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, 
hope China's economic development will stimulate economic 
development in the Asia-Pacific region rather than being eager 
to see China in chaos. In short, the present macro and micro 
climates are different from what they were during the cultural 
revolution and 1989, when the pro-democracy movement took place, 
so the writer believes China will not be have chaos after Deng's 
death. 
  People in Beijing political circles point out that the party 
will see two internal factions holding different viewpoints for 
a long time to come, adding that only future events will prove 
which is correct. If the present "central leading body with 
Jiang Zemin at the core" wants to ensure that there will not be 
a power vacuum after Deng's death, they must do a more solid job 
to gain popular support. 
<H5>  Ding Guangen Becomes a Liaison Man Between Deng and Jiang </H5>
  The source said that although Deng had handed the power to 
make day-to-day policy decisions to the central leading body, he 
is ready to give his advice on major policies upon request. 
Apart from concerning himself with the operation of the central 
leading body through his office and his children, Deng has 
recently contacted the central leading body through Ding 
Guangen, who is a member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau, secretary of the Central Secretariat, and head of the 
CPC Propaganda Department. Since Guan, together with Wang 
Hanbin (CPC Central Committee Political Bureau alternate member 
and NPC vice chairman) and Wang Daming (Beijing CPPCC chairman), 
often plays bridge with Deng, Jiang usually asks him to tell 
Deng about Political Bureau meetings and Deng, in turn, also 
gives feedback to Jiang through Guan, thus virtually making Guan 
a liaison man. Because Mao Yuanxin acted as a liaison between 
the Political Bureau and Mao Zedong in the past, people jokingly 
call Guan a contemporary Mao Yuanxin. Reportedly, Jiang also 
often asks Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee, to brief Chen Yun, who usually stays in Shanghai, on 
Political Bureau meetings, and Chen also gives instructions to 
the bureau through Wu. So Wu has also become a liaison man 
between Chen and the Political Bureau. 
  People in Beijing political circles maintain that Jiang can 
get more assistance from Deng with the help of the liaison man, 
but this is quite detrimental to his efforts to foster his 
independent authority. Therefore, to ensure stability after 
Deng's death, it is better to remove the liaison man.

<F P=106> [Special dispatch by XINHUA reporter Chi Maohua (3069 5399 </F>
5369) for SHANXI RIBAO: "The Central Authorities Are Concerned 
About Shanxi"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Shanxi delegation 
to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] drew attention from people whether it was at the session 
or not. 
  Shanxi is a base of energy resources and heavy chemical 
industry and enjoys an important strategic position in the 
nation's economic setup. Its coal, iron, aluminium, and other 
natural resources are well-known around the country; nearly 
four-fifths of total commodity coal supplies are from Shanxi. 
  Shanxi is poor at the same time. Luliang Prefecture is one 
of China's 18 collectively and perpetually poor areas. Of the 
118 counties (cities, prefectures) in the province, 14 are 
state-level poor counties and 36 are provincial-level ones. 
  Because of this, the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council have been concerned about people in Shanxi, and economic 
development there. During the Second Session of the Eighth NPC, 
Li Peng, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
Standing Committee and premier; Qiao Shi, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and 
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee; Li Lanqing, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier; Ren 
Jianxin, secretary of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, 
secretary of the CPC Central Commission on Politics and Law, and 
president of the Supreme People's Court; and other leaders have 
separately visited the Shanxi delegation and held forums with 
its members on plans for revitalizing Shanxi's economy, and 
encouraging the 30 million people in Shanxi to score new 
achievements in the reform, opening up, and modernization drive. 
  Veteran comrades of noble character and high prestige, 
including Peng Zhen and Bo Yibo, are also very concerned and 
have kept thinking about the elders in their hometown and the 
development of Shanxi's work. 
  In short, the central authorities are concerned about 
Shanxi! 
<H3>  Premier Li Peng: Thanks for Shanxi's Significant 
Contributions to the Nation </H3>
  During the NPC session, Premier Li Peng joined discussions 
with the delegations of Beijing, Hebei, Hainan, Jilin, Henan, 
and Heilongjiang. Although he was very busy, he still decided 
to visit Shanxi deputies as he was really worried and concerned 
about Shanxi. 
  When they started the discussions, Hu Fuguo, secretary of 
Shanxi Provincial CPC Committee; Governor Sun Wensheng; Zhang 
Kui, chairman of Shanxi Provincial Planning Commission; Wu Ang, 
secretary of Yuncheng Prefectural CPC Committee; Zhang 
Guangjian, president of Shanxi Academy of Social Sciences; and 
other comrades spoke on the current situation in Shanxi's 
economic development, and existing problems. When Guo Baolin, 
director of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, said the 
enterprise developed from over 2 million yuan in losses in 1991 
to some 2 million yuan in profits in 1993 through keen reform, 
Li Peng was very pleased and made more inquiries about the 
factory's present conditions in production, and existing 
problems. Li Peng continued: The central authorities have 
attached great importance to large and medium-sized enterprises 
and do not think their problems have been properly resolved. 
This is the focus, as well as the knot, of reform. You have 
just noted many problems and it seems that comprehensive 
management is necessary. Starting from what has been achieved, 
the central authorities are prepared to conduct due 
investigations and studies this year to resolve large and 
medium-sized enterprises' problems thoroughly and in a 
step-by-step manner. The institution of share-holding system 
has given enterprises a driving force, but it cannot completely 
resolve problems. The most important issue is that their 
products must be marketable, technology must be upgraded, and 
efficiency must be improved -- with these, enterprises will 
display their vitality. This, of course, will need mechanisms, 
as well as investment and many factors combined. 
  Datong is a famous coal-producing city in China. People 
would not forget Li Peng's several visits to Datong. Premier Li 
has left his footprints at Datong No. 2 Power Plant and in the 
villages of Yanbei. Speaking on Shanxi's coal mines, Premier Li 
Peng said: Shanxi's coal mines include those whose production 
is under unified central planning, those managed by the local 
authorities, and those run by village and town enterprises. 
Coal mines run by village and town enterprises account for over 
half of the nation's total output. How should we deal with this 
problem? It requires the correct understanding that small 
coalpits have their drawbacks, such as low percentage of 
resources recovery, some waste of resources, less advanced 
equipment, and higher casualties. However, if we say Shanxi has 
made contributions to the national coal production, small 
coalpits have contributed their share too. So how should we 
treat small coalpits? We should vigorously support them to 
develop further, upgrade technology, raise their labor 
productivity, and improve safety levels. 
  At this moment, Premier Li Peng asked with concern: "I 
visited the Dongyi Coal Mine in Pinglu District whenever I went 
to Datong. I wonder how it is now?" 
  Xue Jun, secretary of Shuozhou city party committee, 
replied: 
"The mine is much better off than the time you saw it on your 
previous two visits. They have established a group company now." 
  Li Peng said: "I think this is a good model -- to turn every 
small coalpit into a semi-modernized coalpit or one developing 
in the direction of modernization. The future of Shanxi's coal 
industry will be promising if we follow this model." 
  When Shanxi Party Secretary Hu Fuguo briefed Li Peng on 
Wanjiazhai's project of diverging water from Huang He, Li Peng 
said: Shanxi is a province short of water supplies. The central 
authorities are very concerned about this problem. We should 
make concerted efforts to construct the Wanjiazhai diversion 
works well; the construction of this project is an important 
strategic measure. He added: Shanxi has still made significant 
progress compared with itself. When I was still engaged in the 
work of power supplies in northern China in the late 1970's, I 
visited Datong, which was very poor then -- low agricultural 
output value, with only 200 kg of grain output per mu for lack 
of chemical fertilizers and water. Later, small coalpits were 
developed and when I went to Datong again, grain output per mu 
had also increased because of more investment. This had brought 
about a significant change in people's lives. When compared 
with developed areas, Shanxi must not improperly belittle 
itself; when measuring their gaps with others, Shanxi should not 
forget that in some poorer areas, such as the mountain areas in 
Luliang Prefecture and Yanbei Prefecture, people's food and 
clothing problems remain unsolved or are not completely solved. 
When northwestern Shanxi was a base of the War of Resistance 
against Japan, and revolution, the most difficult time for the 
area, life in Pianguan, Youyu, Zuoyun, Baode, Xingxian, and 
Sanjiao Town in Linxian was very hard because natural conditions 
were fairly poor. Now the whole nation should help them to get 
out of poverty. I hope Shanxi will do a better job, and the 
people will get richer every year. 
  Li Peng said: "You have put forward many good suggestions in 
your remarks. I used to be very familiar with some localities 
in Shanxi because I paid many visits there. I have not gone 
there for years and I apologize to you for this. I will go 
there if circumstances permit this year. The central 
authorities are very concerned about and have attached great 
importance to Shanxi. General Secretary Jiang just visited 
there not long ago." Premier Li's sincere remarks won the 
applause of every deputy. 
  Li Peng said: Shanxi delivers over 200 million tonnes of 
coal to other localities every year, and China's commodity coal 
is mainly from Shanxi too. Shanxi has not only played an 
important role in the nation's economic construction in the 
past, but also will continue to make more contributions. 
  Facing the premier of the republic and in the spirit of 
being 
highly responsible to the state and the people, deputies spoke 
without reservation and frankly stated their opinions. 
Listening to the deputies' remarks -- suggestions or criticisms 
-- Li Peng wrote them down one by one in his notebook. 
  Finally, Li Peng hoped Shanxi would bring out the best in 
itself, forge ahead in unity, and make more achievements in 
various tasks of the province. 
  The premier's ardent talk was greeted with deputies' 
applause 
again. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi Hopes Shanxi Will Be Built Better 
and Better 
  At 10 A.M. on 17 March, Qiao Shi, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of 
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, visited the 
Shanxi delegation. The deputies, one after another, stepped 
forward to say hello to him. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi has inspected Shanxi many times and is 
very 
much concerned about the province. He also conducted studies 
and investigations in Shanxi's rural areas, factories, and 
schools. 
  Shaking hands with the deputies, Qiao Shi said with a smile: 
"You are working very hard. I am here to see you and say hello 
to you." 
  After posing for a group photo with the deputies to mark the 
occasion, Qiao Shi said: "Shanxi is China's coal energy base 
with abundant coal deposits. It has made great contributions to 
our country. At present the coal industry is having some 
difficulties with respect to prices. I believe that the problem 
will be solved and Shanxi will become better off in the days to 
come. 
  Qiao Shi said: Shanxi has more than just coal. It also has 
agricultural, scientific and technological, cultural, 
educational, and other undertakings. I hope that Shanxi will 
constantly make progress in all these undertakings. 
  He said in conclusion: Shanxi is an old revolutionary base 
area with very fine revolutionary traditions during the 
revolutionary war years. I hope the new generations will carry 
on the glorious traditions and build Shanxi better and better. 
  Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi provincial party 
committee, 
said on behalf of all Shanxi deputies: We are determined to 
live up to the central leading comrades' trust and expectations, 
continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and work 
hard to develop Shanxi's economy. 
<H3>  Vice Premier Li Lanqing: In Education, the Fundamental Way 
Out is Reform </H3>
  Bai Feng: "It is necessary to create a good environment for 
youngsters to grow up." 
  Li Lanqing: "You are right." 
  Ma Cuizhen: "Education should start with children." 
  Li Lanqing: "I agree with you completely"...[ellipses as 
received] 
  This was the discussion between Li Lanqing, member of the 
CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, and the Shanxi deputies in the afternoon of 18 March. 
  Li Lanqing, who is in charge of education, arrived at the 
Shanxi delegation's quarters at 4 P.M. Some deputies from the 
teaching profession vied to speak, and Li Lanqing occasionally 
answered their questions. The discussion was conducted in a 
very lively manner. 
  Bai Feng, a teacher of Taiyuan city's No. 5 Middle School, 
loudly said at the meeting: "In society today, the problem of 
over-emphasis on intellectual education to the neglect of moral 
education is very serious. We must not pay attention to only 
the proportion of students advancing to higher schools and 
overlook the job of making students develop morally, 
intellectually, and physically at the same time." 
  Li Lanqing nodded in approval and responded with a quote 
from 
a late old educator, Tao Xingzhi. 
  Bai Feng was followed by Ma Cuizhen, a teacher of the Beijie 
Elementary School of Shuozhou city. She said: "We must not 
neglect the elementary education. Education should start with 
children. This is an important task which has a bearing on the 
future of our country." When she became quite emotional in her 
speech, Li Lanqing asked her to slow down a little, and 
seriously took notes of what she said. 
  Then, several other educators, including Liu Rongfen, Liang 
Hongfei, and Ling Daqi successively spoke. Li Lanqing 
attentively listened to their views and occasionally interrupted 
and discussed with them how to develop education. 
  After deputies, from teachers to other deputies, had taken 
the floor, Li Lanqing said: "All the views just expressed by 
every deputy present were very good and educative." He then 
talked about his opinion on improving the quality of education 
and teachers. He said: The fundamental way out for education 
lies in reform. It will not do to rely on the government alone 
for solving the problems encountered by universities. Of 
course, the government should do its duty and, in particular, it 
must fulfill its duty on compulsory education. We must readjust 
China's macro educational structure. The government should do 
its best to successfully conduct compulsory education; it is an 
important issue related to the improvement of the quality of all 
the Chinese nation. China should develop a great deal of 
vocational education as well as adult education. Vocational 
education and adult education are the main channel for our 
Chinese youths to become useful personnel. Our current 
educational work faces sweeping reform in such areas as the 
pattern of running a school, school systems, admission fees, 
student distribution system, the establishment of branches of 
learning, and so forth. I think it is necessary to carry out 
reform in the light of the overall needs of a socialist market 
economy. 
  Touching on the development of resources, Li Lanqing said: 
Resources must be developed. However, it will not do if we 
simply pay attention to the development of resources. We must 
pay attention to making use of them, too. In the past, 
exploited coal was transported to eastern China; we spent a 
large amount of money on repairing the Datong-Qinhuangdao 
Railway. It was necessary at that time because we did not 
acquire the technology for long-distance electric power 
transmission. In addition, Shanxi possesses one more very good 
strong point, namely, a comparatively solid foundation for heavy 
industry, machine-building industry, and basic industries. Let 
all provinces give full play to their respective strong points, 
instead of promoting a similar [industrial] structure. We have 
established powerful machine-building industries and basic 
industries over the past four decades or so; therefore, we enjoy 
a better competitive edge than others in this field of endeavor. 
The problem facing us now is that we have not very successfully 
tapped the export potentials of these sectors yet. With regard 
to foreign economic relations and foreign trade, economic 
decision-making powers shall be delegated to those large and 
medium-sized enterprises whose conditions permit them to have 
liberalized operation. 
  Everyone spoke freely during the discussion meeting, which 
presented a scene of warm participation by all present. Other 
deputies also successively expressed their views on issues of 
their respective concern. 
  Though many deputies vied with each other to take the floor, 
the hour hand of the clock already pointed at 1840... [ellipses 
as received]. 
  [Supreme People's Court] President Ren Jianxin: "We 
Should Promote Stability in the Same Way As We Develop the 
Economy" 
  On the morning of 13 March, the Shanxi delegation to the 
Second Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC held a group meeting to 
deliberate the "Government Work Report." In his speech, Ren 
Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, 
secretary of the Central Commission on Politics and Law, 
president of the Supreme People's Court, and deputy to the 
Eighth NPC, said: "This year is very important and crucial for 
deepening reform. Party and government leaders at all levels 
should maintain social stability in the same way as they carry 
out economic work." 
  Ren Jianxin expressed satisfaction with the hands-on 
approach 
adopted by leading comrades from the Shanxi provincial party 
committee and government in maintaining stability. He was very 
delighted to hear that Shanxi Province had set the goal of 
becoming one of the provinces with the best public order in the 
country, and that provincial leaders and local leading comrades 
had specifically signed documents to assume leadership 
responsibility for comprehensive management of public security. 
He said: "You have my full support. I sincerely hope people 
across the province will work together to realize this goal at 
an early date." 
  Ren Jianxin said: Our country now enjoys economic 
development, political stability, national unity, and social 
progress; the situation as a whole is favorable. It should be 
noted, however, that factors affecting social and political 
stability are increasing. We must be mentally well-prepared and 
take practical and effective measures to go all-out to maintain 
social stability. 
  Speaking of several current issues that merit attention, Ren 
Jianxin said emphatically: 1) Principal leading comrades from 
parties and governments at all levels should place a great 
premium on maintaining social stability and earnestly assume 
responsibility. Party and government leaders at all levels 
should arm themselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and fully 
recognize and correctly handle the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability. They should follow the principle of 
"carrying out two tasks simultaneously while paying equal 
attention to both," and maintain social stability in the same 
way as they carry out economic work. 2) We should deal a stern 
blow to criminal activities that gravely jeopardize public 
order, and tighten comprehensive management of public security. 
A normal state of law and order now prevails in most parts of 
the country, and the trend toward significantly higher crime 
rates has been initially stemmed. However, the continuing 
existence of many law and order problems, and the substantial 
increase in major violent crimes have caused serious harm. 
Criminal gangs are rather rampant in some areas, with some of 
them showing clear attributes of organized crime. Some areas 
suffer from a lack of public order. With hooligans committing 
all sorts of crimes, riding roughshod over fellow villagers, and 
bullying people, these areas offer little reason for optimism 
about their law-and-order situation. We should take this matter 
seriously. We should continue to fight against criminal 
activities that gravely jeopardize public order, taking swift 
and stern actions in accordance with the law. We should stiffen 
our blows; bolster our means of delivering such blows; swiftly 
wage special and intensive struggles against criminal activities 
that have aroused strong public resentment; and resolutely 
eradicate all kinds of social ills. 3) We should wage a 
deep-going struggle against corruption to promote clean 
government. The anticorruption struggle determines whether we 
can gain public support, whether our political power is secure, 
and whether reform and opening up are successful. Currently, we 
should make still greater efforts to seriously study Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's propositions on the anticorruption struggle, 
study Comrade Jiang Zemin's speeches at the second and third 
meetings of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and 
implement the party Central Committee's plans to the letter. 
Specifically, we should redouble our efforts to investigate and 
deal with major and important cases, base our actions on fact, 
follow the principle of taking the law as the criterion, and 
mete out stiff and heavy punishment to criminals involved in 
embezzlement and bribery cases in accordance with the law. 
Judging by the situation over the past few months, many 
localities have conscientiously investigated and dealt with some 
major and important cases, penalizing a number of felons who 
committed economic crimes. However, they have also encountered 
some difficulties, running into stumbling blocks or even some 
resistance in investigating and dealing with some of the major 
and important cases. 
  In view of some major and important cases brought to light 
by the deepening anticorruption drive, we must strengthen 
leadership, undertake painstaking organizational efforts, 
promptly investigate and deal with them, conduct thorough 
investigations, and mete out stern punishment without mercy 
regardless of who is involved and how much resistance we may 
encounter. We should severely punish people who obstruct our 
efforts to handle cases or who shelter corrupt elements, acting 
in accordance with party discipline and state law. Furthermore, 
we should stress key aspects of our work and fulfill the 
requirements of the central authorities by focusing on 
investigating and dealing with criminal cases involving 
personnel in leading party and government bodies and in 
judicial, administrative, law enforcement, and economic 
administrative departments who embezzle public funds, take 
bribes, and bend the law for personal gain. 4) We should 
fortify primary government and party organs and rely on the 
masses in maintaining social stability. Party and government 
leaders at all levels must show a strong sense of urgency, 
institute practical and effective measures, devote great efforts 
to consolidating primary party and government organs in 
different stages and groups, and continuously strengthen work in 
this respect in keeping with the evolving situation. Moreover, 
we should improve various self- governing mass organizations 
based primarily on party branches, such as villagers', 
neighborhood, public security, and mediation committees. We 
should remove various difficulties hindering the normal 
operation of these primary organizations; give full rein to 
their role in maintaining social stability; and work in 
conjunction with the masses to maintain social stability to 
ensure smooth progress in reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  After Ren Jianxin finished his speech, Peng Peiyun, state 
councilor and concurrently minister in charge of the State 
Family Planning Commission, and Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation, spoke. 
  NPC deputy Dong Qinjun, president of the Shanxi Provincial 
Pediatrics Hospital, said: Endemic diseases have erupted in 85 
percent of the counties across the country, afflicting more than 
60 million people. In Shanxi, 90 percent of the counties are 
plagued by endemic diseases, especially by Kaschin-Beck disease, 
Keshan disease, iodine deficiency, and brucellosis. 
Poverty-ridden areas are prone to endemic diseases. He said: 
Endemic diseases not only endanger the patients but also affect 
their children and future generations. The past few years have 
witnessed an upswing in endemic diseases as a result of 
slackened prevention and control efforts nationwide and of 
serious shortages of funds for prevention and control. The 
prevention and control of endemic diseases is a major 
undertaking that has a bearing on the nation's rise and fall, 
the health of posterity, reform, development, and stability. We 
can never allow a recurrence of the previous situation in which 
even doctors as good as "Hua Tuo [a famous surgeon in the Han 
Dynasty] could do nothing to control parasitic worms." For this 
reason, he filed a motion in which he said: "We should quickly 
enact laws on preventing and controlling endemic diseases to 
bring such prevention and control onto the legal track." 
  After hearing his speech, Minister Peng Peiyun said: In 
preventing and controlling endemic diseases, we should enlist 
the joint efforts of all social sectors and rely on overall 
coordination between departments in charge of medical and 
educational services as they relate to economic development. 
The central authorities have decided to solve the endemic 
disease problem in the near future. 
  After hearing the deputies' remarks, Wu Yi noted: At 
present, the most important task in developing foreign trade is 
to enhance our own competitiveness, to train foreign economic 
and trade personnel, and to survive and develop in the course of 
competition. 
  Hu Fuguo and Sun Wensheng said: The period from now on until 
the middle of the next century will be crucial for Shanxi's 
development. We have no choice but to make unremitting efforts 
in carrying out the central task of economic construction. This 
is a historic opportunity and a great mission of the times for 
Shanxi. Now that a sound blueprint has been mapped out and the 
way forward has been pointed out, we need to work in a 
down-to-earth manner. 
<H5>  Comrade Peng Zhen: "Unity Is Strength" </H5>
  At 1600 on 21 March, Hu Fuguo, Sun Wensheng, Lu Gongxun, Li 
Ligong, and Wang Tingdong, all Shanxi deputies to the Second 
Session of the Eighth NPC, came to Comrade Peng Zhen's residence 
to call on this veteran comrade of noble character and high 
prestige on behalf of all comrades in the Shanxi delegation as 
well as the elders in Shanxi. 
  Comrade Peng Zhen, who was full of energy, was very glad to 
see the comrades from his hometown. He said repeatedly: "How 
are you, comrades? Thank you for visiting me. Thank my fellow 
townfolk for their concern for me." He then inquired about the 
speeches, opinions, and suggestions made by comrades in the 
Shanxi NPC delegation. He specifically inquired about the work 
carried out in his hometown and the living conditions of his 
fellow townfolk over the past year. 
  Peng Zhen told Shanxi CPC Secretary Hu Fuguo: "I heard 
people say that, after returning to your post in Shanxi, you did 
a number of things that really benefited the people and that 
were very welcomed by the masses. We are all very pleased, too." 
  Hu Fuguo said: "Thank you for your encouragement. It is an 
inducement and a spur to us. There are a lot of things that I 
still need to do. I will do an even better job in the future 
and I hope you will give us more directions from now on." 
  Then, Hu Fuguo told Peng Zhen: Shanxi is building highways 
and the Wanjiazhai Project to divert the Huang He.... 
  Peng Zhen asked with concern: "Has construction of the 
project started?" 
  "It has already started," Hu Fuguo said. "The central 
authorities are very concerned with Shanxi's work. Vice Premier 
Zou Jiahua went to the job site to cut the ribbon for a ceremony 
to kick off construction of the Wanjiazhai Project. General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin made a special trip to Shanxi to inspect 
its work before the Spring Festival; he is very concerned with 
Shanxi's work, its people, highways, and water. During the 
current session, Comrades Li Peng and Qiao Shi specially joined 
discussions with Shanxi deputies to hear, face to face, 
everyone's views and suggestions. They all showed the central 
authorities' concern and support for Shanxi." 
  Peng Zhen said: "Shanxi has made very tremendous 
contributions to the nation no matter whether it was in the war 
era or after the founding of the People's Republic, in the past 
or present. It is still necessary for us to carry forward this 
fine tradition. Shanxi faces a water shortage. I hope the 
problem can be solved at an early date." 
  When Hu Fuguo told Comrade Peng Zhen that Shanxi's leading 
group is very closely united, the latter said gladly: "Very 
good, unity is strength. An important content of Marxism-Mao 
Zedong Thought stresses unity. When you succeed in promoting 
unity, you, as a secretary, have tackled your work's crucial 
point." 
  Li Ligong and other comrades told Peng Zhen: When you 
returned to your hometown in 1986, you earnestly exhorted its 
people again and again to promote unity and not to fuss about 
such past unpleasant trifles as the Zhang's dog having bitten 
the Li's chicken or internecine strifes. You also strictly 
forbade your own relatives to always think about three family 
members being persecuted to death during the "Great Cultural 
Revolution." Let bygones be bygones, you told them; and you 
urged them to take the lead to promote unity and carry out 
construction in the town. These words of yours and your breadth 
of vision still spread among the people of your hometown; they 
become the strength that spurs all its people to promote unity 
and build the town. 
  Peng Zhen had repeatedly said: Those who allow themselves to 
be swayed by personal feelings do not belong to a communist 
party. The whole party and all the people across the country 
must unite. Nothing can be accomplished without unity. After 
listening to deputies' speeches, he stressed: "Communists and, 
in particular, the party's leading cadres at all levels, must 
stress unity more than other things. Only when we are united 
can we have strength." 
  Peng Zhen exhorted with deep feeling: "Shanxi is an old 
revolutionary area. It made efforts during the war and also 
during socialist construction. I hope the people of our 
hometown will make even greater contributions." 
  At last, on behalf of the Shanxi people, Hu Fuguo wished 
Comrade Peng Zhen good health and a long life. Peng Zhen said: 
"Please convey my regards to the people of my hometown. I hope 
it will achieve greater successes in carrying out its work!" 
  Comrade Bo Yibo: "Develop Shanxi's Economy" 
  On the afternoon of 22 March, 24 Shanxi deputies attending 
the Second Session of the Eighth NPC, visited Comrade Bo Yibo at 
his residence. Bringing along the good wishes of all members of 
the Shanxi delegation, they called on the veteran comrade of 
noble character and high prestige. 
  Walking to the courtyard with vigorous strides, Bo Yibo 
shook 
hands with the comrades from his home province and had a group 
photo taken to mark the occasion. 
  He said happily: The current NPC session has been convened 
very well. I read newspapers about it every day. To correctly 
handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability 
is everyone's duty, not just the party and government leaders. 
The proper handling of the relationship among the three is very 
important to accomplishing the tasks forwarded by the current 
session, as well as to bringing about a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy. He was glad that 
the deputies shared such a view and supported the major and 
basic principles for the work of the whole party and country 
this year. 
  Shanxi Governor Sun Wensheng briefed Bo Yibo on his work 
after being transferred from Hunan to Shanxi and on his concept 
about Shanxi's economic construction. Sun Wensheng said: "We 
are building roads and water-drawing projects and we pledge to 
perform more actual deeds and do good work in Shanxi. Although 
Shanxi is not my native province, I am willing to dedicate the 
second half of my life to Shanxi." 
  Bo Yibo said happily: "Very good! Since both you and Comrade 
Hu Fuguo tell the truth, perform actual deeds, and set good 
examples, things are a lot easier to do there. The people in 
Shanxi place very high hopes on you two. I am very glad that 
you two are teaming up so well." 
  Bo Yibo said: "Success lies in unity. Shanxi has abundant 
underground natural resources. The question now is how to take 
advantage of them. People often say that a place becomes 
glorious if there are outstanding talents there. It is true. 
We should rely on specialized personnel and unity. A genuine 
unity is shown by deeds, not lip service. A leading group's 
members should discuss things with one another more often." 
  Wang Tingdong, who sat beside Bo Yibo, butted in: "Shanxi's 
leading body is very united. Fuguo and Wensheng are setting 
examples in everything and the people fully support them." 
  Bo Yibo said: "I constantly read about Shanxi and know about 
Shanxi's determination to deal with some undesirable people and 
things [chu li yi xie bu hao di ren he shi 5710 3810 0001 0067 
0008 1170 4104 0086 0735 0057]. This is very good. However, it 
is also necessary to establish and commend positive examples." 
  He said: "You should seize the opportunity to promote 
economic development, build well the Wanjiachai project for 
drawing water from the Huang He and the Yangcheng power plant, 
and pay attention to training young specialized personnel." 
  Bo Yibo said with deep feeling: "Shanxi is an old 
revolutionary base area with abundant natural resources. I hope 
the people in my native province will make new progress in 
economic development." 
  Then, it was 1830. Hu Fuguo wished Bo Yibo good health on 
behalf of all Shanxi people. Bo Yibo said: "I thank the people 
of my home province. Nothing is better than hearing good news 
about the home province. I am waiting to hear good news about 
you."

<F P=106> [Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Peng at the </F>
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress on 10 
March 1994. The Beijing TV version of Li Peng's Work Report was 
published in the 10 March China DAILY REPORT] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  On behalf of the State Council I would now like to deliver 
the government work report at this session. Please examine it. 
I also request members of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee and other 
observers to present your views. I. A Review of 
Domestic Affairs in 1993 and Basic Principles for the Work in 
1994 
  The past year was a year in which the nation implemented in 
all sectors the guidelines laid down by the 14th National CPC 
Committee in all sectors and proceeded victoriously along the 
course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and 
in which major achievements were made in reform, opening up, and 
modernization, and a new situation appeared in the work in all 
quarters. In an international environment marked by unrest, 
changes, and economic recession, our great socialist motherland 
stands tall in the east of the world with fast economic growth, 
political stability, national solidarity, and social progress. 
  The national economy grew rapidly. On the basis 
of the fast growth in 1992, our national economy continued its 
vigorous development in 1993. The gross domestic product [GDP] 
exceeded three trillion yuan, topping that of the preceding year 
by 13.4 percent. Agriculturally it was a year of bumper 
harvests. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line 
production, and fishery developed steadily. The added value of 
agricultural output increased 4 percent. The output of major 
agricultural products increased substantially, with the 
exception of cotton and sugar- bearing crops, the production of 
which declined. Grain output reached 456.4 billion kilograms, 
which was a record high. Village and town enterprises continued 
to develop rapidly. The added value of the nation's industrial 
output increased by 21.1 percent. The output of certain major 
goods increased by big margins. Steel output reached 88.68 
million tonnes. The pace of enterprises' technological 
transformation and product-mix restructuring quickened. 
Economic returns were higher. The domestic market thrived. 
Retail sales of consumer goods increased 11.6 percent after 
allowing for price increases. The investment pattern was 
improved. Major construction projects were intensified. 
Remarkable results were achieved in energy, communications, and 
telecommunications construction. The capacity of generators was 
expanded by 14.38 million kilowatts. The construction of the 
Beijing-Jiujiang, Nanning-Kunming, and other main railways was 
progressing smoothly; and the construction of high-grade 
highways and key seaports quickened. The development of postal 
and telecommunications services was fast. The number of 
telephones in urban and rural areas increased by 5.86 million 
units. 
  To deal with conspicuous contradictions and problems during 
the rapid economic development, the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council took timely macroeconomic regulatory and 
control measures, made great efforts to rectify financial order 
and stabilize the economic situation, and maintained the good 
momentum of economic development, thus providing the necessary 
conditions for sustained economic development, and smooth 
progress of reforms this year. In addition, we have accumulated 
valuable experience in exercising macroeconomic regulation and 
control under the socialist market economic conditions. 
  New progress has been made in reform and opening 
up. We have continued to promote reforms in all fields 
according to the requirements of establishing a socialist market 
economic structure. The reform, with emphasis on changing 
operational mechanisms, continued to deepen. Enterprises were 
given decision-making power step by step. The main role of the 
market was strengthened. While developing the state-owned and 
collective economy, the individual, private, and foreign-funded 
sectors of the economy continued to grow. Prices were further 
rationalized, and both the buying and selling prices of grain 
were basically decontrolled. The pace of development of markets 
for production factors, including capital, land, labor force, 
technology and information, was accelerated. On the basis of 
conducting thorough investigation and study and seeking opinions 
from all quarters, we formulated plans for reforming the fiscal 
and taxation, financial, investment, and foreign trade systems. 
These reform plans now have in the main been promulgated, and 
are proceeding quite smoothly. This indicates an important step 
taken by China in establishing a socialist market economic 
structure. In the past year, the country was opened to the 
outside world wider and wider. Foreign investment remarkably 
increased, the area of investment was expanded, and the 
investment structure improved. Direct investment totalled $25.8 
billion, the largest for one year since the start of reform and 
opening up. Foreign trade enjoyed an all-round development, 
with total volume of import-export trade amounting to $195.8 
billion, up 18.2 percent from 1992. Of the export goods, the 
proportion of manufactured goods increased and the degree of 
processing was enhanced. 
  Scientific and technological cooperation and cultural 
exchanges with foreign countries further expanded. 
International tourism made rapid development. Contracting of 
projects and provision of labor services abroad became more 
brisk. 
  Various social undertakings made further 
development. New progress was made in scientific and 
technological undertakings while deepening reform. 
Implementation of the plans for technological research and 
applied technology research, and for tackling key problems in 
science and technology proceeded smoothly, and over 30,000 major 
scientific and technological results were achieved. A number of 
scientific results including the Galaxy II supercomputer and the 
Dawn I parallel computer reached advanced world levels. 
Construction of the new and high technology industrial 
development zones made new development, thus playing an obvious 
role in commercialization and industrialization of scientific 
results. Educational undertakings advanced amid reform. Basic 
education, vocational education, adult education, and higher 
education continued to develop and improve. 
  China successfully held the Seventh National Games and 
hosted 
the first East Asian Games. Chinese athletes won 103 world 
championships in major international sports meets. The mass 
sports activities continued to develop. New achievements were 
scored in the fields of literature and arts, the press and 
publishing, radio, film and television, the social sciences, 
public health, pharmaceutical production, family planning, 
environmental protection, disaster prevention, and disaster 
reduction. Celebration of Chairman Mao's birth centennial and 
the showing of 100 patriotic films produced excellent social 
effects. Work on the comprehensive management of social order 
was further promoted. New achievements were scored in national 
defense undertakings. The development of socialist spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and the legal system was stepped up. 
  The livelihood of the urban and rural people continued 
to improve. After allowing for price rises, last year the 
average amount of per capita income that urban and rural 
dwellers used for living expenses increased 10.2 percent, and 
per- capita net income of rural residents went up by 3.2 
percent. Bank savings deposits of urban and rural residents 
increased by a big margin, with the yearend balance of bank 
savings deposits reaching 1,476.4 billion yuan, up 28 percent. 
In 1993, housing floor space totalling 270 million square 
meters was added for urban residents, and 570 million square 
meters were built in rural areas. Consumption levels of urban 
and rural citizens went up steadily, and their spiritual and 
cultural life was constantly enriched. 
  Deputies: Over the last year, under the leadership of the 
CPC and through struggle in unity by people of various 
nationalities across the country, we have in the main completed 
various tasks for 1993 set by the First Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress. On behalf of the State Council, I 
wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to people of various 
nationalities of the whole country for their trust in the work 
of the government and their support. I also wish to express my 
sincere thanks to compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao; 
overseas Chinese; and all foreign friends who have shown concern 
for and supported our country's modernization drive! 
  While affirming our achievements, we have soberly seen that 
there are still some deficiencies and shortcomings in the 
government's work. In the course of advancing, there are still 
some contradictions and difficulties, principally, the scale of 
investment in fixed assets was overextended; increases in 
commodity prices were relatively large; the problem of the 
irrational economic structure remained salient; many state-owned 
large and medium enterprises still had considerable difficulties 
in production and management; public order in some localities 
was bad; the fight against social ills was not forceful enough; 
corrupt practices such as embezzlement, bribery, favoritism, and 
fraud existed among a small number of government functionaries; 
and formalism and bureaucratism among government departments 
affected the government's close ties with the people. The party 
Central Committee and the State Council have paid great 
attention to these problems and have been taking measures to 
solve these problems in an effective manner. 
  Fellow deputies, after having comprehensively analyzed the 
situations at home and abroad, the CPC Central Committee clearly 
put forward the basic principles for the work of the whole party 
and the whole nation, namely, to implement the guidelines of the 
14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee in an all-round way; accelerate 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang di 
fa zhan]; maintain political stability; and promote sweeping 
social progress under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
the party's basic line. The CPC Central Committee emphatically 
pointed out that seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability represent the overall interests of the work for the 
whole party and the whole nation. We must subordinate ourselves 
to and serve these overall interests in carrying out all our 
tasks. We must conscientiously and properly handle the 
relationships among reform, development, and stability in real 
earnest. Economic development is the center of all our work, 
reform and opening up are the motive force of development, and 
development and reform are the foundation of long-term social 
and political stability; and social stability, in turn, is a 
prerequisite for economic development and the smooth progress of 
reform. Judging from the situations at home and abroad, we can 
see that China faces a rare historical opportunity for reform 
and development now. So long as we conscientiously do a good 
job in all fields of endeavor, timely discover new situations 
existing in reform and development and solve new problems, and 
maintain coordination among reform, development, and stability, 
and enable them to promote one another, our cause of socialist 
modernization will surely be able to march from one victory to 
another. 
  II. Maintain Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy 
Development of the National Economy 
  Nineteen ninety-four is a year in which the national economy 
has continued to maintain its growth momentum and is also an 
important year for us to press ahead with reform. In our 
economic work this year, we will deepen reform, open wider to 
the outside world, strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic 
structure, promote technological progress, actively open up 
markets, heighten economic efficiency, and control inflation to 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development. 
  In line with these requirements, the gross domestic product 
is projected to increase 9 percent this year. It is fairly 
appropriate that this growth rate has been arranged on the basis 
of 13 percent annual growth for two consecutive years. It will 
be a tremendous achievement if we can maintain a growth of 
between 8 percent and 9 percent for a successive number of 
years. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: "New ideas are 
needed to promote development. It is necessary to truly switch 
onto the track which focuses on heightening economic 
performance. We must not blindly take the old road of blindly 
going after output value, growth rate, and expanding the scale 
of investment." The current conditions for economic growth are 
somewhat tight, and the effects of bottleneck restrictions and 
inflationary pressures are expanding. Reform requires a fairly 
relaxed circumstance. We must correctly analyze and grasp the 
situation. We must not only see favorable conditions but also 
pay attention to unfavorable factors in an effort to maintain a 
vigorous but also steady and proper growth rate. In line with 
their respective actual conditions, various localities should 
determine a rational growth rate for themselves. They should 
avoid competing with each other and recklessly going after 
output value. 
  We must strengthen the role of agriculture as the 
foundation of the national economy, and develop all sectors of 
the rural economy. Agriculture concerns the overall 
situation. As the majority of China's population resides in the 
countryside, at no time should we neglect the farmers' interests 
and rural economic development. The supply of farm products has 
a direct bearing on the stability of prices, and the improvement 
of people's living conditions in urban and rural areas. 
Moreover, increases in farmers' incomes also has a direct 
bearing on the expansion of markets. Governments at all levels 
must conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central 
conference on rural work held last year, stabilize all basic 
party policies for rural areas, further deepen reform in rural 
areas, and appropriately resolve the outstanding contradictions 
and problems emerging in the course of economic development in 
rural areas. On the basis of ensuring the steady growth of 
grain and cotton production, it is necessary to promote an 
all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline undertakings and fishery, maintain the 
sustained growth of town and village enterprises, and do 
everything possible to increase farmers' incomes. 
  The main measures are as follows: 
  To appropriately increase the purchase prices of grain and 
the prices of contract purchase of cotton; to support the 
development of the industry for agricultural use; to strengthen 
the management of the prices of agricultural capital goods; to 
increase the central and local governments' agricultural 
investment; to encourage and guide collectives and peasants to 
increase investment; to step up agricultural capital 
construction and comprehensive agricultural development; to 
refine the state's grain storage system and to establish grain 
risk funds; to maintain stability of the grain market on the 
basis of stabilizing the area of grain and cotton crops and 
increasing per- unit area output, to adjust the agricultural 
production structure and develop a diversified economy. The 
state will give support to 500 selected key commodity grain 
production counties and 150 counties producing good-quality 
cotton, and will build a number of high-yield, good-quality, and 
highly- efficient model agricultural zones each of which with 
its own characteristics. Developing village and town 
enterprises is the way we must go to enable the rural population 
to live a relatively comfortable life. We should continue to 
support village and town enterprise development, especially in 
the middle and western parts of the country. We will continue 
to advance agriculture through the application of science and 
technology and promotion of education. We will cultivate a 
large number of useful and dedicated agricultural technicians, 
make those technicians and agricultural technology promotion 
organs more stable, take positive measures to prevent plant 
diseases and insect pests, and promote fine strains and the use 
of advanced and applicable technologies. We should continue to 
implement measures on easing farmers' burden and solve 
conspicuous problems with special efforts. The measures on 
easing farmers' burdens have enjoyed popular support, and we 
should continue to carry them out. We should earnestly carry out 
the plan to help the poor. This plan is, over the next 7 years 
from now to the end of this century, to help the 80 million 
people in poor areas, especially in the old revolutionary base 
areas, minority nationality areas, and frontier areas, to have 
enough to eat and wear, and to help them free themselves from 
poverty and live a better life. This is an unshirkable 
responsibility of governments at all levels. We believe this 
plan will definitely win warm support from people across the 
country. 
  We must dearly cherish and attach importance to protecting 
cultivated land, continually promote the building of a 
socialized service network in rural areas, further develop and 
perfect farm produce markets, push forward reform of the supply 
and marketing systems and the household registration 
administration system of small towns. The transfer of surplus 
rural labor to nonagricultural sectors and its rational flow 
between regions are the objective requirements of economic 
development and an inevitable trend. We must actively guide and 
strengthen the management of this work and carry it out step by 
step in a well-organized way. 
  We should improve management and do a good job of 
production on the industrial and communications front. 
Successfully carrying out industrial production and 
communications, especially the production and operation of 
state-owned large and medium enterprises, is of extremely great 
significance to maintaining the national economy's sustained 
development. Generally speaking, reform measures announced this 
year will have a positive impact on the enterprises' production 
and operations. However, they are also likely to bring 
temporarily unfavorable impacts to some enterprises. Currently, 
some state-owned large and medium enterprises are still in a 
difficult situation and suffer from poor economic efficiency. 
The causes of this are in their operating mechanisms as well as 
in their heavy social burdens, numerous historical loads, and 
poor internal management. We must actively work from many 
aspects to resolve this. Given that our finances are still 
fairly difficult, the State Council has nevertheless decided to 
exempt state-owned enterprises from the payment of energy and 
transport funds and budget regulatory funds, beginning this 
year. In addition, a special fund is appropriated to 
consolidate bankrupt enterprises and resettle their workers. 
All localities and departments should place the task of making 
state-owned large and medium enterprises successful at the head 
of their agenda, adopt feasible measures to create a favorable 
external environment for enterprises to carry out management and 
operations, and help them halt losses and increase profits. 
However, state-owned enterprises must rely on their own efforts 
to overcome their difficult situations. While actively pressing 
ahead with reform, enterprises must actively adjust their 
product mix in light of market demands at home and abroad, 
strive to produce readily salable goods, and constantly develop 
new products to enhance their market adaptability and 
competitiveness. 
  Governments at all levels should attach importance to 
commercial work and unclog the channels of rural and urban 
markets in order to further enliven commodity circulation and 
smooth the flow of goods. 
  Technical transformation of enterprises should be conducted 
by focusing on optimization of the product mix, improving the 
quality of products, reducing consumption, and lowering costs. 
Basic industries should upgrade their production capacity 
through technical transformation; and processing industries 
should seek advancement through technical transformation. We 
should attach importance to and support the transformation of 
the old industrial bases in order to enable them to continue 
playing an important role in the national economy. 
  The condition of production safety in some enterprises is 
not 
good, and serious accidents causing deaths and injuries have 
occurred quite frequently. Bad management is the main cause. 
Therefore, we must pay a high degree of attention to this 
situation. We should adopt effective measures to strengthen 
management on production safety and make sure that our efforts 
in this respect yield obvious results as soon as possible. 
  We must maintain a rational scale of investment and 
optimize the investment structure. A rational investment 
scale is an important condition for maintaining economic 
stability and enhancing the capacity to advance future economic 
development. Currently, the number of projects under 
construction throughout the country is already very large, and 
the number of construction projects arranged for the new year is 
not insignificant. We can no longer permit the continued 
expansion of construction projects. Even in the construction of 
basic industries and infrastructural facilities, we should also 
undertake them in line with our financial capacity. In order to 
realize a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy, all localities and departments must draw up 
their plans rationally by bearing in mind the overall situation 
and following an order of importance and urgency. They must 
give priority to devoting their financial and material resources 
to projects under construction involving the transport, 
telecommunications, energy, and important raw and semifinished 
material industries, as well as to other key construction 
projects involving the harnessing of large rivers and lakes. 
The coastal areas should be encouraged to invest in central and 
western regions in China and to jointly exploit local resources 
by making use of the advantages of the labor force there. This 
year, we will no longer approve the establishment of new 
development zones in the country. In the future, new capital 
construction projects must not start before necessary funds are 
available; it is necessary to have a certain proportion of 
capital to start new projects. Making investments by diverting 
circulating funds will not be permitted. The banks should 
tighten supervision and management to ensure the sufficient 
amount of circulating funds needed when projects are put into 
production. 
  Deepening the reform of the investment system is a 
fundamental guarantee for maintaining a rational scale of 
investment, optimizing the investment structure, and heightening 
investment returns. The reform of the investment system this 
year mainly involves the establishment of the National 
Development Bank. The aim is to provide a steady source of 
funds for key capital construction projects, and at the same 
time to check inflation and investment expansion through the 
balancing of capital. In order to establish a mechanism for 
restricting investment, both investors and the banks which 
provide loans must undertake responsibility for investment 
risks. We must improve macroeconomic regulation and control 
over the scale of investment and investment structure and 
standardize the procedures of making policy decisions on 
investment in order to reduce recklessness in investment. 
  We will open up wider to the outside world and 
develop cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries. 
On the whole, the current international environment is 
favorable to our country. We must seize this opportunity and 
continue to do a good job in opening up our special economic 
zones, the Shanghai Pudong New District, coastal open cities and 
belts, and technological and economic development zones, as well 
as key cities located in border areas, along rivers, and in the 
interior; and continue to raise the level of opening up. To 
maintain and develop the good momentum of foreign investment in 
China, we should further improve the investment environment, 
improve our economic laws and regulations concerning foreign 
businesses, make earnest efforts to protect foreign-funded 
enterprises' legitimate rights and interests, guide foreign 
investment with our state industrial policy, and encourage 
foreign investors to participate in building our country's basic 
industries and infrastructures. Foreign-funded enterprises 
should also abide by China's laws and regulations and operate 
their businesses according to law. We should pay attention to 
maintaining a proper amount of foreign debts and a rational mix 
of debts. 
  Maintaining a basic balance of international receipts and 
payments is an important condition for achieving a sustained and 
healthy economic development. China's economy is developing 
rapidly and the prospects of its market are very bright. Our 
imports last year increased quite considerably and the growth of 
our exports was relatively slow, causing a rather substantial 
deficit in our foreign trade. To ensure our needs of foreign 
exchanges for imported goods, we must actively expand our 
exports. We must follow the strategy of winning with quality 
and diversifying our markets, increase the intensity of 
processing, increase the technology of our goods, improve 
after-sale service, and actively explore new markets while 
consolidating and developing existing markets. We must continue 
to improve the tax refund system for exports, decontrol the 
import-export businesses in an orderly manner, and authorize 
more enterprises with the needed resources to trade with foreign 
countries. Foreign trade enterprises must earnestly change 
their operating mechanisms, thinking, and styles, and develop in 
the direction of turning themselves into industrialized, 
internationalized, and group-type trade enterprises. We must 
strengthen the approval and management of investments outside 
the country, strengthen the supervision over enterprises 
established outside the country, strive to develop international 
tourism, and expand the business of contracting foreign projects 
and cooperation in labor service. 
  On the basis of economic development, we should 
continue to improve the people's living standards. 
Continuously enhancing people's material and cultural lives is 
the basic purpose of developing our economy. It is also the 
basic starting point of government work. We must firmly uphold 
the mass view and be concerned with the masses' plight at all 
times. 
  Though we reaped bumper agricultural harvests in recent 
years, the comparative grain and cotton returns dropped. The 
increase in peasants' income was relatively slow. Governments 
at all levels must attach a high degree of importance to the 
problem; they must strengthen leadership over and give more 
support to rural economic development; they must increase 
peasants' income by developing the rural economy and by 
appropriately increasing purchase prices for grain and cotton. 
Continued efforts should be made to develop the tertiary 
industry to provide more job opportunities in urban and rural 
areas. State enterprises must increase the incomes of staff and 
workers by improving economic returns. A new wage system has 
been implemented for state functionaries, and it must be 
gradually improved. Housing construction must be sped up in a 
planned way in conjunction with the housing system reform in 
urban areas; the focal point of the work is to build a group of 
residences at medium or low prices for the people in an attempt 
to improve their housing conditions. Now, the masses in some 
impoverished and some disaster-hit areas and the staff and 
workers of enterprises with poor economic efficiency that have 
partially or completely halted production are still leading 
relatively difficult lives; and retired people's actual incomes 
have decreased somewhat. Governments at all levels must show 
special concern for them, and take positive measures to help 
them solve difficulties. We must uphold the policy of 
encouraging some areas and people to become prosperous ahead of 
others through honest labor and lawful business, and encourage 
those who have become prosperous ahead of others to bring along 
and help those who have lagged behind so as to gradually achieve 
common prosperity. Meanwhile, we must regulate excessive income 
gaps through a policy of rational distribution and the 
regulatory role of taxes. 
  Fellow deputies! Family planning and environmental 
protection are basic national policies. Though we have 
scored great achievements in carrying out the family planning 
task, its development is uneven and some achievements are not 
adequately consolidated. We must not slacken our efforts in the 
slightest degree. We must further improve the system of 
responsibility for attaining given objectives and strictly 
implement family planning policies, laws, and regulations. We 
must earnestly step up propaganda and education among 
grass-roots units and particularly at the village level, and 
improve services for them; and we must conscientiously solve new 
problems cropping up under the new situation. In conducting 
family planning work, we must put the stress on the rural areas 
and the migrant population and we must satisfactorily integrate 
family planning work with economic development, universal 
education, improvement in population quality, and the efforts to 
shake off poverty and achieve prosperity. Governments at all 
levels must include environmental protection in economic and 
social development programs; they must persist in mapping out 
plans for economic, urban and rural, and environmental 
construction; in carrying out the plans; and in achieving 
development in these fields of endeavor at the same time. They 
must carry out comprehensive treatment of urban and rural 
environments, they must strengthen supervision and inspection in 
accordance with laws, they must rationally exploit and protect 
natural resources, and they must make vigorous afforestation 
efforts to improve China's ecology. 
  III. Speeding Up the Establishment of a Socialist 
Market Economy 
  The general blueprint formulated by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee for the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure is the program for 
action in further deepening reform. This year, we should 
combine package reform with breakthroughs in key areas and make 
substantial progress in reforming the economic structure. 
  We should conscientiously implement the plan for 
fiscal and taxation reform and rationalize the distribution of 
revenues between the central and local authorities and between 
the state and enterprises. The main contents of the fiscal 
and taxation systems reform are to change the current local 
fiscal contractual responsibility system to a tax-sharing system 
on the basis of a rational division of power between central and 
local authorities. We will divide the revenue between the 
central and local authorities according to different categories 
of taxes and establish a separate taxation system for the 
central and local authorities. In the taxation system reform, 
we should establish a turnover tax based mainly on a value-added 
tax. We will unify the taxes on domestic- funded enterprises 
and the individual income tax. Meanwhile, we will reform the 
system of distributing state-owned enterprises' profits. The 
reform plan takes into full account both the need of a gradual 
increase in the central authorities' financial resources and, at 
the same time, the interests of local authorities and the 
enterprises' operational situation, which is conducive to 
bringing the initiative of both the central and local 
authorities into full play. This is a practical and feasible 
plan. Governments at various levels should take the overall 
situation into consideration and ensure the reform plan's smooth 
implementation. 
  At present, state finances are faced with some difficulties. 
With the economy's development and the fiscal and taxation 
systems reform, state revenues will increase steadily. However, 
it will take some time to alleviate the financial difficulties. 
This year, due to the fact that the government has to spend a 
relatively large amount of money to repay both capital and 
interest on domestic and external debts, lighten financial 
burdens on enterprises, carry out commodity prices reform and 
increase wages, there will be more factors of decreasing 
revenues and increasing expenditures. The central government 
deficit will be fairly large. The fiscal and taxation 
departments are required to strictly enforce the levying and 
management of taxes and to strive to increase financial 
revenues. In expenditures, we should adhere to the principle of 
belt tightening and strengthening budget control. Various 
localities should strive to achieve a balance in their revenues 
and expenditures and avoid deficits. The central government 
will solve its deficit by issuing state bonds and will no longer 
make overdrafts from banks. The state plans to give favorable 
treatment to those who purchase state bonds, improve the 
distribution methods, and develop and perfect the treasury bond 
market. This is a good thing that will benefit the country and 
the people. It is hoped that people across the country will 
enthusiastically purchase state bonds to support national 
construction. 
  We will steadily carry out the banking system reform 
and realize the unification of foreign exchange rates 
smoothly. As the socialist market economy develops, 
banking will play an increasingly important role in the national 
economy. We should steadily promote the banking system's reform 
and establish an effective system of macroeconomic regulation 
and control by the central bank, so that the People's Bank of 
China can effectively control the currency supply and stabilize 
the currency's value. We should actively and properly separate 
the functions of policy-lending banks from those of commercial 
banks. In addition to the establishment of a National 
Construction Bank, we will establish the China Import-Export 
Bank to support the import and export of whole sets of 
equipment. We will also establish the China Agricultural 
Development Bank, which will be responsible for the state's 
grain and oil reserves, the contractual procurement of 
agricultural and sideline products, and agricultural 
development. The existing state-owned specialized banks should 
gradually change themselves into state-owned commercial banks. 
Governments at various levels should support bank work and make 
it possible for banks to independently perform their functions 
and duties. Banks should consciously implement the state policy 
of macroeconomic regulations and control and establish 
self-regulating mechanisms. 
  China's economy is in a period of rapid growth; therefore, 
a shortage of funds will exist for a long time to come. Over the 
last two years, the total amount of currency and credit has 
increased sharply. However, because the economy has developed 
rapidly and the scale of construction has been excessively 
large, the contradiction between the supply of and demand for 
funds is still very prominent. This year we should strive to 
maintain an appropriate scale of currency issuance and credit, 
and prevent investment from swelling. At the same time, we 
should continue to improve the investment structure, rectify the 
financial order, tighten account settling discipline, take 
positive measures to break debt chains between enterprises, and 
improve the effectiveness of fund utilization. 
  Unifying the official renminbi exchange rate with the rate 
in 
the foreign exchange regulation market is a reform measure of 
great significance. This will play an important role in linking 
the domestic and overseas markets, and in broadening the scope 
of opening to the outside world. We should strictly implement 
the management system for settling both import and export 
charges with full payment in foreign exchange, and tighten the 
monitoring and management of revenue and expenditure of 
capital-related foreign exchange [zi ben xiang mu 6327 2609 7309 
4158] to prevent losses of foreign exchange. We should further 
develop and improve the foreign exchange market. The People's 
Bank of China should strengthen its foreign exchange market 
management, provide services to both the supply and demand 
sides, regulate supply and demand in a timely fashion, and 
stabilize foreign exchange rates. 
  We should transform the operating mechanisms of 
state-owned enterprises and search for effective ways to 
establish a modern enterprise system. Large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the mainstay of the 
national economy; the reform of state-owned enterprises is both 
the focus and difficult part of the economic structural 
reform. The fundamental way to increase the vitality of large- 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is to deepen reform; 
transform enterprise operating mechanisms; and establish a 
modern enterprise system under which the property rights as well 
as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly 
defined, government administration and enterprise management are 
separated, and scientific management is established. 
Establishing a modern enterprise system is definitely a 
requisite for developing socialized mass production and a market 
economy. This is difficult and complicated work. This year, 
the state will organize a number of large- and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises to experiment with establishing a modern 
enterprise system in accordance with the Company Law. Their 
experiences will be actively summed up and standardized 
implementing measures will be formulated gradually to popularize 
the modern enterprise system step by step. We should continue 
to actively advance the reform of the social security system to 
ease the burden of enterprises in undertaking social welfare 
projects and to create conditions for enterprises to participate 
in market competition on an equal footing. 
  We should also step up the reform of enterprise in general. 
We should continue to transform enterprises' operating 
mechanisms; truly give enterprises all their rights and 
responsibilities; continue to deepen the reform of enterprises' 
labor, personnel, and distribution systems; refine their 
internal mechanisms; and increase their vitality. We should 
truly strengthen the management of state-owned assets, do a good 
job in assets inventory and appraisal to ensure that state-owned 
assets maintain and increase their value. We should strictly 
prohibit state-owned assets from being used at a low price as 
company shares, being sold at low prices, or even being given to 
individuals as gifts. 
  We should further straighten out price relationships 
and develop and foster a market system. Over the last 
decade and more, with little social shock, we have basically 
decontrolled commodity prices. Our reform has been successful. 
This year we will also appropriately adjust the prices of 
grain, cotton, and energy in order to rally peasants' production 
enthusiasm, to support the development of the energy industry, 
and to promote the conservation of energy. In carrying out price 
reform, we should consider the state's, the enterprises', and 
the masses' ability to cope with the consequences. We should 
work positively to make an overall arrangement and conduct the 
work in a positive and steady manner. Governments at all levels 
and relevant social sectors should adopt positive, effective 
measures and make efforts to keep the increase of this year's 
retail prices within 10 percent. We should pay special 
attention to controlling the increase in the prices of basic 
consumer products and in the fees for services that are closely 
related to the masses' daily lives. We should continue to 
implement the mayor responsibility system and ensure the success 
of the vegetable basket project to stabilize non-staple food 
prices in urban and rural areas. 
  We must deepen the restructuring of the circulatory system 
and expedite the consolidation and opening of the domestic 
markets. While continuing to develop and improve the commodity 
markets, we must actively develop different kinds of production- 
factors markets, perfect market regulations, improve market 
order, strengthen market management and supervision, and protect 
consumers' legitimate rights and interests by resolutely 
punishing according to law all acts of producing or selling 
counterfeit and inferior goods. 
  We must continue to do a good job in restructuring 
government institutions and earnestly change government 
functions. Over the past year, the State Council, acting 
in accordance with the plan approved by the First Session of the 
Eighth NPC, carried out organizational reform. All departments 
have basically completed their assignments of designating 
responsibilities of specific organs and staffing them according 
to authorized sizes. This year, provincial-level governments 
should basically complete restructuring their organs, and the 
governments of some cities and counties should also undertake 
organizational reform. Governments at all levels should all 
make efforts to change their functions and raise work 
efficiency. We must persist in separating the government 
functions from enterprise management, let enterprises handle all 
the affairs within their operating autonomy, and let the market 
solve those problems which it should solve itself. We should 
give full play to the services of intermediary market 
organizations, such as trade associations and chambers of 
commerce, and improve the statistical work and administrative 
and auditing supervision. The government should primarily play 
the role of providing proper macroeconomic regulation and 
control, overall coordination, and social management. Cadres at 
all levels, especially leading cadres, must strive to study 
market economics and keep abreast with major reform projects, 
policies, laws, and regulations so that they can improve their 
leadership, and take greater initiative and be less reckless 
while doing their work. The State Council has decided to set up 
a state institute of administration to intensify the training of 
medium- and high-ranking public functionaries. 
  This year, major strides of reform have been made in 
establishing a socialist market economic structure. To make 
sure that the reform can proceed smoothly, governments at all 
levels must place greater efforts on reform, organize various 
projects meticulously, provide overall coordination, and provide 
reform with guidance through the media as well as by means of 
publicity and education. 
  Fellow deputies! Making greater efforts to build an 
efficient and clean government and fighting all phenomena of 
corruption is a basic task in building our political power and 
an important guarantee for the smooth progress of reform and 
development. Since last year, successes to varying degrees 
have been achieved in fighting corruption and promoting clean 
government with respect to disciplinary actions taken by cadres 
themselves to promote honesty, the major cases that have been 
investigated and handled, and efforts made by various 
professions and trade to stop unhealthy tendencies. During the 
new year, governments at all levels must not in the least 
slacken their efforts in this regard. We must understand the 
urgency, formidability, and complexity of the anticorruption 
struggle; fully depend on the masses; deal with the root causes 
as well as the symptoms; and strive to achieve new success. 
Government functionaries, especially leading cadres at various 
levels, must keep firmly in mind that the power in our hands is 
from the people. Seeking personal benefits by abusing power is 
totally against the objective of the people's government, and it 
is totally incongruous with China's socialist system. 
Introducing the principles for commodity exchange into state 
organs and government activities and trading power for money are 
absolutely not permissible because it is an act which seriously 
distorts the principles governing socialist market economy and 
damages reform, opening up, and modernization. We must continue 
to intensify the crackdown on such serious cases as abusing 
power for personal benefit, corruption, bribery, dereliction of 
duty, and malfeasance, as well as smuggling; and we must punish 
those lawless, undisciplined, and corrupt elements according to 
law. By no means must be tolerate them, otherwise we would have 
abetted them. We must oppose extravagance and waste, fraud, 
formalism, bureaucratism, and proneness to boast and exaggerate; 
and firmly stop the unhealthy tendencies in various trades and 
professions. Through deepening reform, we must improve our 
legal system and establish effective supervisory and restraining 
mechanisms so that we can guard against and eliminate corruption 
institutionally. Under the leadership of party committees at 
all levels, we must carry on in a deep-going and sustained 
manner the anticorruption struggle vital to the country's 
survival. Cadres at all levels must do their work honestly, 
diligently, conscientiously with self-discipline, and rouse 
ourselves for vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous; 
maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the broad masses, and serve 
the people wholeheartedly. 
  IV. Developing Scientific and Technological, 
Educational, and Cultural Undertakings 
  Developing scientific and technological, educational, and 
cultural undertakings and strengthening the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization are important aspects of 
modernization as well as important guarantees for the smooth 
progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
While concentrating efforts on economic construction, we should 
also attach great importance to reform and development in these 
spheres. 
  It is necessary to promote the close integration of 
science and technology with the economy. Science and 
technology is a primary productive force. Economic construction 
must rely on science and technology. Scientific and 
technological work must be geared to the needs of economic 
construction. This year, we will comprehensively implement the 
Scientific and Technological Advancement Law; increase 
investment in science and technology; manage well new- and 
high-technology industrial development zones; transform 
scientific and technological results into practical productive 
forces; implement the principle of "holding fast to one end and 
leaving the whole field open"; give vigorous support to basic, 
applied, and new- and high-technology research; encourage 
cooperation between scientific and technological development 
institutes and enterprises so that they will compete 
aggressively on the market and enhance their own development 
vitality. Scientific development and application should be 
focused on equipping all sectors of the national economy with 
advanced technology. In particular, we should address such 
urgent problems as developing a high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture; bringing about enterprises' 
technical transformation; converting military industrial 
enterprises' technologies to civilian production; and 
assimilating and renovating advanced technologies introduced 
from abroad. Activities in technological innovation and 
offering rationalization suggestions should be extensively 
conducted among the people. Great efforts should be made to 
foster a technology market, to set up intermediary organizations 
for technological development, and to effectively protect 
intellectual property rights. We should concentrate our efforts 
on managing well the existing state new- and high-technology 
industrial development zones so that they will play an exemplary 
role and create a radiating effect in promoting technological 
progress, transforming traditional industries, and developing 
new industries. 
  This year, in basic, new, and high-technology research, we 
should continue to select and tackle a number of key problems 
that have a profound and far-reaching influence on the 
scientific and technological development of the next century. 
To promote the development of engineering science and 
technology in our country, the State Council has decided to 
establish the China Engineering College, and preparations are 
under way in this respect. 
  We should do a good job of educational reform and 
development. Modernization depends on the improvement of 
people's quality and the training of qualified personnel. 
Governments at all levels should show foresight and a sense of 
urgency, earnestly implement "China's Program for Educational 
Reform and Development," and give strategic consideration to 
developing education on a priority basis. They should quicken 
the pace of educational reform, earnestly increase input in 
education, strengthen the management of educational funds, and 
promote the development of educational services. Governments at 
all levels should economize in other areas and perform some 
practical deeds for education in every possible way. In 
educational reform, we should focus on revamping the educational 
structure and on improving the quality of instruction and the 
efficiency of the use of funds. Schools of all types should 
implement the principle of promoting development in an all-round 
way -- morally, intellectually, and physically. They should 
strengthen and improve moral education; pay attention to 
education in national conditions, in the prevailing situation, 
and in our fine traditions; and nurture a new type of citizen 
who has high ideals, moral integrity, better education, and a 
strong sense of discipline. Primary and middle-school education 
is the basis of universal education. Basically universalizing 
nine-year compulsory education and basically eradicating 
illiteracy among young and middle-aged people are important 
tasks for the nineties, which must be carried out 
conscientiously and effectively. We should pay attention to 
admitting into school rural school-age children, strive to 
reduce the school dropout rate, mobilize resources in society to 
carry forward "Project Hope," take practical measures to lighten 
students' excessive burdens, and change the way students engage 
in studies for the sole purpose of coping with examinations. We 
should fully inspire the initiative of all social sectors to use 
modern means of transmission, such as radio and television, to 
vigorously develop vocational education, adult education, and 
all types of social education; gradually accomplish the goal of 
"providing training to people before they are employed and 
report to duty"; and train large numbers of professionally 
trained people and skilled workers. In some localities, we 
should appropriately increase the proportion of vocational 
education in compulsory education. In higher education, we 
should reform the system of running schools; actively but 
steadily and properly reform the systems of school admissions, 
fee collection, and employment for graduates; readjust the 
academic disciplines structure; strengthen internal management; 
and establish a number of key institutions of higher education 
and academic disciplines. We should seriously implement the 
"Teachers' Law," give full scope to the teacher's role, make 
great efforts to improve teachers' salaries, and foster the good 
custom of respecting teachers and stressing education in all of 
society. 
  We should actively create an environment and conditions 
favorable to fully exploiting people's talent and to bringing 
out large numbers of qualified people. We should gradually form 
a mechanism to facilitate the rational flow of qualified people; 
integrate the active training of qualified people with the 
rational employment of such people; continue to improve the 
working and living conditions of intellectuals; pay close 
attention to training and employing young and middle-aged 
intellectuals; continue to implement the principles of 
"supporting overseas studies, encouraging students studying 
abroad to return to their home country, and allowing them to 
come and go freely"; and encourage qualified overseas people to 
serve the motherland through various means. 
  We should promote the flourishing of socialist 
culture. We should adhere to the orientation of serving 
the people and socialism and the principle of letting a hundred 
flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend; 
vigorously enhance our fine national culture; advance socialist 
culture with Chinese characteristics; and further develop 
literature, arts, the press, publishing, radio, film, 
television, and other undertakings to enrich people's spiritual 
lives and arouse their initiative to plunge themselves into 
socialist modernization. We must actively press ahead with the 
culture management structure reform, enhance the vitality of 
cultural undertakings to advance, perfect economic policies 
related to culture, and correctly handle the relationship 
between social and economic benefits of spiritual works, placing 
social benefits at the top. Governments at all levels should 
support and help, with due emphasis, those fine literature and 
art creations and public-minded cultural undertakings that need 
support. We must step up the protection of cultural relics; 
attach importance to building libraries, cultural galleries, 
museums, science and technology centers, and archives; 
popularize putonghua [Mandarin]; promote the standardization of 
the written and spoken language; strengthen grass-roots cultural 
work; and do a good job of promoting cultural activities in 
enterprises, campuses, communities, and the vast countryside to 
enliven the cultural life of both urban and rural people. We 
must strengthen the management of cultural markets in accordance 
with the law and use rich, colorful, and healthy spiritual works 
to enliven cultural markets. We must oppose and boycott bad 
works detrimental to unity among the people, to social progress, 
and to the healthy mental and physical growth of young people. 
We must develop cultural cooperation and exchanges with the 
outside world. While absorbing the fruits of civilization of 
all countries of the world, we must actively introduce to the 
world the Chinese nation's fine culture. Cultural workers 
shoulder the glorious mission of advancing socialist culture. 
They should go deep among the masses and into reality to 
publicize in a big way the main theme, eulogize advanced figures 
who work hard and keep forging ahead in a pioneering spirit and 
with selfless dedication, and strive to create outstanding works 
which are positive in content which reflect socialist 
modernization, reform, and opening up and which are worthy of 
our great times. 
  We will promote public health and physical 
culture. In public health work we should persistently put 
prevention first. This year, we will continue to carry out 
experiments in the reform of the medical insurance system in 
selected urban areas by integrating the experiments with reform 
of the social security system; improve the work of public health 
in rural areas and expand rural cooperative medical services by 
adopting the method of integrating voluntary participation by 
peasants with mutual aid among them; stabilize the number of 
medical personnel in rural areas; establish and improve a 
three-level health care network embracing counties, townships, 
and villages; and realize, step by step, the goal of enabling 
everyone to enjoy primary health care. We will attach 
importance to prevention and control of endemic diseases, 
occupational diseases, and infectious diseases which seriously 
jeopardize people's health; and give full play to the advantages 
of traditional medicine and tighten control over the production 
and sale of pharmaceuticals. The masses of medical personnel 
should provide good-quality service by carrying forward the 
lofty professional ethics of healing the wounded and rescuing 
the dying. We will actively explore ways to reform the 
management system of physical culture in the new period and 
launch extensive mass sports activities to improve the people's 
physical fitness. Athletes must work hard to achieve good 
results at the 12th Asian Games and at other international 
competitions. 
  Deputies! 
  Here I want to specially emphasize we must adhere to 
the principle of fostering both material progress and cultural 
and ideological progress and of attaching importance to both in 
the entire process of reform, opening to the outside world, and 
the modernization drive, and strengthen the building of a 
socialist spiritual civilization. The building of a 
socialist spiritual civilization includes improvements in the 
fields of education, science, culture, ideology, and ethics, and 
is embodied in the economic, political, and cultural spheres and 
in social life. It is the common duty of all fronts and all 
departments to strengthen the building of a spiritual 
civilization. In ideological construction, we should focus on 
arming the people of the country with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The 
publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping was an important event in the political life in 
China. We must study them conscientiously and implement them in 
line with actual conditions. In compliance with the requirement 
raised by Comrade Jiang Zemin, we must arm people with a 
scientific theory, guide people with correct mass media, 
influence people with a noble spirit, and encourage people with 
outstanding works of literature and art. It is necessary to 
strengthen research in philosophy and the social sciences under 
the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought attach 
importance to the role of philosophy and the social sciences; 
and unremittingly carry out education on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism. The power of examples is 
inexhaustible. We should vigorously commend heroes and models 
on all fronts, learn from Xu Hongguang's noble spirit of daring 
to take up the cudgels for a just cause and of fearing no brute 
force, as well as his heroic behavior, and publicize this Lei 
Feng spirit in the new period. We should give full play to the 
strong points of political-ideological work to guide people, 
especially the young people, in fostering correct ideals, a 
correct outlook on life, and correct values; strengthen 
education on professional and social ethics; advocate 
industriousness, thrift, and the spirit of plain living and hard 
struggle; and oppose money worship, extreme individualism, and a 
decadent lifestyle, so as to foster good social practice. 
  V. Strengthening the Building of Socialist Democracy 
and the Legal System. 
  Developing socialist democracy and perfecting the socialist 
legal system are important components in building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. This year we will achieve new 
progress, ensure the smooth progress of reform and development, 
and promote all-round social progress. 
  We should continue to strengthen the building of 
socialist democracy. Reform, opening up, and modernization 
are the undertakings of hundreds of millions of people. We must 
rely wholeheartedly on the working class and the broad masses of 
people, fully develop democracy, and bring the initiative of the 
masses into play and successfully protect and guide it. 
  Governments at all levels must establish a sound democratic, 
scientific, decisionmaking system; listen with an open mind to 
views from all quarters; draw on the collective wisdom and 
absorb all useful ideas; and constantly raise our decisionmaking 
standards. We must consciously accept supervision of the 
people's congress and its standing committee at the 
corresponding level and supervision by the broad masses of 
people. We must further bring into play the roles of the CPPCC, 
democratic parties, and nonparty people in political 
consultation and democratic supervision. We must attach 
importance to the roles of trade unions, the Communist Youth 
League, women's federations, and other mass organizations as 
bridges and links; and give play to the supervisory role of 
public opinion. We must attach importance to letters and visits 
by the masses, and grasp people's feelings by opening and 
unclogging a multitude of channels. We must continue to 
strengthen the building of political power at the grass-roots 
level, perfect the democratic management system in enterprises 
and the urban neighborhood and village self- management system, 
perfect the democratic supervision system, and ensure that 
citizens' legitimate rights and interests are not encroached 
upon. 
  We must attach great importance to building the 
socialist legal system. The establishment and perfection 
of a socialist market economic structure relies on a 
comprehensive legal system to provide a safeguard. Since the 
start of reform and opening up, the NPC and its Standing 
Committee have speeded up the pace of legislation. A large 
number of important laws have, one after another, been 
promulgated for enforcement to provide a legal basis for work in 
all fields. Governments at all levels must learn to use legal 
means to manage the economy and society. All government 
personnel must conduct official business in accordance with the 
law and resolutely rectify the phenomena that laws are ignored 
or not strictly enforced and that law-breaking is not dealt 
with, so as to safeguard the dignity of the law. This year, we 
will step up the enactment of a number of administrative laws, 
strengthen the building of a law-enforcement contingent, raise 
law enforcement standards, strengthen and improve judicial and 
law enforcement supervision, establish and develop legal service 
organizations, and train a large number of qualified legal 
personnel to meet the needs of building the legal system. We 
must continue to conduct in-depth education about the legal 
system and disseminate legal knowledge among the entire 
citizenry, especially among cadres at all levels, to improve the 
sense of the legal system throughout society. 
  Conscientiously improving all facets of public 
security. This represents a strong desire of the people 
and a major responsibility of governments at all levels. It is 
the top- priority task of all law-enforcement departments to 
maintain stable public order this year. We must pay close 
attention to work in four areas: 1) Combating various criminal 
activities that jeopardize people's lives, property, and safety, 
and that disrupt modernization, in accordance with the law; 2) 
investigating and sternly dealing with major and important 
cases, punishing economic criminals in accordance with the law, 
and continuing the struggle against smuggling; 3) waging a 
deep-going struggle to ban prostitution, the practice of 
patronizing prostitutes, the abduction and sale of women and 
children, and drug abuse and smuggling; and eliminating the six 
vices and pornography; 4) Administering police work in 
accordance with law, strengthening the ranks of public security 
personnel, and bolstering the police force. Governments at all 
levels should make comprehensive improvement of public order a 
major, regular task and strictly enforce a system of leadership 
responsibility. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on 
dealing with or to launch specific crackdowns on those criminal 
offenses and repulsive social phenomena about which the people 
have complained bitterly. We should properly handle the 
contradictions within the people and mediate civil disputes in a 
timely manner in order to provide against possible trouble. We 
should uphold the principle of integrating specialized 
departments with mass work and enlist the participation of all 
to ensure that measures for comprehensive improvement of public 
order are implemented at the grassroots level and to create a 
fine social environment conducive to economic construction in 
which the people can live and work in peace and contentment. 
  Fellow deputies! China is a unified, multinational 
country. Strengthening national unity is in the interests of 
people of all nationalities in the country, and it is our common 
aspiration. Chairman Mao Zedong once said: The 
unification of our country, the unity of our people, and the 
unity of our various nationalities--these are the basic 
guarantees of the sure triumph of our cause. Reform, opening 
up, and the modernization drive have created a situation never 
before seen in our country for consolidating and developing our 
socialist national relationships in a spirit of equality, unity, 
and mutual assistance, as well as for promoting common 
prosperity. Primarily for historical, geographical, and social 
reasons, certain minority regions are still quite economically 
undeveloped today. It will take more time before we can change 
this situation once and for all. It is a major responsibility of 
the government to expedite the minority regions' economic 
development and social progress, as well as the common mission 
of people of all nationalities in the country. Through carrying 
out reforms and opening up, and with state support and 
assistance from economically developed regions, minority regions 
certainly can bring their own strengths into play, become more 
vital in developing their economies, and gradually reduce the 
gaps with economically developed regions and achieve prosperity 
with them together. We must earnestly implement the "Law of 
Regional Autonomy," comprehensively carry out policies for 
minority nationalities, improve the system for regional national 
autonomy, safeguard autonomous regions' rights to autonomy and 
national equality, safeguard national unity and our motherland's 
unification, and oppose separation of nationalities. We must 
comprehensively and correctly implement the policy governing 
religions, strengthen the management of religious affairs 
according to law, actively guide religions to adapt to socialist 
society, and lead people with and without religious beliefs and 
people of different religious denominations to respect each 
other, get along harmoniously with each other, and work hard in 
unity for the modernization of our great motherland. To 
safeguard our country's security, we must intensify the 
modernization of our national defense. China follows a 
strategy of active defense. Guided by Mao Zedong's military 
thought and Deng Xiaoping thought for army-building in the new 
period [deng xiao ping xin shi qi jun dui jian she si xiang 6772 
1420 1627 2450 2514 2601 6511 7130 1696 6080 1835 1927], the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA] has strived to make a 
success of its tasks of construction and reform and to create 
the best armed forces that our conditions permit, in light of 
the general requirement put forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin that 
the PLA must be "politically qualified, militarily toughened, 
remarkable in work style, strict in discipline, and assured of 
adequate logistical support." The PLA must vigorously carry 
forward the fine traditions of the people's army, intensify its 
ideological and political work, and firmly attend to military 
training so as to strengthen its capacity for fighting battles 
and defending the country in modern warfare and for rendering 
active support to reform, opening up, and local economic 
construction. Governments at all levels must be concerned with 
national defense construction and give the military the support 
it needs to accomplish its missions. We must persistently 
educate the people on national defense so as to heighten the 
whole nation's awareness of national defense. It is necessary 
to carry out in depth activities of supporting the government 
and cherishing the people and of supporting the army, giving 
preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and 
martyrs, and safeguard armymen's legitimate rights and interests 
in order to consolidate and develop army-government and 
army-people unity. Earnest efforts must be made to improve the 
militia and reserve service, build stronger reserve forces, and 
build a stronger people's armed police, public security, and 
security forces so as to safeguard national security and social 
stability. 
  VI. Actively Promote the Motherland's Peaceful 
Reunification 
  In the new year, we should continue to follow unswervingly 
the policy of peaceful reunification and "one country, two 
systems," and work actively to promote the great cause of 
reunifying the motherland. 
  The day is drawing near when China will resume its exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. The Chinese Government 
will, as always, go on preparing for a smooth transfer of 
government and a smooth transition in both places, in accordance 
with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [HKSAR], the Basic Law of the Macao Special 
Administrative Region, and relevant resolutions of the NPC and 
its Standing Committee. China and Portugal have cooperated well 
on the question of Macao. However, the talks between the 
representatives of the Chinese Government and the British 
Government on arrangements for 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong 
have terminated, the responsibility of which rests completely 
with the British side. In accordance with the Basic Law of the 
HKSAR and the decision of the NPC Standing Committee, the 
Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory 
Committee of the HKSAR has begun its work. The PWC's work is 
demanding and its responsibility heavy. It is hoped that the 
PWC will live up to the expectations and trust of the whole 
nation by uniting with Hong Kong compatriots on the broadest 
possible basis and doing good preparatory work for the first 
government and legislature of the HKSAR. No matter what 
unexpected turns that may crop up, the Chinese Government and 
people have the determination and ability to resume the exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule and to maintain Hong 
Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. It is hoped that 
compatriots of Hong Kong will join the people of the whole 
country, make concerted efforts, and contribute to this cause. 
  As a result of the coordinated efforts of people on both 
sides of the strait, cross-strait economic cooperation and trade 
grew continuously and personnel exchanges and exchanges in the 
fields of culture, science, technology, sports, and so forth 
further increased last year. A preliminary understanding was 
reached in talks of a functional nature. We maintain that, 
under the principle of one China, differences between the two 
sides of the strait should be settled through increased contacts 
and consultations. It is the common aspiration of all Chinese 
people to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, 
and any act or attempt of secession, no matter in what form, 
runs counter to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation 
and will be in vain. We place high hopes on the Taiwan 
authorities and still higher hopes on the people of Taiwan. We 
hope the Taiwan side will attach great importance to the overall 
interests of the nation and join us in developing relations 
across the strait and working for the peaceful reunification of 
the motherland. 
  VII. On Diplomatic Work 
  The world today is in the process of complicated and 
profound 
changes. The world is moving noticeably toward multipolarity. 
In general, the international situation is becoming more 
relaxed, and development is now a more prominent issue. 
Economics is becoming a dominant factor in the development of 
international relations. Peoples around the world share a common 
aspiration for the relaxation of tensions, cooperation, 
development, and progress. However, the world is far from 
tranquil. Many regions are in turmoil or suffering from endless 
war and chaos. Hegemonism and power politics remain. The major 
tasks for the international community are still to maintain 
world peace and promote economic development. 
  In this complicated and changing international situation, 
China has unswervingly pursued an independent foreign policy of 
peace and has made fresh progress in its diplomatic work. It 
has continuously expanded its friendly relations and cooperation 
with other countries, and its international prestige has 
steadily grown. It has played an important role in maintaining 
world peace and promoting economic development. We have friends 
all over the globe. 
  China has further strengthened good-neighborly and friendly 
relations with surrounding countries. China's relations with 
the DPRK have continued to grow. China's mutually beneficial 
and cooperative relations with Japan, Russia, and the ROK have 
expanded continuously. Meanwhile, our friendly relations and 
cooperation with other Asian nations, as well as developing 
countries in Africa, Latin America, and the South Pacific region 
have also developed further. 
  Relations between China and the West European countries and 
the European Community have further improved. Sino-German 
relations have entered a new stage of development and a new 
chapter has been opened in Sino-French relations. There are 
broad prospects for economic cooperation and trade between China 
and the West European countries, and so long as the two sides 
work hard together, bilateral relations between China and each 
of the West European countries will continue to be consolidated 
and to grow. 
  The maintenance of normal and stable Sino-U.S. relations not 
only accords with the vital interests of the two people but also 
benefits the stability and development of the Asia-Pacific 
region and the world as a whole. We should consider Sino-U.S. 
relations from a global perspective, looking beyond this 
century. We stand for resolving differences on the basis of 
mutual respect and through dialogue. Sino-U.S. relations will 
be improved and expanded continually so long as the various 
principles laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques 
are strictly observed to increase trust, reduce trouble, develop 
cooperation, and avoid confrontation. 
  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has 
actively participated in international affairs and played a 
positive role in such matters as settling international disputes 
through peaceful means, protecting the environment, and 
promoting social progress. The Fourth World Women's Congress 
will be convened in Beijing in 1995. The Chinese Government and 
people are preparing for this event. China stands for expanded 
economic cooperation and trade among nations and for enhanced 
south-south cooperation and north-south dialogue. It advocates 
the complete prohibition and destruction of all weapons of mass 
destruction, including nuclear weapons, proposes that all 
nuclear powers conclude a treaty undertaking not to be the first 
to use nuclear weapons and, supports the effort to conclude a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty through negotiations. 
China does not engage in the arms race, nor does it participate 
in any military bloc or seek a sphere of influence. It supports 
the idea of conducting dialogues on matters of security and 
cooperation in Asia and the Pacific and has made contributions 
to that end. 
  No matter how the world situation changes, China will not 
swerve from its position of upholding the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence, nor will it change its policy of 
developing friendly relations and cooperation with countries of 
the world and strengthening solidarity and cooperation with the 
vast number of developing countries. Ours is a diversified 
world. It is essential to recognize the differences among 
nations in their social systems, ideologies, cultures, 
traditions, national characteristics, and religious beliefs, to 
respect each other, cooperate with each other for their mutual 
benefit, and develop state-to-state relations on the basis of 
the universally recognized norms of international relations. 
  China attaches importance to human rights and is willing to 
participate, on an equal footing, in discussions on the human 
rights issue in the international community. However, we will 
by no means allow anyone to interfere in China's internal 
affairs under any pretense. The Chinese Government supports a 
resolution recently adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights 
denouncing certain countries for putting pressure on developing 
countries in this regard. I would like to tell our deputies 
about a news dispatch we have just received: In a vote 
yesterday by the UN Commission on Human Rights, the anti-China 
motion raised by some countries through the use of human rights 
issue met with failure once again. This fully demonstrates how 
unpopular it is to oppose China. Here, on behalf of the Chinese 
Government and people, I would like to express my heartfelt 
thanks to all countries which upheld justice. China is against 
hegemonism in any form. China is not seeking hegemony now, and 
it will not seek hegemony in the future when its economy is 
developed. China will never be a threat to any country or 
region and will always be a reliable force for the preservation 
of regional and world peace. The Chinese people will continue to 
work hard together with all other peoples around the world to 
establish a new international political and economic order that 
is just and reasonable, to maintain world peace, and to promote 
common development. 
  Deputies! 
  To build a strong China and bring prosperity to the people 
is 
the common aspiration of people of all nationalities across the 
country. The current situation is excellent and we have a rare 
opportunity. In the new year, we should, under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, unswervingly 
carry out the party's basic line, strengthen the great unity of 
people of all nationalities across the country; work hard 
together with one heart and one mind; vigorously blaze new 
trails; rely on our own strength; build our country through 
arduous struggle; and win a fresh victory in the reform, opening 
up, and modernization drive.

and the Draft State Budget for 1994" delivered by Finance 
Minister Liu Zhongli to the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress, NPC, in Beijing on 11 March] 
  [Text] Deputies: Being entrusted by the State Council, I 
now submit the report on the implementation of the state budget 
for 1993 and the draft state budget for your examination and 
approval, and also for suggestions from members of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference and other observers. 
<H5>  1. The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 </H5>
  In 1993, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line, the people of all nationalities across the country worked 
hard as one to implement in an all-round way the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress, thus scoring tremendous 
achievements in all fields of endeavor. The reform of the 
economic structure continued to deepen, and the national economy 
grew in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. A bumper 
harvest was reaped in agriculture; industrial production 
witnessed rapid growth; the domestic market was brisk, and the 
people's living standards continued to rise as their income 
increased; the state of fixed-asset investment improved 
somewhat, and the construction of infrastructural facilities and 
basic industries was increased; and as China opened itself wider 
to the outside world, international economic cooperation and 
trade contacts increased considerably. The aforementioned 
situation indicated that reform and opening to the outside world 
had brought about vitality and potential for developing China's 
economy, that all economic operations were continuing to move 
forward in a healthy direction, and that it was entirely 
necessary and correct for the party Central Committee and the 
State Council to adopt the measure strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control. 
  On this basis, total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 
billion yuan -- (including 69.384 billion yuan in income 
received from domestic and foreign debts) -- covering 113.1 
percent of the budget, a 23.2-percent increase over the previous 
year. Total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan 
-- (including 33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle 
and interest on domestic and foreign debts) -- equalled 112.5 
percent of the budget, a 21.2- percent increase over the figure 
for 1992. This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, 
which was not in excess of the budgeted figure. Of this figure, 
the central finance deficit came to 20.5 billion yuan, which is 
the same as the budgeted figure. Local revenues and expenditures 
were balanced. These figures were initially figures taken from 
the monthly report on the budget's implementation. There will 
be some changes when the final state accounts are compiled. 
  The state of implementing the state budget for 1993 based 
on the double-entry system was as follows: 
  Revenues in the regular budget totalled 407.391 billion 
yuan, 
or 119.3 percent of the budgeted figures. The main forms of 
revenue were: 1) Various taxes were 402.805 billion yuan, or 
116.3 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) Income from state 
budget regulatory funds was 10.172 billion yuan, or 86.2 percent 
of the budgeted figures. 3) Other income was 17.889 billion 
yuan, or 187.7 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Subsidies 
for nonproductive enterprises were 20.527 billion yuan, which 
was 1.473 billion yuan less than the budgeted figure, and the 
amount was reversed in the budget entry. Expenditures in the 
regular budget totalled 334.834 billion yuan, or 111.3 percent 
of the budgeted figures, accounting for 62.9 percent of total 
state expenditures. The main items of expenditures were: 1) 
Capital construction for nonproductive projects totalled 19.519 
billion yuan, or 112.4 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) 
Expenditures for developing various public undertakings and for 
social security [she hui bao zhang 4357 2585 0202 7140] totalled 
129.718 billion yuan, or 112.1 percent. Of this total, 
expenditures for agriculture, forestry, and water conservation 
projects totalled 14.214 billion yuan, or 107.5 percent of the 
budgeted figures; expenditures for cultural, educational, 
science, and health undertakings were 96.046 billion yuan, or 
112.7 percent of the budgeted figures; and pensions for disabled 
people and families of deceased people and social aid totalled 
7.516 billion yuan, or 108.4 percent of the budgeted figures. 
3) Expenditures for state political power were 102.406 billion 
yuan, or 112.2 percent of the budgeted figures. Of this total, 
expenditures for administration and management were 54.033 
billion yuan, or 121.5 percent of the budgeted figures; and 
expenditures for national defense were 43.248 billion yuan, or 
101.8 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Expenditures for 
price subsidies were 29.622 billion yuan, or 79.5 percent of the 
budgeted figures. 5) Other expenditures were 51.719 billion 
yuan, or 149.7 percent of the budgeted figures. Total revenues 
were 72.557 billion yuan more than total expenditures in the 
regular budget, and the balance was shifted to the construction 
budget. 
  The construction budget revenues (not including income from 
domestic and foreign debts) totalled 107.264 billion yuan, or 
122.5 percent of the budgeted figures. The main sources of 
revenue were: 1) The amount of the balance in the regular budget 
shifted to the construction budget was 72.557 billion yuan. 2) 
Specialized construction revenues (including income from energy, 
communications, and other key construction projects and taxes 
for city maintenance) were 48.699 billion yuan, or 96.7 percent 
of the budgeted figures. 3) The income of various enterprises 
was 5.433 billion yuan, or 65.1 percent of the budgeted figures. 
4) Transfer funds were 1.302 billion yuan, or 26 percent of the 
budgeted figures. 5) Subsidies to make up for losses by 
productive enterprises were 20.727 billion yuan, resulting in a 
balance of 3.877 billion yuan which represents a debit in the 
budget that has been deducted from the receipts. Construction 
budget expenditures were 197.148 billion yuan (including 
expenditures for the repayment of domestic and foreign debts, 
plus interest), or 114.6 percent of the budgeted figures, 
accounting for 37.1 percent of the total budgeted expenditures. 
The main items of construction budget expenditures were: 1) 
Productive capital construction expenditures were 73.187 billion 
yuan (including 26 billion yuan by utilizing foreign debts), or 
102.8 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) Expenditures for 
tapping potentials, restructuring existing enterprises, and 
introducing the trial production of new products were 42.362 
billion yuan, or 170.5 percent of the budgeted figures. 3) The 
additional appropriation of revolving funds for enterprises 
totalled 1.882 billion yuan, or 134.4 percent of the budgeted 
figures. 4) Expenditures for geological surveys and prospecting 
were 5.16 billion yuan, or 105 percent of the budgeted figures. 
5) Expenditures for supporting agricultural production were 
17.977 billion yuan, or 112.6 percent of the budgeted figures. 
6) Expenditures for city maintenance and construction totalled 
19.47 billion yuan, or 124.7 percent of the budgeted figures. 
7) Expenditures for supporting economic development in less 
developed areas were 2.226 billion yuan, or 104.6 percent of the 
budgeted figures. 8) Expenditures for the repayment of domestic 
and foreign debts plus interest were 33.735 billion yuan, or 
96.5 percent of the budgeted figures. The difference between 
construction budget revenues and construction budget 
expenditures was 89.884 billion yuan, and the balance was 
included in the central state budget. Of this total, 38.484 
billion yuan were covered by domestic debts and 30.9 billion 
yuan were covered by foreign debts, and the remaining 20.5 
billion yuan were an out-and-out financial deficit which will be 
covered by borrowing from the People's Bank of China according 
to the budget approved by the First Session of the Eighth NPC 
last year. 
  The result of the implementation of the 1993 state budget 
was that both revenues and expenditures exceeded the budgeted 
figures by a fairly large margin. According to our preliminary 
analysis, the overfulfillment of revenues by a large margin was 
mainly due to three factors: First, the national economy's 
sustained, rapid growth caused an accompanying increase in 
revenue. In 1993, the gross domestic product increased 13.4 
percent compared to the previous year; industrial value-added 
production increased by 21.1 percent; and the total volume of 
retail sales increased by 26.1 percent. The rapid growth of the 
national economy and the expanded circulation of commodities 
brought about the overfulfillment of revenues of the main tax 
categories closely related to economic growth. Revenues from 
the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax alone were 
49.5 billion yuan greater than the budgeted figure. Second, 
measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control yielded positive results and led to a marked drop in 
revenue losses. As a result of the implementation of measures 
taken since last year by the party Central Committee and the 
State Council to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and 
control, situations such as reducing or remitting taxes without 
authorization, refunding tax payments arbitrarily, assigning 
people to collect fixed amounts of taxes, and other violations 
of financial and tax laws have been brought under effective 
control. Meanwhile, cases of reducing or remitting taxes for 
the time being or because of financial difficulties were no 
longer examined and approved. As a result, financial revenues 
increased month by month. According to State General 
Administration of Taxation statistics, efforts to screen tax 
reductions and exemptions and to collect tax payments in arrears 
for previous years brought about a 30 billion yuan increase. 
Third, in 1994, the central authorities decided to implement the 
fiscal tax assignment system, under which the central government 
will return to local governments a certain percentage of their 
tax revenues based on their 1993 figures. This new system 
aroused the local governments' enthusiasm for revenue 
collection, and they took a number of measures to strictly 
collect taxes, manage revenues, and prevent tax evasion. As a 
result, revenues increased by a large margin in the fourth 
quarter. However, some local governments, to inflate the base 
figure for the central government's reimbursement, resorted to 
illegitimate means and to fraud by collecting taxes before the 
due date. We have urged local governments to examine and 
correct themselves, and we will organize forces to verify and 
handle cases in accordance with the State Council's requirements. 
  Expenditures exceeded the budgeted figure. This is mainly 
because local governments may spend more when they have more 
revenue according to the principle of striking a balance between 
revenues and expenditure and after turning over what they have 
to turn over to the higher authorities in light of the 
contracted financial responsibility system. So, a big increase 
in local revenues gave rise to a corresponding rise in local 
expenditures. 1) As far as the categories of increased 
expenditures were concerned, expenditures related to economic 
growth increased by a bigger margin. Of these increases, 
expenditures for domestic capital construction exceeded the 
budgeted figure by 4.164 billion yuan, expenditures for tapping 
the potentials of enterprises and their restructuring exceeded 
the budgeted figure by 16.982 billion yuan, and expenditures for 
aiding agriculture exceeded the budgeted figure by 3.004 billion 
yuan. 2) Expenditures needed to develop various undertakings 
increased by a larger margin. Of these increases, spending on 
cultural, educational, science, and health projects were 10.816 
billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Spending on 
education alone were 6.463 billion yuan more than the budgeted 
figure. Spending on urban maintenance and construction were 
3.86 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. 3) Spending on 
wage adjustments for workers and staffers of administrative 
institutions and units was budgeted at 4 billion yuan. In the 
course of its implementation, however, because the margin of 
wage adjustments was higher than the originally estimated 
figure, in addition to an increase in personnel and changes in 
jobs and grades throughout the year, the actual spending was 
almost double the budgeted figure. It should be said that such 
spending increases are reasonable and necessary for ensuring the 
development of reform, construction, and various undertakings. 
At the same time, however, it also should be noted that the 
scale of construction has expanded in an unplanned way, and that 
the situation of going after things new and foreign and engaging 
in extravagance and waste is quite serious in the way that 
administrative expenses are disbursed. In a few localities, 
spending was even reported falsely. These are also important 
reasons for expenditures having exceeded the budgeted figures. 
  Generally speaking, the 1993 budget was implemented well. 
To ensure the deepening of reforms and to bring about the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy, the finance and taxation departments at all levels did 
a great deal of work under the unified leadership of the party 
and the government. First, they achieved positive results in 
collecting revenues, strictly managed revenue collection, and 
screened cases of tax reductions and exemptions and cases of tax 
payments which are in arrears. In accordance with the unified 
arrangements of the State Council, local governments carried out 
a complete screening of tax reductions and exemptions that they 
had authorized, as well as of the policies regarding the "two 
funds" and abolished some improper policies and provisions. In 
view of changes in sources of revenue, many localities carried 
out timely readjustments of their emphasis with respect to tax 
collection, improved their management, and ensured a reasonable 
growth of revenue. Second, they tried in every possible way to 
collect funds and thus ensured revenue for major expenditures. 
Especially while revenue growth was slow in the first half of 
1993, the finance departments at all levels managed to reduce 
less essential expenditures and to rationalize the distribution 
of funds, and they did their best and ensured funding for 
essential expenditures. Third, important progress was made in 
fiscal reform and legislation. The "General Rules for Enterprise 
Finance" and the "Rules for Enterprise Accounting" were 
successfully put into effect on 1 July 1993. A great deal of 
preparations were made last year for a comprehensive reform of 
the fiscal and tax systems. The "Registered Accountants Law," 
revised the "Individual Income Tax Law," and the "Accounting 
Law" have been promulgated and put into effect. The State 
Council has promulgated some interim taxation regulations, 
including those concerning the value-added tax, consumption tax, 
business tax, resource tax, enterprise income tax, and land 
value appreciation tax. The "Budget Law" will be submitted to 
this session for deliberation. Special mention should be made 
of the fact that although treasury bond sales were sluggish for 
some period last year, party committees and governments at all 
levels, as well as relevant departments, attached great 
importance and lent their enthusiastic support to such sales. 
Financial departments at all levels also devoted massive 
manpower to providing services aimed at promoting sales, thereby 
ensuring the completion of the task of issuing treasury bonds. 
This was of vital importance to the fulfillment of last year's 
budgetary tasks. 
  Deputies, at present we are in a important period of 
economic 
restructuring and rapid economic development. Not only is the 
contradiction between the supply of funds and the demand for 
funds very sharp, but management in various sectors urgently 
needs to be improved. In 1993, all large increases in both 
revenues and expenditures were attained at the local level, and 
the central government did not fulfill the budget targets in 
revenues and expenditures. While local revenues increased by a 
big margin, the revenue from the turnover tax belonging to the 
central government was far below the budget target, thus further 
aggravating the central government's financial difficulties. 
All these show from different angles the problem of the fiscal 
and tax systems, especially when some localities could not pay 
the wages of their workers and staff members in a normal manner 
even after local revenues increased by a big margin. 
Governments at all levels should pay great attention to this 
problem. To solve these problems once and for all, we will 
comprehensively reform the fiscal and tax systems this year 
according to the decisions and unified arrangements of the State 
Council. We will seize this opportunity to further improve 
fiscal and tax management and gradually establish fiscal and tax 
operating mechanisms to meet the requirements of the socialist 
market economy so that fiscal and tax management will be 
standardized and legally institutionalized, and so the country's 
financial situation will be improved as quickly as possible. 
  2. The Draft State Budget for 1994 
  The year 1994 is a crucual year for implementing in an 
all-around way the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee; realizing reform in establishing 
a socialist market economic structure; and continuing to 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. The deepening of reform and economic 
development have created many favorable conditions for state 
finances, but have also brought about difficulties. The current 
financial situation is still grim. On the one hand, market 
demands this year will remain brisk due to the reaction of such 
factors as the increase of investments and the rise in the price 
of farm products and workers' and staff's wages. On the other 
hand, after two years of successive rapid growth, China's 
economy is faced with an expanding "bottleneck" restraint and 
inflationary pressure. The overall environment for economic 
growth is by no means easy, and the contradiction in money 
supply and demand is quite serious. To maintain a basic balance 
between total demand and total supply and to alleviate the 
inflationary pressure, it is necessary to follow the principle 
of tightening budgetary restraint in drawing up the state budget 
for 1994. 
  On the basis of this understanding, the guiding principles 
for planning the state budget for 1994 are: Fully implementing 
the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; ensuring 
smooth progress in financial, taxation, and other major economic 
reforms; continuing to tighten and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control; actively building up financial sources; 
paying attention to improving enterprises' efficiency; ensuring 
that increases in financial revenue match economic development; 
upholding the principle of acting within one's means; 
readjusting the expenditure structure; appropriately increasing 
input in such key sectors as agriculture, education, science and 
technology, and infrastructure; maintaining needed increases in 
funds for national defense, public security, and judicial 
departments; strictly controlling ordinary fixed assets 
investment and consumptive expenditures; and promoting 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national 
economy, as well as overall social progress. 
  In line with the general plan of the party Central Committee 
and the State Council, we have carried out a major reform of the 
taxation system, the financial system, and the system of profit 
distribution in state-owned enterprises this year. After 
financial and taxation reform, there have been considerable 
changes in the requirements for drawing up the budget. For 
example, following the reform of the indirect tax system -- 
because of the fact that the value-added tax has been 
universally practiced in production and circulation areas -- the 
turnover tax levied on wholesalers and retailers and the product 
tax levied on some products have been converted into value-added 
tax. As a result, the value-added tax has increased nearly 100 
percent while the turnover tax has decreased correspondingly. 
With the cancellation of the product tax, the levying of a 
consumption tax on a small number of products has begun. Here 
is another example: in accordance with the stipulation on the 
division of central and local tax categories set by the new 
financial system, fixed central revenue and fixed local revenue 
are to be listed as central revenue and local revenue. As for 
tax revenues to be shared by central and local authorities, 75 
percent of the value-added tax is to be listed as central 
revenue. At the same time, tax revenues to be returned to local 
authorities by the central authorities are to be listed as 
central subsidy expenditures for local authorities. The amount 
of central expenditures has increased considerably because the 
amount of tax revenues to be returned to local authorities is 
fairly large. As a result of these changes, corresponding 
readjustments have been made in the draft state budget for 1994. 
  In accordance with the guiding principles for budgetary 
planning and the changes made in calculations, we have initially 
planned the 1994 budget as follows: State revenues (excluding 
income from domestic and foreign debts) total 475.995 billion 
yuan, a 7.7 percent increase over the previous year, calculated 
on similar terms. State expenditures (excluding expenses 
incurred to service domestic and foreign debts) total 542.914 
billion yuan, a 15 percent increase over the previous year, 
calculated on similar terms. This leaves a deficit of 66.919 
billion yuan. We also made certain changes from the previous 
year in the way incomes and expenditures from domestic and 
foreign debts and budget deficits are calculated. Primarily, in 
the past, income from debts was included in total revenues, and 
debt service was included in total expenditures; budget 
shortages resulting therefrom were regarded as real deficits and 
were covered by borrowing from the people's bank. Many experts 
at home and abroad have raised issues concerning this method of 
calculation. To better reflect how the state's regular revenues 
and expenditures and debt obligations stand, beginning this 
year, we will change the way deficits are calculated. Under the 
new method, receipts from debts will not be included in total 
budgets, nor will debt service be included in total 
expenditures; budget shortages will be covered entirely by 
borrowing. At the same time, domestic and foreign debts due for 
repayment will be serviced by borrowing. The adjustment only 
changes the way deficits are calculated and will not affect 
their actual size. 
  Under the 1994 budget plan, state revenues will increase 7.7 
percent over the previous year, which is not high. This is 
mainly because last year's revenues were substantially above the 
budgeted amount. The increase in last year's revenues has 
limited the scope of increase in this year's revenues. At the 
same time, policy-related factors -- such as exemption from 
state budget regulating funds and communications and energy 
construction funds granted to state-owned enterprises this year, 
the implementation of the "General Financial Rules for 
Enterprises," and the increase in export tax rebates -- have 
reduced revenues by about 30 billion yuan. These policy-related 
revenue-reducing measures are all designed to support 
enterprises, exports, and reform. Calculated in comparable 
terms, this year's revenue will actually increase 14.4 percent 
over the previous year. The current revenue plan, therefore, is 
positive, and is based on a full consideration of 
revenue-enhancing factors, such as rapid economic development 
and improved management. In the area of expenditures, although 
we appropriately reduced investment in fixed assets, the high 
expenditure base for 1993 made it necessary to increase 
expenditures by more than 50 billion yuan to cover such 
policy-related expenditures as increases in essential 
expenditures on agriculture, education, science and technology 
and other key areas; wage increases for employees of 
administrative departments and public institutions; and 
increased subsidies following the introduction of a single 
exchange rate. All this has made it quite difficult to balance 
the budget and has actually resulted in a considerable increase 
in deficits from the previous year. 
  The draft state budget compiled according to the dual 
budget system follows: 
  Revenues in the regular budget total 448.911 billion yuan, a 
9.9 percent increase over the previous year. The main receipts 
are: 1) Tax receipts, 446.123 billion yuan; 2) receipts from 
state budget regulating funds, 2.8 billion yuan; 3) receipts 
from other sources, 15.288 billion yuan; and 4) subsidies to 
make up for losses for nonproductive enterprises, 19.3 billion 
yuan, which represents a debit in the budget that has already 
been deducted from projected receipts. The expenditures in the 
regular budget amount to 392.846 billion yuan, which posts a 
17.3 percent increase over the previous year and represents 72.4 
percent of total expenditures in the budget. The main 
expenditures break down as follows: 1) Nonproductive capital 
construction, 19.486 billion yuan; 2) expenditures for 
development and operation of certain undertakings and for social 
insurance, 153.566 billion yuan, including 16.737 billion yuan 
in expenses for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, 
113.296 billion yuan for culture, education, science, and public 
health, and 8.386 billion yuan for pensions for the disabled and 
families of the deceased and social relief payments; 3) expenses 
for building up the national strength, 119.199 billion yuan, 
including 61.359 billion yuan for administrative expenses and 
52.04 billion yuan for national defense; 4) subsidies to 
compensate for price rises, 37.342 billion yuan; 5) 
miscellaneous expenses, 54.353 billion yuan; and 6) central and 
local reserves, 3.5 billion yuan. When revenues are set against 
expenditures in the regular budget, there will be a surplus of 
56.065 billion yuan, which will be transferred to the 
construction budget. 
  Revenues in the construction budget total 83.149 billion 
yuan, a decrease of 22.5 percent from the previous year. The 
main receipts break down as follows: 1) Regular budget surplus, 
56.065 billion yuan; 2) receipts for special construction 
projects, 43.718 billion yuan, including 4.8 billion yuan from 
funds collected for construction of key energy and transport 
projects; and 3) subsidies to make up for losses suffered by 
productive enterprises, 16.634 billion yuan, which represents a 
debit in the budget that has already been deducted from the 
receipts. Expenditures in the construction budget total 150.068 
billion yuan, which posts an increase of 9.2 percent over the 
previous year and represents 27.6 percent of total budgetary 
expenditures. The breakdown of major items of expenditures 
follows: 1) Expenses for productive capital construction, 
45.756 billion yuan (excluding 14.245 billion yuan arranged from 
foreign loans); 2) funds for tapping the potential of existing 
enterprises, upgrading technology, and subsidizing trial 
manufacture of new products, 38.508 billion yuan; 3) additional 
working capital for enterprises, 1.882 billion yuan; 4) expenses 
for geological surveying, 6.198 billion yuan; 5) expenditures 
for support of agricultural production, 21.063 billion yuan, 
including 6.685 billion yuan of special funds for agricultural 
development; 6) expenses for urban construction and maintenance, 
21.6 billion yuan; and 7) development funds to aid economically 
underdeveloped areas, 2.55 billion yuan. Expenditures exceed 
revenues in the construction budget, leaving a deficit of 66.919 
billion yuan, which is to be covered by issuing treasury bonds 
and borrowing from the bank. Coupled with the principal and 
interest of domestic and foreign debts in the amount of 48.081 
billion yuan, which mature and must be repayed this year, and 
14.245 billion yuan's worth of foreign loans used by the state 
for key construction projects this year, the total amount of 
debts incurred for 1994 will be 129.245 billion yuan. 
  In the draft state budget for 1994, revenues in the central 
budget are set at 332.91 billion yuan, a 3.8 percent increase 
over the previous year. The figure includes revenues of 272.056 
billion yuan by the central government and revenues of 60.854 
billion yuan turned over by local governments to the central 
government. Expenditures in the central budget amount to 399.829 
billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent over the previous year. 
The figure includes expenditures of 186.289 billion yuan by the 
central government and expenditures of 213.54 billion yuan as 
tax refunds and subsidies to local governments. Expenditures 
exceed revenues in the central budget, leaving a deficit of 
66.919 billion yuan. According to the budget drafted by us for 
local governments, a total amount of 417.479 billion yuan is 
arranged as financial revenues for local governments. The 
figure, including financial revenues of 203.939 billion yuan by 
local governments and tax refunds and subsidies totaling 213.54 
billion yuan by the central government, posts an increase of 6.8 
percent over the previous year. Expenditures in the draft local 
budget come to 417.479 billion yuan, an increase of 6.8 percent 
over the previous year. The figure includes expenditures of 
356.625 billion yuan by local governments and an amount of 
60.854 billion yuan to be turned over to the central government. 
Thus, local revenues and expenditures are balanced. 
  The central budget compiled according to the dual budget 
system follows: 
  Revenues in the regular central budget total 325.923 billion 
yuan, a 6-percent increase over the previous year. The main 
receipts are broken down as follows: 1) Various tax receipts, 
264.529 billion yuan; 2) receipts from state budget regulating 
funds, 1.64 billion yuan; 3) receipts from other sources, 1.49 
billion yuan; and 4) receipts turned over to the central 
government by local governments, 60.854 billion yuan. 
Expenditures in the regular central budget total 310.667 
billion yuan, a 10.7-percent increase over the previous year. 
The main expenditures are broken down as follows: 1) 
Expenditures for nonproductive capital construction, 12.046 
billion yuan; 2) expenditures for the development of public 
services and social security, 19.457 billion yuan; 3) 
expenditures for building up national strength, 62.361 billion 
yuan; 4) subsidies to compensate for price increases, 13.1 
billion yuan; 5) miscellaneous expenses, 9.391 billion yuan; 6) 
central reserves, 1.5 billion yuan; and 7) subsidies by the 
central government for regular expenses incurred by local 
governments, 187.412 billion yuan. When revenues in the regular 
central budget are offset against expenditures, there is a 
surplus of 15.256 billion yuan, which will be transferred to the 
construction budget. 
  Revenues in the central construction budget total 22.243 
billion yuan, a 44.3-percent decrease from the previous year. 
The main receipts are broken down as follows: 1) The surplus 
from the regular budget, 15.256 billion yuan; 2) receipts for 
special construction projects, 13.21 billion yuan; 3) subsidies 
to make up for losses in productive enterprises, 6.223 billion 
yuan, which represents a debit in the budget that has already 
been deducted from the receipts. Expenditures in the 
construction budget total 89.162 billion yuan, a 27.2-percent 
increase over the previous year. The main expenditures are 
broken down as follows: 1) Expenditures for productive capital 
construction, 29.899 billion yuan; 2) Funds for tapping existing 
enterprises' potential, upgrading technology, and subsidizing 
the trial manufacturing of new products, 11.998 billion yuan; 3) 
additional working capital for enterprises, 1.15 billion yuan; 
4) expenditures for geological surveying, 6.158 billion yuan; 5) 
expenditures for aiding agricultural production, 1 billion yuan; 
6) development funds for aiding economically underdeveloped 
areas, 1.385 billion yuan; and 7) subsidies for local 
construction by the central government, 26.128 billion yuan. 
Expenditures exceed revenues in the central construction 
budget, leaving a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan, which will be 
covered by debt. The total debt volume for 1994 will total 
129.245 billion yuan, including 48.081 billion yuan in principal 
and interest on domestic and foreign debts that will become due 
this year, and 14.245 billion yuan in foreign loans to be used 
for key state construction projects. 
  The 1994 state draft budget was drawn up in light of the new 
situation following financial and tax reforms. During the 
budgeting process, we gave as much consideration as possible to 
various factors that may affect budget revenues and 
expenditures. Nonetheless, the actual situation will inevitably 
be different. Specifically, it is difficult to estimate with 
complete accuracy revenues transferred from one tax category to 
another, changes in enterprises' burdens, and increases or 
decreases in local revenues following reform of the taxation 
system. The effects of financial and tax reforms on various 
economic activities can be seen clearly only after such reforms 
have been implemented for a considerable period of time. 
Because the budget was drawn up amid a significant number of 
uncertain factors, some changes may occur when it is 
implemented. If the changes are substantial, we will rework the 
budget and submit the revised version to the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee for examination and approval. To 
facilitate examination by fellow deputies, I would like to 
expound on policy-related issues in compiling the draft state 
budget: 
  (1) On the question of debts in 1994. Domestic 
and foreign debts for 1994 are set at 129.245 billion yuan, a 
39.361 billion yuan increase; the total debt volume accounts for 
3.8 percent of the year's gross domestic product, a slight 
increase over the previous year. The increase in the debt 
volume is related to three factors. First of all, to balance 
regular financial revenues and expenditures, 66.919 billion yuan 
treasury bonds are to be issued to make up for the increased 
financial deficit which, from 1994, can only be settled through 
issuing bonds, not borrowing money from banks; thus increasing 
the debt volume. Second, treasury bonds are also issued for 
paying for the principal and interest on domestic and foreign 
debts due this year, which totals 48.081 billion yuan. Third, 
to step up major construction, the state's financial input for 
key construction projects will be 14.245 billion yuan in foreign 
loans. I would like to explain here the relatively big volume 
of treasury bonds to be issued this year. Although we have 
substantively reformed the procedures for issuing and managing 
bonds in line with the requirements of a market economy, 
successful fulfillment of the issuance task still needs the 
undertanding and support of leaders at all levels and people 
throughout the country. So long as we ensure good publicity, not 
only can this year's task of issuing bonds be fulfilled, but 
also their market operations can be better than in the previous 
year. 
  (2) On the question of promoting rural economic 
development in an all-around way. The development of 
agriculture and increase of peasant income is the prerequisite 
for ensuring a basic balance between the total supply and demand 
of society and for safeguarding social stability. To this end, 
expenditures for aiding production and for paying various 
agriculture-related operating expenses in this year's state 
budget total 37.8 billion yuan, a 17.4 percent increase over the 
actual expenses in the previous year. Including other budgetary 
items used as agricultural expenses, the state's planned 
financial input in agriculture totals 52.3 billion yuan, a 7 
billion yuan increase over the previous year. Meanwhile, to 
comprehensively implement the central authorities' "Several 
Policy Measures Regarding the Current Agriculture and Rural 
Economic Development," the state will adopt additional policy 
measures, including perfecting the grain reserve system and 
establishing the central and local grain risk fund systems; 
appropriately raising the procurement price of grain and the 
contract price of cotton after new grain and cotton crops appear 
on the market; and readjusting the state's input into 
agriculture to ensure stable grain markets and to increase 
peasant income, thereby promoting rural economic development in 
an all-around way. 
  (3) On the question of further invigorating large and 
medium state enterprises. Further invigoration of large 
and medium state enterprises is crucial for maintaining a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy, as well as an important foundation for establishing a 
socialist market economic structure. In line with the central 
authorities' requirements for transforming the operating 
mechanisms of enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise 
system, this year's reform of the fiscal and taxation systems 
will focus on transforming mechanisms and standardizing the 
taxation system for all enterprises, because this will have a 
positive impact on building up state enterprises' stamina for 
development and competitiveness. Meanwhile, the tax reform will 
abolish the regulatory tax for state enterprises and exempt them 
from the payment of funds for construction of key energy and 
transport projects and for state budget regulating funds, 
thereby increasing their financial resources by over 14 billion 
yuan. The implementation of the "two sets of rules" will change 
the computing method for profits and losses of enterprises and 
enable them to keep their capital intact while reducing their 
delivery of revenues to the state and increasing their funds for 
upgrading technology. The impact of the aforesaid reduced 
revenues has already been taken into account in the draft state 
budget. 
  (4) The question of increasing input in science and 
technology, education, and other key areas. In 1993, the 
actual expenses from state finance on science, technology, and 
education increased over the previous year; and operating 
expenses related to culture, education, science, and public 
health increased more than 20 percent over 1992. On the basis 
of last year's increase, this year's budget for culture, 
education, science, and public health expenses is 17 billion 
yuan, or 18 percent, more than last year. Of this, operating 
expenses for education will be 66.233 billion yuan; and for 
science, 7.989 billion yuan; 18.5 percent and 19.8 percent more 
than the previous year's actual amounts respectively, which are 
both higher then the increase of the financial revenue. 
Including other budgetary items used as expenses for education, 
science, and technology, this year the state's financial input 
in education will be 81.5 billion yuan; and science and 
technology, 23.4 billion yuan. In addition, because of price 
rises, wage reform in the army, and increased living standards, 
expenditures in national defense are also adjusted accordingly. 
  3. Deepen Fiscal and Tax Reforms, Vigorously 
Increase Revenues and Reduce Expenditures, and Strive To Fulfill 
the 1994 State Budget 
  Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the 
overall task for the entire party and nation. The key to 
complying with and serving this overall task in fiscal and 
taxation work lies in ensuring smooth progress in fiscal and tax 
reforms and in fulfilling the state budget for 1994. Leading 
comrades in all localities and departments must attach great 
importance to these two aspects and earnestly strengthen 
leadership. Fiscal and taxation departments at all levels 
should seize the opportunity, seek truth from facts, change 
their work style, and work hard to ensure the success of fiscal 
and tax reforms and the completion of budgetary tasks. 
  We must carry out work in a down-to-earth manner to 
ensure that fiscal and tax reforms will produce the desired 
results. The main aspects of this year's fiscal and tax 
reforms include reforming the current local financial contract 
system to institute a separate taxation system based on a 
rational division of power between central and local 
authorities; reforming the taxation system to establish an 
indirect tax system based mainly on the value-added tax and to 
unify enterprises' income tax and personal income tax; and 
reforming state enterprises' profit distribution system. These 
reforms are vitally important for our country's efforts to 
establish a socialist market economic system; to promote 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national 
economy; and to ensure long-term national stability. Fiscal and 
tax reforms are the centerpiece of this year's reform of the 
economic system, and they cover a wide range of areas and carry 
significant policy implications. In devising the reform plan, 
we took account of the need for gradually increasing central 
financial resources and fully considered local interests and 
enterprise operations. We also shifted the focus of reform to 
changing operating mechanisms and did not significantly adjust 
the income distribution pattern. Judging by the practice of 
reform in the two months or more since the aforementioned 
reforms were implemented on 1 January, it is evident that the 
reform plan is correct and that it has been implemented quite 
satisfactorily without any major incident. However, we must 
remain sober-minded and cannot afford to lower our guard. 
Although we conducted many investigations and studies, listened 
extensively to the opinions of all quarters, and repeatedly 
introduced readjustments based on our findings during the course 
of devising our reform plan, the way the plan was designed will 
necessarily differ from how it will relate to the actual 
situation; this will require readjustments and improvements in 
the course of implementation. Current fiscal and tax reforms 
affect the vital interests of all sectors and the broad masses, 
directly affect progress in overall economic reform and social 
stability, and have a bearing on this year's economic and fiscal 
situation. We must organize them meticulously and advance them 
steadily in order to ensure their success. Leading comrades in 
all localities and departments should earnestly strengthen their 
leadership over fiscal and tax reforms, step up their efforts to 
coordinate various reforms, promptly deal with new circumstances 
and problems that emerge in the course of reform, and pay 
attention to incipient problems and take preventive measures. 
Fiscal and taxation departments at all levels should increase 
investigations and studies, detect new circumstances on a timely 
basis, sum up new experiences, and solve new problems. In 
particular, they should properly handle the issue of ensuring 
policy continuity in shifting from one system to another, and 
ensure that all reform plans are implemented. Unity in 
understanding and action holds the key to successful reform. 
Although we can point out problems, we must take overall 
interests into account when it comes to implementing reform. We 
cannot go our own ways, overstep our authority, enact our own 
rules and regulations, and distort or alter reform plans. If 
such problems occur and are confirmed after investigations, we 
should deal with them sternly. 
  (2) Improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation 
and control to promote sustained, rapid, healthy economic 
development. The fiscal and taxation departments, as vital 
departments exercising the state's macroeconomic regulation and 
control, shoulder the major responsibility for healthy economic 
development. We must, in line with the requirements of a 
socialist market economy and the principle of matching 
construction scale with national strength, effectively improve 
and strengthen marcoeconomic regulation and control to promote 
competition among enterprises on an equal footing, coordinate 
regional economic developments, and strive to increase 
production and practice economy, and to increase revenues and 
cut back expenditures. We must, through the allocation of 
fiscal funds and application of fiscal and taxation policies, 
strictly control the investment scale of fixed assets; promote 
the development of agriculture, science and technology, and the 
basic industries; facilitate the readjustment of the production 
structure and enhancement of enterprise economic efficiency; and 
guide enterprises to develop themselves through tapping internal 
potential. We should do things strictly in accordance with the 
state budget, and should not allow new items leading to reduced 
revenues or increased expenditures. The central government 
should control bond issuance under the state-approved scale; 
while the local governments should persist in keeping 
expenditures within the limits of income, striking a balance 
between revenues and expenditures, and avoiding budgetary 
deficits. In the course of reforming the price system and 
changing enterprise operating mechanisms, we should relentlessly 
help enterprises stop deficits and begin to earn profits; should 
stop subsidies for operational losses; and should reduce 
subsidies for losses permitted by policy. We should accelerate 
the legislation on the fiscal and taxation system, reinforce 
economic and financial discipline, and codify the financial and 
tax management as soon as possible. 
  (3) Seize the favorable opportunity for fiscal and tax 
reform to improve and strengthen the collection and management 
of revenues. After tax reform is instituted, taxpayers must 
pay, and tax offices must collect according to the law; tax 
revenues must be calculated and levied according to the rates 
prescrived in the tax law, and "contracting for tax payment" and 
wanton alteration of tax rates are not permitted; and except for 
reductions and exemptions stipulated in the tax law, no 
government or department is allowed to set a precedent in 
granting tax reduction and exemption. We must take the task 
against tax evasion seriously, closely watching new trends of 
tax evasion following the introduction of the new tax system. 
Especially those criminals who forge special vouchers for the 
value- added tax, or who exploit the use of vouchers to evade 
taxes must be severely punished without mercy. In keeping with 
new circumstances arising from the fiscal and taxation reform, 
we must earnestly improve and strengthen the levying and 
collection of various revenues to prevent income losses. We 
must, in accordance with the central authorities' unified 
arrangements, carry out step-by-step the reorganization of 
central and local tax offices, properly resolving problems 
related to division of labor and coordination of work to ensure 
normal operation of tax collection and management. Meanwhile, 
efforts must be made to clear payments in arrears for the "two 
types of funds" and to continue to collect the "two types of 
funds" from nonstate-owned enterprises and institutions, on 
which reductions and exemptions should not be granted without 
authorization. 
  (4) Improve the procedures for issuing state treasury 
bonds to ensure the accomplishment of targeted sales. The 
large volume of state treasury bonds to be issued this year has 
a direct bearing on the success of fiscal and tax reform and the 
balance between revenues and expenditures. One of the important 
factors for accomplishing the targeted sales of treasury bonds 
this year lies in good publicity and coordination. In line with 
the requirements for developing and perfecting financial 
markets, we should reform the procedures for issuing treasury 
bonds, effectively planning contract procurement and marketing 
of bonds, improving and expanding the system of primary 
individual operators, and standardizing and developing secondary 
markets of treasury bonds to increase their circulation and 
stability. We should also combine bond sales with banks' open 
market business. Under the unified leadership of local party 
and government organizations, financial departments at various 
levels should closely coordinate with banks and other relevant 
institutions in ensuring priority sales of treasury bonds. 
Balances of retirement pensions, unemployment insurance, and 
postal savings deposits should mainly be used in purchasing 
treasury bonds. We should do everything within our capacity to 
sell treasury bonds to the masses, and to enable them to buy and 
cash the bonds conveniently. Meanwhile, we should also give 
offices, institutions, enterprises, and units access to 
subscribe to treasury bonds. Financial and banking departments 
at all levels should accumulate experiences in bond sales and 
actively explore ways for issuing bonds under the conditions of 
a market economy. 
  (5) We should control total expenditures and ensure 
that funds are available for key projects. 
  When making arrangements for financial expenditures, we 
should stay within our means, ensure that funds are available 
for key projects, and curb expenditures for ordinary projects. 
In addition to continuing to increase input in such key sectors 
as agriculture, education, science and technology, and 
infrastructure, as well as guaranteeing the necessary increases 
in outlays for national defense, judicial, procuratorial, and 
public security departments, this year we should give priority 
to expenditures incurred in paying wages and building up state 
grain reserves. We should never permit the diversion of funds, 
which are earmarked for remunerating staff members and workers, 
to new projects. Areas that delay the payment of wages to staff 
and workers should resolutely stop or postpone the construction 
of projects funded by financial departments. Institutions that 
delay the payment of wages to staff and workers are not 
permitted to purchase small vehicles or other expensive, 
luxurious consumer goods. Financial departments at all levels 
must attach great importance to this issue. We should strictly 
control the scale of investment in fixed assets. Except for 
indispensable projects that have been approved, we should not 
start new ones. We should resolutely halt or postpone the 
construction of projects for which no funds are available and 
whose prospects are uncertain. Currently, the problem of wasting 
funds is quite serious as money is being spent lavishly to 
renovate houses and buy equipment. The practices of traveling 
for meetings and of wining and dining at government expense 
continue despite repeated efforts to ban them. Specifically, 
there is a lack of effective control over staffing, and 
"personnel fees" have eaten up a substantial amount of funds 
earmarked for developing various undertakings. Therefore, we 
should curtail expenses for personnel, vehicle purchases, and 
meetings this year. We should vigorously promote the fine 
tradition of diligence and thrift, and urge the broad masses of 
cadres and people to combat extravagance and waste. Moreover, 
as price reform deepens, we should gradually slash subsidized 
projects and ensure that total expenditures for such projects 
will not surpass the budgeted figure. We should deepen reform of 
fiscal management in institutions, continue to encourage and 
support such institutions in rationally disposing of their 
incomes as permitted by policy and law, and exercise overall 
planned management of total revenues and expenditures. We 
should resolutely and fully implement provisions regarding the 
"separation of revenues and expenditures," and exercise unified 
budgetary control over revenues that should be subject to 
budgetary management, such as those derived from fees charged 
for using land and from selling public housing. 
  Fellow deputies: Our fiscal and taxation tasks are rather 
formidable in 1994. Nevertheless, we can surely surmount 
various difficulties, achieve the desired results in various 
reforms, and successfully fulfill the state budgetary tasks for 
1994 as long as we fully implement the guidelines of the 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, earnestly implement various reform measures, take 
practical steps to improve and tighten macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and properly handle the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability under the leadership of the 
party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.
