  [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Based on the common 
understanding reached this February between the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and Taiwan's Straits 
Exchange Foundation [SEF] in the "Joint Press Release of Tang 
Shubei and Jiao Renhe," the two organizations will began holding 
their fourth working level talks today on issues that include 
the fishery dispute between the two sides of the Strait. 
However, due to moves by Taiwan prior to its delegates' 
departure for Beijing to "veto part of the Tang-Jiao common 
understanding," there is no optimism for reaching an agreement 
during the current talks. 
  At the conclusion of the Tang-Jiao talks this February, 
Taiwan described the "Joint Press Release" as a having developed 
a "great degree of common understanding" between the two sides. 
Huang Kunhui, chairman of the "Mainland Affairs Council [MAC]," 
and others gave it a "high degree of affirmation." However, 
according to Taiwan press reports, part of the common 
understanding reached during the Tang-Jiao talks was vetoed in 
mid-March during a meeting convened by MAC, and attended by such 
as the "National Security Bureau [NSB]" and "Ministry of Justice 
[MOJ]," to discuss strategies to be adopted at the forthcoming 
fourth round of talks between the two organizations. This 
caused "great shock" among the SEF delegates to the talks. 
Complying with a top SEF official's request, "MAC" called a 
special meeting again on 19 March. However, departments such as 
"NSB" and "MOJ" again made firm demands for rights, including 
jurisdiction over judicial matters," thus "overturning the 
important common understanding over the three issues formed 
during the Tang-Jiao talks." They also claimed they wanted to 
"maintain the bottom line of the two organizations' Taibei 
[Taipei] talks on the premise of giving consideration to the 
dignity of the rights of jurisdiction over legal matters." 
  Commenting on this, the Taiwan press noted that by 
overturning the common understanding reached in the Tang-Jiao 
talks, Taiwan will cast variables in reaching an agreement 
during the two organizations' fourth round of talks and will 
create pre-talks tension.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- The fourth working 
talks between the Chinese mainland Association of Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Taiwan-based Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) opened in Beijing today. 
  The two sides discussed in detail the draft agreement on 
three issues including repatriation of those who have entered 
the areas of the other side in violation of relevant regulations. 
  Sources said that the two sides made progress in their talks 
but differences remained. 
  According to the arrangement of the talks decided upon by 
the 
two sides yesterday evening, today's morning session covered the 
topics "Repatriation of Hijackers Across the Taiwan Straits" and 
"Repatriation of Those Who Have Entered the Areas of the Other 
Side in Violation of Relevant Regulations." 
  The afternoon's topic was "The Settlement of Fishing 
Disputes 
at Sea Across the Straits." 
  Sun Yafu, deputy secretary-general of ARATS, said that the 
common understanding and opinions voiced by the two sides are 
serious and responsible. 
  He said that the fourth talks aimed to finalize the written 
form of the agreement as soon as possible. 
  On repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Straits, Sun 
said that the issue had been discussed three times. During the 
last talks in Taipei, the two sides reached a basic framework 
for an agreement. 
  He said that now the talks were focusing on arrangements 
regarding factors that might crop up. 
  Liu Huiyou, SEF's deputy secretary-general, said that both 
sides maintained the original understanding on the issue, that 
is, that hijackers should be prosecuted. 
  Liu also mentioned differences on the issue, such as the 
application of the provision about non-repatriation, time limit 
for repatriation and other related issues. 
  Sun Yafu pointed out that the mainland side will not accept 
the term that people of their own side shall not be repatriated 
as it is the refurbished version of extradition between states. 
  He said that as a matter of fact, repatriation of criminals 
or suspects between the two sides can be conducted according to 
the "Jinmen Agreement", which still remains valid. 
  The two sides also differed on the issue of the settlement 
of 
fishing disputes, according to Sun.

  [Excerpts] The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS] and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] 
continued their talks on the afternoon of 27 February. The 
working-level talks continued to center on the three issues 
originally planned for discussion. The ARATS presented a number 
of new proposals based on its study of the SEF's views. 
However, the two sides were not able to narrow their 
differences and reach an agreement. 
  After the talks, ARATS Deputy Secretary General Sun Yafu 
told 
reporters: 
  [Begin recording] Personnel of the two sides held general 
discussions this afternoon touching on the three issues 
discussed in the last couple of days. The first issue concerns 
the repatriation of personnel who entered the areas of the other 
side in violation of the relevant regulations. On this issue, 
each side essentially discussed matters that need to be 
considered by the other side. 
  The second issue concerns the repatriation of hijackers 
across the Taiwan Strait. [passage omitted] 
  The third issue concerns settling fishing disputes. [passage 
omitted] [end recording] 
  Sun Yafu gave his views on the talks held during the last 
several days. He said he believed that although the two sides 
encountered difficulties, the ARATS is willing to continue the 
talks. He said: 
  [Begin recording] These working-level talks were based on 
the 
common understanding reached between the persons in charge of 
the ARATS and SEF during their previous talks in Beijing. They 
pledged to honor the understanding and hoped that agreement 
could be reached as soon as possible. It should be pointed out 
that the two sides did not reach a common understanding on all 
issues. They clearly reached a common understanding on certain 
issues while approaching agreement on others. It is our hope 
that the two sides will conduct the current working-level talks 
based on the Beijing talks. During the talks, both the SEF and 
ARATS may also talk about additional issues raised by the other 
side. This is a question of following the rules on contacts and 
talks between the two sides. To make the talks successful, we 
are willing to continue the talks. [end recording] 
  It was learned that the ARATS and SEF will decide through 
discussions on the evening of 27 March whether or not to 
continue the talks. SEF Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyou [Hsu 
Hui-yu] said that SEF Deputy Secretary General Shi Chiping [Shih 
Chi-ping] was not able to arrive in Beijing on schedule and that 
the date of his arrival would be decided by Taipei.

1997, 1999 Will Be Restricted" -- ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE headline] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 7 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A report 
from Taipei: According to the provisions of the "Draft 
Regulations on Relations With Hong Kong and Macao," which is 
being examined by the Mainland Affairs Council of the 
Administrative Yuan of Taiwan, the "reporting for the record" 
system will be adopted for the people of Taiwan to invest in 
Hong Kong and Macao after 1997 and 1999, respectively. The 
Ministry of Economy will promulgate regulations restricting 
investment in Hong Kong and Macao by enterprises on the island. 
Any offender will be fined from NT$300,000 to NT$3 million [New 
Taiwan dollars] and such punishment can be repeated. 
  In addition, the Mainland Affairs Council also has examined 
many relevant regulations, the main content of which includes 
the following: Taiwan's financial organizations may continue to 
accept and exchange Hong Kong dollars on condition that the Hong 
Kong dollars have "ample exchange reserves" and can be 
"exchanged freely." 
  Regarding transportation, the Mainland Affairs Council said 
that "with permission," Taiwan's ships and civilian aircraft 
"can navigate between Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao." The 
procedures for obtaining permission will be formulated by the 
Ministry of Communications. With permission, ships and aircraft 
of Hong Kong and Macao also may enter Taiwan's restricted and 
prohibited waters and aviation information areas. With 
permission, foreign ships and aircraft also may navigate between 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. 
  Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council is scheduled to complete 
all preliminary examination work on 7 March and to make public 
these drafts to extensively solicit the views and suggestions of 
various circles on the island. At the same time, it has planned 
to entrust academic organizations with holding seminars in Hong 
Kong and Macao to listen to views on the legislation of various 
circles in Hong Kong and Macao.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (CNA) -- No major progress was 
achieved as of press time during the first day of the current 
round of cross-strait technical talks being held in Beijing. 
  [Words indistinct] out a "primary framework" for resolving 
the three issues at hand, said negotiators from the Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the two non-official organizations 
authorized by Taipei and the mainland to handle cross-strait 
exchanges. 
  The three issues are the repatriation of mainland hijackers, 
the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and 
cross-strait fishing disputes. SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho 
and ARATS vice chairman Tang Shubei at the end of their Beijing 
talks in February claimed to have reached a "consensus" on the 
issues and hoped that draft agreements would be signed at the 
current round of talks. 
  According to Taipei negotiators, Beijing is reluctant to pay 
the costs of repatriating the illegal mainland immigrants and 
recompensing Taipei for their stay in Taiwan -- a cost the 
Taiwan side has estimated to be NT$1 [new Taiwan dollars] 
billion (about U.S.$38 million). 
  In addition, the mainland has disagreed with Taiwan's 
suggested wording of the draft agreement on the repatriation of 
hijackers: "Neither side has to return a hijacker who is a 
citizen of that country." Since last April, 11 mainland 
passenger planes have been hijacked to Taiwan. 
  In Taipei, the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] said the 
mainland side was to blame for the lack of progress during 
Friday's talks. "The mainland side is even tougher than 
before," MAC spokesman Kao Kung- lien said.

  [Text] The cross-strait talk between Taiwan's Strait 
Exchange Foundation [SEF] and its mainland counterpart remained 
deadlocked in Peking [Beijing] on Sunday [27 March]. On the 
agenda were talks on the repatriation of hijackers, illegal 
immigrants, and the settlement of fishery disputes in the Taiwan 
Strait. However, bickering was the common point throughout the 
negotiation, according to local media reports. 
  Sun Yafu, the chief negotiator for the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], accused Taipei of 
swallowing promises made during the previous round of talks in 
February. He said SEF Secretary General Chao Jen-ho had 
verbally agreed that hijackers would not be legally viewed as 
criminal suspects when they were repatriated. However, SEF 
Deputy Secretary and Taipei's chief negotiator H.Y. Hsu [Hsu 
Hui-yu] said that ARATS was confused over what Chao had said and 
that Taipei would recognize only promises written in black and 
white. Hsu claimed that the mainland delegation had been 
insincere throughout the talks.

  [Text] Taipei, March 28 (CNA) -- The greatest difficulty in 
dealing with Mainland China lies in Beijing's reluctance to 
honor its commitments, a mainland affairs official said Monday 
[28 March]. 
  "Beijing has not only failed to faithfully implement the 
written agreements it has reached with Taiwan but has also often 
distorted oral agreements or interpreted them out of context," 
said Kao Kung-lien, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs 
Council [MAC], which sets Taiwan's policy toward Beijing. 
  Kao was commenting on the slow progress in the ongoing round 
of talks in Beijing between the two semi official intermediary 
bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait on the three thorny 
issues -- the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the 
repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and the resolution 
of cross-strait fishing disputes. 
  The talks between officials from Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) and the mainland's Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) have deadlocked over Beijing's 
reluctance to recognize Taiwan's legal jurisdiction. During the 
talks, Kao said, mainland delegates have unilaterally distorted 
"consensuses" reached in talks between SEF Vice Chairman Chiao 
Jen-ho and his ARATS counterpart, Tang Shubei, in Beijing late 
last year concerning the three issues. 
  For one thing, Kao explained, the joint press statement 
issued at the end of Chiao-Tang meeting said Taiwan would agree 
not to include the repatriation of criminal suspects in 
cross-strait agreements on the repatriation of illegal 
immigrants and hijackers if Beijing would agree to SEF proposals 
that Taiwan be allowed to automatically repatriate illegal 
mainland immigrants and that it not have to repatriate Taiwan 
nationals who hijack mainland planes to Taiwan. 
  In the current round of talks, which began March 25, Beijing 
rejected the two SEF premises while simply insisting that 
criminal suspects be excluded from any agreements on the 
repatriation of illegal immigrants and hijackers. 
  Talks were adjourned Monday with no progress reported, and 
will resume Tuesday. Reports from Beijing quoted chief Taiwan 
negotiator Hsu hui-yu as saying that whether the talks will 
continue through Wednesday as scheduled depends on whether any 
progress can be made in Tuesday's talks. Hsu is also SEF deputy 
secretary-general. 
  This is the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three 
issues since the heads of the two organizations met in Singapore 
last April. The two sides failed to reach any agreements in 
subsequent talks held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei in the 
second half of last year. 
  Another SEF secretary-general, Shih Chi-ping, was originally 
scheduled to leave for Beijing Monday for talks with ARATS 
officials on some cross-strait economic issues, but his trip was 
canceled because of the lack of progress in talks on the 
aforesaid three pressing issues.

  [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- Legislator Jaw Shau-kong 
on Saturday [26 March] suggested that the government investigate 
the interception of a Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) 
plane by two Japanese fighter planes. 
  The CAA plane was conducting regular tests off Taiwan's 
northeast coast Friday morning when two F-4 Phantom planes from 
the Japanese Air Force scrambled to make an interception, 
according to the pilot of the test plane. 
  The pilot said that the two fighters were flying [words 
indistinct] below his plane before they climbed to the same 
altitude after making sure that it was an unarmed civilian plane. 
  He said that the two fighters tailed him for some distance 
before they disengaged, after which he continued to fly in a 
northeasterly direction to carry out the testing mission. 
  Jaw said the two Japanese fighters blatantly disregarded 
Taiwan airspace during the incident. 
  He suggested that the government make a thorough 
investigation and lodge a protest with Japan. 
  Meanwhile, Cheng Pingaliang [spelling of name as received], 
CAA deputy director, said that the event Friday may be a result 
on faulty coordination between Japanese air traffic controllers 
and the Japanese Air Force. 
  Chang said that the CAA notified a Japanese air traffic 
control center about the planned test flight before it was 
carried out. He said that the two Japanese fighters were merely 
making an identification of the plane.

<F P=106> [By Tad Stoner] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong builders yesterday refused en masse to 
tender for the latest Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) 
contract. The tendering "strike" has thrown more than 100 other 
bids due in the next few months into doubt. The move threatens 
a Chek Lap Kok construction timetable already under severe 
pressure, and could further increase the cost of the 
multibillion-dollar project. 
  Failing to respond to a noon deadline yesterday for 
construction of a temporary ferry pier, builders said new 
contract conditions imposed on contractors by the PAA 
"collectively push us over the line". The PAA hit back later in 
the day, saying that similar conditions had been accepted 
previously by other contractors, and that builders' 
organisations had been briefed last year on PAA demands. "All 
of them who prequalified (to tenders bids) have come in knowing 
the conditions for the contracts," a PAA spokeswoman, Norma 
Fung, said. 
  Peter Lam, president of the Hong Kong Construction 
Association, representing the builders in the dispute, argued 
the latest PAA documents were the first examined by his 
organisation, and that it had subsequently recommended its 350 
members "not take up" the terms sought by the PAA. He hoped 
that the airport authority might agree to a compromise in the 
near future. "They'll have to decide," he said. "They set out 
conditions in which there are areas that are beyond our control. 
Time is pressing, and we have suggested that it would be best 
if we can come to some agreement." 
  The dispute centres on a series of potentially costly 
obligations that make builders responsible for delays, design 
changes, price rises in labour and materials and any damage 
resulting from events such as ground settlement. Payments may 
be withheld if the PAA judges work to be inadequate, the right 
to arbitration is limited and project managers, normally 
independent, will be paid by the authority. Builders say such 
responsibilities are usually shared with the client, and that 
without changes in the PAA's terms, tens of billions of dollars 
in construction work could be stymied. "The result (of 
yesterday's tender) speaks for itself," a construction-industry 
source said. "The PAA has said they are not going to change the 
terms," the source said. We'll just have to wait and see." 
  The next deadline is Thursday, when bids are due for 
construction of temporary accommodation for workers at the Chek 
Lap Kok site. "Some of these contracts can be delayed and some 
cannot. Some are more important than others," Lam said. He 
said that disruptions in early projects would affect later, 
larger ones. He said it was "quite true" that without a 
temporary ferry pier, materials and labour for the airport 
terminal foundations could not be moved onto the island, and 
that construction would be impeded without workers' 
accommodation. "You'll have to ask the PAA about any delays," 
Lam said. "I'm sure it will boost costs, but if no one is going 
to work for them, then the airport won't get built at all, and 
if the airport has to be built, then something has to happen." 
The PAA's Fung said that construction remained on schedule for 
the moment. 
  Both Lam and Fung denied the situation was a stalemate. 
"They said that some of the things made sense and that they 
would be happy to look at them," Lam said. Fung said the 
authority would seek talks with other airport employers. "As 
the authority's conditions are generally consistent with those 
of other airport core programme employers such as the government 
and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, it will be talking to 
them before taking a final decision on the way forward," she 
said.

  [Text] The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) has ruled 
out the participation of Hong Kong officials in its review of 
the territory's ordinances. The PWC has begun reviewing Hong 
Kong's laws to identify any possible conflict with the Basic 
Law, the territory's post-1997 mini-constitution. But the move 
has raised concerns that the PWC is duplicating some of the 
tasks being carried out by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group 
(JLG) set up by an internationally binding treaty. Shao 
Tianren, the coconvenor of the PWC's legal group which began a 
three-day meeting in Beijing yesterday, ruled out the 
possibility of inviting legal experts from Hong Kong to attend 
the discussions to avoid any duplication. "We can't invite Hong 
Kong officials for they are under the British administration, 
and that would involve discussions at a foreign affairs level," 
he said. 
  Mr Shao's statement contradicted moves by the PWC several 
months ago to invite Hong Kong officials to address its groups, 
sparking a row with the British administration. The PWC's 
economic group had invited Secretary for Economic Services 
Gordon Siu to explain Britain's fourth proposed airport funding 
strategy. The invitation was declined. 
  Speaking after the first day of the legal group's 
discussions, Mr Shao said 12 ordinances relating to land and 
real estate had been reviewed. "The group has decided not to 
recommend changes to the units of weights and measures under the 
British system such as inches, feet or pounds," he said. "All 
these are historical habits. Let the Hong Kong people decide 
whether to change them or not after 1997." However, Mr Shao 
said the 12 ordinances were in need of technical amendments to 
remove references to British sovereignty, such as "Royal" and 
"British government". 
  He denied any duplication of the work already being 
undertaken by JLG experts. "Our group will only give principal 
advice and we will not amend the ordinances and regulations one 
by one" he said. "It's not the assigned work of the PWC. If 
both sides (the Chinese and British) can co-operate the (legal) 
work actually can be discussed in the Joint Liaison Group."

  [Text] The United Democrats would repeat their 1991 
landslide victory if a Legislative Council election were held 
tomorrow, according to a poll commissioned by the SOUTH CHINA 
MORNING POST. 
  But the poll found also that more than half of the Hong Kong 
public believe that China will overturn the whole three-tier 
political structure in 1997 and that there will be no "through 
train" arrangement for those selected next year to sit beyond 
the changeover. 
  The survey, conducted by Asian Commercial Research Limited, 
found that up to 30 percent of respondents would vote for 
candidates of the United Democrats if an election were held 
tomorrow. 
  In all, United Democrats and the other candidates considered 
to be liberals would command 56 percent of the votes, compared 
with 21 percent for the Liberal Party and pro-China forces. 
  However, up to 23 percent of 604 people interviewed by 
telephone this month said they had no opinion on who they would 
vote for. 
  The strong support for the United Democrats is despite 
China's labelling as subversive its chairman, Martin Lee 
Chu-ming, and veteran member Szeto Wah. Both have been warned 
repeatedly that they will not be allowed to sit on the 
legislature of the Special Administrative Region. 
  There are 13 United Democrats in the 60-member Legislative 
Council. The party swept the 1991 elections by winning 12 of 
the 18 directly elected seats contested then. 
  Support for the Liberal Party is running at only 12.6 
percent. 
  The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood 
managed 
to be the third most popular party 9.2 percent of the poll's 
respondents said they would vote for association candidates. 
  It was followed by the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong, with a score of 5.4 percent, and 
another liberal party, Meeting Point, which scored 4.3 percent. 
  Up to 12.6 percent of respondents said they would vote for a 
pro- Hong Kong independent candidate in an election, compared 
with 2.6 percent who said they would support a pro-China 
independent. 
  A third of respondents maintained that the Legislative 
Council should delay voting on the remaining parts of Governor 
Chris Patten's electoral package, despite chances for the 
resumption of talks seeming unlikely. A total of 12 percent 
said the electoral package should be amended to make it 
acceptable to China. 
  However, another 28 percent of respondents said the package 
should be passed, compared with the nine percent who said the 
whole package should be voted down. 
  The same poll also showed that 42 percent of the respondents 
believed the Governor's political reform proposals would have a 
negative effect on Hong Kong's political situation after 1997, 
compared with the 31 percent who say they would make Hong Kong 
better. 
  Only two percent said they would have no effect. 
  The remaining 25 percent said they held no opinion on the 
question.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Respect the Law"] </F>
  [Text] The plan by Dr Philip Cheng Hui-ho to sue the Hunan 
authorities for illegal detention and withholding his passport 
is a courageous but vital step in the long-running battle to 
ensure the safety of Hong Kong businessmen working and 
travelling in China. Even if his case fails, he will have struck 
a blow for the rule of law and shown the way for others to try 
to win redress. 
  The American passport holder, who arrived back in the 
territory this week after having been kept in China for seven 
months and virtually held to ransom over a business dispute, is 
just one of a string of Hong Kong businessmen who have been held 
in similar cases. 
  In January, another businessman, Chong Kwee-sung was 
released 
through the intervention of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, after he had been held incommunicado for more than 30 
months. 
  Mr Chong's release came just three days after Secretary for 
Security told the Legislative Council that at least four Hong 
Kong people were in detention in China as a result of commercial 
disputes. He said the Government had received eight reports 
involving a total of 10 people in similar situations over the 
previous three years. 
  It is high time the Chinese authorities involved in these 
cases were asked to account for their actions in court. Hong 
Kong cannot object if those suspected of breaking Chinese law 
are arrested or put on trial. But it is not acceptable for 
businessmen to be arrested over commercial disputes unless there 
are suspicions of criminal fraud. Even in criminal cases 
prisoners should not be held incommunicado for long periods or 
detained with neither a trial nor an explanation. 
  Commercial disputes should be settled in the courts, not by 
arresting a company representative and then holding him until 
his family or employer bail him out or indemnify his Chinese 
business partners. 
  China has made tremendous progress in improving its judicial 
and legal systems in recent years. It should not tolerate 
officials who show no respect of the law, such as those who had 
detained Dr Cheng for seven months without a good reason, to 
tarnish the country's reputation.

<F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F>
  [Text] Macao police investigating a bungled armed hold-up 
by two Chinese illegal immigrants have discovered what they 
described as a "beeper bomb factory" making bombs using pagers. 
It is the first time that police have come across the devices 
by a pager signal, the police spokesman, Major Jose Lourenco, 
said. "It was not the work of amateurs, but of people who have 
a very precise knowledge of electronics and explosive devices," 
Lourenco said. 
  Two men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested by police after a 
raid 
on a flat in Rua do Almirante Costa Cabral at about 7am on 
Saturday [26 March]. They were expected to appear before Macao 
District Court today. A team of officers from the Macao public 
security police discovered 30 detonators, a Chinese-made Makarov 
pistol, 20 rounds of ammunition and an amount of explosives. 
  He said the men were arrested 24 hours after they had tried, 
unsuccessfully, to rob the Chan Hang frozen meat shop on Rua de 
Erva on Friday. The men left behind two pager bombs when they 
fled the shop after the proprietor bit one of them on the hand, 
triggering a gun shot that accidentally hit the other bandit. 
The bombs were defused by police but 15 minutes after they had 
been deactivated, the two pagers reacted to calls from the 
central paging station. 
  Macao police sources said that the pager bombs were 
"extremely worrying for their criminal cunning". "Imagine 
someone putting a pager bomb somewhere in Macao, then after that 
travelling to China or Hong Kong and phoning from there to a 
pager station in Macao in order to trigger the explosion," one 
source said. "You could call it cross-border remote control." 
  "Theoretically, you can put a pager bomb somewhere in 
America, then you leave that continent to make your pager 
station call from Asia or Europe."

  [Text] The provincial party committee, the provincial 
people's congress standing committee, the provincial government, 
and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference held a rally of cadres at and above the 
section level of provincial-level organs at Jinan Zhenzhuquan 
Auditorium on the morning of 25 March to relay the guidelines of 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC], the Second Session of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and 
the central rural work conference. 
  Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
gave a speech on how to implement these guidelines. He 
stressed: It is necessary to implement the guidelines of the 
NPC and national CPPCC sessions and the central rural work 
conference, firmly attend to the overall situation of the whole 
party's and the whole country's work tasks for this year, 
concentrate efforts on grasping the three major affairs of 
reform, development, and stability, and promote a greater 
development in Shandong's economic and social undertakings. 
  The rally was presided over by Li Zhen, chairman of the 
provincial people's congress standing committee. Ma Zhongcai, 
vice chairman of the provincial people's congress standing 
committee, and Lu Maozeng, chairman of the provincial CPPCC 
Committee, respectively relayed the guidelines of the NPC and 
the national CPPCC sessions. Zhao Zhihai, deputy secretary of 
the provincial party committee and provincial governor, relayed 
the guidelines of the central rural work conference. 
  In referring to the opinions for the implementation of the 
guidelines of the NPC and the national CPPCC sessions, Jiang 
Chunyun stressed the necessity of grasping four points: 
  1. Conscientiously study the documents, understand the 
guidelines, and reach a consensus of views. 
  2. Further clearly define this year's work tasks, 
clearly recognize the overall situation, concentrate efforts on 
the three major affairs of reform, development, and stability, 
and consolidate and develop an excellent situation of economic 
and political stability. 
  3. Uphold the principle of taking a two-handed approach 
and be tough with both, strengthen democracy, the legal system, 
spiritual civilization, party style, and administrative honesty, 
and win new victory in the two civilizations. 
  4. Realistically change leadership work style, go to 
the reality of life to conduct investigation and study, deal 
with concrete matters relating to work, make earnest efforts to 
do practical things, give priority to discussing hot topics and 
solving difficult problems in work and problems which the people 
show strong reaction, and realistically fulfill all tasks put 
forward by the NPC and national CPPCC sessions. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: The central authorities have held the 
rural work conference within the first half of this year. This 
shows that the central authorities have paid great attention to 
agriculture and rural work. The speeches given by Comrades 
Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji have comprehensively and 
fully analyzed the agricultural and rural work situation, 
expounded on the status of agriculture and rural work from the 
high plane of the whole party and the whole country's major 
affairs, and put forward the objectives, tasks, policies, and 
measures for agriculture and rural work for this year and for 
some time to come. Their speeches are very purposeful and have 
a strong guiding significance. We must implement them well. 
First of all, we must unify thinking and understanding, 
recognize the major significance of agriculture and rural work 
from the high plane of the overall situation of seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability, and closely integrate 
the agricultural and rural work issues with the country's 
overall situation of reform, development, and stability. Without 
agricultural development, the development of rural economy, 
particularly the steady increase in grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops, and rural stability, it will be difficult to 
achieve a sustained, rapid, and sound development in the 
national economy, to effect reform of the socialist market 
economic structure, and to have social stability. Our party and 
government cadres at all levels must unite their thinking with 
the central guidelines, overcome and straighten out the ideology 
of neglecting or slackening efforts in agriculture and rural 
work, regard agriculture as the primary task of economic work, 
and do a good job in agriculture and rural work. 
  Second, we must clearly define the objectives and tasks. 
Jiang Chunyun said: In line with the central plans and 
demands, this year our province's agricultural and rural work 
tasks are to regard increasing the production of agricultural 
products and income of peasants as the focus, pay simultaneous 
attention to cultivation of grain, oil-bearing crops, and 
cotton, and guarantee a steady increase in the output of grain, 
oil-bearing crops, cotton, and the rural economy, and greatly 
increase the income of peasants. To realize these objectives and 
tasks, we must stabilize the farming acreage, guard against 
drought, do farm work in the right farming season, [words 
indistinct], try by all possible means to raise economic 
efficiency, and increase peasants' income by a large margin. He 
stressed: We must regard raising efficiency and increasing the 
income of peasants as the central tasks of agricultural and 
rural work; resolutely develop high-yield, fine-quality, and 
highly efficient farming; pay attention to the comprehensive 
development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline 
production, fishery, and diversified undertakings; and continue 
to run [words indistinct] well. 
  Third, we should deepen rural reform. Jiang Chunyun pointed 
out: To greatly develop agriculture and the rural economy, the 
fundamental way out is to reform. In line with the demand of 
establishing the socialist market economic structure, we should 
accelerate the change of agriculture and the rural economy into 
the market economy and instill new vigor and vitality into 
agricultural and rural economic development. In rural reform, 
we should also combine package reform with breakthroughs in key 
areas. We should continue to stabilize and improve all kinds of 
rural policies with the family-base output-related contract 
responsibility system as the mainstay, actively cultivate the 
market, and provide loans for developing the market-oriented 
agriculture. It is necessary to actively promote the 
shareholding cooperative system, integrate farming with 
industry, commerce, foreign trade, science, and transport, 
accelerate the process of industrializing the rural economy, 
actively establish the rural socialized service system, and make 
special efforts to stabilize the agricultural technology 
dissemination organs and ranks of scientific and technical 
workers in the agricultural sector. 
  Fourth, we should guarantee social stability in the rural 
areas. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Judging from the general 
situation, our province's rural areas are stable, but really 
there are some destabilizing factors. We must pay full 
attention to this. It is necessary to do much work to maintain 
stability. We should persist in carrying out the entire rural 
work with two hands and be tough with both, strengthen socialist 
spiritual civilization in the rural areas, intensify ideological 
and political work, extensively conduct education on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism, and guide the peasants to properly 
handle the relations among the state, collectives, and 
individuals. Efforts should be made to comprehensively manage 
public security in the rural areas, strengthen democracy and the 
legal system in the grass roots, strengthen grass-roots 
organizations, give priority to improving the state of weakness 
and slackness in grass-roots organizations and economically weak 
backward villages, proceed the work with reshuffling party 
branches, and change their outlook as quickly as possible. 
  Fifth, we should further change leadership work style. Jiang 
Chunyun stressed: In this aspect, the provincial organs should 
serve as good examples. They should take the lead in studying 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the knowledge on market economy and 
enhancing ideological and theoretical level, and the ability to 
control the overall situation. They should also take the lead 
in upholding the party's purpose, strengthening the mass 
concept, and serving the people wholeheartedly; going deeply to 
the rural areas to conduct investigation and study, keeping 
abreast of the situation, summing up experience, and solving 
problems; reducing peasants' burdens, and not bringing chaos to 
peasants; speaking the truth, doing practical things, and 
resolutely overcoming unhealthy trends, such as bureaucracy, 
formalism, boastfulness, cheating, and telling only good news 
but not the bad ones; performing official work diligently and 
honestly, opposing corruption, and recently checking the 
unhealthy trends of abusing one's power to seek personal gain, 
engaging in lavish wining and dining, entertaining guests, 
sending gifts, extravagance, and waste. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: The higher and the lower levels 
across the province should unite as one, make earnest efforts to 
do practical things, make this year's agricultural and rural 
work a success, create outstanding achievements, and give a 
qualified answer to the party Central Committee and the State 
Council.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (AFP)--China said Saturday [26 
March] that it will study a Russian proposal for an 
international conference on the nuclear crisis in North Korea. 
  "We have taken note of Russia's proposal, and we will study 
it," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said by telephone. 
  Moscow had proposed an international conference Thursday to 
try to find a solution to the nuclear impasse in North Korea. 
Pyongyang rejected a complete inspection of its suspect nuclear 
sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The conference would bring together the two Koreas, China, 
Japan, the United States and Russia and delegates from the 
United Nations and the IAEA. The countries concerned reacted 
rather coolly to the proposal on Friday. 
  China, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, continues to oppose international sanctions against its 
communist ally, but Western diplomats at the United Nations said 
Friday that Beijing might sign a declaration on North Korea 
which would not include sanctions. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-Sam was expected to arrive 
in 
China Saturday for a five-day visit during which he will ask his 
hosts to help get North Korea to accept inspections of its 
nuclear installations and to reopen its dialogue with South 
Korea.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng today 
chaired the 16th executive meeting of the State Council at which 
"China's Agenda 21," or the "White Paper on China's Population, 
Environment, and Development in the 21st Century," was discussed 
and approved. 
  The problems of population, environment, and development 
have 
drawn attention from various countries in the world in recent 
years. To counter the global economic, social, resources, and 
environmental problems, the Chinese Government took the lead in 
initiating and convening a ministerial conference on environment 
and development of developing countries in Beijing in June 1991. 
In June 1992, the UN held an environment and development summit 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and adopted the "Rio Declaration on 
Environment and Development," the "Agenda 21," and other 
documents. Premier Li Peng attended the summit and, on behalf 
of the Chinese Government, promised to fulfill the "Agenda 21" 
and other documents. According to this commitment, 52 
departments under the State Council, including the State 
Planning Commission and the State Science and Technology 
Commission, jointly worked out "China's Agenda 21," or the 
"White Paper on China's Population, Environment, and Development 
in the 21st Century." In line with China's basic conditions and 
development strategy, the document sets the general strategy, 
policy, and measures for the coordinated and sustainable 
development of economy, society, resources, environment, 
population, and education. It will become a guiding document

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- China's "Agenda 21", 
a white paper on population, environment and development in the 
21st century, was approved by the State Council today. 
  The agenda was discussed and adopted at the 16th Executive 
Meeting of the State Council presided over by Premier Li Peng. 
  China is the first country to have worked out and adopted 
its 
own "Agenda 21", proposed by the United Nations at the Rio de 
Janeiro summit meeting in June 1992. 
  At the summit, Premier Li Peng promised to carry out the 
U.N. 
agenda and other documents adopted at the meeting. 
  China initiated and sponsored the ministerial meeting on 
environment and development for developing countries in June 
1991. 
  The "Agenda 21" was worked out by 52 departments under the 
State Council, including the State Planning Commission and the 
State Science and Technology Commission. 
  The "Agenda" expounds China's strategy, policy and measures 
to secure harmonious and sustainable development out of the 
milieu of the economy, resources, environment, population, 
education and other social factors. 
  The "Agenda" will also be an important directory document 
for 
China in making its mid- and long-term economic and social 
development plans. It will form an important part of the goals 
and content of the Ninth Five-Year (1995-2000) and the 2010 
plans. 
  The "Agenda" made clear the position and actual action of 
the 
Chinese Government in implementing the U.N. Agenda 21. 
  Today's meeting of the State Council also adopted an outline 
program of state industrial policies for the 1990s.

  [Text] Qian Qichen, member of the political bureau of the 
CPC Central Committee, vice premier of the State Council, and 
concurrently minister at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
delivered a report on the international situation at the foreign 
affairs work conference of Beijing Municipality that was held on 
the afternoon of 17 March. Chen Xitong, member of the political 
bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Beijing 
Municipal CPC Committee, attended the conference. 
  Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing Municipality, chaired the 
conference. Qian Qichen reported on the current international 
situation, China's policies and principles toward foreign 
countries, and the issues that the people are concerned with. 
His report was welcomed by the participants. Chen Xitong 
expressed thanks to Qian Qichen for his assistance to the work 
of Beijing Municipality and urged the party and government 
leaders at various levels to conscientiously study the report 
and achieve the foreign affairs work. 
  Wang Daming, Li Zhijian, and Chen Guangwen, leaders of the 
municipality, attended the conference. 
  The municipal foreign affairs work conference opened on the 
morning of 17 March. Mayor Li Qiyan made a speech at the 
conference. He stressed in his speech: Beijing is the capital 
of China. Beijing's foreign affairs work is of extreme 
importance. We must implement to the letter the basic line of 
the party and the line of foreign affairs, and serve the foreign 
affairs of the central authorities, the economic construction of 
Beijing, and the capital's political and social stability. 
  Lu Yucheng, vice mayor of the municipality, made a report at 
the conference. Under the guidance of the guidelines of the 
14th party congress, according to the requirements of the 
seventh party congress, under the leadership of the municipal 
party committee, the municipal government, and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, and with the great support of relevant 
departments, in 1993, the municipal foreign affairs front 
accurately implemented the central authorities' foreign 
principles and policies, emancipated the mind, renewed their 
ideas, and made new progress in expanding the contacts with 
foreign countries, serving the economic construction, and 
managing foreign affairs. All this forcefully promoted the 
further development of the opening to the outside world. The 
contacts with the capitals of foreign countries and foreign 
cities are unprecedentedly vigorous. As of now, the 
municipality has established friendly ties with 18 foreign 
cities and government- level contacts with 96 capitals cities of 
72 foreign countries. The number of persons entering and 
leaving the border increased rapidly. The foreign economic and 
trade volume increased by a big margin. The import and export 
volume reached $3.04 billion. A total of 3,752 foreign-funded 
enterprises of three types were newly approved. The daily 
approvals numbered 10. Some $6.28 billion foreign capital were 
introduced according to agreements. The municipality made 
progress in developing foreign cooperation in the scientific and 
technological aspects. A total of 1,054 scientific and 
technological groups were dispatched and 622 foreign specialists 
were invited. The number of foreign cultural contacts increased 
with each passing day. Sixty-nine cultural troupes were sent 
out and 104 groups were invited from other places. The external 
contacts in the educational, public health, and sports spheres 
were ceaselessly expanded. Districts and counties made great 
headway in developing foreign affairs. The mass organizations 
established closer contacts with the outside world. The 
management of foreign affairs was further strengthened. New 
achievements were made in conducting external propaganda. 
Simultaneously, we must notice that we still lag behind in 
emancipating the mind and suiting the demands of reform, opening 
up, and modernization. 
  Lu Yucheng said: The basic ideas guiding the 1994 foreign 
affairs work are: Take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance; 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and the 1994 work 
principles as defined by the municipal party committee and the 
municipal government; make new breakthroughs in expanding 
foreign contacts, serving economic construction, and 
intensifying the management of foreign affairs; safeguard the 
stability of the capital; create a good environment and 
condition for opening to the outside world; form, step by step, 
a pattern of foreign contacts suitable to internationally large 
modernized cities; and make contributions to becoming fairly 
well-off three years ahead of schedule. We should achieve the 
work in the following five aspects: Further expand the contacts 
with foreign countries, further serve reform, opening up, and 
economic construction, further intensify the management of 
foreign affairs, further strengthen foreign propaganda, and 
further strengthen the setup of foreign affairs worker 
contingents. 
  In his speech, Li Qiyan expressed thanks to the foreign 
affairs office of the State Council, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, and the central departments concerned for their support 
to the work of Beijing Municipality. He stressed: Beijing's 
foreign affairs work is related to the implementation of the 
central foreign policies and the image of the state. So, we 
must conscientiously and comprehensively implement to the letter 
the basic line of the party and define the line of foreign 
affairs according to the basic line of the party. The primary 
task is to serve the foreign affairs of the central authorities 
and to positively work in cooperation with the central 
authorities to fulfill various specific tasks. We should make 
the foreign affairs work serve the economic construction, 
further emancipate the mind, pioneer channels for attracting 
foreign affairs, promote the cooperation in the economic and 
trade and scientific and technological spheres, and promote the 
economic development of the municipality. The foreign affairs 
work should serve the capital's political and social stability. 
This is the primary task of the municipality. The foreign 
affairs work should serve this overall situation. Li Qiyan also 
urged the necessity to stress the unified and centralized 
leadership over the foreign affairs work and to guard against 
the practice of each acting according to its own way. The party 
committees and governments at various levels should pay 
attention to foreign affairs work. The party and government top 
leaders should personally engage themselves in the foreign 
affairs work. The newly elected district and county leaders 
should pay attention to studying the party's foreign policies, 
the knowledge of foreign affairs, and foreign etiquette. We 
should intensify the construction of the foreign affairs worker 
contingents, strengthen the improvement of administrative 
honesty and diligence, set strict demands, and grasp the study 
of politics, policies, professional knowledge, and foreign 
languages. 
  Li Yongan, secretary of the municipal discipline inspection 
commission, made a speech on strengthening foreign affairs 
discipline and correcting the unhealthy trends of using public 
funds to go out of the country (border) for trips. 
  Municipal leaders Qiang Wei, Meng Zhiyuan, Hu Zhaoguang, and 
Shen Rendao attended the conference.

<F P=106> [From the "News and Current Events" program] </F>
  [Text] On 18 March, the mainland's Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] wrote a letter to 
Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] on a recent incident 
wherein Taiwan's defense troops stationed on offshore islands 
fired at Fujian fishermen. The letter says: As informed by 
relevant Fujian provincial authorities, at about 0400 on 6 
March, (Zheng Baoxing) and other fishermen from (Simu) Village, 
Huangshi Town, Lianjian County, set sail on fishing boat 
(?Yuminyu) No. 8509 to fish at waters near Mazu's (Daqi Island). 
While searching for their lost fishing hooks due to broken 
lines, they were suddenly fired at by the defense troops. 
(Zheng Baoxing), a crew member, was shot dead on the spot, 
while (Yan Huayong) and [words indistinct] were injured. After 
the incident, the boat sought medical treatment but was rejected 
by the defense troops firing their guns. Fifteen minutes later, 
the boat sailed to Mazu's Beigan to moor at (Huaikaicun) pier, 
and was again fired at by the defense troops. Only after the 
repeated requests of crewman (Lin Huoqiang), two men, who 
appeared to be officers, came to investigate and summoned a 
doctor to give simple dressings for (Wu Guoyou)'s wounds. One 
of the officers gave $15,000 New Taiwan dollars to (Lin 
Huoqiang) as compensation. At about 1300, the Mazu side sent a 
boat to tow (Yuminyu) No. 8509 from the pier. The fishing boat 
returned to Huangshi, Lianjiang, at 1430. 
  The letter says: Over a long period of time, Taiwan's 
defending troops stationed on offshore islands ignored the 
brotherly friendship between the people on the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. The incidents of firing at and killing or 
injuring mainland fishermen occurred occasionally. In 1993 
alone, there were 18 incidents wherein defense troops in Jinmen 
and Mazu fired at or shelled mainland fishermen working on the 
sea, causing bloodshed, deaths, and injuries. Of these, seven 
people were killed and 15 were injured. The disgusting conduct 
of Taiwan's defending troops stationed in offshore islands not 
only caused great harm to the feeling of mainland's coastal 
fishermen but also disrupted the normal production and life of 
the Taiwan Strait. In addition, it brought utmost mental agony 
as well as tremendous economic loss to the families of the dead 
and injured fishermen. 
  Recently, we made many representations to relevant Taiwan 
authorities. However, not only did the defense troops' firing 
not stop, it became increasingly rampant. Our country has 
strongly asked the relevant Taiwan authorities to adopt positive 
and effective measures to stop this kind of incident from being 
repeated and pay compensation, including compensation for the 
losses of dead and injured fishermen in the (?Yuminyu) incident.

  [Text] President Jiang Zemin of China has stepped in to 
try to settle the prolonged row between Britain and China on the 
financing of the new airport in Hong Kong. In a hitherto 
undisclosed move, Jiang recently sent an emmissary, Li Chuwen, 
to the territory to conduct substantial on-the-spot research on 
the Hong Kong government's latest funding proposal for the 
multi-billion dollar new airport at Chek Lap Kok. 
  Li, a former priest before the Communist takeover of 
Shanghai 
in 1949 and former deputy director in Hong Kong of the New China 
News Agency (XINHUA), has just returned to Shanghai after a 
week-long secret visit to Hong Kong. Currently serving as 
director of the Shanghai municipality government's foreign 
affairs office, Li was personally chosen by Jiang to undertake 
the mission in Hong Kong. 
  During Li's stay last week, several informal meetings were 
arranged for him and Hong Kong government officials in charge of 
the new airport project. These meetings were said to have been 
held in a very relaxed and informal atmosphere, where government 
officials outlined details of the fourth airport funding 
proposal. Li also met a number of pro-China figures, party 
leaders and business representatives during his visit. 
  A Chinese official in Beijing declined to disclose the list 
of people Li met. He did say the purpose of Li's visit was to 
find out "professional views" over the fourth airport funding 
plan. China has so far not responded formally through the Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG). "In a word, the Chinese central government 
wanted to know whether or not, the latest proposal was 
acceptable," the Chinese official said. 
  It is understood that most of the people Li met last week 
urged the Chinese government to get on with the project as 
quickly as possible since the new funding plan has addressed 
China's main concerns. "We told Li that it was time an 
agreement was reached by both sides," a source who met Li said. 
"It is better than no agreement at all since that will enable 
the Hong Kong government to gain financial approval from the 
Legislative Council without check and balances by Beijing." 
  Some people proposed to Li that China should urge the Hong 
Kong government to inject more equity into the core airport 
projects, as China viewed the Provisional Airport Authority's 
and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation's $23bn [billion] in 
borrowings as government debt. This is more than four times the 
borrowing limit set out in the Sino-British Memorandum of 
Understanding on the airport. 
  The fourth proposal was passed to China through the JLG 
early 
this month. China was also briefed by Hong Kong government 
officials last week. Under the proposal, the Government will 
inject a total of about $60.3bn into the project, the amount 
China demanded last year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- The collection of the 
revenue shared by the central and local governments has been 
going well since China adopted the new revenue-sharing system 
two months ago. 
  According to figures released by the Finance Ministry, the 
total volume of value-added tax collected in the first two 
months of this year amounted to 21.5 billion yuan. 
  Of this amount, the central coffers took 71.1 percent while 
the local governments shared a total of 28.9 percent, close to 
the projected sharing ratio of 3:1. 
  Liu Zhongli, finance minister and director of the State 
Taxation Bureau, expressed satisfaction over the implementation 
of the revenue-sharing system, which became effective January 1 
this year to replace the former turnover tax system. 
  The reform of the taxation system, based on a rational 
division of responsibilities and rights, was aimed to strengthen 
the ability of the central government in exercising 
macro-economic regulation. 
  Liu said the past two months saw a rapid increase in 
revenue. 
By the end of February the country's total revenue (excluding 
debts) was up 32.1 percent over the same period of last year. 
  He said the detailed rules and regulations on implementing 
the new taxation system issued early this year properly 
addressed the concerns of foreign-funded enterprises and cleared 
the doubts of foreign investors -- their total payment of taxes 
did not increase under the new system. 
  This was done because the additional payment under the new 
system would then be returned to the foreign-funded enterprises 
to ensure their original interests, he said. 
  However, he said, this period of "tax compensation" will not 
exceed five years, and those enterprises founded after January 1 
this year will be subject to the new taxation system. 
  As to the value-added tax on land, Liu said it was designed 
to prevent land speculation, not to discourage foreign 
investors, especially real estate businessmen engaging in 
developing residential quarters. 
  He reiterated three governing principles: value-added tax 
(VAT) will be levied on land, with domestic and overseas 
investors on an equal footing; land VAT should be unified 
everywhere in China; and government departments will give 
consideration to public reaction and formulate relevant 
regulations. 
  Liu did not give a timetable for promulgating the detailed 
rules and regulations on levying land vat, but he added they 
will be made public "as soon as possible".

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Tax Reform Heralded as Successful"] </F>
  [Text] Aside from a few minor problems, the new tax system 
has functioned as expected since its introduction at the 
beginning of this year, a top Chinese financial official said 
yesterday. 
  A smooth transition from the old tax system to the new 
system 
has been achieved during the past three months, according to Liu 
Zhongli Finance Minister and the Director of the State Taxation 
Bureau. 
  Liu noted the massive tax reform has not triggered major 
price fluctuations as many people had worried. 
  Moreover, it didn't have any unfavorable impact on the 
country's industrial production and market operations. 
  During the first two months of the year, China's industrial 
production reported a 18.16 per cent growth compared with the 
same period last year. Total retail sales volume increased 23 
per cent during the same period, he said. 
  Moreover, by the end of February, the country's revenue -- 
excluding domestic and overseas loans -- registered a 32.1 per 
cent increase compared with the same period last year. 
  Industrial and commercial tax revenue increased 32.2 per 
cent 
from the corresponding period in 1993, Liu said. 
  In addition, he noted most enterprises reacted calmly to the 
changes on their tax burden under the new system. 
  Foreign investors' worries about a heavier tax burden were 
also dispelled after they found their taxes didn't increase 
under the new tax system, Liu said. 
  And no provinces or cities reported financial problems as a 
result of the new tax-sharing system which restructured tax 
revenues between the central and local governments. 
  Liu said tax reform has reinforced the country's confidence. 
  However, he also acknowledged some minor problems have 
cropped up in recent months. 
  Some enterprises, especially grassroots units, remain 
ignorant about the functions of the new tax code. 
  The minister attributed this to inadequate publicity and 
instruction about tax reforms. 
  Also, a small number of enterprises have complained the new 
system adds to their tax burden. 
  Actually, Liu said, only 25 percent of the country's 
enterprises have had to pay more taxes. Half of these 
enterprises have had just a four per cent rise in taxes. 
  Liu said minor problems are inevitable during such a massive 
reform. He said the government expects to overcome these 
difficulties through progressive efforts. 
  "We must persist in this reform which is of vital importance 
to the establishment of modern enterprise management mechanism 
and reforms in the financial, foreign exchange and investment 
systems," he pledged. 
  Liu said this year's task is to set up the basic framework 
for a tax system which can suit the needs of the socialist 
market economy. 
  To reach that goal, great efforts will be paid to ensure a 
successful issuance of this year's treasury bonds, he stressed. 
  Meanwhile, the printing technique of value-added tax 
invoices 
will also be improved to prevent fake receipts, the minister 
added.

  [Text] A senior government adviser has criticized the 
leadership for lacking a strong will in using market forces, 
warning that the consequences could be costly. The challenge to 
Beijing's economic strategy was made by Professor Wu Jinglian, 
senior researcher at the Development Research Centre under the 
State Council. 
  "I told [former party chief] Zhao Ziyang [in 1988] that the 
slower the pace of reform the greater the instability," the 
liberal economist said. He said if he had the chance to talk to 
current Chinese leaders, he would tell them the same thing. 
  Professor Wu praised the 50-item economic blueprint adopted 
at the Communist Party's third plenum last November as an 
outstanding achievement, and said he was upset it had not been 
implemented. 
  "[The leadership's] understanding on the market economy is 
not deep enough," he said. Professor Wu warned that the use of 
more state fiats would be ineffective and produce adverse side 
effects for the country. 
  "It is also against the trend of building up a market 
economy," he said. "We need to adopt economic tools to change 
the system in order to attain quick results... 
  "But the reduction of administrative measures has been 
contentious. I'm in the minority." Professor Wu said the 
Central Government should rely on interest rates as the major 
economic weapon with which to readjust the country's economy. 
  He said the annual interest rate of 10 percent had been far 
below inflation, and this had overheated the economy. "The 
result is that you have to intensify state fiats to curb the 
growth of money supply." 
  He said enterprises had been badly hit and had complained 
strongly to the Government, forcing it to relax credit again 
since last September. Present inflation was a direct result of 
that relaxation of credit between September and November he said. 
  "It is a question of whether the central Government is 
determined to withstand the pressure from enterprises... 
  "The use of negative interest-rate policy is not the answer 
to solve the plight of money-losing enterprises," he said. 
  Professor Wu warned that the "vested-interest persons" who 
had the privilege of access to low-interest credit certainly 
would not want an increase in the interest rate. But leaders 
should not be influenced by their lobbying, he said. 
  Professor Wu conceded that as inflation had increased there 
had been calls to slow the pace of reform in areas such as tax 
and finance. "This is an old argument used by some to explain 
the failure of the reforms in 1988... 
  "But it's not because of the rapid pace of reform, but the 
wrong money-supply policy," he said. 
  He said the success of reform in state firms was crucial to 
the task of keeping inflation below 10 percent this year. 
  However, state firms now were "like a funnel" through which 
money for investment flowed out again. 
  "I'm pessimistic about the future of the state sector," he 
said. 
  "The national economy will be bolstered by the nonstate 
sector in future."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Zhiping: "State To Step Up Reserve </F>
Plan"] 
  [Text] A reserve scheme for key commodities is being 
developed further to control price rises and curb inflation, 
official sources said at the weekend. 
  The system, designed by the Internal Trade Ministry, aims to 
ensure supplies of vital consumer goods cover people's basic 
needs. 
  The programme has been tested in Shanghai, Beijing and 
Tianjin and in Liaoning, Hubei and Guangdong provinces since the 
start of the year . 
  "Shanghai has done a very good job in setting up a 
municipal-level reserve system for important commodities 
including grain, edible oil, pork and sugar," said a ministry 
official. 
  "And the reserve system is already helping to stabilize 
Shanghai's food market," he said, adding that the city's stocks 
of pork and sugar could meet the daily needs of its more than 13 
million citizens for about two months. 
  The system would also allow local governments to feed people 
and keep prices stable in the event of natural disasters or 
other "unexpected accidents," said the official. 
  The central government has authorized provincial, regional 
and municipal governments to decide on the type and quantity of 
vital goods in local reserves, in line with the conditions they 
face and changes in market demand. 
  Reserves are being built up by the various local governments 
and their commercial departments in line with policies laid down 
by the Internal Trade Ministry. 
  The scheme is also seen as another arm of the government's 
economic controls, said the official. 
  Meanwhile, the central government is moving to build up its 
own supplies of such essential goods as grain, cotton, edible 
oil and steel to ensure a steady market supply, the official 
said. 
  He also revealed that the government is pressing ahead to 
establish a commodity market funding system across the country 
to develop production centres for consumer goods. 
  The government has set crop targets of 450 million tons of 
grain, 4.85 million tons of cotton and 17 million tons of oil 
crops for this year. 
  The total value of agricultural production is scheduled to 
grow by 4 per cent and its sales value and profits are to go up 
by 25 percent and 19 percent respectively.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- Information released by 
the State Information Centre shows that saturation has nearly 
been reached in the market for several different kinds of 
products whose further production should be curtailed at present. 
  -- Colour television sets: There are now at least 57 
enterprises undertaking this business with a total turnout of 
nearly 20 million sets in 1990. The annual turnout was put at 
10 million in recent years, represented only 50 percent of 
production. 
  -- Personal computers: These are produced by 30 enterprises 
across the country with a mere four of them being big in scale. 
The current turnout in this business sector is put at 150,000 
computers. An increase of 250,000 was seen during the Eighth 
Five Year Plan period, a gain capable of meeting the market 
needs. 
  -- Colour TV tubes and screens: Production of colour TV 
tubes registered 7.5 million in 1990 and will rise to 12.9 
million during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Some 
export-oriented enterprises can produce 4.1 million colour TV 
tubes. The turnout of television screens was 5.26 million 
pieces in 1990 and this increased to 19.08 million during the 
Eighth Five Year Plan period. Meanwhile, export- oriented 
enterprises were capable of turning out 4.45 million screens. 
  -- Videotape recorders: Production of this item is three 
million while production of components and spare parts and 
certain supplementary devices for the recorder has also been 
arranged in the country. 
  -- Magnetic tubes for microwave ovens: There are now five 
enterprises specializing in the production of these tubes with 
an annual turnout of between 2.4 million and 2.5 million, 
sufficient for meeting domestic and foreign demand. 
  -- Television cameras: There are so many enterprises 
applying for production of this item, resulting in a heavy input 
of high technology and capital. 
  -- Digital programme-controlled switchboards: Production of 
this item is now increasing and the state will select certain 
production entities for renovation in order to meet the market 
demand. 
  -- Laser discs, karaoke machines, mobile communications 
sets, 
facsimile machines and optical fibre communications items: 
There are so many enterprises now producing these items which 
involve a heavy input of technology and investment and the 
market is yet to be developed. 
  -- Transport vehicles for agriculture: As this item is in 
strong demand, many plants are tending to produce them. 
Incomplete statistics indicate that there are now 80 
enterprises in this sector across the country with an annual 
turnout of between 130,000 and 150,000. A mere three big-sized 
enterprises are capable of turning out over 10,000 vehicles a 
year while 75 percent of all such enterprises have a turnout of 
not more than 1,000 each a year. Production of such kinds of 
vehicles should be reserved for big- sized plants in a bid to 
improve product quality.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- From March 25 this year, 
prices for purchasing raw silk in China are controlled at RMB 
[Renminbi] 180,000 per tonne with only 10 percent floating 
prices being permitted and no purchasing at prices of over RMB 
200,000 for each tonne will be permitted, a top official of the 
China Silk Import and Export Corporation (CSIEC) recently 
announced here. 
  Since the beginning of this year, a soaring rise in prices 
for silk and silk cloth materials have been seen with prices of 
raw silk, rising by 25 percent between January and March. The 
skyrocketing prices for raw silk, besides the reduction of the 
silkworm cocoon production last year and the drop in storage of 
such materials, were mainly caused by artificial factors with 
speculation by middlemen being very rampant in the country as 
they took advantage of the situation to hold back supplies and 
so raise prices, posing a heavy burden on silk-related textile 
and printing and dyeing mills and threatening the silk industry 
in the country and the preeminent place China has had in the 
international silk market for a long time. 
  The CSIEC, the state authorized company in charge of 
administration and management in this sector, will consequently 
coordinate its branches at provincial levels in practising 
management with price limitations over the raw silk market. 
  According to a leader of the CSIEC, if the country fails to 
put the sharply rising prices of raw silk under control, the 
outcome will be very serious and another "silkworm cocoon war" 
will break out.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "Ceiling Is Set To Curb Rising </F>
Raw-Silk Prices"] 
  [Text] China has imposed a cap on soaring prices for raw 
silk, which threaten production stability and curtail exports. 
  From Friday, March 25, the maximum purchase price for raw 
silk was set at 200,000 yuan ($22,989) per ton. The measure was 
taken in concert by China National Silk Import and Export Corp 
and 31 local companies to encourage production and exports. 
  So far this year, the price of raw silk has jumped 25 
percent 
to 230,000 yuan ($26,438) per ton. 
  To a large degree, analysts say, the price spike has held 
back silk exports. Last year, exports of raw silk declined from 
1992 but the precise figure was not available. 
  Soaring domestic prices for raw silk add another burden to 
the sluggish international silk market, analysts say. They add 
that this year silk consumption will not rise in Europe or 
Japan, the major markets for Chinese silk products. 
  The unchecked spiral in prices for raw silk has fueled a 
rampant increase in the nation's production of mulberry, whose 
leaves are fed to silkworms. 
  Over time, though, the production expansion will force down 
prices for raw silk, eventually hurting mulberry producers. 
This will unsettle farmers in China's hinterland and minority 
regions, whose livelihood depends on mulberry. 
  The price gyrations resemble those of 1988, when the country 
was caught off guard by fierce competition among growers of 
silkworm cocoons. Cutbacks in cocoon production led directly to 
price hikes. 
  At the same time, booming domestic silk enterprises demand 
more raw materials, making the shortage of raw silk even more 
acute. 
  In addition, many manufacturers raised prices following the 
recent revision of tax regulations and the unification of the 
dual exchange rates. 
  In fact, such increases are considered unwarranted because 
the value-added tax introduced this year imposes no extra 
burdens on major domestic enterprises. 
  In contrast to raw silk exports, silk garment makers 
anticipate a buoyant overseas market this year. 
  Last year, they exported more than 310 million pieces, 
compared with 70 million in 1990. The garments accounted for 70 
percent of all silk exports last year. 
  Chinese silk production last year ballooned to 32.7 billion 
yuan ($3.76 billion), or 22.26 percent more than in 1992. 
  Silk production is the country's third largest textile 
sector 
after cotton spinning and artificial fibre. 
  China is still the world's leading producer of silk 
products, 
accounting for more than 65 percent of the total. In 1993, 
China was responsible for some 70 percent of the world's output 
of silkworm cocoons.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- A survey conducted by 
the Institute of Economics of the State Planning Commission on 
differences in the consumption pattern between the urban and 
rural areas showed that a consumption gap had taken place, 
having an adverse effect on the growth of the national economy. 
It has also caused serious idle productivity in the consumer 
goods industry as well as heavy stockpiling of finished 
products. The survey called for the early adoption of effective 
measures to coordinate economic development in urban and rural 
areas with the eventual aim of solving the growing serious 
economic contradictions between the urban and rural areas. 
  The report revealed that from 1979 to 1984 when rural income 
increased to a great extent, purchases of expensive consumer 
goods including watches, bicycles, sewing machines, radio sets 
and black-and-white television sets showed a sharp gain. Urban 
income has since 1985 posted a rise and continued to grow at a 
rate higher than in rural areas. A shopping spree for 
high-grade consumer goods took place. Consumption of expensive 
items tended to go further in urban areas after 1988, but most 
consumers in rural area saw their consumption capability lagging 
behind their urban counterparts mainly because of their slow 
gain of income, thereby constituting a gap between the urban and 
rural areas regarding consumption patterns. 
  The survey indicated that the per capita net income in rural 
areas was RMB [Renminbi] 784 in 1992. When taking into 
consideration price fluctuation, the rural income was equivalent 
to RMB 454.49 as it was in 1980 and to RMB 431.77 after taking 
into account a reduction of five percent from the income for 
expansion of production. It then struck a balance with the 
urban income of RMB 439.4 as it was in 1980. Judging from the 
figure, the current consumption capability in rural areas is 
just the same as that in the urban areas in the early stages of 
reform. This means that the rural areas have lagged behind for 
12 years when compared with the urban areas in terms of 
consumption capability. The report suggested that the 
authorities should adopt measures to narrow the gap.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Government Reveals Foreign Shopping List"] </F>
  [Text] The government is expected to launch a massive 
overseas purchasing programme to back up the nation's 
modernization drive over the next seven years according to 
official sources. 
  The programme, drafted by the State Planning Commission, 
involves importing advanced technology and equipment valued at 
some $30 billion. 
  A large part of the new technology will be used to develop 
24 
key agricultural projects during the 1994-2000 period. 
  However, the $30 billion buying list also covers other 
sectors, including energy, machinery and electronics, chemicals, 
transportation, metallurgy and post and telecommunications. 
  The money to support the immense purchase will come mainly 
from State foreign exchange reserves and the financial coffers 
of relevant departments and local governments -- in addition to 
overseas commercial credits and soft loans from foreign 
governments and international financial institutions, government 
officials said. 
  The agricultural technology and equipment will be used for 
projects across China, including Guangdong, Hainan, Fujian, 
Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hebei, Liaoning and Gansu Provinces and 
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  The key agricultural projects will focus on integrating 
farming, animal husbandry, fisheries and forestry with 
processing and environmental protection in the grain-rich Henan, 
Sichuan, Fujian, Hainan, Jilin Provinces and the Liaohe River 
region of Liaoning Province. 
  Also high on the agenda are vital irrigation projects such 
as 
the delta projects for the Yellow River, Huaihe and Haihe 
Rivers; the irrigation programme of the southen Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region; the Tongyu River irrigation engineering 
project in Jiangsu Province; and the farmland irrigation project 
in Hubei and Hunan provinces. 
  The imported technology will also be introduced to help 
State 
farms in Guangdong Province develop tropical crops. The Bohai 
Bay aquaculture project and the national agricultural-technology 
popularization programme are also targeted for imports. 
  Other recipients will include the compound-fodder project; 
the grain storage, transportation and market development 
project; and the second-stage afforestation project. 
  Additionally, the programme covers the ongoing Taihu Lake 
flood-protection project in Jiangsu Province; the second-stage 
red-soil development project in South China; and the Loess 
Plateau soil-erosion protection and agricultural development 
project of Northwest China. 
  Finally, part of the imported techniques and equipment will 
be used for the nationwide seed-breeding development project; 
agricultural development along the Hexi Corridor in Gansu 
Province; and poverty alleviation programmes in Guizhou and 
Yunnan Provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "New Plans for Luring Machinery </F>
Investors"] 
  [Text] China is encouraging foreign companies to invest in 
large and medium-sized machinery enterprises owned by the State. 
  But, cautioned Nong Keqiang, head of the Foreign 
Co-operation 
Division under the Ministry of Machinery Industry, controlling 
stakes in key enterprises with large shares of the domestic 
market must be held by Chinese. 
  In the past year, many multinational corporations, including 
Siemens, ABB, General Electric, Westinghouse Electric, Linde and 
Hitachi, have come to China looking for co-operative partners. 
  Their targets are large and medium-sized enterprises, which 
are the backbone of the industry. 
  The Ministry of Machinery Industry also hopes to renovate 
these State enterprises with foreign technology capital and 
management, Nong said. 
  However, most foreign companies interested in turning these 
enterprises into joint ventures want majority stakes. 
  They also ask for control of sales and marketing and deduct 
a 
percentage of sales revenue for research and development costs. 
  This will hinder joint ventures in developing new products, 
Nong said. 
  In order to maintain State control, he said, the ministry 
has 
ruled that Chinese partners must have the final say when turning 
key enterprises in basic industries into joint ventures. 
  Nong said the ministry will intensify its efforts to raise 
foreign capital this year to promote industry-wide development. 
  Foreign investment will be channeled into basic machinery 
products and components and into power generating equipment, 
which are the industry's priorities. 
  Because of the country's massive demand for energy, many 
foreign companies wish to set up joint ventures to produce power 
generators and transmission equipment. 
  Nong said China will open part of its domestic market to 
attract foreign investment. 
  However, he said that if a large State enterprise is turned 
into a joint venture, no less than 70 percent of the stake must 
remain in Chinese hands. 
  If part of an enterprise is turned into a joint venture or a 
new venture is launched, foreign companies can own the majority 
of its shares. 
  Foreign companies can also hold controlling stakes if they 
bring in advanced technology that China lacks. 
  China's production of power generating equipment is 
dominated 
by three giants in Heilongjiang and Sichuan provinces and 
Shanghai. 
  The Dongfang Power Station Equipment Corp, in Sichuan, will 
set up several joint ventures with Siemens AG of Germany to 
produce thermal power generating equipment. 
  Parts of the Shanghai Power Station Equipment Corp will be 
turned into joint ventures with the Westinghouse Electric Corp, 
which will invest nearly $90 million. 
  The Harbin Power Station Equipment Corp in Heilongjiang, 
China's largest manufacturer in this field, is planning to 
establish a joint venture with General Electric Co to produce 
gas turbines.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- China is to introduce 
a set of new rules for foreign trade arbitration from June 1 
this year. 
  The move is aimed at accelerating the modernization and 
internationalization of China's international economic and trade 
arbitration. 
  Cheng Dejun, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the 
China 
International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission 
(CIETAC), said here today that the new rules will give better 
expression to the principle of respecting the will of the 
parties concerned and will be loser to international practice. 
  The existing rules for CIETAC, which is attached to the 
China 
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), went 
into force five years ago. 
  Cheng told a press conference that the amendment will better 
meet the demand of China's further reform and opening-up and 
building of a socialist market economy. 
  The new rules are complete in contents and easier to apply. 
  Added to the contents are provisions about jurisdiction, 
arbitration agreement, withdrawal of arbitrators, evidence, 
mediation, principles and deadlines for hearing cases, 
examination and rendering of awards, and making, alteration and 
addition of rulings, simple procedure, and abandoning of 
disagreement as well as the working language for the hearing. 
  Cheng said that the new rules are more convenient for 
parties 
concerned and conducive to working efficiency and an 
independent, fair, smooth and prompt settlement of international 
economic and trade disputes. 
  CIETAC has drawn up a new list of 290 arbitrators including 
87 from 22 other countries and regions. 
  During the past few years, CIETAC has accepted over 200 
cases 
annually; last year the figure rose sharply to a record 504, an 
increase of some 90 percent over the previous year.

<F P=106> [By Ivan Tong] </F>
  [Text] The People's Bank of China has postponed plans to 
unify the country's biggest swap centres by at least three 
months. The decision is a setback to China's attempt to revamp 
its currency exchange system. The move came after Beijing 
decided the plan to abolish the swap markets at one stroke by 
April 1 was unrealistic, said sources. Under the proposal, what 
the central bank had dubbed a "national interbank system" was to 
have replaced the old-style swap centre system and begun 
operating on April 1. However, sources said that the lack of 
regulations governing the new system, banking staff's 
inexperience in handling foreign exchange transactions and other 
technical problems were the major deterrents. 
  "Banking officials gathered in Beijing in the middle of the 
month to be briefed by the central bank on the operation of the 
new system. But the officials used the meetings to voice 
grievances at the haste in which the system would be 
introduced," said one source close to the central bank. "Nobody 
seems to quite know how the system will operate, not even 
Beijing officials who made the proposal," the source said. 
  The delay will affect Beijing's attempts to centralise 
foreign exchange supply and strengthen its control over foreign 
exchange flow. 
  The abolition of the swap centres, announced by Beijing on 
December 29 last year, as part of the official and swap centre 
rates unification plan, is the most important reform of China's 
foreign exchange system since the establishment of the swap 
centres in 1985. The measure to establish the banks as the basis 
for the country's foreign exchange system indicates China's 
intention to model its system on those of other market 
economies, in which banks deal through interbank markets and 
intermediating brokers. 
  Some critics of the plan branded April 1 "the fools' day", 
considering that China's interbank system, which barely 
resembles those of other market economies, is insufficient to 
accommodate the changes. In theory, under the new system, 
companies will ask the authorised banks to buy or sell yuan. 
The banks in turn will instruct their dealers to execute orders 
in the markets. But in practice, the plan is simply to change 
their names from foreign exchange adjustment centres to foreign 
exchange markets and linking up through a computer network to 
form a unified system. Seats in the foreign exchange markets 
would only be available to banks, both foreign and Chinese. 
  It is understood that the central bank's vice-governor Chen 
Yuan, will brief foreign banks' personnel in Beijing on the new 
foreign bank regulations as well as interbank operations in 
handling foreign exchange transactions. 
  One report by Business China noted that China's 110 swap 
centres scattered over the country would not be closing, even if 
the swap markets were to be abolished as scheduled on April 1. 
In the trial period, only the biggest 18 swap centres would be 
linked and the rest would continue to function as old-fashioned 
swap centres. As a result, only those within the unified system 
will quote one exchange rate while those outside will quote 
different ones. 
  Warburg Securities analyst Allan Ng said that such a 
practice 
in the transitional period was not very different from the old 
system and it might still lead to a black market due to the lack 
of a real unified rate throughout the country. 
  Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist College, 
said mainland banks were understood to be barely prepared for 
the new foreign exchange system, despite training courses for 
staff over the last two months.

"Central Authorities Call for Efforts To Supervise and Manage 
Foreign Enterprises According to Law, Strengthen Measures 
Against Tax Evasion"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (TA KUNG PAO) -- A central leader 
recently pointed out that while continuing to give play to the 
role of foreign-invested enterprises, it is necesssary to 
further strengthen and improve supervision and management over 
them according to the law; to establish and develop mechanisms 
for supervision and restraint on the input-output of the assets 
of Chinese partners; to strengthen measures against tax 
avoidance; and to promote the healthy development of 
foreign-invested enterprises. 
  This leader also said: We welcome foreign investment in the 
technical transformation of old enterprises and in 
infrastructural projects, but a project may not get underway 
until it is examined and approved according to required 
procedures following a rational evaluation of state property by 
a state-acknowledged appraisal institution, and after the 
financial authorities and state property management authorities 
have reviewed and confirmed the results. Promising a fixed 
investment-recovery rate without authorization is not permitted. 
  The State Council has made it clear that in the future, it 
is 
necessary to strengthen guidance for foreign investments through 
industrial policies; to continue to encourage foreign investment 
in projects in infrastructure, basic industries, high- and 
new-technology industries, and the technical transformation of 
old enterprises; and to encourage the establishment of 
export-oriented enterprises. It is especially necessary to try 
to attract large enterprises and multinational companies to 
invest and set up high- and new-technology projects in China, 
and to open the domestic market to them selectively and to an 
appropriate degree. Such projects as automotive assembly and 
exclusive apartments, vacation villages, and deluxe recreational 
facilities which exceed the actual demand should be curtailed. 
Projects that cause a high level of pollution, require a high 
level of material consumption, and endanger the ecosystem and 
people's physical and mental health must be sternly forbidden. 
Retailers partnering foreign enterprises must emphasize balance 
of import and export and balance of payments in foreign 
currencies. As this is quite a sensitive field, in which we 
lack experience, prior approval must be obtained for pilot 
operations, so as to to accumulate experience and improve 
relevant laws and regulations before gradual expansion. At 
present, attention must be focused on introducing experience in 
the operation and management of chain stores abroad, so as to 
activate the production and export of China's convenience 
articles and raise the standards of commercial management and 
service. In other fields of opening up where experience is also 
lacking, pilot operations are also necessary before gradual 
popularization. The joint-venture projects in the tertiary 
industry to be set up now should concentrate on fields that 
directly serve production. 
  This year, China will continue to let special economic zones 
and the Shanghai Pudong New Zone act as pacesetters in the 
reform and opening up; encourage these places and coastal open 
areas to create a better investment environment; accelerate the 
upgrading of products; and concentrate energies on developing 
high- and new-technology industries and fund- and 
technology-intensive tertiary industries. In order to gradually 
narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions in 
economic development, China will make a point of giving more 
support to the central and western regions in the use of foreign 
investment to exploit and utilize resources. 
  As for the development zone rush in recent years, the 
central 
authorities also have come to see a clearer picture in the 
process of adjustment and rectification. The construction of 
development zones should follow the principle of overall 
planning, rational layout, acting according to capabilities, 
gradual development, overcoming blindness, and raising the 
efficiency of development. It is necessary to make a 
conscientious effort to run well the economic and technological 
development zones and bonded zones that have been approved. For 
setting up new development zones and bonded zones, it is 
necessary to conduct feasibility studies well and to secure 
approval according to the required procedures. Development 
zones that have been set up with approval should concentrate on 
high- and new-technology and export-oriented projects, integrate 
with the adjustment of industrial structure and the 
transformation of old urban areas and old enterprises, and 
integrate with the adjustment of industrial structure and 
product mix. It is necessary to avoid the practice of 
neglecting the transformation of old urban areas and old 
enterprises and setting up large numbers of new concerns in the 
development zones. Development zones should depend mainly on a 
well-developed and healthy investment environment to attract 
foreign investors, and may not formulate their own preferential 
policies at the expense of national interests.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- An official from the 
People's Bank of China said here today that the provisional 
regulations on the exchange settlement, surrender and payment 
have been formulated to ensure an ample supply of foreign 
exchange by the central bank in order to realize the 
convertibility of renminbi under current accounts, which is 
central to the reform of China's financial system. 
  The regulations were issued on December 29, 1993. 
  According to the regulations, all foreign exchange receipts, 
except those held by foreign-funded enterprises, foreign loans 
and foreign exchange for debt servicing and exchanges in the 
hands of individuals, must be surrendered to the state banks and 
if they need foreign exchange for import and export and other 
purposes, they have to buy it in the exchange market. 
  The regulations say that foreign-funded enterprises may 
retain their foreign exchange receipts. They may sell or buy 
them at the foreign exchange swap market.

  [Text] Beijing, March 27 (XINHUA) -- China's Ministry of 
Finance and the State Economic and Trade Commission launched 
China's first credit guarantee firm here yesterday. 
  This is the government's latest move to safeguard the 
repayment of bank loans and investment capital while guiding 
investment to flow in the desired direction. 
  China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation (CNIGC), 
with a registered capital of 500 million yuan and 18 million 
U.S. dollars in its foreign currency fund, is poised to provide 
credit guarantees for investments required by new and hi-tech 
industry and for technical renovation. 
  In addition, the corporation will invest directly in 
industrial projects and provide feasibility studies and 
consulting services. 
  The guarantee business will be more or less policy-oriented, 
said Jiang Lemin, CNIGC's president, as new and hi-tech projects 
in any case need strong support from the government. 
  But the rest of the corporation's business will be conducted 
to make profits, to ensure that CNIGC will have greater 
guarantee powers. 
  At present, CNIGC can only provide credit guarantees for a 
maximum 5 billion yuan, or ten times the amount of its capital 
fund, Jiang noted. 
  He stressed that CNIGC's potential clients will encompass 
all 
kinds of enterprises, including foreign-funded and private ones.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "State Acts To Protect Its </F>
Shares"] 
  [Text] China is tightening the management of State-owned 
shares of stock in an effort to stop the drain of State assets. 
  Closer scrutiny will be given to those State enterprises 
that 
are transformed into shareholding companies according to an 
official with the National Administrative Bureau of State-owned 
Property. 
  Early this month the bureau issued an opinion specifying 
that 
the administrative departments managing State property at all 
levels are in charge of State shares. 
  According to the bureau's formal opinion, the country's 
first 
document in this field, these departments will be involved in 
all the important steps in converting a State enterprise into a 
shareholding company. This includes evaluating assets, 
specifying property rights, setting the prices of newly issued 
shares, and appointing the institutions to act as 
representatives of State-owned shares. 
  The bureau also said that the State property administration 
departments, along with other government departments and 
institutions, can also act as representatives of State-owned 
shares if authorized by local governments. 
  Zheng Li, division chief of the bureau's Enterprise 
Department said the State will incur big losses if State shares 
are not protected as the wave of shareholding conversions builds 
up. She noted that most of the transformed enterprises are 
mainstays of an industry, a region, or even the entire country. 
  "The biggest headache in the shareholding companies is that 
many companies' State-owned shares do not have responsible 
representatives," Zheng said. 
  Generally, if a State enterprise is converting to 
shareholding, the local State property administration department 
will appoint the enterprise's president as the representative of 
State shares in the new company. 
  But, Zheng said, most such representatives are not very 
responsible, resulting in unfair treatment of State-owned shares. 
  Since the representatives have no direct stake in the State 
property, Zheng said, State-owned shares are not allocated the 
bonus shares and dividends they are due. 
  Meanwhile, Zheng said, many representatives who are 
conscious 
of the need to protect State property, don't know how to 
exercise their duties. 
  Others, though, simply infringe on the rights of individual 
shareholders. For example, they personally appoint members of 
the board without proper election by shareholders. 
  Now, Zheng said, institutions will replace individuals as 
representatives of State shares. Zheng said that since 
institutions will be responsible to the State, she hopes they 
will ensure better treatment of State shares. 
  Zheng said the bureau's formal opinion is also intended to 
standardize the procedures for establishing shareholding 
companies, since many businesses converting to shareholding do 
not know how to deal with State assets. 
  Zheng said the bureau's opinion can guide State property 
administrative departments in managing this area and enterprises 
in switching to shareholding.

  [Text] Police were out in force as thousands of investors 
flocked to Beijing's first public share issue yesterday morning, 
aiming to avert a repeat of the stock riots which rocked 
Shenzhen in August 1992. 
  More than 300 specially designated banks and credit 
co-operatives were open yesterday, each selling lottery tickets 
for one of four stocks on offer in the one billion yuan (about 
HK$885 million) [Hong Kong dollars] issue. 
  The four companies offering shares are Beijing Department 
Store, Beijing Town and Country Trade Centre, Beiren Co, and 
Beijing Light Bus Co. 
  Eager investors started queuing for tickets about 6 am and 
while some pushing and shoving was reported when the doors 
opened at 9 am, the sale went ahead without serious incidents. 
  Public security officers and municipal officials were 
stationed at each of the issuing locations to maintain order 
following a massive government propaganda campaign last week 
designed to convince residents that everyone had an equal chance 
to buy shares. 
  "We have done everything in our power to make sure this 
event 
goes off smoothly," a city government official said yesterday. 
  "We have certainly learned from the experience of Shenzhen 
and are confident this issue will be a success." 
  Prospectuses for the four state-run enterprises issuing 
shares were printed in the BEIJING DAILY newspaper, with 
detailed explanations of the lottery system and warnings that 
stock prices could go down as well as up. 
  Sale of lottery tickets will take three days, after which 
drawing of the winning tickets will be shown on television and 
the results published in newspapers. 
  Most potential investors interviewed yesterday were happy 
with the lottery system which requires buyers to place a 200 
yuan, six-month deposit at the bank for each ticket, but some 
felt the system still could be open to abuse. 
  The Beijing Department Store, located in the city's premier 
Wangfujing shopping district, will issue 50 million shares, but 
analysts said it was doubtful if the stock would prove popular. 
Although the store, built in 1955, had a sales volume of 1.1 
billion yuan last year analysts say it suffers from poor 
management and the building needs renovation. 
  The Beijing Town and Country Trade Centre, on the other 
hand, 
is likely to attract considerable investor interest. 
  The massive department store located at Gongzhufen serves 
the 
rapidly growing residential area of western Beijing and last 
year recorded profits of 52 million yuan. 
  Town and Country also plans to issue 50 million shares and 
analysts expect the issue to be oversubscribed. 
  Another sought-after stock will be Beiren Co. China's 
largest 
printing machinery producer, which successfully listed 100 
million shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange last July. 
  The fourth stock is Beijing Light Bus Co. which produces 17 
percent of all China's mini-buses and last year made profits of 
22.3 million yuan. 
  Beijing Light Bus plans to issue 40 million shares and 
invest 
the capital raised in renovation of its ageing plant.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- More than 200 experts 
from both at home and abroad will meet in Beijing in May to 
discuss issues concerning the protection of intellectual 
property rights [IPR], announced Zhao Damou, chairman of the 
board of the Zhongcheng Intellectual Property Right Protection 
Service Co. Ltd. here today. 
  The symposium will be co-sponsored by the China Intellectual 
Property Right Society, the China Copyright Society and the 
Zhongcheng Intellectual Property Right Protection Service Co. 
Ltd. 
  The representatives will come from the U.S.A., Japan, the 
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and some European countries. 
  Cai Cheng, chairman of the organizing committee of the 
meeting and member of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress, said that China has improved its own legal 
system regarding intellectual property right protection and has 
brought it into line with international practice. 
  He said that if an overseas company found its intellectual 
property rights infringed upon, it could file a complaint with a 
Chinese court in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations, 
Cai said. 
  He said that China has attracted more investors by the 
strength of its open policy and reform process. 
  "In order to maintain the legal rights and interests of 
overseas investors and other intellectual property rights 
owners," Cai said, "the Chinese Government has promulgated a 
series of laws, regulations and rules." 
  China adopted the Copyright Law in 1991, enforced the new 
Patent Law at the beginning of last year, and passed the Law on 
Trademarks in March of last year. 
  China has also opened special courts in Shenzhen, Beijing 
and 
Shanghai cities and Hainan and Fujian Provinces, to handle cases 
involving intellectual property rights. 
  Moreover, China has acceded to the world intellectual 
property right organization as well as a series of multilateral 
accords, including the Paris pact on industrial property right 
protection, the Madrid agreement concerning the international 
registration of trademarks, the patent cooperation treaty, and 
the Bern Convention for the protection of literary and artistic 
works.

"More on the Two Conferences: Taking the Overall Situation Into 
Consideration in 1994"] 
  [Text] A series of economic structural reform plans, 
especially that for the tax-sharing system, have deeply touched 
the deep-level issue of the interest relationship between the 
central authorities and various localities. This topic 
inevitably became the focus of discussion of central leaders and 
local officials at the recent "two sessions" [National People's 
Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference]. Against this background, the repeated calls of 
major newspapers in Beijing for subordination to the overall 
situation and strengthening macro regulation and control have 
attracted even greater attention. 
  While attending National People's Congress deputies group 
discussions as an observer, this reporter often heard officials 
from underdeveloped areas ask the central authorities for 
preferential investment and taxation policies, and officials 
from developed areas also expressed their hope that the central 
authorities would continue to "provide water for breeding fish" 
and allow their localities to retain more revenue. The central 
authorities, for their part, stressed that the most important 
thing was for the whole nation to be of one mind, push forward 
reform, establish the relevant mechanisms, and act in accordance 
with the laws of the market. The central government repeatedly 
stressed the necessity of controlling the growth rate and the 
scale of capital construction, while a few local officials 
continued to talk about grand capital construction plans a great 
deal. 
  Should the whole nation be of one mind and be subordinate to 
the overall situation? Or should the whole nation, like last 
year, blindly compete for more construction projects and 
investment and be overeager for quick success and instant 
benefits, ignoring the impossibility of supplying funds and 
materials, causing an imbalance in supplies, finance, credit, 
and foreign exchange, further deteriorating inflation, seriously 
affecting the improvement of comprehensive results, and landing 
the economic development in a strange "hot" and "cold" cycle? 
This question gives various localities much food for thought. 
  The reform of the financial, taxation, banking, and 
investment structure has extensively touched upon many 
deep-level difficult problems in ideological concepts, the 
readjustment of interests, and specific operations. It has 
involved the issue of readjusting the interest pattern by 
breaking barriers between departments and between regions and 
has addressed sensitive questions, such as the redefinition of 
the scope of macro regulation and control, the scientific 
division of the limits of authority in economic management 
between the central government and local governments, and so on. 
How can the strengthening of the central authorities' economic 
management authority be ensured and can various kinds of power 
in macro regulation and control be concentrated in the central 
authorities while continuing to give play to the enthusiasm of 
both the central authorities and various localities? This is a 
problem which has not been properly solved ever since the 
founding of New China and which has not yet been completely 
solved despite attempts since the beginning of reform. 
  In view of the serious consequences of the overheated 
economy 
last year, rational Chinese have come to understand: Strict 
control over the scale of fixed assets investment has a bearing 
on the overall situation of reform, development, and stability 
this year. 
  The central government hopes to benignly integrate results 
with speed and build a market pattern with a unified standard by 
formulating and promulgating the "Budget Law" to strengthen 
macro regulation and control and to control the scale of capital 
construction and the speed of construction in various 
localities. Another means of macro regulation and control is the 
tax-sharing system. According to the financial budget this 
year, 75 percent of the value-added tax in various localities 
shall be handed over to the central financial departments, and 
this means the amount of taxes handed over to the state will 
grow as speed increases. This move should result in more 
effective macro regulation and control. 
  What is worthy of attention is that, according to the 
financial minister's report, after the implementation of the 
tax-sharing system, the growth rate of local financial revenue 
will be higher than that of the central authorities, half of the 
central financial revenue will be returned to the localities, 
and the central authorities will not take away large amount of 
financial resources from the localities. Therefore, local 
governments have no reason not to favor the tax-sharing system. 
  This year, reform is facing a severe test. The situation 
also demands the establishment of a sense of taking the overall 
situation into consideration and demands a strengthening of the 
central government's authority. This is because reform is no 
longer characterized by spontaneously moving forward from bottom 
to top and delegating power and interests from top to bottom; it 
has moved on to unified coordination and organized 
implementation from top to bottom. The process of reform has 
changed from moving one single item after another forward and 
conducting operations in batches to moving forward as a whole 
and making breakthroughs around focal points. The establishment 
of a sense of the overall situation is more necessary, and the 
way to guide reform is shifting more and more from pushing 
forward with policies to pushing forward with laws. It is 
precisely this point that requires local officials to understand 
that the central leaders have really given a great deal of 
thought to stressing the establishment of the market economic 
mechanism as the most important thing. They should not worry 
about gains and losses that have resulted from preferential 
policies, and it is also necessary to strengthen macro 
regulation and control to do away with the practice of being 
small but complete, to break regional monopolies, to give play 
to the strong points of various localities, and to develop the 
entire economy in a coordinated manner. 
  Adopting the policy of subordination to the overall 
situation 
and strengthening macro regulation and control do not mean a 
return to the old path of the planned economy; rather, they mean 
that the entire nation, with one mind and one goal, will 
establish the operational mechanism of the socialist market 
economy, and the central government will more effectively give 
play to the means of macro regulation and control to ensure that 
the entire economy will develop in a sustained, healthy, and 
stable [chi xu jian kang wen ding 2170 4958 0256 1660 4489 1353] 
manner.

  [Text] Yichang, March 28 (XINHUA) -- Since February this 
year, China has started work to harness a dangerous rock 
formation within the Three Gorges area on the middle reaches of 
the Chang Jiang river where a huge water-control project is to 
be built. 
  Containment measures are being pursued with the aim of 
ensuring safe navigation through the Three Gorges area and 
protecting the projected reservoir. 
  The rockface, nicknamed the "Huangla Stone" with a total 
volume of 40 million cu m, is located at the juncture of the 
Xiling and Xixia gorges and is only 64 km away from the area 
where the gigantic water control dam is to be built. 
  According to experts, the rocky outcrop is the most 
dangerous 
spot in the Three Gorges, with increasingly frequent slippage 
and poor stability in the main body of the rock heightening 
concerns over the past few years. Extended rains or a jarring 
earthquake in the region would be likely to cause the Huangla 
Stone to fall into the Chang Jiang river, triggering waves as 
high as 20-80 m to surge along the river. 
  Moreover, if the rock happens to break loose, it will not 
only destroy the Badong County seat and nearby villages and 
farmland, but also block the entire navigable route of the 
Yangtze, bringing navigation of ships in the area to a 
standstill. In addition, several million tons of silt may 
follow the landslide into the Yangtze, further worsening water 
pollution in the river, said the experts. 
  The State Council, China's central government, has attached 
great attention to the harnessing of the dangerous rock. Before 
the official launching of containment work, experts from nine 
national organizations were recruited to carry out research on 
the feasibility of harnessing the rock. 
  According to Qu Xingyuan, chief of the headquarters in 
charge 
of Huangla Stone harnessing, they have adopted the method of 
building drainage projects on the surface of the ground and 
below the ground, in a bid to improve and enhance the stability 
of the rock. 
  In nearby areas where landslides are most likely to occur, 
facilities with the functions of holding water back from the 
surfaces and draining water from inside have also been built to 
forestall landslides. 
  So far, more than 500 workers have taken on the harnessing 
work, digging out 5,500 cu m of earth and building 2,300 m of 
drainage canals. The first-phase harnessing work is expected to 
be completed in May.

  [Text] China's largest construction project, which forms 
the backbone to its ambitious energy development programme at 
the controversial Three Gorges Dam project, was brought to a 
standstill by a two-week wildcat strike this month at a remote 
site in Sichuan province. Thousands of workers at the US$3.7 
billion (HK$28.5 billion) Ertan Dam project on the lower reaches 
of the Yalong River in southwestern China were involved in the 
strike that ended on March 15, the SUNDAY MORNING POST has 
learned. Officials at the plant, who declined to be named, 
confirmed the strike had ended but refused to provide further 
details. The project, perhaps the largest foreign joint venture 
in China, is a partnership between German companies Philipp 
Holzmann and Hochtief AG, together with Ge Zhou Ba (Chinese Dam 
Company). Sources say at least two of the partners are bidding 
on work at Three Gorges. 
  The bitter labour dispute, which has not been mentioned in 
the official Chinese media, illustrates the kind of widespread 
worker unrest raging across the country. Official Chinese 
sources have confirmed 10,000 industrial actions nationwide in 
1993. Despite a vigorous campaign to curtail illicit labour 
groups, including the arrest of suspected leaders, direct action 
by workers is gaining popularity. "There is clearly widespread, 
spontaneous industrial unrest emerging in China," Robin Munro, 
director of Human Rights Watch/Asia (formerly Asia Watch) said. 
"These are wildcat strikes, not organised actions." A 
crackdown on labour groups has widened in recent months to 
single out worker leaders, according to a new Human Rights Watch 
report, China: New Arrests Linked To Worker Rights. The report 
details the cases of four labour organisers arrested this month, 
with three -- Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbin and Wang Jiaqi -- 
still in custody. 
  A U.S. State Department official told the SUNDAY MORNING 
POST 
that worker leaders had come under increasing government 
scrutiny since the crushing of the student democracy movement in 
1989. Documents released by Human Rights Watch suggest the 
grassroots network of labour activists in China is developing 
into a more cohesive organisation. A group calling itself the 
League for the Protection of the Rights of the Working People of 
the People's Republic of China released a five-point petition on 
workers' rights. Among the demands were: the establishment of a 
nationwide worker network offering information and support 
services; an arbitration system to settle labour disputes; 
protection of worker rights; the right of peasants to form 
unions; the public declaration of the income of officials, all 
the way up to the Politburo leadership; protection of migrant 
workers; workers in joint ventures receiving the right to form 
unions and conduct collective bargaining. 
  Mr Munro said labour activists, although small in number, 
were beginning to form a formidable network. "Rather than 
espouse more abstract notions of democracy, many of them are now 
talking about worker rights and labour concerns." Under a 1992 
law, collective bargaining in China is only permitted by workers 
in private enterprises, which involve less than five per cent of 
the Chinese workforce. All labour activity by law must be 
through the government-controlled All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions. 
  At Ertan Dam, workers risk their lives daily in gruelling 
conditions for the equivalent of $200 to $300 per month. The 
massive excavation project has been plagued by industrial 
accidents. Many workers have been killed. Workers at the plant 
had reportedly been promised bonuses for speeding up work on the 
dam and to complete a water diversion tunnel before the arrival 
of Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua. The dispute was sparked 
when payments were less than workers expected. It was resolved 
only after salaries were raised to $300 to $400 per month, a 
source said. Costs for the massive Three Gorges Dam project 
were estimated to be at least 50 billion yuan in 1990. 
  Philipp Holzmann, among the world's largest construction 
companies, was recently among the bidders for a share of the 
work on the West Kowloon Expressway.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "State Industries Are Left Out of the </F>
Boom"] 
  [Text] China seems a paradox: The backbone State 
industries are hemorrhaging money, yet the economy has remained 
buoyant. 
  This sharp contrast has given rise to speculation that China 
may well fail to sustain its economic momentum in the long run. 
  But a senior Chinese economist believes a quick fix is at 
hand. 
  "And, it's no surprise to see enterprises deep in trouble as 
our economy is in a transition from a planned to a market one," 
said Li Wuwei, a professor at the Shanghai Academy of Social 
Sciences. 
  The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) has maintained 
double- digit expansion in about three consecutive years. 
Meantime, State enterprises have watched their profits slide. 
  About one-third of State industrial enterprises are running 
in the red, siphoning off 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) in 
subsidies from the government each year. 
  How so? 
  "The profits of State industries have been squeezed by 
higher 
production costs resulting from soaring prices of raw 
materials," Li explained. 
  Take Shanghai, for example. The city's State enterprises 
spent an extra 8 billion yuan ($920 million) in the late 1980s 
to offset higher prices for raw materials. 
  But these enterprises recouped only 7 billion yuan ($800 
million) even after raising prices for their own products. 
  Thus they faced a deficit of 1 billion yuan ($115 million). 
At the same time, though, the raw material sector profited by 
the same amount. 
  Li says that 15 to 20 percent of the revenue of the city's 
State industrial enterprises went into the hands of the raw 
material and transportation sectors, which had raised their 
prices by a huge margin. 
  Still another 30 per cent of revenue was absorbed by the 
service sector, including banks, insurance companies and 
advertisement agencies. 
  Incomplete statistics show that the service trade made up 38 
percent of the city's GDP last year, compared with only 25 
percent 10 years before. 
  Higher wages have also reduced the profit margins of State 
enterprises. 
  Despite the price increases for raw materials, State 
enterprises in many cases cannot raise the prices of their 
products freely. 
  For instance, the prices of oil products cannot be raised 
even though a big increase in crude oil prices is due in a few 
months. 
  State industries had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, 
when the prices of raw materials were kept artificially low by 
rigid central planning. The service trade was almost 
nonexistent. 
  But at the same time the enterprises, unlike those in 
Western 
countries, were responsible for the welfare of their employees. 
  This was once deemed the superiority of socialism. 
  "A shrinking profit margin due to the booming raw material 
and service sectors is not the real threat to State industrial 
enterprises because the latter can adjust their products' prices 
over time," Li said. 
  "The real way out now is to relieve the enterprises of the 
extra burden by setting up a sound social insurance system.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 26 (XINHUA) -- China now has more 
than 50 ports handling container traffic. 
  The total number of container berths has gone up to over 30, 
with a total handling capacity of three million standard 
containers. 
  So far, the country has more than 860 scheduled container 
liners to over 100 countries and regions around the world. The 
total throughput of the containers traffic last year reached 3.8 
million units. 
  In Tianjin, north China's biggest port city, eight container 
berths have been built, capable of handling more than one 
million containers yearly, over one-third of the country's total. 
  It also has opened several container shipping routes leading 
to North America, northwest Europe, Australia and the Persian 
Gulf, running 112 scheduled voyages every month. 
  As one main terminal of the Eurasian continental bridge (a 
Eurasian railway from Lianyungang port in Jiangsu Province, east 
China, to Rotterdam of the Netherlands), which went into 
operation three years ago, the Tianjin port has sent out or 
received through it more than 3,000 standard containers yearly. 
  Currently, China has more than 1,000 container railway 
carriages, and 23 percent of its highways can handle containers.

  [Text] Beijing, March 27 (XINHUA) -- Approved by State 
Council departments, a state-level industrial demonstration zone 
will be set up in the new port city of Fangchenggang in 
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  The zone is aimed to help the region eliminate abject 
poverty 
by improving laborers' general qualities and increasing their 
income. 
  China has set a target of wiping out abject poverty among 
its 
80 million poverty-stricken people by the year of 2000. 
  The Fengchenggang Zone is the first of the kind set up by 
the 
state, according to today's "PEOPLE'S DAILY". 
  Officials from the State Council office in charge of aid-the 
poor projects and the World Bank have arrived in the city on a 
study tour. 
  A special loan will be granted by the World Bank for the 
construction of the zone which is designated to cover four 
square kilometers. 
  Preferential policies will be given to the zone to attract 
both domestic and overseas investors. 
  Workers employed on the zone's projects must come from the 
region's poor areas. They will start work after training in the 
job center in the zone.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Increasing farmers' 
income and farm produce supply are the most important jobs of 
China's rural work in 1994, Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang 
said here today. 
  Speaking at the ministry's meeting, Liu said the ministry 
will do its utmost to raise farmers' income and ensure a supply 
of farm produce to meet domestic demands. 
  He said that the efforts will contribute to the country's 
efforts to control inflation and maintain sustainable, rapid and 
healthy economic development. 
  In China, the situation in agricultural production is 
considered vital to the country's economy and everyday life of 
its people, since no other country could provide the enormous 
amount of farm produce China needs. 
  Also listed on the ministry's agenda for this year are the 
promotion of the country's rural and township enterprises and 
deepening of rural reform, such as extension of farmland 
contract tenure and promotion of rural share-holding systems, a 
new business management form popular in China's rural areas. 
  The ministry also vowed to coordinate with other government 
departments to ensure that the central government's rural 
policies are implemented, including the government's decision to 
finance the 550 counties selected by the government as key 
market-oriented grain and cotton production centers. 
  According to sources from the ministry, total acreage under 
agricultural crops throughout China is expected to increase this 
year over last year. But the amount of farmland used for grain 
production is estimated at less than the state plan, mainly 
because less wheat was sown over the previous year. 
  However, total rape-growing areas have been increased by a 
big margin over those of last year and a bumper harvest is in 
sight. 
  The areas sown in cotton in China's major cotton-producing 
regions also exceeded acreage for the previous year, sources 
from the ministry said.

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY commentary: "Farm Aid"] </F>
  [Text] On the very first day after the conclusion of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top Party leadership 
convened its second rural work conference within six months, a 
sure sign that shows commitment to improving agricultural 
conditions. 
  Agriculture serves as the pillar of national economic 
development and social stability. Its steadfast growth is of 
particular importance this year now that the nation is 
endeavouring to balance reform, development and stability -- the 
theme of the NPC session. Only with a healthy agriculture can 
stability last, which in turn facilitates reform and development. 
  This is a rule the Chinese Government and people have sought 
out after repeated success and failure in history. For whenever 
agricultural production expands and the peasants see their lives 
improved, there is social stability, and reforms are carried 
forward smoothly. Stagnant farm production, however, will send 
inflation soaring and squeeze the economy out of proportion. 
  China's sheer population size determines that it has to rely 
on itself to secure a solid food supply. 
  The issue is all the more important now because grain 
producing capacity is not much more than the nation's food 
consumption. It is not only the traditional cereal producing 
bases that ought to strive for an increasing output, but the 
relatively developed coastal regions should also set aside a 
stable acreage for grain and adequate food storage. 
  The central government should build its own food reservoir 
and set up a special-purpose national fund to regulate grain 
production and circulation. 
  The supply of non-staple food, vegetables in particular, is 
the single most important factor that directly affects average 
urbanites' lives and is an essential element behind inflation. 
The central government's decision to designate city mayors to 
take full charge of non-staple food supply and ensure stable 
prices is a crucial measure to hold inflation at bay. 
  As for farmers, the most pressing task is to help them earn 
more. The last decade of reform has enabled output to increase 
steadily but failed to augment farmers' income correspondingly 
in many regions, resulting in a widening gap between urban and 
rural residents. 
  Modernization is impossible if three-quarters of the 
population remain poor. 
  The government needs to increase its agricultural 
investment, 
raise grain procurement prices, ensure the supply of farm 
materials and machinery, provide information and organize 
services to farmers, and ensure no levies in addition to State 
taxes and the authorized collective charges are imposed on 
farmers. 
  The long-term and fundamental way to increase their income, 
however, lies in transferring surplus rural labour to 
non-agricultural undertakings. This would leave farm hands with 
larger plots to cultivate on the one hand and migrant workers 
with more opportunities to show their talents on the other. 
  New reforms are indispensable. Local governments, in the 
light of their conditions, may experiment with transferring the 
use rights of idle land to capable farmers, reshape rural 
businesses in the form of the share-based co-operative system, 
and restructure rural financial and banking networks. 
  The national and regional legislatures should supervise the 
execution of existing laws and formulate new ones to guarantee 
that agricultural development goes along a regulated, legal 
track. 
  Tough and protracting as the job is, the country has 
actually 
no other alternative but to work concertedly to advance rural 
development. A robust agriculture in a nation with one-fifth of 
the world's population not only underwrites a stable environment 
for domestic growth but also contributes greatly to world peace 
and development.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Farmers, Following the Cash, </F>
Plant More Cotton, Less Grain"] 
  [Text] This spring, Chinese farmers are seeding more 
fields with cotton but cutting wheat-producing acreage, the 
State Statistics Bureau says. 
  Since farmers are devoting more of their land to cash crops, 
the bureau's economists say, this year's grain output may not 
outstrip the record yield of 1993. 
  According to the bureau's latest survey of 9,730 big 
agricultural villages across the country, this spring 
cotton-planting acreage rose to 5.33 million hectares, up 6.3 
percent from the same period of 1993. 
  Much of the original grain-planting land is now being used 
for cotton as farmers respond to the government's call for 
greater cotton production, Huang Bingxin, an economist with the 
bureau's General Organization of Rural Socio-Economic Survey, 
told Business Weekly. 
  "The grain production might stand at around 450 million tons 
this year," he added. 
  This spring, the country's total cereal-sowing acreage 
dropped by 0.6 percent from a year ago, but the acreage planted 
with legume and potato rose by 4.7 percent and 0.3 percent, 
respectively. 
  Huang explained that the government also considers legumes 
and potatoes part of the country's grain catalogue. 
  But, Huang predicts that this spring the gross grain and 
cash 
crop acreage will not be smaller than last year's, which was 
176,600 hectares less than 1992 because of rural 
industrialization. 
  The country devoted 110.4 million hectares to growing grain 
and cash crops last year, he added. 
  Of the grain acreage, fields planted with rice and wheat 
shrank this year by 0.5 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. 
  However, maize fields grew by 0.5 percent, and Chinese 
sorghum acreage jumped by 12.8 percent. 
  In order to ensure higher cotton output, the State has set a 
target of seeding at least 6 million hectares with cotton this 
year. 
  Henan Province, the country's leading cotton producer, has 
raised its cotton purchase price to 370 to 450 yuan ($42.50 to 
$51.72) per 50 to stimulate production. 
  Meanwhile, farmers in the province also foresaw a profitable 
year with expanded cotton production. This followed two 
consecutive years of shrinking cotton output that reduced the 
country's supply and forced up retail prices. 
  In Henan, the cotton acreage exceeds 1 million hectares, up 
4.5 per cent from a year ago. The cotton acreage in Xinjiang 
Uygur Autonomous Region, another major cotton producer, also 
increased this spring, by 17 percent from a year earlier. 
  The bureau's figures also show that the acreage for edible 
oil crops increased by 666,700 hectares from last year, 
tobacco-growing lands dropped by 333,300 hectares and vegetable 
planting farmland grew by more than 266,600 hectares. 
  Sugar-planting fields remained at the same level as last 
year, 1.73 million hectares.

  [Text] Beijing, March 27 (XINHUA) -- China now has more 
than 800,000 scientists and technical workers active in 
development and research in agricultural technology. 
  This is part of the effort by Chinese scientists in recent 
years to develop farm products and technology, invigorate the 
country's agriculture and bolster the economy's growth. 
  Great achievements have been made in fertilizers, 
pesticides, 
breeding of crops and domestic animals, and processing and 
storage of farm products. 
  Changes in farm patterns, economic structures and 
development 
modes, as well as in the thinking of farmers, are all attributed 
to the development in technology. 
  Figures from a government department show that about 16.8 
percent of the country's total scientific awards at national 
level last year were given to research projects in agriculture, 
stock raising and the fishing industry. 
  These projects not only help tackle the technical problems 
in 
agricultural production, but also contribute to bettering 
people's life in rural areas. 
  In east China, over 1,000 scientists from more than 100 
different bodies have been involved in a development and 
research project to deal with the problem of low production in 
the plains of the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe Rivers. 
  In the past eight years, some 81 of the 134 results they 
have 
achieved have been put into use. In some experimental areas, 
the annual grain output reached 15,000 kilograms per hectare.

  [Text] Yinchuan, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Afforestation by 
aerial seeding has proved to a big success in China as it has 
turn many barren mountains green and brought about tremendous 
ecological and economic benefits. 
  According to the Ministry of Forestry, the country has 
afforested 9.6 million ha by aerial seeding during the past 12 
years, exceeding the total of the previous 23 years. 
  The country's average survival rate under aerial seeding has 
increased by 22 percent in the same period. 
  At present, a large-scale aerial seeding has been conducted 
in 700 counties of the country's 25 provinces and autonomous 
regions. 
  Aerial seeding has been further expanded northward, becoming 
the world's first success in aerial seeding in areas with annual 
precipitation lower than 100 mm. 
  Aerial seeding has also proven fruitful in northern China's 
sandy land and deserts as well as in some freezing high altitude 
areas in southwest China's Sichuan Province. 
  Seeds of various broadleaf trees and arbors have been used 
in 
aerial seeding instead of the original single type. 
  Thanks to the principle of spreading the operation in 
conjunction with experiments, aerial seeding techniques have 
been implemented quickly and effectively in many barren or sandy 
areas beset by windstorms, sandstorms and serious soil erosion. 
  Statistics show that aerial seeding has saved the country's 
ten percent of sandy land from the invasion of deserts with 
40,000 sq k of barren land now covered with trees. 
  Aerial seeding has played an important role in afforestation 
in north China's shelterbelt project, known as Great Green Wall. 
A stretch of 540,000 ha of forest has brought green to sandy 
areas in northwest, north and northeast China through aerial 
seeding. 
  Aerial seeding not only makes the afforestation possible in 
remote high or stony mountains and deserts but also surpasses 
manual afforestation with lower costs, minimal labor demands, 
higher speed, larger scale and higher survival rate. 
  To better conduct aerial seeding, the central government 
earmarks large amounts of funds each year for the project. 
Permanent stations have been set up for tree management and 
protection work in provinces where regular aerial seeding is 
conducted. 
  China airlines and the air unit of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army have both actively supported the aerial seeding 
activity all over the country. 
  China's aerial seeding has taken the lead in the world in 
both efficiency and technology and has attracted experts from 
more than 40 countries and regions of the world and from 
international organizations.

  [Text] United Nations, March 28 (XINHUA) -- China's family 
planning had been a cause of concern to the world, a Chinese 
representative told the Population Commission which opened its 
twenty-seventh session today. 
  In explaining why such efforts were necessary, Peng Yu, 
vice-director of the National Family Planning Committee, said by 
the end of last year China's population was more than 1.18 
billion. The number of women at reproductive age was more than 
324 million or 27 percent of the population. 
  But China's arable land was only 7 percent of the world's 
total, it had to support 22 percent of the world's people, Peng 
said. 
  China's population had to live within the country, she went 
on. Unlike the situation which had prevailed in Europe during 
its industrial revolution, China could not ease its population 
pressure by diverting large populations to other continents. 
  Rapid population growth had led to sharp reductions of 
arable 
land and over-exploitation of resources and aggravated 
environmental pollution, she continued. As its basic national 
policy since the late 1970s China adopted family planning to 
control population quantity and improve its quality in terms of 
health and education. The aim was to accelerate socio-economic 
development. 
  Peng summarized the main points of China's current family 
planning policy: to promote late marriage and later, fewer 
births; to advocate the practice of "one couple, one child," to 
persuade rural couples who wished for second children to have 
proper spacing; and to let the governments of autonomous regions 
or provinces inhabited by national minorities decide their 
family planning needs according to local conditions.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zheng Jian: "Romania, Russia Sign Military </F>
Accord"] 
  [Text] Bucharest, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Romania and Russia 
have signed a long-awaited accord on military cooperation, 
giving a fresh impetus to bilateral relations and heralding the 
resumption of cooperation between the armed forces of the two 
countries. 
  The document, initialled by the countries' top military 
officials last July, was formally signed by Romanian Defense 
Minister Gheorghe Tinca and his Russian counterpart Pavel 
Grachev here on Monday [28 March]. 
  The traditional ties between the armed forces of Romania and 
the former Soviet Union have gone through twists and turns in 
recent years. 
  Previously cemented in the Warsaw Pact, they hit rock bottom 
with the dissolution of the eastern military bloc and the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, and plummeted further in the 
summer of 1992, when a bloody ethnic conflict flared up between 
Moldovan troops and mainly Russian-speaking national guards of 
the breakaway Dnestr River region. Historically and ethnically, 
Moldova, where a majority of the population speak Romanian, has 
had close relations with Romania. 
  However, a thaw in the relations took place last July when 
Romania's chief of the general staff visited Russia and 
initialled the military cooperation accord with the Russians. 
  But some later incidents including the bloody clash between 
the Russian Government and rebel parliamentarians in Moscow and 
the invectives by Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
against Romania forced Grachev to postpone his visit time and 
again. 
  The eventual realization of the trip, Tinca said, indicated 
the end of the most difficult period in bilateral relations. 
  The accord envisages a restoration and expansion of 
cooperation in military training, armament and military science. 
  The media here appeared more interested in the cooperation 
in 
the area of military materiel, disclosing Romania is in dire 
need of upgrading its Soviet-made military equipment and 
importing parts from Moscow to keep it working. 
  After the signing ceremony, the two defense ministers said 
that the accord would help promote mutual trust between the two 
countries, and contribute to stability in Eastern Europe and to 
security in Europe as a whole. 
  During a meeting with Grachev, Romanian Foreign Minister 
Teodor Melescanu said Romania's security not only depends on the 
Partnership for Peace relationship with the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO), but also on Russia's domestic 
situation and Romanian-Russian relations. 
  The press here said that a once prevailing strategic 
thinking 
in Romania's diplomacy, which stands for bilateral cooperation 
with both Russia and the West for the sake of the country's own 
national security, is still applicable nowadays. 
  Since 1989, Romania has signed as many as 15 military 
cooperation accords with its neighboring and Western countries. 
  Grachev and Tinca agreed that the significance of the accord 
has gone beyond the military area, as the document represented 
part of the efforts to foster many-sided cooperation between the 
two countries. 
  The signing of the accord has also paved the way for Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to visit Romania, they said.

  [Text] New York, March 28 (XINHUA) -- The American 
Depositary Receipts (ADRS) for Shanghai Chlor-Alkali Chemical 
Co., Ltd have started trading in the United States, according to 
Xu Rxongyi, chairman of the company here today. 
  "We believe that the potential for our company is enormous," 
Xu told a group of reporters at the Bank of New York, which has 
been selected to act as the depositary for the sponsored level-1 
ADRS of the Shanghai company. 
  The Bank of New York announced on March 21 that Shanghai 
Chlor- Alkali Chemical Company's ADRS were effective and are 
traded in the ratio of one ADR representing ten "B" shares 
traded on Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
  They will trade on the over-the-counter market in the United 
States. 
  The Shanghai company, a Sino-foreign joint stock company 
established in July 1992, produces over 20 kinds of products 
with over 40 different styles of four categories. 
  With the capacity to produce 350,000 tons of caustic soda 
and 
220,000 tons of PVC [polyvinyl chloride], the company's products 
have been exported to over ten countries and regions, such as 
Japan, the United States and Italy. 
  Shanghai Chlor-Alkali's B shares owned by foreign investors 
now represent 34.9 percent of its total shares outstanding. In 
1993, based on international accounting standards, the company's 
total sales were 1.3 billion Chinese yuan and profit after tax 
was 171 million yuan. 
  According to Wu Yalun, vice chairman of the Shanghai Stock 
Exchange, Shanghai Chlor-Alkali now became the third Chinese 
company to have ADRS traded at the U.S. market. He expected 
that there would be more Chinese ADRS to enter the U.S. capital 
market if they perform well.

  [Text] Moscow, March 28 (XINHUA) -- The Russian Defense 
Ministry today refuted the latest batch of media reports 
alleging that it is continuing a program of creating biological 
weapons, including a new "super-plague" to which the West has no 
antidote. 
  A spokesman for the ministry said that some foreign and 
Russian media have quoted an anonymous intelligence source as 
saying the program was under the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  The spokesman said it is astonishing that the story, 
circulated by Western media in search of sensation, was 
thoughtlessly repeated by some Russian mass media organs. 
  "Russia is neither developing nor producing biological 
weapons," the spokesman stated.

  [Text] Kiev, March 27 (XINHUA) -- Ukrainian voters went to 
polls today to elect a 450-member parliament in Ukraine's first 
parliamentary election since its independence in 1991. 
  Under the new electoral law, parliament members are directly 
elected from the country's 450 constituencies and a candidate 
must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win. 
  The new parliament will retain its original name of "Supreme 
Soviet" and the term of office will be four years instead of the 
former five. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, casting his ballot late 
this morning, said he hoped that professionals who favored 
market economic reform and democracy would enter the new 
parliament. 
  Earlier, parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch predicted that the 
new parliament "might not necessarily turn out on March 27," but 
he was confident that the second round of election on April 10 
would be successful. 
  A voter turnout of more than 50 percent is required by the 
law for the validity of election and at least 300 members are 
needed for a quorum. 
  The latest official statistics show 62 percent of the 5,833 
registered candidates in the election run as independents or 
represent collectives. 
  More than one quarter of the candidates have political party 
affiliations though only 11 percent represent parties. 
  Among the 18 parties taking part in the election, the 
Ukrainian Communist Party, the Nationalist Rukh Party and the 
Socialist Party have the most candidates. 
  The election has drawn worldwide attention with 50 countries 
and 11 international organizations having sent their observers 
to Ukraine. 
  Witnesses have reported a smooth ongoing of the polls in 
several constituencies. Initial results are yet to come out.

  [Text] The first national function of entrepreneurs 
successfully concluded in Fuzhou yesterday [25 March]. During 
the function, attendees extensively exchanged views, and 
conscientiously discussed transformation of enterprise 
operational mechanisms, establishment of a modern enterprise 
system, and formation of an entrepreneurs' contingent. They 
stated: It is necessary to continue to carry forward the spirit 
of daring to be the first in the world advocated by 55 factory 
directors and managers 10 years ago to explore the way forward, 
deepen enterprise reform, and speed up the pace of establishing 
a modern enterprise system. 
  Jia Qinglin, provincial CPC committee secretary and 
governor, 
attended and addressed the function. He said: March 24 is a 
day which deserves commemoration by entrepreneurs. Ten years 
ago today, 55 factory directors and managers jointly urged the 
higher authorities to delegate power. They played a promoting 
role in enterprise reform and evoked greater repercussions in 
the society. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, as in various other parts of the country, a 
number of enterprises with good management, high efficiency, and 
vigorous mechanisms have also appeared in Fujian. In 
particular, these enterprises have integrated themselves into 
the market economy in accordance with international practice and 
accumulated experiences for establishing a modern enterprise 
system. This has forcefully promoted sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy. 
  Jia Qinglin pointed out: To invigorate state-owned 
enterprises, medium and large enterprises in particular, the 
fundamental solution lies in deepening reform, transforming 
operational mechanisms, and establishing a modern enterprise 
system. At present, on the one hand, we must grasp well the 
implementation of existing measures. On the other hand, we must 
continue to explore new ways to further enforce enterprise laws 
and regulations, so that enterprises can truly become corporate 
bodies which cater to the needs of the market and main market 
competitors as well. 
  In conclusion, Jia Qinglin hoped that the majority of 
entrepreneurs will continue to carry forward the spirit of 
daring to be the first in the world, and the spirit of 
initiative, self- reliance, self-support, and self-renewal, and 
rely on and unite with the broad masses of workers and staff 
members to explore how to run modern enterprises. CPC 
committees and governments at all levels, relevant departments, 
and various quarters in the society must show concern for, 
support, and cherish entrepreneurs, and create a fine 
environment and conditions for carrying out enterprise reform 
well.

0365): "Taiwan Businessman Sentenced For Being Held Responsible 
for Last Year's Fire"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 27th--Taiwan businessman Mai Tzu-wen was 
found guilty of serious negligence in a fire incident which 
occurred on 13 December last year and sentenced on the 18th of 
this month by Fuzhou City Intermediate People's Court to a 
two-year suspended sentence. The deadline for appeal is 
Tuesday. 
  Around 0400 on 13 December 1993, a fire broke out at a four- 
storey warehouse owned by the Gaofu Textile Company Limited in 
the Fuzhou Mawei Economic and Technological Development Zone, 
killing 61 workers in the warehouse and injuring 15. It was a 
tragedy. After the incident the police investigated the cause 
of the fire and quickly discovered that it was set by a factory 
worker, Dong Yanglin, who has received a death sentence. 
  On 27 January this year, the Fuzhou City People's 
Procuratorate charged Mai Tsu-wen, the legal representative of 
the Gaofu Company and its director and general manager, with 
serious negligence at the city intermediate people's court. 
  It is understood that he was the first Taiwan businessman to 
be sentenced on the mainland following the promulgation and 
implementation of the "PRC Investment Law Protecting Foreign 
Businesses." It is on account of this that relevant authorities 
were very careful in verifying criminal evidence and handing 
down sentences, giving full consideration to the fact that the 
defendant had assisted actively in dealing with the aftermath of 
the fire, and had repented and regretted his crime.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Overseas investors 
have poured more funds into the commercial retail trade of 
Shanghai, the country's largest and most thriving commercial 
center, as part of the effort to further enter China's vast 
domestic retail market. 
  Foreign investors or those from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao 
once were forbidden to invest in the Chinese commercial retail 
business. Trial utilization of foreign funds in this field in 
some large cities including Beijing and Shanghai was approved by 
the State Council only in recent years to meet the growing 
demand of consumers. 
  Since then, Shanghai commercial departments have approved 
300- plus foreign invested retail projects with a total capital 
exceeding one billion U.S. dollars. Investors are from Japan, 
Hong Kong, Taiwan and some transnational corporations. 
  Following the Eastern Shopping Mansion, another large-scale 
complex named the Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center and partly 
funded by Hong Kong investors opened to service recently in 
Shanghai. 
  Equipped with high-standard facilities and stocked with 
world- renowned brands, these shopping centers manage to provide 
elegant and comfortable shopping environments and greater 
selection for those consumers with high income. 
  In order to attract more local wage-earners, the 
newly-opened 
Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center offers affordable daily 
necessities in conjunction with expensive luxuries in its 
beautifully-decorated shopping halls. Its commodities amount to 
more than 30,000 varieties in total. 
  "If you want to make your brands known in China, Shanghai 
can 
help you do it," general manager of the Hongqiao Friendship 
Shopping Center said, which is also what most overseas investors 
in Shanghai's retail business firmly believe.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Fei (0702 2431): "Shanghai Issues </F>
Certificates to Manage Migrant Laborers; 400,000 People Apply 
for 'Labor Certificates'"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 20 Mar (WEN WEI PO)--The department 
concerned of Shanghai Municipal Government will soon issue 
"labor certificates" to over 430,000 laborers from other 
provinces, and the more than 20,000 laborers from other 
provinces who have received "labor certificates" welcomed this 
measure. Shanghai is now actively seeking a better way to solve 
various problems caused by the increasing inflow of a migrant 
population. In 1993, about 2.81 million people came from other 
provinces to Shanghai, and 74.3 percent of these people came to 
seek jobs or do business. People at working ages of 21 to 59 
accounted for 85.3 percent, and construction workers numbered 
760,000. 
  In the past few years, the inflow of the huge migrant 
population caused many problems for Shanghai. In particular, 
before and after the Chinese New Year, the huge tide of migrant 
laborers put heavy pressure on the railway, public security, 
labor, and urban transport departments. Urban residents also 
complained about the consequent inconvenience. On one hand, 
there were a lot of construction projects and commercial 
undertakings in Shanghai, and they needed a large external labor 
force; on the other hand, the inflow of millions of external 
laborers also caused difficulties and problems for city 
management. 
  In late 1993, the public security, civil affairs, railway, 
industrial and commercial administrative, comprehensive 
management, and labor departments of the municipal government 
jointly set up a new organ for managing the external population. 
It then adopted a number of management measures. Recently, 
when the department concerned issued "labor certificates," it 
also issued "blue card" residence certificates to professionals, 
investors, and senior managerial personnel in enterprises. 
  Recently, this reporter visited the Shanghai Municipal 
Office 
for Managing the External Labor Force, which issued the "labor 
certificates" to external laborers in Shanghai. Shen Zhiwei, 
deputy director of the office told this reporter that "labor 
certificates" were mainly issued to workers employed by Shanghai 
enterprises from other localities. The employing institutions 
included state-owned and collective enterprises, joint-stock 
companies, private enterprises, and individual businesses. The 
management office would examine the employment applications and 
labor contracts submitted by the employing institutions in order 
to prevent their paying wages lower than the standards to 
workers from other localities. The issuance of "labor 
certificates" would enable external workers to achieve legal 
working status so their legitimate working rights and interests 
can be guaranteed. At the same time, this would also enable the 
public security and labor departments to more effectively 
exercise management within their jurisdiction. In addition, the 
issuance of "labor certificates" may play a role in curbing the 
inflow of migrant laborers. Because migrant laborers have told 
each other about the new measure, they may be discouraged from 
pouring into the city before they can find jobs. At present, 
"labor certificates" have not been issued to construction 
workers, household assistants, and scattered odd-job workers. 
The department concerned is now considering the method of 
managing such people. Now, some 430,000 people have applied for 
"labor certificates," and the number of applicants will continue 
to increase. The official expected that the work of issuing 
this year's labor certificates would be completed by May. 
  According to the people concerned, along with the 
development 
of Shanghai's construction and the expansion of the urban area, 
a large external population will continue to flow into Shanghai 
for a long time in the future. The adoption of a series of 
measures indicate that Shanghai has taken the initiative in 
exercising effective management over the external migrant 
population in the city.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Man-na (3769 2581 1226): "Liu </F>
Zhongli Says Land Value Added Tax Must Be Levied"] 
  [Text] Mainland Finance Minister Liu Zhongli yesterday 
disclosed for the first time the principles of the land value 
added tax [VAT], which feature one and the same tax policy for 
investors from outside the borders and domestic investors. Yuan 
Zheng, director of the Guangdong Provincial State Land 
Department, said that a unified tax rate will deter foreign 
businessmen from coming to Guangdong and inland cities to 
develop property markets, adding that Guangdong will consider 
taking emergency measures. 
  Liu Zhongli, who is also director of the State General 
Administration of Taxation, announced yesterday the three 
principles for the land VAT. 1) The land VAT tax shall be 
levied and equal treatment will be given to investor outside and 
inside the borders. 2) The same tax law shall be applied to all 
areas of the mainland. And 3) the government will take opinions 
of various localities into consideration and formulate 
appropriate detailed regulations and rules for enforcing the law. 
  In an interview with this reporter through the trunk-line 
exchange last night, Yuan Zheng said: "Under Guangdong's land 
VAT policy, which was introduced earlier, the tax rate ranges 
from 20 to 60 percent. To lower property prices, the Shenzhen 
government has raised the rate to 60 or even 100 percent. If 
the land VAT is fixed at 50 percent as required by the central 
government, it will be a blessing for Shenzhen, because the 
national tax rate is lower than the local one. But the 50 
percent tax rate will have a fairly big adverse impact on other 
areas in the province, especially areas in northern Guangdong, 
because the national rate, which is higher than local ones, 
means a greater burden for investors and thus prevents them from 
investing in the real estate industry in poor areas." 
  Yuan continue: "As the land VAT will go to local funds, we 
hope the central government will listen to our opinion and grant 
us greater authority in enforcing the tax law so that we can 
implement the law flexibly in accordance with actual conditions. 
When the detailed regulations and rules for implementing the 
tax law are published, we will take emergency measures after 
study." 
  Asked if the land VAT policy, which treats domestic and 
foreign investors alike, will deter foreign businessmen from 
investing in Guangdong's real estate industry, Yuan said: 
"Guangdong presently gives equal treatment to foreign and 
domestic investors in collecting land gain fees, so it is fair 
to apply to them the same land VAT rate. For foreign property 
developers, the matters uppermost in their minds are local 
investment environment and the rate of return on investment 
rather than the tax policy. Of course too high a tax rate will 
dampen their enthusiasm." 
  Yuan continued: "Guangdong's real estate industry has 
developed rather rapidly, the land VAT policy will probably slow 
down the pace. The land of which the service life was 
transferred last year totaled 256,000 mu (excluding land 
transferred by administrative means), of which 128,000 were for 
property development. Last year, foreign businessmen invested 
in 577 projects related to property development with a 
contracted amount of $14.87 billion. Also last year, land used 
by foreign businessmen stood at 68,000 mu, most of which was 
developed by businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 1993, 
Guangdong's land revenues hit 11 billion yuan, up 17 percent 
from the previous year. This year Guangdong will reduce land 
for property development by 10 percent and will concentrate 
funds and land on 33 major capital construction projects." 
  Yuan pointed out: "Since Guangdong borders on Hong Kong and 
Macao, it has an edge over other provinces in selling houses to 
overseas buyers. As Guangdong enjoys a higher economic growth 
rate than many other provinces, the coastal cities in Guangdong 
will remain superior to other provinces in introducing foreign 
funds for property development after the unified land VAT law 
comes into effect."

  [Excerpts] In a speech at the second enlarged session of 
the provincial commission for discipline inspection, which 
concluded yesterday, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Guan 
Guangfu emphasized that it is necessary to carry out the 
anticorruption struggles in Hubei in depth with consistent 
efforts and reliable effects, by centering around the overall 
situation of reform, development, and stability and working hard 
to achieve new results. 
  Guan Guangfu said: Having analyzed and assessed the 
anticorruption work over the past few months, the Central 
Committee has set out the need to seize the opportunity, deepen 
reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain 
stability [zhua zhu ji yu shen hua gai ge kuo da kai fang chu 
jin fa zhan bao chi wen ding], which is the overall situation in 
the work of the entire party. Discipline inspection work must 
subject to and serve this overall situation. The provincial 
party committee has already made arrangements for work in 1994 
and set out that 1994 is a year of reform, forging ahead, 
implementation, and building clean government. This requirement 
embodies the principle of grasping two types of work 
simultaneously and paying equal attention to both and complies 
with the overall work situation of the entire party. Party 
committees, governments, commissions for discipline inspection, 
and procuratorate organizations at all levels should correctly 
differentiate and handle two categories of contradictions. It 
is imperative to resolutely crack down on all law-breaking and 
criminal activities and mete out the appropriate penalties in 
cases of corruption. [passage omitted] 
  Guan Guangfu said that, consolidating and augmenting 
flesh-and- blood and party-and-people ties is the fundamental 
goal of waging the anticorruption struggle and has a bearing on 
the rise or fall and success or failure of the party's cause, 
not to mention the basic issue of the party's life or death. He 
indicated that the overwhelming majority of the people have 
improved their living standards through reform, opening up, and 
economic development; however, some of our state-owned 
enterprises are really suffering from their economic 
difficulties, and it has been a hard life for the workers, staff 
members, and people there. We should always bear the masses in 
mind, show concern for them, and adopt effective measures to 
help them resolve difficulties. [passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, Guan Guangfu said, the key to waging the 
anticorruption struggle in depth and with consistent efforts and 
reliable effects lies in augmenting leadership. Party 
committees and governments at all levels must continue to place 
the anticorruption struggle on the agenda and augment leadership 
in a down- to-earth way. It is necessary to establish the 
responsibility system and augment supervision and examination. 
Party committees at all levels must support discipline 
inspection work and supervision departments and help them 
resolve their difficulties. [passage omitted] 
  Approximately, 600 participants attended the meeting, 
including Qian Yunlu, provincial party committee deputy 
secretary; its standing committee members Ding Fengying, Li 
Daqiang, Wang Shengtie, and Huang Yuanzhi; Wang Hanzhang, 
Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee vice chairman; 
Zhong Shuqiao, Provincial Committee of Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference vice chairman; Li Qifan, 
Provincial Higher People's Court president; Zhong Shuqin, 
Provincial People's Procuratorate chief procurator; Hou Guodao, 
Wang Zhuru, and Liu Yadong, Provincial Commission for Discipline 
Inspection deputy secretaries; responsible persons of party 
groups, party committees of all departments and commissions 
directly under the provincial party committee, government organs 
at provincial level, various commissions, offices, bureaus, 
general companies, and mass organizations.

  [Excerpt] The provincial party committee auditorium, which 
has a capacity of 1,000 seats, was packed full on the afternoon

organizations directly under the provincial authorities, army 
units, institutes of tertiary education, and scientific research 
institutes gathered here to hear provincial party committee

crucial one in quickening the pace in building the socialist 
market economic structure as well as one in which the greatest 
number of reform measures are to be presented. To help the broad 
cadres have a clear picture of the role of various reform 
measures in building the socialist market economic structure, 
the provincial propaganda department, and work committees of 
organizations directly under the provincial authorities decided 
to sponsor a series of report meetings on deepening reform and 
quickening the pace in building the socialist market economic 
structure. The first report would be made by provincial party 
committee Secretary Wang Maolin. 
  Wang Maolin's report made yesterday had three parts: First, 
to realize renovation of concepts and make a leap in thinking is 
the objective requirement of building the socialist market 
economic structure; second, to outline several major aspects in 
changing concepts and making a leap in thinking; and third, how 
to realize this change in concepts and make a leap in thinking.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam urged China Monday to try and establish the legal 
and institutional framework necessary for effective promotion of 
bilateral trade and investment. 
  "It is my conviction that the China-Korea summit this time 
will lift economic cooperation onto a higher plane," Kim said at 
a luncheon hosted by Chinese business leaders. 
  The president arrived in Beijing Sunday and began his 
official visit on Monday. 
  Although Kim is expected to focus on the North Korean 
nuclear 
issue during his talks with President Jiang Zemin and other 
Chinese leaders, one of his main objectives is boosting economic 
and trade links. 
  "Our two nations need to build a future-oriented and 
mutually 
complementary cooperative system through increased joint 
ventures in industrial and research projects as well as 
increased direct trade," he said. 
  "If the resources of the two nations -- manpower, natural 
resources, technology, capital and development know-how -- are 
combined and utilized to promote our mutual interests, it will 
produce great results," Kim said. 
  Kim said South Korean businesses have extensive experience 
in 
production and marketing, accumulated over the past 30 years. 
Korean businessmen, unlike their counterparts from advanced 
countries, are familiar with the business climate in developing 
countries like China, he said. 
  Furthermore, Korean firms are stepping up investment in the 
technology-intensive industrial sectors of the Chinese economy, 
he said. 
  Seoul will spare no effort in supporting the business 
activities of Korean enterprises in China, Kim assured the 
Chinese businessmen. 
  He also expressed hope that businesmen from the two 
countries 
will promote a combined presence in third countries through 
joint investments in such sectors as construction, automobiles 
and aviation. 
  Kim noted that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum is being developed as an open cooperative body, and there 
have been rapid increases in inter-country investment and trade 
within the region. 
  Furthermore, regional economic projects including 
development 
of the tumen river basin are being actively promoted, he said. 
  "Once the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved and the 
North decides to pursue policies of openness and reform, 
regional cooperation in Northeast Asia wil be greatly 
facilitiated, in addition to economic cooperation between China 
and South Korea," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam and First Lady Son Myong-sun arrived at the Great 
Hall of the People Saturday morning amid a 21-gun salute 
accorded to guests of the state. 
  "It's nice to see you again," Kim said to Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin, recounting their first meeting in Seattle last 
November during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
summit. 
  "You came a long way," Jiang answered, taking Kim's hand. 
  Kim shook hands with everyone in the welcoming line as Jiang 
provided introductions. Kim obviously found some familiar faces 
and didn't forget to say, "it's been a while." 
  The South Korean leader then followed suit, introducing 
everyone accompanying him on his trip to China. 
  The welcoming ceremony lasted 15 minutes including the 
performance of national anthems and the walk down the red carpet 
between honor guards. 
  -- Kim jogged around Daiyoutai, the guest house where he is 
staying, before leaving for the welcoming ceremony and 
remembered to praise the beauty of the trees and the ponds in 
talks with Jiang. 
  Chatting before the summit opened amid a burst of camera 
flashes, Kim said he had spent a very comfortable night at the 
guest house and especially appreciated the beautiful scenery. 
  The summit room, unlike when Kim met with Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with only one aide present, was 
filled with officials from both sides. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Ambassador to Beijing Hwang 
Pyong-tae, Senior Aide for Diplomacy and National Security Chong 
Chong-uk and the Foreign Ministry's Director-General for Asian 
Affairs, Yu Pyong-u, sat in for the Seoul side. 
  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Vice Foreign Minister Tang 
Jiaxuan, Ambassador to Seoul Zhang Tingyan and the 
Director-general for Asian Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, Wang 
Yingfan, represented Beijing. 
  -- The Kim-Jiang summit was followed by an expanded summit 
attended by 13 officials including the trade, science and 
technology and communication ministers as well as military 
leaders. 
  The two countries capped their summit with the signing of 
agreements on cultural cooperation and avoidance of double 
taxation.

<F P=106> [Telephone conversation between unidentified anchorman and </F>
KBS political reporter Kim Chin-su from Beijing on 28 March] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Anchorman] In today's 
talks, other than the nuclear issue, it seems that talks were 
exchanged between the leaders on the method for promoting 
economic cooperation between the two countries. What did the 
two leaders discuss? 
  [Reporter Kim Chin-su] Along with the North Korean nuclear 
issue, another important agenda at the ROK-Chinese summit talks 
was the economic cooperation field. Both sides agreed to 
establish a ROK-Chinese industrial cooperative committee. 
Through this industrial cooperative committee, the two 
countries decided to strengthen cooperation in the field of 
automobile, airplanes, electronic exchangers, and HDTV. In 
particular, President Kim Yong-sam proposed that the scope of 
joint venture projects in the Time Division Exchanger (TDX) 
field should be increased, and that technological tie-up and 
joint venture production should begin in the aviation field. He 
also said that he hopes that ROK's finished automobiles can 
advance into China and that the road will be opened for the 
ROK's superior construction technology to actively participate 
in China's eighth Five-Year Plan. In this regard, President 
Jiang Zemin answered by proposing to hold minister-level talks 
and consultations among working-level officers in private 
businesses. [passage omitted] 
  [Anchorman] After the summit talks, the Chinese side 
separately announced the result of the talks to its reporters. 
Did the Chinese side reveal its position by saying that the 
Chinese Government's position is that it opposes the resumption 
of the Team Spirit exercise? 
  [Kim] Yes. When viewing the result of the summit talks as 
given by the Chinese side, China's position regarding the North 
Korean nuclear issue can be viewed more clearly. In a briefing 
after the summit talks, Shen Guofang, spokesman of the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry, said that President Jiang Zemin explained to 
President Kim that China supports pursuing long-term peace and 
security on the Korean peninsula and denuclearization on the 
Korean peninsula, and that all issues must stem from the point 
of maintaining peace and security on the Korean peninsula. 
Spokesman Shen revealed that currently there is no cooperation 
between China and North Korea regarding the nuclear issue, but 
since North Korea is also a sovereign state, there is a limit to 
China's role because another country cannot order another 
country what to do. He said that therefore, the most effective 
method regarding the North Korean nuclear issue is dialogue 
between the parties concerned through patience. He also 
explained that maintaining peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula is defending the Korean people's fundamental interest. 
He firmly said that whether it is military exercise or 
deployment of missiles, China opposes any kind of action and 
measure that is detrimental to security on the Korean peninsula. 
  [Anchorman] In today's summit talks, it was decided that 
concrete discussions regarding the nuclear issue will be dealt 
with at the foreign ministers' talks. The foreign ministers' 
talks were held today, right? 
  [Kim] Yes. In accordance with the agreement made at the 
summit talks, ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks for about one and a half 
hour this afternoon to hold further talks on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. In today's talks, the two foreign ministers 
decided that both countries jointly exert efforts for the 
peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, and 
agreed that both countries take joint measures to find the most 
effective way to change North Korea's attitude. Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen proposed that rather than adopting a 
resolution on North Korea at the UN Security Council [UNSC], 
issuing a statement by the president of the UNSC would be of 
help in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Foreign 
Minister Han said that if this is an opportunity to enhance the 
road to persuade North Korea by China, he will not oppose this 
proposal. Foreign Minister Qian also said that there is clearly 
a limit in persuading North Korea, but if there is no change in 
North Korea's attitude even after the president of the UNSC 
issues a statement regarding the North Korean nuclear issue 
through China's efforts, it will further strengthen efforts to 
persuade North Korea. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A summit meeting was held 
between PRC President Jiang Zemin and ROK President Kim Yong-sam 
at the Great Hall of the People on the morning of 28 March. In 
the summit, President Jiang Zemin revealed that China truly 
hopes that long-term peace and stability be preserved on the 
Korean peninsula and supported denuclearization on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  President Jiang Zemin emphasized that true peace and 
stability can never be maintained in the Asian-Pacific region 
without peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. He also 
stressed that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should 
be properly [tadanghagae] resolved through dialogue between the 
parties concerned. President Jiang Zemin said that the two 
countries should develop bilateral relations, bearing in mind 
peace and security on the Korean peninsula, and development and 
prosperity of the Asian region in the 21st Century. 
  During the summit meeting, President Kim Yong-sam emphasized 
that the ROK also hopes to settle the nuclear matter peacefully 
by means of dialogue and negotiations, not by pressure. He also 
said the ROK counts on China's continuous role for peace and 
stability on the Korean peninsula. 
  Touching on the bilateral economic relations, President 
Jiang 
Zemin said that, even though the two countries established 
diplomatic ties not long ago, the prospects for the bilateral 
relations are bright when seen from the current development of 
bilateral economic cooperation. 
  President Kim Yong-sam also revealed that the future for 
ROK-PRC trade cooperation is bright, and stressed the need to 
strengthen bilateral relations in the field of automobiles, 
airplanes, electronic exchangers, and HDTV. In particular, 
President Kim Yong-sam said promoting the relations of economic 
and trade cooperation between the two countries will be 
advantageous for the economic stability of the Asian-Pacific 
region and the world. 
  President Kim Yong-sam requested that President Jiang Zemin 
visit the ROK and President Jiang Zemin accepted his invitation.

  [Text] President Jiang Zemin held a special interview for 
ROK reporters only today. During the interview, he revealed 
once again that he will visit the ROK in the near future and 
that China will continue to exert efforts to resolve the North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  The following is a report by correspondent Yi Tong-sik: 
  [Begin correspondent Yi Tong-sik recording] In a news 
conference for ROK reporters only, President Jiang Zemin 
emphasized once again that China's consistent position regarding 
the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue is to ease 
tension and maintain security on the Korean peninsula, support 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, and holding dialogue 
between the parties concerned with patience. 
  In connection with resolving the nuclear issue, President 
Jiang Zemin said that any act that intensifies contradiction 
will not be helpful in resolving the nuclear issue, and if 
tension and uneasiness increase, the ones that will suffer loss 
will be the Korean people themselves. 
  President Jiang Zemin said reunification on the Korean 
peninsula is basically a matter of the Korean people, and that 
he hopes that South and North Korea will work to unfold active 
efforts to improve relations through dialogue so that ultimately 
they can provide a favorable condition for a peaceful 
reunification. 
  President Jiang expressed satisfaction over the increase in 
economic cooperation between the two countries since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations, and hoped that future 
cooperation will be through an open way which will be of help 
for both sides, not in a closed way. 
  In today's news conference, President Jiang Zemin showed 
faith in economic development and promotion in cooperation 
between the two countries, and highly assessed the significance 
of President Kim's visit to China. 
  This has been Yi Tong-sik from Beijing. [end recording]

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (YONHAP) -- China expressed 
unprecedentedly deep concern over the situation on the Korean 
peninsula at the summit and foreign ministers' meetings with 
South Korea during President Kim Yong-sam's visit, a 
highly-placed source close to the meetings said Tuesday. 
  "Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his South Korean 
counterpart Han Sung-chu that if the international community 
applied pressure on North Korea, then North Korea would have no 
choice but to take military action," the source said. 
  Qian was quoted as stressing China's belief that the 
situation should not be allowed to deteriorate and that dialogue 
among the countries concerned must continue. 
  Qian reportedly admitted that China would be put in an 
awkward position if North Korea were slapped with economic 
sanctions through a United Nations Security Council resolution. 
  The official quoted Qian as saying, "China does not want to 
see a UN observation party deployed at the Chinese border with 
North Korea to monitor whether economic sanctions on North Korea 
are being implemented." 
  Qian, adding that such action might trigger an exodus of 
North Koreans into China as well as compel North Korea into 
provoking a war, suggested that China would oppose economic 
sanctions against Pyongyang, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed at his 
summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam the "four-party, 
three- channel" solution -- that is, resolution through three 
channels of talks between South and North Korea, between North 
Korea and the United States, and between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Jiang told South Korean journalists that if tension 
continued 
to mount on the Korean peninsula, the first to suffer would be 
the Korean people.

<F P=106> [Report by Gert Anhalt including statements by PRC Foreign </F>
Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin in Chinese with superimposed 
German translation; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Do they have the bomb or are they just bluffing? 
Actually, this is not the most important thing just now. North 
Korea, the eternal outsider of the international community, has 
finally maneuvered itself into a corner and is standing with its 
back to a wall. The question now is, can the Korea crisis be 
settled peacefully or is a conflict unavoidable? 
  China could have the answer to that. China is the only 
country that has good contacts with Pyongyang and with Seoul -- 
the ideal mediator, therefore. 
  Therefore, South Korea's President Kim Young Sam hopes for 
diplomatic support during his visit to Beijing. However, PRC 
President Jiang Zemin told him only what he had told to the 
worried Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa a week ago: China 
relies on patient negotiations. China does not want any 
pressure on North Korea. 
  Wu Jianmin, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry says: 
  [Begin Wu Jianmin recording] Political pressure or even 
sanctions would just escalate the current tensions and make the 
situation even more complicated. China is in contact with all 
parties involved, but our influence is limited, and we do not 
want to interfere in the negotiations. The dialogue must be 
held between North Korea on the one side and the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency], the United States, and 
South Korea on the other. Of course, China wants stability in 
Korea and we do not want nuclear weapons there -- be it in the 
north or in the south. [end recording] 
  If North Korea is working on the bomb in its nuclear 
facilities, this cannot be a matter of indifference to China. 
It does not want a new nuclear power in its neighborhood, in 
particular because South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan could arm 
themselves with nuclear weapons within the shortest possible 
period out of fear of North Korea. The strategic balance in 
eastern Asia, which is still to China's advantage at the moment, 
would be lastingly disturbed. 
  Therefore, some see the reason for Beijing's 
imperturbability 
in the fact that the Chinese intelligence service knows more 
than the West, which has only some satellite pictures. Perhaps 
China knows that North Korea will not be able to produce nuclear 
weapons for a long time to come. 
  Perhaps, however, China is still loyal to the fraternal 
communist country. In the Korean war, half a million Chinese 
soldiers died on Kim Il-song's side, and in China's leadership 
there are still the old revolutionaries, who have not forgotten 
that. 
  However, whatever the reason, the official justification is: 
China does not interfere, particularly not when sanctions are 
threatened. 
  [Begin Wu Jianmin recording] I give you an example that 
explains why China insists on finding a solution by means of 
negotiations. This is just as with Chinese herbal medicine. It 
needs a very long time to have an effect, just as negotiations. 
If you treat an illness with herbs, the healing process might 
take longer, but in the end, it might be much better than to 
have precipitate surgery. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (YONHAP) -- Quoting the Korean 
adage that "When a family is in trouble, its neighbors should 
share its worries," South Korean President Kim Yong-sam urged 
China Tuesday to persuade North Korea to join in the global 
movement toward reform and openness. 
  Delivering a speech at the famed Beijing University Tuesday 
morning, Kim noted that the Korean peninsula has yet to cast off 
the yoke of the cold war. 
  "This state of affairs threatens to throw Asia into chaos at 
any moment," Kim said, adding: "This is because North Korea is 
still loath to ride the global trend toward reform and openness." 
  In particular, its nuclear development program imperils 
peace 
not only in Asia but in the whole world, he said. 
  Pyongyang is now vacillating between two courses of action: 
Sticking to its old policy of isolation and confrontation or 
embracing the world trend of openness and cooperation, Kim said. 
  "I believe that China is a neighbor who can join us in 
trying 
to persuade North Korea to participate in the current global 
movement," Kim said. "I ardently hope that China will play an 
active role in this effort." 
  Indeed, China may be the only country that could possibily 
exert influence over the communist regime in North Korea. 
  "We have never wanted the North to be isolated, and we will 
spare no effort to help Pyongyang join the international 
community as a responsible member," said the South Korean 
president, who is on a five-day official visit to China. 
  Kim said his country is stepping up development of its west 
coast with the aim of boosting interaction with China. 
  "If and when North Korea also rides the global wave of 
openness and reform, a Yellow Sea economic zone will rapidly 
emerge," Kim said. 
  The Yellow Sea would then become an expanse of peace and 
prosperity and Northeast Asia an even more dynamic region, Kim 
predicted. "The Pacific would even more certainly emerge as the 
center of new world civilization," he said. 
  Korean unification would be in China's interest as well, Kim 
said, since it would ease tension in Northeast Asia and 
accelerate regional development. Korean reunification would 
help stabilize a new Northeast Asian order, he said. 
  "We must live together and join forces to usher in a new 
era," Kim said. "By living together well, South Korea and China 
will be the axis for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and 
thus the driving force behind the budding Asia-Pacific age." 
  In this context, South Korean-Chinese ties are one of the 
most important bilateral relationships, Kim said. 
  "There is great potential for our two countries if we 
combine 
our manpower, natural resources, capital and technology, while 
also sharing the benefits of developmental experience and 
expertise," he said. 
  Seoul and Beijing should also step up joint efforts to 
develop the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum so as 
to enhance regional cooperation, he said. 
  After the speech, President Kim met with Prime Minister Li 
Peng and Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress. 
Kim emphasized the need for closer cooperation between Seoul 
and Beijing to resolve the North Korean nuclear row. 
  They also exchanged views on ways to boost bilateral 
economic 
cooperation. 
  Kim was to have lunch with Korean reporters covering the 
presidential office of Chongwadae [presidential offices] before 
holding a press conference for both Korean and foreign 
journalists.

<F P=106> [By Zeno Park] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (AFP)--Washington and Seoul will 
seriously consider China's proposal for a non-binding UN 
Security Council statement urging Pyongyang to accept fresh 
nuclear inspections, South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
has said. 
  At a late evening press briefing on Monday [28 March] that 
followed his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, 
Han said he was leaving later Tuesday for the United States to 
discuss Beijing's proposal with Washington. 
  "We (South Korea) have not yet chosen between a (binding) 
resolution and a (non-binding) statement," Han said. "We have 
to weigh the pros and cons of China's proposal (for a statement) 
and for this purpose, I am going to Washington, taking with me 
China's position and explanation," Han said. 
  "The pros of a statement of the Security Council is that it 
would be feasible on a consensus base and would leave a greater 
possibility of a negotiated solution," Han said. 
  "China says that it will have more to do (in international 
efforts to resolve the nuclear standoff) when there remains some 
possibility of dialogue," he said. 
  In the United Nations Monday Security Council president, 
Jean-Bernard Merimee, said differences between China, a 
traditional ally of North Korea, and other permanent council 
members, had bogged down UN action on the nuclear inspections 
row. 
  "Certain delegations still hope for a resolution," Merimee 
said, instead of a non-binding statement issued by the council 
president, which China has said it would consider if the wording 
were objective and mild. 
  Merimee also said he would meet with Han during his visit to 
New York Tuesday, before Han heads to Washington. 
  South Korea has called on China to take a more active role 
in 
persuading North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. Han 
indicated he was in favor of a statement as a first step in 
order to ensure support from Beijing. 
  Last week, the United States pushed for a draft resolution 
that would have pressed Pyongyang to give International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) experts unimpeded access to all its 
nuclear facilities. 
  The U.S. move followed an IAEA report last Monday that it 
had 
been unable to inspect a radiochemical laboratory at the 
Yongbyon nuclear facility outside the North Korean capital 
Pyongyang. The U.S. draft text also called for IAEA Director 
General Hans Blix to report on the situation again in a month. 
  China, however, refused to accept a resolution to pressure 
North Korea, leading the United States and the other permanent 
council members France, Russia and Britain, to consider a 
weaker presidential statement in order to keep China on board, 
rather than seeing it abstain on or veto a resolution. 
  In Washington, however, the United States sounded set to 
drop 
its call for a resolution in favor of a statement, if the 
phrasing were right. Han arrived here Monday for a stop off 
visit, before flying to the United States for talks at the 
United Nations and in Washington then heading to Japan to 
discuss the Chinese proposal and coordinate international 
efforts to resolve the nuclear issue. 
  Answering a question about the results of President Kim 
Yong-sam's meeting with Chinese leader Jiang Zemin here on 
Monday, Han said the meeting had seen "the most direct and 
straightforward" exchange of views he had ever seen. But he 
denied that Bejing had suggested that Seoul was reponsible for 
aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula with a 
decision to deploy defensive Patriot missiles or to resume joint 
U.S.-South Korean military exercises in response to the North's 
rejection of nuclear inspections. 
  Kim said he would decide on when to start the exercises, 
named Team Spirit, after he returned home Wednesday from China. 
  Jiang on Monday demanded that Kim to stop Team Spirit and 
the 
planned deployment of Patriots in order to seek a negotiated 
solution to the crisis.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Visiting President of 
the Republic of Korea (ROK) Kim Yong-sam today described his 
country's relationship with China as having a long history of 
thousands of years. 
  Delivering a speech at Beijing University here this morning, 
Kim said that the two countries are not only similar culturally, 
close geographically and historically friendly, but also 
complementary economically. 
  Kim said that the ROK and China established diplomatic ties 
only about one-and-a-half years ago, but bilateral ties have 
been boosted in many aspects. 
  He expressed the belief that ROK-Chinese relations will not 
only blossom fully but also be fruitful in the future. 
  Kim said that it is a great honor for him, as the first 
president of the ROK, to visit Beijing University, an 
institution with a brilliant history and tradition. 
  Wu Shuqing, president of Beijing University, also made a 
speech at the meeting.

<F P=106> [Opening remarks by ROK President Kim Yong-sam at a news </F>
conference for domestic and foreign reporters at the Great Hall 
of the People in Beijing -- live] 
  [Text] Dear domestic and foreign reporters: I am 
delighted to have an opportunity to tell you about my visit to 
China. I think my current visit to China was a meaningful 
opportunity to upgrade the substantial cooperation between our 
two countries a step further. 
  I very sincerely and extensively exchanged views on matters 
of common interest between our two countries with the Chinese 
leaders. In particular, President Jiang Zemin and I met again, 
four months after we met in Seattle last November. He and I 
talked in a very intimate atmosphere this time. I invited 
President Jiang Zemin to visit the ROK soon [kakkaun siil nae], 
and President Jiang willingly [kikkoi] accepted my invitation. 
  The ROK and China established diplomatic relations one and a 
half years ago. This was an action that our two countries took 
after actively responding [nungdongjoguro taeung] to the 
establishment of a new international order of reconciliation and 
cooperation. 
  The two countries know well each other's potential and 
realize a need to promote cooperation for the sake of each 
country's national development. The world has been undergoing 
great political and economic change. In the midst of this 
change, a discussion has been under way to invigorate a regional 
economic cooperation system for common prosperity in this 
region. We reached an agreement that it is necessary for the 
ROK and China to build a more in-depth and multisided [poda 
simchungjogigo tawonjogin] cooperation system in step with such 
an international trend. 
  Domestic and foreign reporters: Our two countries share the 
view that the tension on the Korean peninsula surrounding the 
North Korean nuclear issue is not beneficial to either country. 
President Jiang Zemin and I again confirmed this during our 
summit talks. We have so far cooperated to resolve this issue 
through dialogue and persuasion and will not give up our efforts 
for dialogue. 
  The ROK and China share the same interest in the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, stability there, and 
peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. 
  I expect North Korea will become a responsible member of the 
international community and join in the tide of world history, 
which is reform and openness. 
  When North and South Korea have substantial dialogue and 
cooperation and, ultimately, achieve North-South Korea 
reunification, genuine peace will be achieved on the Korean 
peninsula and Northeast Asia. 
  It is necessary for the ROK and China to develop long-term 
relations of cooperation, looking forward to such North-South 
dialogue and cooperation and a reunified Korea in the future. I 
stressed this point to the Chinese leaders during my current 
visit to China. 
  We were of the same opinion that a reunified Korea will be 
greatly beneficial to not only to the Korean people but to China 
and other neighboring countries of ours. 
  Since it began to carry out the policy of reform and 
openness, China has continuously maintained an alarming economic 
growth. Since they established diplomatic relations, our two 
countries have learned the other's good points and promoted 
cooperation. In this course, our two countries have gained much 
reciprocal benefits. 
  The two countries have reached a point at which they must 
widen a systematic basis [chedojok kiban] to further accelerate 
economic exchanges. To this end, an ROK-China industrial 
cooperation committee was inaugurated as a result of my visit to 
China. I am pleased about this. 
  We will promote industrial cooperation in the production of 
automobiles, electronic telephone switchboard systems, aircraft, 
and various other fields. The double taxation prevention 
agreement that was signed this time will accelerate economic 
exchange between the two countries. 
  We extensively discussed the expansion of bilateral economic 
cooperation and the invigoration [hwalsonghwa] of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. We will closely cooperate to 
build an open, free Asia-Pacific economic order. 
  China has promulgated various laws and eased restrictions 
and 
taken various other measures to enter GATT. The ROK assesses 
that these measures by China would contribute to strengthening 
the multilateral trade system. We will positively extend 
cooperation to ensure that China enters the GATT system. 
  Since the ROK and China established diplomatic relations, 
the 
exchange of people between the two countries has significantly 
increased. Over 150,000 people of the ROK and China visited 
each other's country last year. I have significantly simplified 
the procedures necessary for our people's visits to China. We 
opened a ROK consulate general in Shanghai last year and will 
open one in Qingdao. The expansion of the exchange of the 
people between the two countries will greatly contribute to 
promoting a mutual understanding and friendship. 
  Our two countries will promote more intimate relations of 
cooperation based on their historically and geographically close 
relations. We, as genuine neighbors who need each other, will 
consolidate friendship in all fields. 
  Cherishing deep in my heart the Chinese people's friendship, 
I will depart for Seoul tomorrow. Before leaving for Seoul, I 
will go to Tianjin to visit a place where the people of our two 
countries are working together for common prosperity. I express 
deep thanks to the Chinese leaders and all Chinese people who 
warmly welcomed me and my delegation and extended warm 
hospitality to us. Thank you.

<F P=106> [News conference by ROK President Kim Yong-sam with domestic </F>
and foreign reporters at the Great Hall of the People in 
Beijing--live] 
  [Text] [SBS reporter Chon Yong-hak] Mr. President, you 
agreed in the ROK-PRC summit talks yesterday on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the principle of 
solution through dialogue. But the present situation is that 
the efforts for solution through dialogue have run up against a 
wall, as inter-Korean dialogue broke down and the dialogue 
between North Korea and the United States is suspended. In this 
connection, please tell us whether specific discussion was made 
on the issue of China playing the role of mediator to resolve 
the North Korean nuclear issue. In addition, you said that you 
would decide the time when the Team Spirit exercise will be 
resumed after your visit to Japan and China. What is your plan 
on this? 
  [President Kim] The one-on-one summit I had with President 
Jiang Zemin which lasted for one hour and 20 minutes was 
entirely devoted to the North Korean nuclear issue. Only in the 
expanded summit talks did we discuss economic cooperation. I 
think the talks were very serious and beneficial. However, it 
is difficult to disclose all the conversation between the 
presidents here. Nevertheless, I told you that the presidents 
intensively discussed the North Korean nuclear issue. Although 
much discussion is being made on such matters as the Team Spirit 
exercise and the Patriot missiles, we never discussed the Team 
Spirit exercise or the Patriot missile in the talks. 
  My statement that I would decide on the matter of the Team 
Spirit exercise after my visit to Japan and China is still 
valid. I am now staying in China. Therefore, I have time 
before making the decision I promised to make, you will 
understand this. 
  [KBS reporter Kim Hong] I would like to ask you about the 
Team Spirit exercise. You said you would decide on the issue of 
the Team Spirit exercise after your visits. Do you think that 
the results of your visits will affect the issue of the Team 
Spirit exercise in any way? 
  [President Kim] As I have emphasized whenever there was an 
opportunity to do so, the Team Spirit exercise is an exercise 
for defensive purposes, not an offensive exercise. This is the 
point that should be taken into account. This concept remains 
unchanged if I leave the ROK or if I visit Japan and China. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN's Beijing-based correspondent Che Chu-sang] As 
was noted in the first question, the North Korean nuclear 
problem does not show any signs of solution. Please tell us 
whether you have any plan to conduct inter-Korean economic 
cooperation or to make an active effort for inter-Korean summit 
talks to bring a breakthrough in this situation. 
  [President Kim] There is no change in my position regarding 
the inter-Korean summit talks. That is, I am prepared to come 
to the talks if it helps resolve the nuclear issue. I think 
that this helps create an atmosphere for economic cooperation as 
well. 
  [XINHUA reporter] Your excellency has previously said that 
the economic and trade relations between the ROK and China have 
been pushed ahead without a hitch. However, for instance, China 
last year recorded a $2 billion trade deficit with the ROK. As 
far as we know, the ROK imposes unfair controlled tariffs on 
some Chinese agricultural products. Do you have any plan to 
abolish such tariffs for the rectification of the trade 
imbalance? 
  [President Kim] I think there is a difference in the method 
of calculating the trade volume between the ROK and China. You 
said China's trade deficit amounted to $2 billion last year, 
however that is not true. I guess it resulted from the 
difference in the calculation. The ROK is now paving the way 
for easing all the regulations and opening our markets further 
and will endeavor to have these things handled autonomously to 
the maximum. In addition, the ROK will direct all possible 
efforts to balance ROK-China trade. 
  [KYODO News Agency reporter Kotawa] Mr. President, in your 
address before the Japanese Diet, you looked back upon the past 
one hundred years of Korea's modern history and expressed a 
resolve that the ROK will not repeat past failures. In light of 
this, what kind of role do you think the ROK should assume in 
the Asia-Pacific region toward the 21st Century? 
  [President Kim] In connection with this question, I firmly 
believe that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] will 
become the epicenter of the economy of the 21st Century. In 
this connection, what I desperately felt during my visit to 
Japan and China was the necessity for the ROK, Japan, and China 
to cooperate. An APEC meeting was once held in Seattle. I think 
we should further enhance the role of the APEC and effectively 
operate the APEC summit which is slated to be held in Indonesia 
in January. 
  [HANGUK ILBO Beijing correspondent Yi Kyong-won] I would 
like 
to ask you once again about the nuclear issue. The president 
visited China, which is expected to play a decisive role in the 
North Korean nuclear issue, at a time when the issue is 
virtually in a deadlock. Were you aware of the stance China 
would assume toward North Korea's nuclear issue before your 
visit? Is there any change in your stance toward the nuclear 
issue in the wake of your visit? 
  [President Kim] I have already touched on that issue. I had 
a comfortable conversation with President Jiang Zemin since this 
was my second summit with him. I met with him several times at 
the APEC summit. I think it is very important for people to 
meet often because this will give an opportunity for the people 
to share their opinions frankly. I think it is not appropriate 
to reveal all the conversation exchanged in the summit. However 
what I can say is that there is no change in China's position 
and my position on the nuclear issue in the wake of my visit. 
The two sides reaffirmed a joint stance. President Jiang Zemin 
and I concurred that nuclear weapons should not exist on the 
Korean peninsula. I also think this issue must not hinder 
economic development in this region. 
  [CNN reporter Mike Chinoy, in English] Mike Chinoy from 
CNN. Mr. President, the Chinese have made very clear in the 
last few days they are strongly opposed to the use of pressure 
on North Korea, that they are strongly opposed to bringing the 
issue to the United Nations, that they are strongly opposed to 
the use of sanctions. Are you at all disappointed with the way 
the Chinese put forward their position on this issue? In view 
of what the Chinese have said publicly or privately to you, 
where does this lead the process of dealing with the nuclear 
issue which is now under discussion at the UN Security Council? 
Does this slow it or does this clear any difficulties for 
moving through the United Nations into trying to exert pressure 
on the North to open up its nuclear facilities? Thank you. 
  [President Kim] You have asked questions in a very 
complicated way. I know China has its own views, of course. 
However, our two countries reached an agreement that the ROK 
and China will closely cooperate with each other with regard to 
the North Korean nuclear issue. Therefore, the two countries 
will hold close consultations on how to deal with this issue in 
the United Nations and any other places. Of course, how the 
North Korean nuclear issue will proceed -- I sent the ROK 
foreign minister to the United States this morning. He will hold 
consultations with the U.S. leaders and ambassadors at the 
United Nations. He will also visit Japan on his way back home 
and meet the Japanese leaders. We will hold close consultations 
with the United States, Japan, and China. We are also holding 
consultations with Russia, an important country in our 
neighborhood, on various channels. I am planning to send our 
foreign minister to Russia early next month. We will hold 
consultations with the four powers. I believe every issue can 
be satisfactorily resolved at the United Nations and other 
places. [pause for translation into Chinese] Let us conclude 
today's news conference at this point. Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> ["Newsletter From Seoul, ROK" by staff reporter Xu Baokang </F>
(1776 1405 1660): "Expand Cooperation, Make Progress Together-- 
Written on the Eve of President Kim Yong-sam's Visit to China"] 
  [Text] The land is coming back to life in early spring. 
On the eve of ROK President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, this 
reporter visited a number of institutions, enterprises, and 
schools in the ROK, and found that pleasant spring winds of 
expanding exchanges and cooperation with China are everywhere. 
This can be seen in a string of convincing figures: China has 
become the largest external destination for ROK investment, and 
ROK investment in China accounted for 58.6 percent of its total 
overseas investment in 1993. The number of ROK investment 
projects in China last year reached 616, exceeding the total of 
the previous five years. At present, China has become the ROK's 
third largest trading partner. 
  Since China and the ROK established diplomatic relations in 
1992, bilateral economic and trade relations have developed 
rapidly. According to the latest statistics of the ROK Trade 
Association, the total volume of trade last year reached $9.08 
billion and increased by 42.3 percent. Along with the increase 
in trade, the ROK has also been increasing its investment in 
China year after year. Although there is a good foundation for 
PRC-ROK economic cooperation, and such cooperation has developed 
to a considerable scale, there remains a huge untapped potential 
for the further expansion of trade and of economic and technical 
cooperation. This is the consensus of the people in business 
circles. 
  We can see the following characteristics in the development 
of ROK-Chinese trade and economic cooperation: First, there is 
a high growth rate. According to ROK customs statistics, the 
volume of bilateral trade increased by an average annual rate of 
over 50 percent between 1988 and 1993. Second, indirect trade 
has been replaced by direct trade. In the past, entrepot trade 
between the two countries accounted for over 70 percent of their 
total trade volume, but the proportion of indirect trade 
declined to 20 percent in 1992, and further fell to a lower 
level last year. Third, economic cooperation between the two 
countries has begun to develop in the capital-intensive, 
technology-intensive, and resource- developing patterns. 
Various ROK conglomerates have been carrying out their 
cooperation plans with China in key industries. After the Daeu 
Enterprise Group of the ROK invested approximately $300 million 
in China's Shandong to build a modern cement factory, other 
leading ROK enterprises, such as Samsong, Hyontae, Daeu, 
Sangkyong, Ssangyong, and Nakhui Kimsong, have all been seeking 
opportunities to expand cooperation with China in the 
car-making, electronics, space, passenger aircraft, and 
telecommunications industries with the support of the ROK 
Government. 
  Along with the rapid development of Sino-ROK economic and 
trade relations, a new "Chinese language craze" is rising in the 
ROK. This reporter saw that not only large enterprises, but also 
a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises had set up 
China affairs offices, and people who know the Chinese language 
are being urgently employed by various institutions, 
organizations, and enterprises. 
  This year, there was a tide of "recovering Chinese 
characters" in the Korean language. The government leaders 
explicitly pointed out that the past practice of eliminating 
Chinese characters from the Korean language was wrong and went 
against the trend of the times. ROK newspapers are now 
frequently using special columns to popularize knowledge about 
Chinese characters and advocate the need to master Chinese 
characters in order to open up the country and bring it into the 
international community. Designers have created rotating 
Chinese character tables on pencil boxes for primary school 
students to enable the children to learn more Chinese characters 
at any time. Recently, when schools enrolled new students, they 
required students to write their names in Chinese characters. 
Computer companies have also began to develop Chinese-character 
software. Seoul is planning to erect Chinese-character 
signposts for all streets. 
  China and the ROK are two neighboring countries which are 
separated only by a strip of water. The two countries have a 
time- honored historical tradition of economic and cultural 
exchanges. Their mutually complementary economic structures, the 
two peoples' strong desire for increasing exchanges, as well as 
the needs in the interests of the two countries form the 
precondition and foundation for the development of their 
friendly cooperative relationship. The changes in the 
post-cold-war international situation and in the ROK's domestic 
situation and the vigorous development of the Chinese economy 
have also provided a new opportunity for the development of 
Sino-ROK relations. ROK political circles have generally held 
that the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Kim 
Yong-sam during the informal APEC summit meeting in Seattle last 
November was an important event in the development of ROK-PRC 
relations. Since China and the ROK established diplomatic 
relations in August 1992, Chinese leaders Qian Qichen, Li 
Lanqing, Tian Jiyun and ROK National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop 
and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu have exchanged visits, and 
this has played an important role in helping the ROK renew its 
understanding of China. As the economy in the Asia-Pacific 
region is maintaining its momentum of rapid growth, the new 
China craze in the ROK is obviously not related to short-term 
economic interests. The ROK looks forward to closer cooperation 
with China so that they may jointly make contributions to the 
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren met here this morning with visiting 
Libyan Foreign Minister 'Umar M. al-Muntasir. 
  Rong said that since the two countries established 
diplomatic 
relations in 1978, bilateral friendly relations of cooperation 
in various fields have developed continuously; the two countries 
share similar views on some important international issues; and 
they have cooperated well in international organizations, 
supporting each other and coordinating their steps in handling 
some issues. 
  Rong said that China is ready to make concerted efforts 
together with Libya to further strengthen such friendship and 
cooperation. 
  He expressed the conviction that al-Muntasir's visit to 
China 
will help further the friendship and cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Al-Muntasir conveyed the compliments of the head of state of 
Libya Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi for the Chinese Government and 
people. 
  Al-Muntasir said that Libyan leaders are committed to 
strengthening and developing friendship and cooperation with 
China, hoping that such relations would be furthered. 
  Prior to the meeting, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen held talks with al-Muntasir on bilateral 
relations and issues of common concern. 
  Qian said that since the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between the two countries, China and Libya have 
conducted effective cooperation in various fields, and China is 
satisfied with the development. 
  He noted that China is willing to continue to develop 
friendly relations of cooperation with Libya on the basis of the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence. 
  On Lockerbie incident, Qian said that China has all along 
been concerned with the issue. China opposes terrorism of any 
description and holds that international disputes should be 
settled through peaceful means. 
  He said that China advocates for the settlement of the 
Lockerbie crisis through consultation and negotiations by 
parties concerned. "We disapprove of imposing sanctions on 
Libya, let alone imposing severer sanctions," Qian said. 
  He pointed out that sanctions against Libya have brought 
about pains to the Libyan people and caused difficulties for 
Libya's neighboring countries and other countries concerned, 
thus intensifying the already strained regional situation. 
  He said that China understands and sympathizes with Libya 
concerning the current conditions and does not want to see the 
situation worsening. 
  He said that China appreciates the stand of Libya and the 
flexibility exhibited by it in settling the Lockerbie incident 
through peaceful negotiations. 
  Qian said that China appeals to parties concerned to take 
measures to prevent the situation from worsening and promised 
that the Chinese Government will make its due efforts to this 
end. 
  Al-Muntasir praised China for its important role in 
establishing a new world order, saying that Libya is to 
strengthen bilateral relations, coordination and cooperation in 
international affairs with China. 
  He also briefed Qian on the latest development concerning 
the 
Lockerbie incident and Libya's stand on the issue, adding that 
Libya will apply negotiations and peaceful means to resolve the 
international crisis. 
  Muntasser arrived here on March 28 at the invitation of 
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.

<F P=106> [By reporter Luo Hui (5012 6540)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- State Vice President 
Rong Yiren met here this morning with visiting Libyan Foreign 
Minister 'Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir. 
  Rong Yiren said: Since China and Libya established 
diplomatic relations in 1978, friendly relations and cooperation 
in various fields between the two countries have developed 
continuously. The two countries share similar views on some 
major international issues. They have cooperated well in 
international organizations, supporting each other and 
coordinating their efforts in handling some issues. 
  He said: China is ready to make concerted efforts with Libya 
to further strengthen friendship and cooperation in all fields. 
He expressed the conviction that al-Muntasir's visit would help 
further the friendly relations between the two countries. 
  Al-Muntasir conveyed the regards of Libyan leader Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi to the Chinese Government and people. He said: 
Libyan leaders are devoted to strengthening and developing 
friendly relations and cooperation with China, hoping that such 
relations would be furthered. 
  Prior to the meeting, Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State 
Council and foreign minister, held talks with al-Muntasir. The 
two sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of 
common concern. 
  Qian Qichen said: Since they established diplomatic 
relations, China and Libya have cooperated effectively in all 
fields. China is satisfied with this development and is willing 
to continue to develop friendly relations and cooperation with 
Libya on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence. 
  On the Lockerbie incident, Qian Qichen said: "China has 
always been concerned about this issue. China opposes terrorism 
of any description and favors the settlement of international 
disputes through peaceful means. Consistent with this stand, we 
favor the settlement of the Lockerbie crisis through 
consultation and negotiation by the parties concerned. We 
disapprove of imposing sanctions against Libya, especially of 
stepping up sanctions against that country." 
  He pointed out: Sanctions against Libya have brought 
suffering to the Libyan people and caused difficulties for 
Libya's neighbors and other countries concerned, thus escalating 
the tension in the region. China fully understands and 
sympathizes with Libya's plight and does not want to see the 
situation worsening. 
  He said: China appreciates Libya's stand on settling the 
Lockerbie incident through peaceful negotiations, as well as the 
flexibility it exhibits in this regard. China appeals to the 
parties concerned to take measures to prevent the situation from 
worsening. 
  The Chinese Government will make due efforts to this end. 
  Al-Muntasir praised China for its important role in 
establishing a new world order, saying that Libya will 
strengthen bilateral relations with China and step up 
coordination and cooperation with China in international affairs. 
  He also briefed Qian Qichen on the latest developments in 
the 
Lockerbie incident and Libya's stand on the issue, saying that 
Libya would resolve the international crisis through negotiation 
and peaceful means. 
  Al-Muntasir arrived in Beijing on 28 March at the invitation 
of Qian Qichen.

<F P=106> [By Huang Tien (7806 3944): "Beijing To Release Wang Juntao </F>
on Bail for Medical Treatment"] 
  [Text] An informed source has revealed that the mainland 
Chinese authorities are considering releasing Wang Juntao in 
response to U.S. concerns about human rights on mainland China. 
In the meantime, the Beijing authorities have contacted the 
United States to investigate the possibility of sending Wang 
Juntao to the United States for medical treatment, but the 
request has been rejected by the U.S. side. 
  Information has it that Tian Qiyu, vice minister of public 
security in Mainland China, while exchanging views on human 
rights issues with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary Shattuck 
early this month, proposed releasing Wang Juntao on bail and 
sending him to the United States for treatment of his liver 
disease. Shattuck's counterproposal was that it is more 
suitable for Wang Juntao to stay at home for treatment. 
  It is said that the reason the United States turned down the 
request to send Wang Juntao to the United States was because the 
U.S. side is worried that Beijing intended to expel 
pro-democracy activists from the country into "exile" abroad in 
an attempt to alleviate pressure from public opinion and reduce 
the outcry from opposition groups within Mainland China.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (AFP)--A group of dissidents in 
Shanghai have sent a petition to parliament, signed by 54 
people, demanding freedom of the press, party pluralism and free 
trade unions, one of the signatories, Bao Ge, said Tuesday. The 
dissident said in a phone conversation from Shanghai that the 
19-point petition had been sent to the National People's 
Congress (NPC) last Friday. 
  Entitled "Blueprint for the political democratisation of the 
state and society in 1994," the petition was signed by 54 people 
"from all walks of life in Shanghai -- intellectuals, academics, 
artists, peasants, workers and private businessmen," Bao said. 
The names includes those of Yang Zhou, Wang Fucheng and Li 
Guotao, prominent Shanghai dissidents, he said. 
  "It is the first signature campaign, and we are going to 
extend the movement nationwide," he said.

  [Text] Friends and family of the jailed pro-democracy 
activist Zhai Weimin are to travel to Henan province's Yeshugou 
jail today in an attempt to secure his release. 
  At least two Beijing-based dissidents and half a dozen 
family 
members met in Luoyang city last night and will set out for the 
prison, near Xinan city, this morning. They were hoping prison 
officials would allow them to see Zhai, who has reportedly been 
held in solitary confinement since being sent back to his home 
town under police escort on March 7. 
  They want to find out about Zhai's living conditions and why 
he was detained, sources said. "Only then will we make loud 
appeals for his release," one dissident said. Tomorrow, the 
group plan to go to the Luoyang public security office and may 
visit the provincial public security bureau in Zhengzhou. They 
will also request meetings with members of the provincial 
people's congress standing committee in Zhai's home town of Xian. 
  Beijing dissidents said they delivered a letter to the 
Minister of Public Security, Tao Siju, on Saturday protesting 
against Zhai's detention. Zhai, number six on the "list of 21 
most-wanted students" after the 1989 Tiananmen Square student 
movement, was detained without warning on March 6. 
  In a note smuggled out of Yeshugou jail by a primary school 
student last week, Zhai said: "I am being investigated by 
public security officers in Yeshugou. Estimate must wait at 
least three months until after June 4." 
  Beijing dissidents, who received the message, believe Zhai's 
detention is related to activities being planned to commemorate 
the upcoming fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen riots. Public 
security officials have already stepped up vigilance in the 
square. 
  His sister, Zhai Yujie, who reportedly saw him last Friday, 
could not confirm the reasons for his detainment. Zhai, 23, was 
released on September 13 after three-and-a-half years in jail 
for "counter- revolutionary propaganda and incitement". He was 
arrested-in 1990 for involvement in the underground Democratic 
Front for the Salvation of China. 
  Dissidents were surprised by the tough treatment meted out 
to 
Zhai, who was not on parole and had had his full political 
rights restored.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other key players 
in the suppression of the democracy movement of 1989 have tried 
to dissociate themselves from the crackdown. 
  They have apparently already moved to head off any settling 
of scores which might take place after the death of patriarch 
Deng Xiaoping. 
  Chinese sources said that in recent internal addresses, Mr. 
Jiang made repeated reference to the way in which the student 
movement in Shanghai had been defused in a "peaceful" manner. 
Mr. Jiang was party boss of Shanghai before his elevation to 
party general- secretary on June 24, 1989. 
  The speeches were made in the context of measures the 
leadership was taking this year to prevent an outbreak of 
massive social disorder, the sources said yesterday. 
  "The central leadership must be careful and judicious in 
handling national disturbances," said Mr. Jiang in a 
thinly-veiled reference to June 4. "We in Shanghai were able to 
neutralise the trouble- making elements without upsetting 
stability." 
  The leadership decided soon after the crackdown to freeze 
the 
"Tiananmen Square issue", particularly the question of 
responsibility, until the death of Mr. Deng. 
  While the military side of the operation was supervised by 
Mr. Deng and Yang Shangkun, respectively the chairman and 
secretary- general of the Central Military Commission, Mr. Jiang 
played a sizeable role in crisis management, including ousting 
then-party chief Zhao Ziyang and other "bourgeois liberals" in 
the party. 
  "Technically, Jiang remained Shanghai party boss till late 
June 1989, and he can claim credit for the way the Shanghai 
leadership, including then-mayor Zhu Rongji, managed to put out 
the rebellion without bloodshed," a source said. 
  Diplomats in Beijing said that after Mr. Deng's death, three 
politicians would be susceptible to be made scapegoats: Premier 
Li Peng, Beijing party boss Chen Xitong, and his predecessor, Li 
Ximing. 
  "For the sake of unity, Deng's successors will not finger 
their patron," said a senior Western diplomat. "However, just 
as the Gang of Four were accused of misleading Chairman Mao, the 
two Li's and Chen might be stigmatised for giving Deng the wrong 
advice." 
  According to party sources, Li Ximing, who retired from the 
Politburo and his position of Beijing party boss in late 1992, 
recently tried to exonerate himself in a seminar on recent party 
history. "Historical events, including those in the party, were 
never caused by a small group of people," Mr. Li reportedly said. 
  The party sources said Mr. Deng's assessment of the severity 
of the student demonstrations in April and May 1989 were partly 
based on verbal accounts given to him by Mr. Li and Mr. Chen, 
then mayor of Beijing. Premier Li became the symbol of the 
suppression partly because he declared martial law in Beijing on 
May 20, 1989. However, the sources said, because he was not as 
close to Mr. Deng as Mr. Yang, Mr. Jiang or Mr. Li, his role in 
the decision to use drastic measures against the students might 
have been less than expected. 
  The sources said National People's Congress chairman Qiao 
Shi 
could benefit most from the "blame game" that would be played 
after Mr. Deng's demise. At a crucial meeting of the Politburo 
Standing Committee in late May, Mr. Qiao abstained from a vote 
on whether to move the troops to the capital.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Yu Zuomin, the most notorious village despot in 
recent Chinese history was subjected to a pre-trial popularity 
poll before being sentenced to 20 years for various crimes by a 
Tianjin court last August, sources have revealed. 
  Court officers personally visited the deputies to the 
Municipal People's Congress and People's Political Consultative 
Conference, asking them to choose one of three descriptions of 
Yu: "well-meaning peasant", "generally good but with small 
faults", or "ignorant village moneybags". 
  "More than 80 per cent of the delegates chose `ignorant 
village moneybags' (tuchan zhu)," a source said. "This proved 
to the court that nobody would protest against a stiff sentence." 
  Yu had been the head of the inordinately wealthy Daqiuzhuang 
village near Tianjin. Unconfirmed reports at the time of his 
sentencing suggested that Yu's case was taken all the way to the 
Politburo because lower-level legal functionaries believed that 
Yu had the personal protection of a senior Chinese leader. 
  The main reason for the delay in sentencing Yu was 
uncertainty about the popular response to throwing the book at 
the once-praised peasant hero, the source said. But the poll 
dispelled all doubts. 
  "This gave them confidence that the sentence would not be 
contentious as were many of those passed after June 4," he said, 
referring to harsh sentences dished out to Tianjin students 
after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which had caused 
resentment in the city. 
  Yu was sentenced to 10 years for bribery, six years for 
harbouring criminals, three years for obstructing justice and a 
total of six years for unlawful detention and control of others 
in a case involving the beating to death of a village worker in 
December 1992. Some of the terms will be served concurrently. 
  In publicity surrounding his trial, mainland media 
repeatedly 
criticised Yu and the 25 village henchmen sentenced along with 
him for their disrespect for and ignorance of the law. 
  Two weeks ago, China's procurator general, Zhang Siqing, 
mentioned Yu's case in his national work report as an example of 
"the small number of judicial officials and grass roots cadres 
who abuse their authority and detain people unlawfully." 
  However, the Daqiuzhuang issue remains a sensitive political 
topic in Tianjin, where officials have already quashed a 
proposal from the city's agricultural research institute to 
launch a study on "the Yu Zuomin Phenomenon in China". "It was 
believed this would go against Beijing's policy that Yu Zuomin 
should be treated as an isolated case which does not invalidate 
the economic achievements of many other rich villages whose 
leaders have a boldness of vision," a government researcher in 
the city said. 
  Yu is understood to be under tight guard at a rural Tianjin 
jail, where he complains about a lack of birds nest soup and 
Yunnan cigarettes. While under detention, Yu was accused of 
offering "tens of thousands of yuan" to bribe a court official 
to reveal details of the investigation. 
  Meanwhile, sources said Daqiuzhuang has been reopened to 
foreign visitors after a one-year off-limits policy. "The clan 
atmosphere has been done away with following the appointment of 
outsiders to take over," the source said. "Tianjin leaders feel 
it is safe to open it again." Experienced cadres from Jinghai 
county, which includes Daqiuzhuang, have been brought in to take 
over. 
  The government and party posts have been split to prevent a 
recurrence of the autocratic style of rule of Yu Zuomin, who was 
concurrently party secretary, village head and general manager 
of its main enterprise holding company. Ou Binju, former deputy 
director of Jinghai's foreign trade bureau, is the new mayor, 
while Wei Zongjing, former assistant county head of Jinghai, is 
the new party secretary. 
  Daqiuzhuang was promoted from a village to a town in 
November, giving it more access to public infrastructure 
spending, the source said. The village's economy, meanwhile, is 
showing signs of recovery from the incident, which idled many of 
its 300 factories in the first half of last year. 
  Ou told the People's Daily last month that residual problems 
caused by the factory shutdowns had been resolved by July or 
August last year. "But the greatest change in Daqiuzhuang is 
among the people," he said. "When the people meet with the 
business leaders of the village no longer do they meet the 
arrogant manner of the past." 
  The town aimed to increase its total output by 34 percent to 
7.5 billion renminbi in 1994, Ou said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hongtao (0491 3163 3447) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Senior 
Colonel Si Jiuyi, deputy to the National People's Congress and 
commander of the Yunnan Province Armed Police Corps, revealed at 
an exclusive interview with our staff reporter today that, in 
1993, the armed police and public security authorities in Yunnan 
cracked a total of over 4,000 drug cases, 27 of which were cases 
of armed drug trafficking; seized five metric tons of heroin and 
opium; and arrested over 6,000 criminals, among whom 473 were 
sentenced to death. 
  Si Jiuyi said: The drug problem is still very serious in 
Yunnan, as the temptation of money has encouraged large numbers 
of offenders to take the risk. The incidence of drug 
trafficking is showing an upward trend, and the following new 
developments have been observed. 
  An increase in major drug trafficking cases. After making 
some money, drug traffickers tend to try making colossal profits 
by engaging in transactions involving 100 kg, 200 kg, or even 
larger quantities of narcotics. 
  -- A steady growth in armed drug trafficking. Because they 
are aware of the consequences they will face after being 
arrested, drug traffickers often fiercely resist the armed 
police. Last year, Yunnan police seized a total of 33 military 
firearms, 13 other firearms, and 50 hand grenades. 
  -- Progressively better organized means of trafficking. Drug 
trafficking using cars and motorcycles is no longer a novelty. 
Criminals use mobile phones and walkie-talkies to communicate 
with one another and transport drugs through such methods as 
relaying or sending traffickers and drugs separately. 
  -- The increase in sources of drugs. Drugs used to only come 
from Burma's Golden Triangle, but now they are infiltrating into 
China from Laos and Vietnam. Last year, Yunnan's border towns 
Honghe and Wenshan cracked over 200 drug cases originating from 
Laos and Vietnam. 
  The increase of drug traffickers from other provinces. Last 
year, Yunnan police arrested nearly 900 drug traffickers from 
other provinces, and the scope of areas they came from increased 
from 22 provinces and autonomous regions in the previous year to 
27 provinces and autonomous regions. Most active were drug 
traffickers from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and 
Xinjiang. 
  Senior Colonel Si Jiuyi explained that the antinarcotic work 
is currently in a very difficult stage. As Yunnan borders on 
Vietnam, Burma, and Laos, the residents in the border areas 
share customs and languages with those three countries, and the 
border markers are not very clear, thus posing enormous 
difficulty for antinarcotic operations. Drug traffickers tend 
to be desperadoes. They even have such slogans as "You can 
execute me, but my future generations will benefit" or "I may 
stay in jail for a while, but I will enjoy prosperity for the 
rest of my life." Criminal organizations give pensions to the 
families of arrested or executed drug traffickers. Another 
problem is that antinarcotic operations are short of funds and 
manpower and suffer from backward equipment. In one case, a 
drug-fighting unit leader had to chase a criminal by bicycle. 
In the end, the criminal got away in a car. 
  Si Jiuyi said: Drugs from Yunnan harm not only Yunnan, but 
also the entire country. The antinarcotic work is of vital 
importance. No matter how difficult it is, we must not let drugs 
and firearms flow inland. By adopting the tactic of blocking on 
the first front, investigating on the second front, and 
intercepting on the third front and by relying on the support of 
the masses, Yunnan armed police forces have been able to conduct 
a stern crackdown on drug crimes and can bring about a steady 
increase in the number of cases cracked over the years. Many 
armed policemen have proved themselves to be valiant fighters, 
have rendered meritorious services, and have received awards. 
Two of China's 10 Young People of the Year are antinarcotic 
heroes from Yunnan. Si Jiuyi also revealed that over 20 
soldiers from the Yunnan armed police forces laid down their 
lives in antinarcotic battles over the past few years.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "The Big Freeze For Women in Job Mart"] </F>
  [Text] Zhang Ling recently attended a Beijing job fair 
full of optimism. 
  She was sure she could find a teaching job at a college, 
particularly at a time when education is the last choice for 
many university graduates. 
  But Zhang, who holds a master's degree from Beijing Normal 
University, was greeted by so many recruiters saying "we only 
want men" that she went to a corner at the bustling fair, angry 
and frustrated and on the verge of tears. 
  Zhang is not the only female who feels frozen out of job 
markets held for college seniors. 
  More than half of the posts at the exchanges read "men 
only." 
  Even occupations which are traditionally reserved for women, 
such as secretaries and teachers, are being taken by men. 
  While China's hot economy is demanding well-educated talent, 
bosses are ready to reject qualified female applicants. 
  And the problem is growing worse this year. 
  One reason is the streamlining of staff in government and 
enterprises to improve efficiency. 
  Also, some employers are reluctant to hire women because 
they 
think the women cannot go on business trips alone, cannot serve 
as business representatives abroad and are less career-minded 
once they get married and have children. 
  Liao Aidong, who majored in textile engineering, an industry 
which is not hiring many people this year, said no one responded 
to her applications, while male classmates readily secured jobs 
in Beijing textile mills. 
  Even women who graduate with "hot" degrees, such as computer 
programming and foreign languages, have to swallow their pride 
when men who didn't perform well in school are chosen over them 
by employers. 
  The Beijing Foreign Studies University has 300 graduates 
this 
year, 60 per cent of whom are women. 
  Nearly all the male graduates who wanted to stay in Beijing 
have signed contracts with employers, while less than half the 
women with the same desire have met with success. This is 
despite the fact that many of the women at the university do 
better on tests than the men. 
  Some schools are now taking steps to give women an equal 
chance. 
  The Beijing Foreign Studies University, for example, insists 
that a woman must be interviewed by a company before a man is 
recommended for an interview. Many schools have similar 
policies to persuade obstinate employers to hire women. 
  But according to an official with the University of 
International Business and Economics (UIBE), this tactic is 
backfiring this year. Many employers are now saying that if 
females are forced on them, they'll stop recruiting altogether. 
  Women at UIBE are told not to compete with men for the best 
jobs with the highest salaries or a chance to go abroad, 
according to school authorities. 
  "Girls must lower their expectations," said an official with 
UIBE. 
  But the situation is not always this downbeat. Some 
specialty areas are so short of qualified graduates that 
employers have no choice but to ignore the gender of applicants.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (CNS) -- More than 100,000 
persons are poisoned by chemicals used in agriculture annually 
in recent years in China, with the number poisoned in the course 
of production equalling those not engaged in production 
activities, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Ministry of Public Health. 
  In 1992, a total of 70,618 persons in 25 provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities suffered from poisoning 
from agricultural chemicals resulting in 8,620 deaths, 12.2 
percent of all those succumbing to such poisoning. In 1993, 
some 51,283 persons in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities were found to have been poisoned with 6,156 of 
them dying, making up 12 percent of all those poisoned. 
According to experts, some 60 percent of all such poisoning 
cases had gone unreported. 
  In the mid-eighties, there were many cases of such 
poisoning. 
The authorities in some provinces organized teams to prevent and 
treat such poisoning and educated peasants about how to use 
agricultural chemicals, reducing the occurrence of such 
poisoning. After 1987, the shortage of funds and a drop in the 
number of professional staff responsible for prevention and 
guidance work saw an increase in the number of people affected 
by such poisoning. The number of peasants using agricultural 
chemicals increased to over 100 million households made up of 
200 to 300 million individuals, leading to an increase in the 
number of people suffering from such poisoning.

<F P=106> [National People's Congress, NPC, Standing Committee Work </F>
Report, given by NPC Standing Committee Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun 
at the Second Session of the Eighth NPC on 15 March 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Fellow deputies: The 
Eighth NPC Standing Committee asked me to report to you the work 
it has accomplished since the first session, and the main 
projects it will do this year. Please examine the report. 
<H5>  I. The Main Projects Accomplished in the Past Year </H5>
  The Eighth NPC Standing Committee's five-year term is an 
important period for China to speed up building a socialist 
market economic system and achieve the second-step modernization 
goal. In accordance with the state's overall situation and 
tasks, the Standing Committee has laid down the main points of 
work for this term as well as these guidelines: Upholding the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
under the guidance of the party's basic line, we should regard 
the strengthening of socialist democracy and the legal system as 
the basic task, continue to improve the people's congress 
institution, safeguard the implementation of the Constitution 
and laws, and actively promote the development of the socialist 
market economy. Over the past year, the Standing Committee, in 
the light of this guiding thought, has earnestly discharged its 
constitutional responsibilities and made new headway in 
intensifying economic legislation, improving supervisory 
mechanisms, promoting reform and development, and safeguarding 
social stability. 
  (1) We Have Given First Priority to Economic 
Legislation and Achieved Remarkable Legislative Successes 
  The constitutional amendment adopted by the First Session of 
the Eighth NPC clearly provides that "the state shall institute 
a socialist market economy," and that the "state shall intensify 
economic legislation." In light of this constitutional 
requirement, the Standing Committee has given first priority to 
economic legislation and strove to build a basic legal framework 
governing the socialist market economy. The pace of legislation 
has accelerated noticeably over the past year. The Standing 
Committee has drawn up and revised and adopted decisions on 
legal issues on 21 laws, including 13 relevant to the socialist 
market economy. The Standing Committee has also approved 17 
treaties, conventions, and agreements. 
  To guide, promote, and safeguard the healthy development of 
the socialist market economy, the Standing Committee has drawn 
up some important laws for controlling the market, maintaining 
market order, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control. The provisions in the Company Law on the 
establishment, organization, and property-related 
responsibilities of limited liability companies and incorporated 
companies have been helpful for controlling the main market 
components, establishing a modern enterprise system, and 
promoting the development of the socialist market economy. The 
Law of Opposing Illegitimate Competition, the Law for Protecting 
Consumers' Rights and Interests, and the Law for Registered 
Accountants, as well as the Decision on Punishing the Crime of 
Producing and Selling Counterfeit and Inferior Commodities and 
the Decision on Interim Regulations Governing the Collection of 
Value- Added Tax, Consumption Tax, and Business Tax from Foreign 
Enterprises and Enterprises with Foreign Investment are playing 
an important role in maintaining market order, stopping 
illegitimate competition, improving macroeconomic regulation and 
control, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of 
parties of economic activities. The Agricultural Law has summed 
up China's experiences in carrying out rural reform and codified 
the state's responsibility systems dominated by contracts linked 
to family output, a system which has stabilized the rural areas. 
The law has also improved the two-tiered system which 
integrates unified management and separate management; and it 
has safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of 
agricultural organizations and farmers. The Law on Protecting 
Taiwan Countrymen's Investment was drawn up to protect Taiwan 
countrymen's investment, encourage them to invest in the 
mainland, and promote the economic development between the two 
sides of the Taiwan Strait. To keep pace with the needs in the 
development of the socialist market economy, the Standing 
Committee has also revised the Economic Contract Law, the 
Personal Income Tax Law, and the Accountancy Law; and it has 
examined the draft Budget Law, the Securities Law, the Foreign 
Trade Law, the Labor Law, and decided to present the draft 
Budget Law to the current NPC session for deliberations. 
  For the sake of promoting scientific-technological and 
educational development and the development of public health 
services, the Standing Committee has adopted the Law for 
Scientific and Technological Advancement, the Teachers Law, the 
Law Governing the Popularization of Agricultural Technology, and 
the Law for Red Cross Societies. The Law for Scientific and 
Technological Advancement has provided the legal basis for the 
state's basic policy that economic construction and social 
development must count on science and technology -- which in 
turn should be geared to the needs of economic construction and 
social development -- and has safeguarded the strategy that 
priority must be given to scientific and technological 
development. The formulation of the Teachers Law is conducive 
to safeguarding teachers' legitimate rights and interests; to 
building a contingent of ideologically, ethically, and 
professionally acceptable teachers; and to promoting the 
development of socialist education. Moreover, the Standing 
Committee has also adopted supplementary regulations for harshly 
punishing the crime of organizing and delivering people across 
the national borders, and it has examined the drafts of the 
State Compensation Law and the State Law on Conferring Medals 
and Honorary Titles. 
  The task of drawing up laws relevant to the socialist market 
economy is an urgent and formidable one. During the course of 
legislation, the Standing Committee has paid attention to: 1) 
approaching and dealing with issues and problems encountered in 
legislation, in following the guidance of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the basic 
party line, and on the basis of the Constitution; 2) carrying 
out the comprehensive investigation and study of socialist 
market economic laws, and drawing up legislative plans according 
to needs and feasibilities so that legislative affairs can 
proceed in a well- planned and selective manner; 3) fully 
mobilizing the initiatives of all quarters and giving scope to 
the role played by experts and scholars and the coordination 
between actual workers and theoretical workers; 4) improving 
organization, guidance, and coordination when laws were being 
drafted, urging the drafting units to complete their assignments 
on time, and ensuring the quality of the drafts; 5) proceeding 
from China's actual situation and bravely assimilating and 
emulating foreign countries' experiences, and making sure that 
our laws are in line with the features and rules of the 
development of the socialist market economy; that they are fair, 
impartial, open, and effective; and that they can further 
emancipate and develop productive forces. 
  (2) Strive To Improve and Strengthen Supervision, and 
Continue To Improve Supervisory Mechanisms 
  While speeding up the reform and opening up process and 
replacing the old economic system with a new one, the Standing 
Committee has intensified its supervision over legislative and 
other work. Over the past year, the Standing Committee and 
special committees, in centering around the state's priority 
projects and major issues about which the people are concerned, 
dispatched 37 inspection groups to inspect the implementation of 
18 laws. At the same time, the Standing Committee has also 
heard and examined reports submitted by the State Council and 
its departments as well as by the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
on the work in eight respects, including finance, foreign trade, 
education, administrative ethics, and civil aviation. The 
special committees were also briefed at regular intervals on the 
work of relevant departments. 
  The Standing Committee paid attention to actual performance 
while inspecting law enforcement. In view of the fact that 
people have responded strongly to public security problems, the 
Standing Committee has inspected the implementation of the 
Decision on Intensifying the Comprehensive Management of Public 
Security, underscored the need to be firm on promoting material 
civilization and socialist ethics at the same time, intensified 
the work of special organs, mobilized and organize all social 
sectors to deal with public offense, and exercised comprehensive 
management through various ways and means, thus harshly cracking 
down on railway and highway robberies, drug trafficking, the use 
of narcotics, prostitution, and other crimes and thus protecting 
the people's lives and property. In view of the rampancy of the 
crime of producing and selling bogus and inferior commodities, 
the Standing Committee has organized inspections of the 
implementation of the Decision on Punishing the Crime of 
Producing and Selling Bogus and Inferior Commodities, stressing 
the need to educate the people about the law until producers and 
traders understand that the quality of their goods must be 
accountable to society, and until consumers know how to protect 
their own rights and interests through the law as well as the 
need to reinforce law enforcement authorities, combat local 
protectionism, and ban the practice of paying fines in lieu of 
serving prison terms. To meet the need of establishing a modern 
enterprise system, the Standing Committee has also come up with 
views and suggestions on implementing the Enterprise Law, 
replacing enterprises' operating mechanisms, and making sure 
enterprises are able to enjoy their autonomy. Relevant special 
committees have also carried out extensive and deep-going 
inspections of the implementation of laws for environmental 
protection, and the media has achieved fairly good results with 
its continual reports which have prompted certain departments 
and regions to take measures to deal with pollution. 
  Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control was an 
important measure adopted by the state last year. The Standing 
Committee heard and deliberated on the "Report on the Current 
Financial Situation and Financial Policies and Measures" 
delivered by State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. The 
Standing Committee members endorsed the series of measures 
adopted by the State Council to improve and strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control and to rectify the 
financial order, and they made suggestions on deepening the 
reform of the financial system. The Standing Committee heard 
and deliberated on the reports of the State Planning Commission 
and the Finance Ministry on the implementation of the state plan 
and the state budget and examined and approved the 1992 state 
final accounts. To promote the deepening of the struggle 
against corruption, the Standing Committee heard and deliberated 
on the Supreme People's Procuratorate's "Report on the 
Investigation and Handling of Major Cases by Procuratorial 
Organs in the Struggle Against Corruption," affirmed the 
achievements of procuratorial organs in handling major cases to 
deal with corruption according to the law, and expressed strong 
support for law-enforcement organs' handling cases according to 
the law. The Standing Committee members hold that strengthening 
the building of a clean government and the fight against 
corruption is an important guarantee for the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure and that this has a bearing 
on the success or failure of the reform and the destiny of the 
state. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out this work 
constantly and unremittingly and see to it that it yields 
results. 
  In carrying out its supervisory work, the Standing Committee 
has paid attention to improving the supervisory mechanism and 
has exercised supervision according to the law. On the basis of 
summing up experiences in overseeing law enforcement in the past 
few years, the Standing Committee drew up "Some Provisions on 
Strengthening the Examination and Supervision of Law 
Enforcement," thus further institutionalizing this work and 
improving the procedures for carrying it out. To maintain a 
unified legal system for the state, the Standing Committee has 
examined the local laws and regulations submitted to it for the 
record and rectified the provisions that were in conflict with 
the laws. The Standing Committee's offices have also carefully 
studied and answered questions raised by local authorities on 
the implementation of laws. 
  (3) Deal Seriously With the Deputies' Motions and 
Proposals and Maintain Close Ties With the Masses 
  The raising of motions and proposals by deputies at the NPC 
session constitutes an important forum in which they exercise 
their right to administer the affairs of the state. This is 
conducive to putting state organs under the supervision of the 
masses and will help state organs improve their work. At the 
First Session of the Eighth NPC, the deputies raised 611 
motions, of which the motion raised by the Guangdong delegation 
on the establishment of the Preparatory Work Subcommittee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region was listed on the agenda of the session. Authorized by 
the NPC session, the Standing Committee decided to establish the 
preparatory work subcommittee, which has begun work. This is 
very important to ensure that China will resume the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong, to realize the smooth transfer of 
power in 1997, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity. 
Ninety-three motions were examined by specialized committees. 
Most of these motions concerned legislation. In making laws, 
the Standing Committee has fully considered and adopted the 
deputies' opinions. The other 517 motions were regard as 
proposals, criticisms, and opinions. These, as well as 2,325 
proposals put forward by the deputies, have been transferred by 
the General Office of the Standing Committee to the relevant 
units for study and handling. All of them have been answered. 
With the efforts of the units handling them, the motions and 
proposals have been handled more quickly than before, and the 
quality of their being handled has improved. 
  Inspections are an important way for the deputies to 
maintain 
ties with the masses, to understand the situation, and to 
reflect the masses' opinions and demands. Before the current 
session was convened, the NPC Standing Committee and the 
provincial-level people's congress standing committees jointly 
organized in 1993 NPC deputies to carry out inspections 
concerning the implementation of the development plan and 
budget, the transformation of the operating mechanisms of 
state-owned enterprises, the reduction of peasants' burdens, the 
efforts to improve public security, and the fight against 
corruption. They also organized the deputies from Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan Province to inspect some areas in 
Heilongjiang, Guangdong, and Fujian Provinces. During their 
inspection tours, they were serious about trying to understand 
the actual situation and offered some important opinions. The 
results were fairly good. 
  Good attention was paid to people's visits and letters. 
Over the past year, the Standing Committee handled 60,907 
letters and received 13,248 people. Through handling letters 
and receiving visitors, the Standing Committee urged concerned 
departments and locales to solve a number of urgent problems and 
thus promoted closer ties between state organs and the masses. 
  We have strengthened efforts to guide the work of standing 
committees of local people's congresses and to support local 
people's congresses in exercising their power according to the 
law. We have held discussion meetings attended by responsible 
comrades of standing committees of people's congresses at the 
provincial level to hear their opinions, exchange experiences 
with them, and study ways to further improve the work of 
people's congresses. The chairman and vice chairmen of the NPC 
Standing Committee made inspection trips to investigate 
situations in various places, to understand the work of local 
people's congresses, and to guide and assist local people's 
congresses in legislative work and the supervision of government 
work. The special committees and working departments of the NPC 
Standing Committee jointly held discussion meetings and 
symposiums with local people's congresses, and they have thus 
maintained closer ties. 
  (4) Actively Develop Contacts With Foreign Parliaments, 
Create a Favorable International Environment for China's Reform, 
Opening Up, and Modernization Drive 
  Making contacts with foreign parliaments is an important 
task 
of the Standing Committee and is also a component part of the 
state's foreign affairs. Over the past year, NPC delegations 
led by the chairman and vice chairmen of the NPC Standing 
Committee visited 26 countries. The NPC Standing Committee sent 
delegations to take part in six international conferences and 
received 37 delegations of foreign parliaments and international 
organizations. The special committees of the Standing Committee 
sent 12 delegations to visit 23 countries and to take part in 20 
related international meetings. Those committees received 59 
parliamentary committees and international organizations. The 
NPC Standing Committee adjusted or established 35 bilateral 
friendship teams between the NPC and foreign parliaments. The 
NPC Standing Committee also invited responsible persons of 
standing committees of people's congresses at the provincial 
level and NPC deputies to take part in the NPC's foreign affairs 
activities. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi's visit to the five ASEAN member countries 
has promoted exchanges between the Chinese NPC and the five 
countries' parliaments, strengthened contacts with the leaders 
of those countries, and consolidated and developed friendship 
and cooperation between China and those countries. His visit 
was of great significance to maintaining stability and 
prosperity in the Asia- Pacific region. Chairman Qiao Shi's 
visits to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria not only promoted 
exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and parliaments of the 
three countries but were also, through extensive contacts with 
the leaders of the three countries, conducive to increasing 
China's influence and promoting the development of China's 
relations with the three countries. His visits have 
strengthened cooperation and promoted the further improvement of 
relations between West European countries and China. The NPC 
delegations also visited the DPRK, the ROK, five Central Asian 
countries, three North European countries, and several other 
countries. Through those multilevel and multichannel foreign 
affairs activities, we have enhanced mutual understanding and 
trust with those countries, increased the influence of our 
country's reform and opening policy, and promoted the 
development of state relations. Through parliamentary 
diplomacy, we have promoted cooperation in economic, trade, 
scientific affairs and technology, education, culture, and other 
fields. Meanwhile, we have also paid attention to understanding 
and borrowing foreign experiences in legislation and economic 
construction. 
  The change in the international situation and the 
development 
of the domestic situation all require us to further strengthen 
the NPC's foreign affairs to expand our influence, make friends, 
promote friendship and cooperation with foreign parliaments and 
people, and create a favorable international environment for 
China's socialist modernization, reform, and opening up. From 
now on, we will continue to implement our country's foreign 
policy, give full play to the role of parliamentary diplomacy, 
and further improve the NPC's conduct of foreign affairs. 
  (5) Strengthen the Building of the Standing 
Committee's Organizational Structure and Bring the Special 
Committees Into Play 
  In light of the new situation's demands on the People's 
Congress, the Standing Committee has given strategic importance 
to strengthening its own construction, particularly the building 
of its organizational structure. It has drawn up the "Rules for 
NPC Standing Committee Members," which urge Standing Committee 
members to study hard the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the Constitution and laws, to 
maintain close ties with the masses, to be honest, and to obey 
the institution of the congress and its work disciplines, and to 
discharge their responsibilities strictly according to the law. 
It has revised and perfected such work regulations as the 
"Rules of Procedure for the Chairmanship Meeting" and the "Work 
Regulations for the Secretariat" so that the Standing Committee 
has some regulations to follow in carrying out its routine work. 
Each special committee has also formulated or revised work 
regulations and rules of procedure and has stipulated rules on 
Standing Committee members' responsibilities, the institution of 
the congress, and its work procedures. 
  The special committees are the NPC's permanent 
organizations. 
When the congress is not in session, they are under the Standing 
Committee's leadership. Its work is characterized by regularity 
and specifics. Giving full play to the special committees is 
crucial to the Standing Committee in carrying out such tasks as 
legislation and supervision. Last year, the Standing Committee 
held two discussion meetings for persons in charge of the 
special committees to study issues such as strengthening the 
construction of the special committees and to help carry out the 
special committees' work. Over the past year, each special 
committee has actively discharged its responsibilities, has 
helped the Standing Committee exercise its authority, and has 
done a great deal and scored marked achievements in studying, 
deliberating, and working out legal and other motions; in 
monitoring law enforcement, in hearing reports from the 
departments concerned, and in carrying out special 
investigations and activities related to foreigners. 
  The Standing Committee attaches importance to strengthening 
organizational construction. Its chairman and vice chairmen 
have held many meetings of public functionaries in calling for 
organizational construction. Over the past year, public 
functionaries have earnestly studied Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the Constitution 
and laws and have improved cadres' political integrity and 
professional level. Various departments and units have 
instituted the responsibility system to accelerate the pace of 
work, to improve work efficiency, and to ensure the completion 
of various tasks. 
  Over the past year, with the support of all its deputies and 
local people's congresses, the Standing Committee has made new 
progress and scored greater achievements in various tasks. In 
the meantime, we must also note that there are some 
imperfections in our work. They are mainly: Legislation does 
not completely meet the needs of reform, opening up, and 
economic development; supervision is still weak, particularly 
the checking and supervising of law enforcement; and the 
building of the Standing Committee itself does not meet the new 
situation's demands on the People's Congress. We should adopt 
effective measures to overcome these shortcomings step by step. 
  II. The Main Tasks for the Coming Year 
  The year 1994 will be a crucial year for China to accelerate 
the establishment of a market economic structure and to maintain 
the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. 
Under the guidance of the theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the Standing Committee will fully 
implement the guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress and the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, make 
the construction of socialist democracy and legality its 
fundamental task, and earnestly carry out the functions vested 
in it by the Constitution and other laws. We should go deeply 
into the realities of life and mingle with the masses, carry out 
research and investigations, solicit the views of the masses, 
pay constant attention to and understand the new problems that 
crop up in the course of economic development, assess various 
situations that may affect social stability and the smooth 
implementation of reform, offer constructive suggestions, and 
properly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability. We should speed up the drafting of economic laws 
and exercise efficient supervision over law enforcement and the 
implementation of reform measures. All the Standing Committee's 
work must be subject to and serve the overall tasks of seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and preserving stability. 
  (1) Continue To Give Top Priority to Economic 
Legislation To Meet the Needs of Developing a Socialist Market 
Economy. 
  This will be a year in which relatively more reform measures 
will be announced. Therefore, laws are needed to guide, 
promote, and ensure reform. This presents a rather urgent 
demand for speeding up the pace of legislation, and economic 
legislation in particular. We will continue to give top 
priority to economic legislation and develop, step by step, a 
system of laws that meets the needs of developing a socialist 
market economy. 
  The Standing Committee has adopted a five-year legislative 
program. At the top of the legislative agenda are major laws 
that standardize market practices, strengthen macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and perfect the social security system. 
Also on the agenda are laws that are designed to promote 
socialist democracy, strengthen the organizational system of 
state organs, punish crimes, safeguard public order, promote the 
development of science, education, and culture; protect the 
environment, and strengthen the national defense buildup. When 
the program is accomplished, a general framework of laws 
governing the socialist market economy will have come into being 
and laws governing other areas will have been strengthened. The 
Standing Committee should provide more effective guidance, 
coordination, and supervision over the implementation of the 
legislative program. In addition to fulfilling their own 
law-drafting tasks, the NPC special committees should step up 
coordination with other law-drafting units. All units with 
law-drafting responsibilities must assign personnel and set a 
schedule to ensure that their law-drafting tasks are completed 
on time with high quality. 
  According to the legislative program, quite a number of laws 
will be formulated this year. We should draw up a plan on the 
basis of their importance and urgency so that urgently needed 
laws will be formulated first. It is necessary to sum up in a 
timely fashion the experience gained from reform measures being 
implemented and, wherever possible, to standardize and codify 
into laws what has been learned. We should step up the 
formulation of the central bank law, the commercial bank law, 
the auditing law, the foreign trade law, the futures trade law, 
the real estate law, the securities law, the instruments law, 
the guarantor law, the trust law, the insurance law, the 
arbitration law, and the labor law. We must also speed up the 
drafting of laws in other areas whenever conditions are ripe. We 
should embrace new ideas in regard to the socialist market 
economy, be bold in exploring new ways, dare to experiment, and 
increase the pace and quality of legislative work to meet the 
needs of reform and development. 
  (2) We Must Successfully Carry Out Inspections of and 
Supervision Over Law Enforcement To Promote the Implementation 
of Various Reform Measures. 
  Reform is an undertaking of all the people across the 
country 
and is in their greatest interests. The Standing Committee must 
proceed from the fundamental interests of the people, bring 
every positive factor into full play, and give full support to 
and promote the smooth implementation of various reform 
measures. On the basis of the duties and powers prescribed by 
the Constitution, the Standing Committee must represent the will 
of the people to further carry out inspections of and 
supervision over law enforcement and strengthen its supervision 
over administrative, judicial, and procuratorial work by making 
its efforts revolve around the major issues of reform and 
construction. 
  The Standing Committee must place the inspection of and 
supervision over law enforcement at the top of its work agenda, 
conscientiously carry out "Certain Regulations on Strengthening 
the Inspection of and Supervision Over Law Enforcement," and 
step up supervision to produce more concrete results therefrom. 
This year, it must focus its inspection and supervision on the 
enforcement of the laws on the market economy, and in particular 
it must organize a force to carry out in-depth inspections of 
the enforcement of the newly adopted laws on maintaining order 
in the market and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control in a bid to promote the healthy development of the 
socialist market economy. It must continue to successfully 
conduct inspections of and supervision over the enforcement of 
the laws on maintaining public security and cracking down on 
various criminal activities so as to maintain social order, 
protect social stability, and promote the building of spiritual 
civilization. 
  To promote the development of economic construction as well 
as reform and opening up, the Standing Committee must hear in a 
time manner work reports by the State Council and its relevant 
departments, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate; supervise the implementation of various 
reform measures; and support and urge them to do a good job. It 
must strengthen supervision over the implementation of the 
national economic and social development plan as well as the 
state budget, and it must guarantee the smooth implementation of 
the plan and budget approved by the NPC session. The Standing 
Committee must intensify its supervision over the work ethics of 
elected and appointed personnel of the NPC and the Standing 
Committee itself. Whenever corrupt personnel who have committed 
graft or have accepted bribes are discovered, those deserving 
dismissal should be dismissed, and those who have broken the law 
shall have their criminal responsibilities investigated 
according to the law. We must support and urge law-enforcement 
authorities to enforce the law strictly and we must intensify 
their efforts in handling major cases. We must seriously handle 
the masses' appeals, accusations, and reports. We must also 
constantly sum up the experiences that we have gained while 
exercising supervision so that our supervision will be even more 
standardized and institutionalized. 
  (3) We Must Create a Good, Law-Conscious Environment 
by Heightening the Entire Society's Sense of Law. 
  Heightening the entire society's sense of law is an 
important 
aspect in building our socialist system and an essential 
requirement for the modernization drive to move forward 
smoothly. The development of reform, opening up, and 
modernization requires people in society, especially leading 
cadres at all levels, to have a higher sense of the law. 
China's feudal society had a several- thousand-year history, 
and we do not have a tradition of democracy and law. Because of 
this, as well as the fact that we have become used to, over a 
long period of time, managing and handling economic and social 
affairs simply by means of administrative measures, some cadres 
and people have only a faint sense of the law, and they do not 
do things according to the law. Some cadres approach laws with 
a pragmatic attitude and do not enforce those which are not in 
their favor. Some have even abused their authority and openly 
violated laws to protect the interests of their own regions, 
departments, and units. This situation is incongruous with the 
development of the socialist market economy. Solving this 
problem is an urgent, protracted, and formidable mission which 
must be accomplished earnestly by making persistent and untiring 
efforts. 
  To heighten society's sense of the law, the most fundamental 
measure is to educate the people. The Standing Committee must 
consider it a routine but important task to publicize the 
knowledge of the law and to educate the public about the legal 
system. It should fully utilize the media, such as television 
and radio stations and the press, to create a powerful momentum 
for the propagation of the law. We must see to it that all 
departments and local authorities make continual efforts in 
educating the people about the law, publicizing the 
Constitution, and popularizing legal knowledge about the market 
economy so that the masses will understand the law, obey it, and 
know how to use it to protect their legitimate rights and 
interests. We must uphold the authority of the Constitution and 
other laws. All organizations and individuals must consider the 
Constitution to be their fundamental code of conduct, and no one 
has the privilege of overstepping the Constitution or other 
laws. Personnel of all state organs, especially those in 
leading positions, must take the initiative in studying and 
understanding the law, in setting the example of observing the 
law, and in knowing how to handle all affairs using legal 
measures. While electing or dismissing cadres, the NPC and its 
Standing Committee should consider whether the cadres have the 
necessary knowledge of the law and whether they are earnest in 
enforcing the law as a yardstick of their competence. We must 
build a stronger contingent of law enforcers, improve their 
quality and competence, and make sure that all laws are strictly 
enforced and that whoever violates the law is punished. In 
short, in order to create a good legal system facilitating 
reform and construction, we must take all effective measures to 
gradually correct the situation under which people are unaware 
of the existence of the law or do not strictly enforce laws if 
they are aware of their existence, and to help the public 
understand that it is an honor to obey the law and shameful to 
break it, and that things should be done according to the law. 
  (4) The Standing Committee Should Strengthen Itself by 
Creating a Strong Contingent of NPC Cadres. 
  Under the new situation, the tasks confronting the Standing 
Committee are arduous, and it must build itself into a stronger 
organ. Members of the Standing Committee and cadres of all its 
organs must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works and 
arm their minds and guide their work with the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must fully 
understand that building a socialist democratic legal system is 
an important part of modernization and that the NPC works at the 
forefront of building the democratic legal system. We must 
concentrate our efforts, work cautiously, and earnestly 
discharge our responsibilities so as to live up to the people's 
high expectations. 
  The Standing Committee must continue to reform and improve 
its organizational and operational systems and rationalize the 
relationships between various departments so that its discussion 
of state affairs can be even more efficient. NPC organs must 
proceed with their structural reform in order to become more 
consolidated, streamlined, and efficient. To adapt to the needs 
caused by increasingly arduous legislative and supervisory 
projects, we must have stronger legislative organs and research 
and consultative organs. To this end, we must improve the mix 
of cadres, improve cadres' proficiency, reinforce these organs 
with specialists and experienced personnel, and intensify the 
training of cadres so that the NPC will gradually have a 
contingent of dedicated cadres who are armed with the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, who are 
knowledgeable about the Constitution and other laws, who have 
established close ties with the masses, and who discharge their 
duties earnestly and honestly. 
  Fellow deputies! The people's congress system is a basic 
political system of China. Upholding and improving this system 
has extremely important significance for ensuring the people's 
role as masters of their own house, for consolidating the 
political power characterized by the people's democratic 
dictatorship, for fully arousing the people's enthusiasm to 
build socialism with Chinese characteristics, for safeguarding 
the state's long-term peace and stability, and for expediting 
the progress of reform, opening up, and modernization. This 
year marks the 40th anniversary of the NPC's founding. We 
should commemorate this anniversary by focusing on the brilliant 
course which the NPC has traversed in its development, by 
broadly publicizing the superiority of the NPC system, and by 
heightening people's understanding of the importance of making 
the NPC more efficient under the new situation so that the NPC 
and its Standing Committee can play their parts more 
effectively. Under the guidance of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and that of the party's 
basic line, we must explore actively, press forward, and work 
hard to do an even better job so as to play our parts in seizing 
even greater victories in reform and construction!

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- The central earth 
station for the "Fengyun No. 2" static meteorological satellite 
to be launched has recently been completed in the northwestern 
suburbs of Beijing, official sources said here today. 
  The sources said all the equipment in the station has been 
tested is now ready for the launch of the static satellite. 
  The sources said signals and data from the satellite at 
36,000 km in outer space will be received and processed at high 
speed in the station and then transferred to meteorological 
stations across the country. 
  The station will also be able to realize remote control and 
exact positioning of the satellite, the sources said. 
  Among similar stations in China, the sources said, the new 
station possesses the most functions and the highest technical 
level. Its overall technological and automation levels match 
the most advanced in the world. 
  The launch of the "Fengyun No. 2" satellite and the 
operation 
of the central station will greatly improve China's mid- and 
long-term meteorological forecasting. The whole Asian and 
Pacific region will directly benefit from them, the sources said. 
  The earth station system was developed by the Chinese 
Research Institute of Space Technology, and its cost is only 
one-third of the imported version of such a system, the sources 
added.

  [Text] Lanzhou, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists 
have made headway in a comprehensive investigation of the 
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. 
  The investigation is being carried out by researchers from 
various institutes under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 
some universities. 
  Scientists on the investigation team say that they have 
completed the first-phase work of outdoor collection of data and 
samples for the "systematic research of the formation, 
evolution, environmental changes and ecology of the 
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau". The scheme has been listed into the 
state's Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991- 1995). 
  The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts from the Kunlun mountain 
range in the north and ends at the Himalaya mountain range in 
the south. The plateau has a total area of 2.5 million sq km and 
an average elevation of 4,000 m. 
  Initial surveys started last year, and latest scientific 
research reveals that conditions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau 
have a great impact on the climate and environment of the entire 
globe, especially the direction of monsoons and the climate of 
the hinterland of the Asian Continent.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese farmers are 
using various forms of energy to replace the traditional 
firewood and straw, according to an official with the State 
Planning Commission. 
  Since the 1980s more and more of China's rural areas have 
begun to develop methane, electric, solar, wind and geothermal 
energy. 
  Electricity is now accessible to 87 percent of China's rural 
areas, and 5.8 million Chinese households are benefiting from 
methane, which is clean and easy to use. 
  Hogpens and toilets, which used to breed flies and 
mosquitoes, have become enclosed methane-generating pits. Offal 
and waste water from slaughterhouses are also being used to 
produce methane. 
  While exploiting new forms of energy, farmers have been 
motivated to save as much energy as possible. At present, 150 
million Chinese farmers are using firewood-saving stoves. 
  Statistics show that the energy newly developed and saved in 
China's rural areas each year is equal to that produced by 80 
million tons of standard coal. 
  But experts said there is still a long way to go before the 
energy problem in rural areas can be solved fundamentally. 
While 120 million rural people still have no access to 
electricity, there is also much waste of energy.

<F P=106> [By Liu Hsiao-hua (0491 2556 5478): "Jiang Zemin Fosters </F>
High-Ranking Military Officers for Next Century"] 
  [Text] A new military leadership reshuffle was recently 
carried out. 
  Central Military Commission (CMC) Chairman Jiang Zemin was 
in 
charge of the reshuffle and Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang 
Zhen joined him in making personnel arrangements. 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin Reorganized the Army on Deng Xiaoping's Advice </H5>
  Before reorganizing the Army leadership, Jiang asked Deng 
for 
advice. This has been the third major personnel reshuffle 
involving high-ranking officers since Jiang was appointed CMC 
chairman. The first reshuffle took place in late April 1990 and 
the second in November 1992. The current reshuffle, which took 
place two years after the last one, involved the seven military 
regions and all navy and air force branches of the armed 
services. 
  Lieutenant General Zhang Gong, who was in charge of the 
CMC's 
day-to-day work and was promoted very quickly under Yang Baibing 
(former CMC secretary general and General Political Department 
director), was, after the 14th CPC National Congress, 
transferred to Sichuan to the post of political commissar of the 
Chengdu Military Region. Recently, he was appointed political 
commissar of the Academy of Military Sciences and the vacancy 
was filled by Lieutenant General Zhang Zhijian. 
  Lieutenant General Li Laizhu was appointed commander of the 
Beijing Military Region, replacing Wang Chengbin. 
  Lieutenant General Li Xinliang (former deputy political 
commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region) was appointed 
political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region. 
  Lieutenant General Fang Zuqi (former director of the 
political department of the Beijing Military Region) was 
appointed political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. 
  Lieutenant General Zhou Kunren (former political commissar 
of 
the South China Sea Fleet) was appointed political commissar of 
the navy. 
  Lieutenant General Tao Bojun succeeded Li Xinliang as deputy 
commander of the Guangzhou Military Region. 
  Lieutenant General Zou Yuqi was appointed deputy commander 
of 
the Lanzhou Military Region. 
  Xu Caihou was promoted to deputy director of the General 
Political Department and chief of JIEFANGJUN BAO. 
  Young General Zhou Youliand was promoted to deputy director 
of the General Logistics Department. 
<H5>  Training Successors to Military Leaders Is An Urgent Need </H5>
  It is imperative for China's party and government leaders to 
train young successors and so it is for military leaders. In a 
sense, the latter is more urgent. This is because incumbent 
senior military leaders are a little too old--many of them are 
over 60--and were injured in the War of Liberation and took part 
in the Korean War. CMC Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang 
Zhen, who helped Jiang Zemin (who was born in 1926) in taking 
care of military affairs, are 78 and 79 respectively. Since 
China is set to achieve the four modernizations (including 
modernization of national defense) by the end of this century, 
it has to update its weaponry using modern science and 
technology, including electronics, and try to catch up with the 
world's most advanced countries in terms of military 
professions, equipment, and strategy. The task is impressive 
and competent people, rather than old people, will play a 
decisive role in fulfilling it. For this reason, after the 
recent enlarged CMC meeting, Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Zhang 
Zhen resolutely reshuffled the high-level leadership of the Army 
and promoted younger officers in all military regions and in all 
services and arms to leadership positions. It is safe to say 
that this is a farsighted move. 
<H3>  Li Peng Said: "Not All Is Well in Today's World and 
Unpredictable Factors Never Reduce But Increase." </H3>
  Li Peng said: "World politics and economic relations are 
moving in the direction of multipolarization at an ever greater 
pace. The international situation is complicated and ever 
changing and the unpredictable factors never reduce but 
increase. Not all is well in today's world and the questions of 
peace and development remain the two top priorities on the 
international agenda today. We must be prepared for danger in 
times of peace. To maintain China's long rule and stability, 
China's Army must always be prepared against war." 
<H3>  What Is the Reason for the Current Military Leadership 
Reshuffle? </H3>
  Some overseas observers believe that the reason for Jiang 
Zemin's urgent reshuffle of the military leadership was that 
Deng Xiaoping's health has begun to break up. It seems that 
this is not the case. The actual reason is that the CPC 
hierarchy is preparing the Army for the next century by updating 
it.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Yanning (1728 1750 1337) from "Earnestly Study the </F>
`Decision' of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee" column: "My Understanding in Three Points on 
Establishing a Modern Enterprise System"] 
  [Text] In the "decision" adopted at its third plenum, the 
14th CPC Central Committee clearly defined the objectives of 
enterprise reform in China for the next period. It also 
proposed that a modern enterprise system, characterized by 
distinct relations between ownership and management and between 
power and responsibility, the separation of government functions 
from those of enterprises, and scientific management, be 
gradually instituted. This important move shows a certain depth 
of theory and is a very significant act. 
<H5>  I. The Basic Characteristics of the Modern Enterprise System </H5>
  The "decision" pointed out the five basic 
characteristics of the modern enterprise system as follows: 1) 
The distinct relations between ownership and management of an 
enterprise with entire corporate property rights [fa ren cai 
chan quan 3127 0086 6299 3934 2938] formed by the investment of 
all investors, including the state. 2) The right of 
independent operations in accordance with the law, as well as 
the obligations of assuming sole responsibility for its own 
profits and losses, paying taxes according to regulations, and 
undertaking to preserve and increase the value of assets 
contributed by investors. 3) The limited rights and 
responsibilities of the investors. 4) The ability of 
organizing production and operation in light of market demands. 
5) A scientific leadership structure and an organizational 
management system. These characteristics are integrated, 
but the most important are the explicit corporate property 
system and the limited liability system of an enterprise. 
  The institution of a modern enterprise system calls for 
a perfect corporate property system in an enterprise. 
Under the traditional planned economic structure, state-owned 
enterprises, being subsidiaries of state administrative organs, 
did not have independent legal person status. In the course of 
practicing the planned commodity economy a few years ago, 
although the state instituted a legal person system in 
enterprises through legislation, it was still incomplete. In 
name, state-owned enterprises had legal person status, but in 
reality they lacked independent property rights that legal 
persons must possess, so they found it difficult to establish a 
restraining mechanism for properties, and the state still had to 
assume unlimited liabilities for them. Meanwhile, enterprises 
were not real independent legal persons because they also found 
it difficult to operate independently and assume 
responsibilities for their own profits and losses. 
  To state-owned enterprises, the essence of the 
enterprise corporate property system is the confirmation of 
ownership belonging to the state and the independent corporate 
property rights belonging to enterprises. On this basis, 
enterprises can enjoy civil rights, undertake civil 
responsibilities, solve the problem of having someone to bear 
responsibilities in enterprises, and unify enterprises' capacity 
to exercise civil rights and capacity to dispose of business, so 
that enterprises can really become a legal entity capable of 
operating independently and assuming responsibilities for their 
own profits and losses. To define enterprise corporate 
property rights, the crucial point is to straighten out 
relations between ownership and management (chiefly, to draw a 
clear demarcation between ownership and management, diversify 
the main bodies of ownership and management, and to make the 
trading of ownership and management convenient and the operation 
of ownership and management effective, and so on). In addition, 
the ownership of an investor (referring to the state) should be 
separated from the property rights of a legal person (referring 
to an enterprise). 
  Under certain conditions, the ownership of an investor is 
manifested by his possession of shareholder's rights. That is, 
he can take benefits derived from the assets as a shareholder 
according to the law, participate in making major policy 
decisions (generally including enterprise's operating 
principles, long-term investment plans, fiscal budgets and final 
accounts, examination and approval of plans to distribute 
profits and redress losses, increase or decrease of authorized 
capital, major changes in ownership and management, and others), 
and select managerial personnel. The investors can neither 
exercise direct control over all corporate properties nor those 
parts belonging to themselves. They can use the rights vested 
with shareholders to exert influence on enterprises' actions, 
but cannot directly interfere in enterprises' operational 
activities. When an enterprise goes bankrupt, the investors 
will only assume limited liability on the enterprise's debts 
according to the capital amount they have contributed to the 
enterprise. The corporate property rights are demonstrated by 
the enterprise's right to own and use the corporate property, 
obtain initial profits, and punish relevant personnel, as well 
as the enterprise's responsibility for its own operational 
activities. The ownership of the investors and the corporate 
property rights are confirmed and protected by the law and are, 
therefore, sacred and inviolable. 
  Another characteristic of the modern enterprise 
system is shown in its scientific organizational structure, 
clear division of duties, and sound checking, balancing, and 
restraining mechanisms. A company system has been 
practiced in the course of reorganizing state-owned enterprises, 
under which a company is constituted according to its corporate 
property, and new leading bodies including a general meeting of 
shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, and so 
on are set up in accordance with the law. The chairman of a 
board of directors is the corporate representative of an 
enterprise, and the managers are appointed by the board of 
directors and should be responsible to it, which is different 
from the former factory director (or manager) responsibility 
system. Various independent but interacting ties with clearly 
stipulated powers and responsibilities are formed between the 
operators and producers through the company's power organs, 
decisionmaking organs, and supervisory organs, and are defined 
and realized in line with the law and the articles of 
corporation. Its core is to establish a power structure of the 
shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, and 
managerial personnel at different levels, and to form a 
restraining, checking, and balancing mechanism to coordinate the 
relations among shareholders, corporate representatives, 
operators, staff, and workers, through the operation of the 
company's organizational system including the shareholders' 
general meeting, board of directors, executive body, board of 
supervisors, and so on. In the meantime, modern management 
methods and means will be adopted to improve and enhance the 
specialized and comprehensive management of an enterprise in 
various areas. The three reform measures of the enterprise 
system will be carried out in light of the requirements on 
enterprises in practicing a socialist market economy, while the 
enterprise's administrative rating will be canceled and the 
bounds between cadres and workers broken. 
  The organizational system of a company in Western, developed 
countries has a different characteristic. In the composition of 
shareholders, shares are mainly held by a corporate body. Like 
Japan and Germany, corporate shareholders are mainly banks or 
other enterprises. In Britain and the United States, however, 
they are mainly retirement funds, insurance companies, and so 
on, rather than banks or other financial institutions. U.S. law 
prohibits banks from holding shares. Owing to different 
compositions of shareholders, there are varying management 
structures in the companies of various countries. The board of 
directors in a Japanese company has more internal directors who 
are members of senior management nominated by the general 
manager (or president), and shareholders play a comparatively 
limited role. In the United States, about two-thirds of the 
company directors are from shareholders, because the law 
provides that external directors must hold a certain proportion 
of a listed company, and some committees of the company must be 
constituted by external directors. In Germany and some northern 
European countries, a dual board of directors system is 
practiced, under which the board of supervisors makes strategic 
policies and exercises supervisory functions, while the board of 
directors acts as an executive managerial department composed of 
senior administrative personnel. The German law also provides 
that one-third or one-half of the members of a board of 
supervisors must be elected from staff and workers so that they 
can participate in decisionmaking. 
  There is a new development trend in the corporate management 
structure in some large international companies. For example, 
the ownership has undergone an extensively diversified and 
decentralized transformation, the shareholders have no longer 
exercised a direct control over enterprises, the board of 
directors has changed its functions from management to 
supervision and policymaking, the power in operation and 
management has been shifted to enterprise operators, and the 
operators' limits of authority have been enlarged. These 
different organizational systems relating to companies are 
constantly changing and making adjustments in various countries 
and at varying economic development stages. Although they have 
disadvantages as well as advantages, on the whole, they are 
effective and relatively scientific and reasonable. The 
"company law" promulgated by China and various implementation 
measures now being formulated have drawn in some useful parts of 
the systems practiced in Western companies. China has also 
worked out relatively clear stipulations on company's 
organizational system in light of the national situations. In 
future experiments and operations, we should repeatedly have it 
revised and refined to meet the emerging problems. 
<H3>  II. The Company System Is a Major Organizational Form of 
the Modern Enterprise System </H3>
  Under the traditional planned economic structure, the 
organizational forms of enterprises in China were differentiated 
by their ownership nature. In fact, it was an operational mode 
of unified state control over revenue and expenditure. But, 
according to the requirement of a market economy, the modern 
enterprise organizational forms are differentiated by the 
organizational forms of property and the legal rights and 
responsibilities that are undertaken. 
  In most cases, a company system is adopted as a form of 
the modern enterprise organizational systems and is a main legal 
form of such systems under the market economic structure. 
Under this structure, the systems of enterprises are numerous 
and varied. Distinguished by properties, they can be wholly 
owned enterprises, partnership enterprises, cooperative 
enterprises, enterprises with a company system, and so on. The 
state-owned enterprises can also be in many forms, which chiefly 
include state wholly owned limited companies, state-owned 
companies with limited liability (whose shares are held by legal 
persons), and state holding limited companies. The "company 
law" promulgated by China also includes an exclusively 
state-funded company as a form of limited liability company -- a 
state wholly owned company. In recent years, such state wholly 
owned companies have also been legally approved in some Western 
countries and have attained relatively good results. The 
advantage of a "state wholly owned company with limited 
liability" is that investor can really represent the interests 
of the state, which is conducive to exercising macroeconomic 
regulation and control, optimizing product mix, and playing a 
backbone role in economic development. 
  A limited liability company and a joint-stock limited 
company are the principal forms of reorganizing state-owned 
enterprises to practice a company system, and both cover 
operations which are aimed at earning profits. With regard 
to a limited liability company, the liability undertaken by a 
shareholder to the company is limited to the amount of capital 
he has paid, and the company undertakes limited liability for 
its debts with its total assets. With regard to a joint-stock 
limited company, its total capital is divided into an equal 
amount of shares, a shareholder undertakes his limited liability 
to the company with the number of shares he holds, and the 
company undertakes limited liability for its debts with its 
total assets. At present, the establishment of joint-stock 
companies in China has just begun, and the procedures for 
setting up a joint-stock limited company are strict, because its 
articles of corporation should be standardized and accounts 
publicized. Hence, many enterprises can hardly meet the 
requirements. Relatively speaking, a limited liability company 
has the general advantages of enterprises with a company system. 
As shares are only subscribed internally, they have relatively 
fewer shareholders and simpler procedures. Therefore, at the 
initial stage of practicing a company system in state-owned 
enterprises, it is suitable to reorganize them into one-share or 
multi-share limited liability companies first. Some of them can 
be reorganized into joint-stock limited companies, which only 
absorb the staff and workers of the enterprises as shareholders. 
As to some exceptionally large state-owned enterprises, they 
can also be reorganized into enterprise groups controlled by 
companies with limited liability or companies limited by shares. 
A listed joint- stock limited company means that the stocks 
issued by this company can be listed in a stock exchange for 
trading provided that it has been approved by the state 
administration for securities. The procedural requirements for 
its incorporation are relatively strict. Internationally, the 
general requirements for a listed company and the listing of its 
stocks are chiefly as follows: 1) Whether it accords with the 
country's law on the trading of securities and the capital 
amount for a listed company as stipulated by the stock exchange; 
2) the operational performance and major profit-making 
capabilities; 3) the capital structure -- the composition of 
self- possessed funds and borrowed funds; 4) the capability of 
debt repayment; 5) the standards for distribution of stock 
rights and the maintenance of adequate liquidity; 6) the market 
prices of stocks to be listed for trading; and so on. The 
"company law" promulgated in China sets out similar requirements 
and pertinent stipulations on the temporary suspension of 
trading and termination of listing. Because stock trading 
involves the public interests of investors in society, only a 
small number of enterprises with high returns, steady growth, 
and a good reputation will be established as this type of 
companies according to the law. 
<H3>  III. The Points for Attention Concerning the Practice of a 
Company System in Reorganizing the State-Owned Enterprises </H3>
  The "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee pointed out: "The practice of a company 
system in the state-owned enterprises is a useful exploration 
for the institution of a modern enterprise system." The company 
system is an effective form of realizing the modern enterprise 
system. The reorganization of state-owned enterprises into 
those with a company system should proceed from China's actual 
conditions. We must be aware that the transformation of 
enterprises from the previous "factory system" to the present 
"company system" is a major change in China in respect of the 
enterprise system, which is of vital significance to 
emancipating and developing the productive forces and ensuring 
the success in enterprise reforms. This is why we must make 
great efforts to do the work well. 
  1. The reorganization of state-owned enterprises to 
practice a company system is aimed at thoroughly transforming 
enterprise operational mechanisms and forming a new modern 
enterprise system. During experiments with the joint-stock 
system and enterprise groups in the past few years, some 
enterprises placed the transformation of operational mechanisms 
in a secondary position, while others thought that the 
establishment of joint-stock companies simply meant turning 
property rights into stocks and listing them on the stock 
exchange for trading, regarding this as a short cut for raising 
funds and setting up new businesses. Still others only engaged 
in setting up "renamed companies." As a result, few changes 
were made to the operational mechanisms so that enterprises 
still lacked vitality. Therefore, we must be clear that the 
purpose of setting up enterprises with a company system is 
neither for simplistically changing their names nor for raising 
funds. Rather, it is aimed at genuinely transforming their 
operational mechanisms and instituting a modern enterprise 
system. In other words, it is aimed at straightening out the 
relations between ownership and management with regard to the 
state and enterprises through reorganization so that enterprises 
will be able to extricate themselves from their status as 
subsidiaries of government organs and to cut off the umbilical 
cord that integrates government administration with enterprises. 
In this way, enterprises will really possess corporate property 
rights, achieve unified capacity to exercise civil rights and 
dispose of business, and become a genuine legal entity and main 
body in market competition in name as well as in reality, which 
is characterized by "independent operation, assumption of sole 
responsibility for profits and losses, self-development, and 
self- restraint." 
  2. It is necessary to persistently maintain the 
position of public ownership as a main body to ensure that 
public property is not infringed upon. In the course of 
reorganizing enterprises to practice a company system, the 
establishment of corporate property rights in enterprises on the 
basis of distinctive relations between ownership and management 
does not mean changing the state's ownership status. It is only 
the management mode of state assets that has been changed. That 
means the form of managing the assets in kind has been changed 
to that of managing the assets in value. Here, the state still 
controls the ownership, and the total amount of state assets has 
not reduced or lost because of the change. 
  Moreover, through the trading of property rights, the 
holding of shares by legal persons, and the diversification of 
share rights, rational circulation of state assets and effective 
allocation of resources can be achieved, the stock of state 
assets in enterprises can be revitalized, and the preservation 
and increase of the value of state assets can be guaranteed. 
After the company system is practiced in enterprises, public 
assets will still account for an absolutely advantageous portion 
of total social assets, and the state-owned economy will still 
control the lifelines of the national economy, which will 
exercise an leading role in social economic development. It is 
necessary to screen assets, settle claims, clear debts, and draw 
a demarcation between ownership and management according to 
relevant laws and regulations. For this purpose, first and 
foremost, it is necessary to make a realistic evaluation of 
assets, appraise and fix the amount of property held by legal 
persons in enterprises, prevent stocks from being broken down 
and sold at low prices or even occupied by individuals without 
compensation, and avoid state assets being nibbled away and 
embezzled, so as to ensure that state assets and their rights 
and interests are not encroached upon. 
  3. It is necessary to strictly abide by the pertinent 
laws, regulations, and policies of the state. We must 
strive to achieve the principal objectives of separating the 
duties of enterprises from those of the administration, clarify 
the relations between ownership and management, intensify the 
checking and balancing mechanism, shake off the unreasonable 
burdens, and so on. To this end, we should conscientiously 
conduct feasibility studies and demonstrations, set up a 
rational and explicit structure of share rights, conduct strict 
evaluation and auditing of assets, and formulate articles of 
corporation. In particular, we should establish a standardized 
institutional and management structure of a company, give scope 
to the institution, overcome artificial interference, and 
properly perform the work of convergence before and after 
reorganization. Relevant departments are now studying and 
working out implementation measures to enforce the "company law" 
and the "regulations on supervision and management of properties 
in state-owned enterprises" which will be promulgated very soon. 
On the basis of the above, the reorganization of enterprises 
should be brought into line with legal standardization. The 
question of which pattern enterprises will be reorganized should 
be guided by the terms and procedures stipulated in the "company 
law." 
  4. It is necessary to persistently proceed from actual 
conditions and avoid rigid conformity. The reorganization 
of enterprises to practice a company system is a momentous 
change of the enterprise system in China and is therefore an 
arduous as well as complicated task. In working out measures 
for implementation and operation, we should proceed from the 
present conditions of our state-owned enterprises and put them 
into practice by stages, in groups, and according to different 
categories through experiments. 
  The conditions of enterprises in China differ greatly. That 
is why we must proceed from the reality to resolve the problems 
that exist in different kinds of enterprises accordingly. The 
general situation of the state-owned enterprises in terms of 
performance is: One-third of them are earning profits, one-third 
are making profits by a narrow margin, and one-third have been 
sustaining losses for a long time. Hence, we should draw up 
reorganization plans for different kinds of enterprises in 
accordance with the state's industrial policies and in line with 
the requirements to ensure the leading position of the public 
economy, so as to reorganize all sorts of enterprises into 
different company patterns with respective equity structures in 
light of their trades, scope, degree of involvement in the 
market, and position in the national economy as a whole. 
  The reorganization of the existing state-owned enterprises 
should be carried out by stages and in groups. Enterprises 
which are more competitive in their trades for better 
performance, lighter burdens, and stronger leadership should be 
selected for experiments, and their experience should be summed 
up as soon as possible and then disseminated deliberately. We 
should try our best to select enterprises for experiments from 
the existing companies and those which are practicing a 
joint-stock system, and should not spend too much time on the 
experiments. In addition, we should also select some 
enterprises which correspond to the state's industrial policies, 
or which have better economic results and hold a relatively 
important position in the region or trade, or which have 
associated operations with other enterprises. Except for those 
in some specialized trades, which will be reorganized into 
state's wholly owned limited liability companies, most of the 
state-owned enterprises should be reorganized into limited 
liability companies whose stocks are held by a number of 
shareholders so that share rights are controlled by different 
investment units. Those limited liability companies which have 
made profits for three consecutive years, whose targets of 
economic results have reached a certain level, and which have 
met the requirements stipulated by the law can be transformed 
into joint-stock limited companies according to legal 
procedures. Only a few joint-stock limited companies 
reorganized from ordinary enterprises can have their stocks 
listed for trading. Moreover, only those large enterprises of 
the state's backbone industries with excellent performance and 
steady growth will be selected as listed companies strictly in 
line with the conditions required by the law. 
  In practicing the company system, it is necessary to screen 
the historical "burdens" of state-owned enterprises. Owing to 
various reasons, there are a wide range of enterprises which 
have suffered losses for a long time, and the amounts of their 
losses have been very large. Some of them have been deep in 
debts and found it very difficult even to survive, which have 
become heavy burdens of society. With their backward productive 
techniques and outmoded equipment, their products are 
unmarketable and overstocked so that they find it difficult to 
enter the market to participate in competition. Therefore, in 
the course of reorganizing enterprises, it is necessary to 
eliminate a number of enterprises which lack sound operation and 
management, suffer losses for a long time, fail to offset their 
debts with assets, and show no signs of turning from deficits to 
profits, in the principle of market competition wherein the 
superior ones will prosper and the inferior ones will be 
eliminated, (but in formulating concrete measures for 
implementation, consideration should be given to the tolerance 
of various quarters). Of course, meticulous work should be 
performed in dealing with various kinds of loss-making 
enterprises, which should be appraised, differentiated, and 
handled according to varying circumstances. With regard to the 
enterprises capable of revival with their own efforts and a 
certain external assistance, they should be given opportunities 
to strive to shake off their historical "burdens" and reverse 
their losing situation. The State Economic and Trade Commission 
has proposed that the unreasonable debt burdens of state-owned 
enterprises should be handled on a case- by-case basis. We 
should resolutely work according to this proposal.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- China will reform its 
foreign exchange control system in an all-round way starting 
from April 1, the specialist newspaper CHINA SECURITIES reported 
today. 
  According to the paper, a national unified foreign exchange 
control market among banks will begin formal operations Friday 
[1 April]. 
  Designated foreign exchange banks are expected to replace 
enterprises in undertaking transactional activities in the 
market, which will be linked with 10 big cities. 
  An official of the State Administration of Exchange Control 
said that the establishment of the national unified market 
requires improvement. 
  At present, China has 18 banks undertaking foreign exchange 
business, and about 100 foreign-funded banks. These banks may 
apply to become members of the China foreign exchange market. 
  The official noted that China has succeeded in the 
transition 
from the old system of foreign exchange control to the new one 
over the past three months. 
  It has smoothly merged the double-track exchange rates into 
one; abolished enterprises' proportional retention of foreign 
exchange system; and carried out a bank settlement system. 
  It has also opened inter-bank foreign exchange business and 
stopped the issuing of foreign exchange certificates.

Exchange"] 
  [Text] The People's Bank of China has issued a set of 
provisional regulations on the selling, buying and payment of 
foreign exchange to ensure smooth sailing for financial reform. 
  The regulations require all foreign exchange 
receipts--except 
those held by foreign-funded enterprises and domestic 
individuals-- to be sold to designated banks. Foreign loans and 
foreign exchange for debt repayment must also be handled by the 
banks. 
  If foreign exchange is needed for import, export and other 
purposes, it can be purchased at the banks. 
  The regulations, which take effect on April 1, are aimed at 
consolidating the country's foreign exchange in the banks to 
ensure sufficient supplies for converting renmenbi under current 
accounts. 
  The official reaffirmed that the country will keep the 
foreign- exchange swap market, where foreign funded ventures can 
continue to buy and sell their foreign exchange instead of at 
the banks.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Beijing by reporter Liu Hsiu-chen (0491 4423 </F>
3791): "Chen Yuan Says Now Taiwan Dollar Must Not Be Allowed to 
Circulate on Mainland; Circulation of Hong Kong Dollar in 
Shenzhen and Zhuhai Should Be Gradually Ended"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (LIEN HO PAO) -- In response to a 
reporter's question, Chen Yuan, vice president of the People's 
Bank of China, pointed out that the New Taiwan dollar will not 
be allowed to circulate on the mainland. Following the reform 
of the foreign exchange system, China clearly stipulated that 
foreign currencies are not to be circulated on the mainland. As 
the New Taiwan dollar is foreign currency, even the Xiamen 
special economic zone, which has independent right to 
legislation, will not be allowed to legislate on the circulation 
of foreign currency. Similarly, the circulation of Hong Kong 
dollar in Shenzhen and Zhuhai will be gradually ended. 
  Chen Yuan pointed out on 25 March: The detailed rules for 
implementation of the regulations on management of 
foreign-funded financial organizations, which will be 
promulgated before 1 April, focus on convergence between the old 
and new regulations. Three state policy banks will be 
established in the latter half of the year, and the headquarters 
of the State Development and Import and Export Credit Bank will 
be set up in Beijing. As the mainland's agriculture is widely 
spread, the location of the headquarters for the Agricultural 
Development Bank is not yet determined. 
  The People's Bank of China invited officials responsible for 
foreign-funded banks and financial organizations in China to a 
"Forum of Presidents of Foreign-Funded Banks" held at the 
Beijing Capital Guesthouse on 25 March. Chen Yuan; Zhu Xiaohua, 
another president of the People's Bank of China; and Luo 
Bochuan, deputy director of the Foreign Exchange Management 
Bureau, gave accounts of the mainland's financial and foreign 
exchange structural reform. The officials of the foreign-funded 
banks raised questions on relevant issues. 
  Chen Yuan said that the regulations on management of 
foreign- 
funded financial organizations promulgated by the People's Bank 
of China will come into effect on 1 April. The regulations 
synthesize the management method for sino-foreign financial 
organizations, the management method for foreign-funded banks in 
special economic zones, and the management method for 
foreign-funded banks in Shanghai. When the regulations go into 
effect, it will bring operation of the foreign-funded banks 
under supervision. Detailed rules for implementation which are 
now being drafted by the People's Bank of China and which are 
expected to be promulgated before 1 April, stipulate the 
convergence between the old and new regulations, which will 
enable foreign-funded banks to readjust their businesses. 
  When mainland China's special banks are changed to state 
commercial banks, the representative of the Standard Chartered 
Bank branch in Xiamen asked, will foreign banks be allowed to 
deal in renminbi business? Has the experiment of renminbi 
business started? Chen Yuan said that the opinions of various 
fields are being solicited and experiment will be conducted 
first. However, this does not mean that the restrictions on 
foreign banks dealing in renminbi business will be lifted only 
after the state's special banks are changed to commercial banks. 
  The representative of the Dresdner Bank branch in Shanghai 
asked: The new regulations for management of foreign-funded 
banks allow these banks to engage in securities transactions. 
In fact, such a business is stated in the management 
regulations for foreign-funded banks and financial organizations 
in Shanghai. However, the competent departments in Shanghai 
have never approved it. Would it be the same case in the new 
regulations? 
  Chen Yuan replied that the detailed rules will make further 
stipulations on securities transactions. But the range will be 
limited, which is different from the wide range of businesses 
that can be done abroad. The new regulations actually stipulate 
that foreign-funded financial organizations may engage in 
approved securities transactions. Mainland decrees are usually 
made on a long-term basis. As for the actual situation, 
ratification is made by the competent unit in light of needs. 
By the end of last year, Chen Yuan pointed out, foreign-funded 
financial organizations had established 302 representative 
offices in 193 cities and set up 98 business offices in 13 
cities, with the volume of business increasing. With assets 
totaling $8.1 billion last year, the foreign-funded banks 
granted $4 billion of loans, of which 77 percent were granted to 
domestic enterprises, and received $4.2 billion of savings 
deposits. Foreign-funded banks now constitute an important 
component part of mainland's financial system.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- China's ongoing 
reform of the labor system, centering on labor, wages and social 
insurance, has had great success in more than 200 cities and 
counties nationwide. 
  Some 40 percent of country's total workforce are now under a 
contract system. 
  This was disclosed at a news conference here today by Liu 
Guanxue, a spokesman of the central government's Labor Ministry. 
  Liu predicted that the framework for a brand-new labor 
system 
suitable for the country's socialist market economy would take 
shape in five years. 
  According to the spokesman, the government's major 
achievements in reforming the labor system lay in the fact that 
all sorts of enterprises throughout China have got expanded 
autonomy in hiring people, especially in the distribution of 
wages. 
  Liu said that almost all the workers employed in recent 
years 
have been subjected to contracts, adding that the market 
mechanism is playing a decisive role in the distribution of 
wages. 
  In China the idea of selecting freely a job meeting one's 
own 
interest and needs is prevailing. A job offered by the 
government is not necessary a life-long job. On the other side, 
work units enjoy greater freedom to select their employees. 
  He noted that more than 2,000 enterprises across China have 
been singled out as pioneers in the change to decide their own 
wage levels, adding that the practice will be introduced to the 
whole country. 
  The spokesman said that China has set up more than 17,000 
job 
introduction agencies to help jobless people find work. The 
agencies nationwide have found jobs for more than eight million 
people annually in recent years. 
  In addition, the country's labor markets in different types 
have become the main channel for providing job opportunities for 
jobless people. 
  To expand the labor system reform, Liu stressed that the 
government was pooling efforts to tackle "bottlenecks" affecting 
this reform, such as the country's under-developed social 
insurance system, loose management and the heavy financial 
burdens for the government and the enterprises. 
  According to the spokesman, the Labor Ministry will 
introduce 
a reform package for the social insurance system. It is aimed 
to establish a unified social insurance system, with unified 
insurance payment rates and unified insurance treatment, 
regardless of the ownership modes of enterprises and their 
employees' status. The insurance fund is to be shared by all 
under unified arrangements. 
  The spokesman said the Labor Ministry will grant enterprises 
the right to lay off redundant personnel. This will first be 
tried out in groups of pilot enterprises, he added. 
  Liu stressed that enterprises, once relieved of the burden 
of 
massive numbers of redundant workers, would find it easy to take 
up the labor system reform.

<F P=106> [By Nan Shih-yin (2809 4258 0936): "Inside Story About </F>
Jiang, Li, Zhu in 1994 Reform"] 
  [Text] In March 1994, various reform measures were put 
into effect in China, and various events happened before and 
after the adoption of these measures causing ripples to spread 
all through the society. This proved the prediction of some 
experts: In the year of reform, contradictions in relations 
will appear. How will the Chinese authorities react? Will they 
make further advances or withdraw? Various signals have 
attracted attention from all quarters concerned, because the 
orientation of reform has been continuously discussed by people 
outside the mainland since last autumn. 
  This year, China's economic train will continue to run at a 
high speed, and the growth rate may even exceed the high figures 
of the two previous years. This was predicted by many Chinese 
economic experts. 
  Both the predictions of experts and the official statistics 
showed that industrial production in the first quarter of this 
year would continue to increase rapidly, and it was expected 
that the total industrial output value would increase by 22 
percent over the same period last year. Up to the end of 
January, the total industrial output value increased by 33.2 
percent over the same period last year. The State Information 
Center revealed more startling figures: Since February 1992, 
the industrial output value had almost always remained at a 
level above 20 percent, and in December 1993, the increase rate 
jumped sharply by 10.9 percentage points to 29.8 percent, with 
the average daily output being 1.48 billion yuan above that in 
the previous month. 
  The figures were the main grounds on which the economic 
experts predicted high-speed economic growth in China this year. 
Some experts predicted that it was very likely that the Chinese 
economy would grow at a rate much higher than the government 
target of around 9 percent. Such runaway economic growth 
makes people worry that the constraints of the "bottleneck" will 
become more serious, the economic efficiency will remain low, 
there will be excessive demand for resources, and such a 
strained economic environment will make it very difficult to 
implement reform. 
  Another characteristic of China's economic development this 
year was that prices remained high. According to the prediction 
of some experts, the volume of retail sales in the first quarter 
of this year may increase by 28.6 percent over the same period 
last year, and the retail price index will reach 14.5 percent. 
Both figures will be higher than last year's average. 
  In 1993, retail prices in China increased by 13.2 percent, 
and the living costs in 35 large and medium-sized cities 
increased by 20 percent. The margins of increase were not only 
bigger than those in 1992, but also marked the highest record in 
recent years. In fact, the retail price index in mainland China 
has already exceeded the warning line of inflation, and in the 
35 cities it has exceeded the warning line of serious inflation. 
The inertia of inflation and sustained high-speed growth in 
1993 will continue to have an impact on this year's inflation 
situation. 
  A pronounced characteristic of inflation last year in China 
was that the prices of producer goods increased by a much wider 
margin than the price increases of consumer goods. It was 
expected that the prices of producer goods would increase by 
about 35 percent over the whole year. The increase in the 
prices of producer goods then raised the production costs of 
consumer goods. Moreover, the prices of some energy products 
and agricultural products will be raised this year, and the 
prices of some commodities will be shifted from a low, 
plan-fixed level to a high, market-determined level. Consumers 
also anticipated the aggravation of inflation and began to 
react. All this makes it easy to imagine how great the inflation 
pressure will be in 1994. 
  The continuing, huge investment in fixed assets is closely 
related to the inflation situation. According to Beijing 
economist Wen Tiejun's prediction, the size of investment in 
fixed assets in the whole country will increase by at least 50 
percent over last year, and the investment will mainly be 
concentrated in the real estate and construction industry. 
  Official Chinese statistics showed that, between January and 
September 1993, the investment in fixed assets made by 
state-owned units increased by 66.4 percent over that in the 
same period in the previous year, and the growth rates in the 
coastal areas were almost all above 60 percent, with some 
exceeding 100 percent. In 1993 the overall size of investment 
in fixed assets in the whole country exceeded 1.15 trillion 
yuan, or increased by more than 300 billion yuan (47 percent) 
over the previous year; the growth rate of investment made by 
state-owned enterprises was 58 percent; the investment rate [tou 
zi lu 2121 6327 376] increased to 37 percent; and the gross 
volume of investment in 1993 was more than double that in 1991 
and reached the highest level in 15 years. This was obviously 
an abnormal condition. A more worrisome fact was that there was 
a nearly 30 billion yuan investment fund shortage, and the 
economic results of the investment were rather poor. The rate 
of utilization of fixed assets declined by 5.5 percentage points 
from 1992. The proportion of agricultural investment dropped 
from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent, that of investment in the 
energy and raw material industries dropped from 39.5 percent to 
35.6 percent, and the constraints of the "bottleneck" still 
existed to a serious degree. 
  In particular, in the last three months of 1993, China's 
money supply was loosened, and nearly 300 billion yuan of credit 
was made available. This not only enabled the state-owned 
enterprises to quicken the circulation of their funds, but also 
stimulated their investment desire. In some localities, people 
had a stronger desire for expanding investment, and tried to 
quicken the pace of investment in fixed assets. 
  Only one month after the Third Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee adopted the "50-point Decision on the Market 
Economy," the prices of grain, cooking oil, and meat increased 
sharply in various localities. According to the price 
monitoring organs in 12 cities, the price of mixed grain 
increased by 3.8 percent, the price of nonglutinous rice 
increased by 8 percent, the price of polished long-grain rice 
increased by 9.1 percent, and the average grain price increased 
by about 30 percent in the whole year. In the last few months 
of 1993, the prices of cooking oil and meat increased rapidly. 
Over the whole year, the average price of cooking oil increased 
by 35 percent, and that of meat increased by about 20 percent. 
For example, the price of rape seed oil increased from 4.08 
yuan per kg in early 1993 to 6.08 yuan per kg at the end of the 
year, and price of fresh boneless meat increased from 7.03 yuan 
per kg to 9.55 yuan. Panic shopping ensued in some localities, 
and people contended with each other to buy as much grain and 
cooking oil as they could. This resulted in shortages in many 
places. 
  Immediately after that, the authorities decided to unify the 
two sets of foreign exchange rates. Some hotels and restaurants 
took advantage of this opportunity to raise their charges and 
prices, and this spread panic among customers. The move of 
unifying foreign exchange rates also made it possible to further 
decontrol the prices of crude oil and oil products, and this 
produced chain effects on other commodities and further 
increased consumers' anticipatory feeling against inflation. In 
Beijing, many consumers rushed to buy gold. 
  Then came the reform of the taxation system, and this 
flustered more people in China. Before people really understood 
the meaning of such new terms as consumption taxes and 
value-added taxes, rumors about "a substantial increase in the 
prices of luxurious and durable consumer goods and even all 
commodities due to the state's collection of special consumption 
taxes and value-added taxes" were spread rapidly and widely 
among the general public. As a result, another round of panic 
shopping appeared before the Chinese New Year. In Beijing alone 
the total volume of retail sales in December 1993 reached 5.42 
billion yuan, an increase of 30.5 percent over the same period 
of the previous year, and this was also an all-time high for 
monthly retail sales. 
  The three strong winds swept across many places of the 
mainland, and added another layer of frost to the icy situation 
of the inflation pressure. 
  At the beginning of the new year, the situation in China's 
economic reform was rather stern, and things had an unfavorable 
start. The high growth rate, high investment rate, and high 
inflation rate all continued, and were not any milder than the 
situation in 1993. The three gusts of wind also showed that if 
there were any loopholes in the implementation of the reform 
measures, which must be well-coordinated, some major trouble 
would be brought about, especially because the reform measures 
were put into practice when the "three high rates" existed and 
when the risks were increasing. Reportedly, the CPC top leaders 
made a sober assessment of the situation in 1994, the year of 
reform. 
  The CPC leadership took a number of resolute measures to 
cope 
with the situation. The three top leaders, General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
personally took up the matter of curbing the price hikes. At 
the year end national meeting on stabilizing grain and 
cooking-oil prices, Premier Li Peng announced a number of urgent 
measures to check the price hikes. Before the Chinese New Year, 
Jiang Zemin inspected Beijing's retail markets. He asked shop 
assistants what commodities became more expensive and how much 
the prices had increased and whether the prices were lowered to 
a reasonable level. Zhu Rongji went to Fujian and Anhui to make 
an inspection tour. He pointed out many times that "some people 
thought there was no need to manage the grain prices after they 
were decontrolled, and this was a misunderstanding of the market 
economy." He hoped that shops would lower grain prices to a 
level specified by the state plan, and would further lower 
prices before the Chinese New Year so that there would be 
greater room for maneuvering in this year's price adjustments. 
The State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Internal Trade, 
the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State Grain 
Reserve Bureau jointly took action to check the price hikes of 
grain, cooking oil, and meat. After that, the State Council 
once again held a national work conference on the supply of 
grain, cooking oil, and meat. Li Peng required the local 
governments to "actually give top priority to the improvement of 
the people's livelihood." On the one hand, the CPC top 
leadership drew a lesson from the problems, and "adopt effective 
macrocontrol measures" to curb inflation and stabilize prices. 
On the other hand, the authorities also tried hard to reduce 
people's misgivings about the reform measures through various 
channels as such misgivings increased after the abrupt increase 
in grain, cooking-oil, and meat prices. 
  When the new reform measures were put into practice, there 
were risks, especially as the situation of the "three high 
rates" was stern and worrisome. All this showed that, as the 
reform deepened, it would certainly be facing unprecedented 
contradictions and certain difficulties. Many problems that 
piled up under the old system would impact the course of the 
across-the-board reform and would obstruct the adjustment of the 
interest pattern. The inflation pressure, the recession of the 
state-owned enterprises, and the increase in the jobless 
population would all create a dilemma for the top authorities: 
If they continue to expand the scale of investment in order to 
stimulate the economy and improve the business condition of 
enterprises, the people will face increasing inflation pressure. 
If they reduce the issuance of currency and tighten up money 
supply, the state-owned enterprises will once again be bogged 
down in the mire of chained debts. If they further the radical 
reforms, which will affect the vested interests of various 
social strata, various localities, and various departments, this 
may bring about social turbulence and thus endanger social 
stability. But if they are overcautious and even try too hard 
to maintain stability, they will effectively end the reform. 
  At the same time, facts also remind people that first, the 
risks from reform come primarily from the problems of the old 
system, so in order to reduce risks, the only way is to 
substantially advance reform. Second, it has become more and 
more important to maintain stability, because nothing will be 
accomplished in reform and economic development if there is no 
stability and the people will have to pay even heavier costs. 
Third, the feasibility and proper arrangements of the reform 
measures have also become more and more important. In these 
eventful days, it is no longer possible to advance reform in any 
single field, and there must be no major mistakes in the 
implementation of the reform measures. However, differences 
exist between the central authorities and the local authorities. 
Some local governments are overanxious to quicken the pace of 
reform and to speed up economic development. They even 
misunderstood Deng Xiaoping's remark that "development is the 
last word." 
  Therefore, in the past, senior officials in Beijing often 
discussed the approach to the relationships between reform, 
development, and stability and the way to deepen the reform. It 
is said that all this caused deep concern in Zhongnanhai. 
  Zhu Rongji was the first to call for: Grasping the 
opportunity, deepening the reform, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability. Li Ruihuan, another member of the CPC 
Central Political Bureau, pointed out: Reform is the driving 
force, stability is the precondition, and development is the 
objective. Li Peng pointed out: Development is the aim, reform 
is the driving force, and stability is the precondition. He 
also said: Reform will be further deepened, and the scale of 
opening up to the outside world will be further expanded. Then, 
before the Chinese New Year, Jiang Zemin made the final 
decision on the general guideline for this year's work: 
Grasping the opportunity, deepening the reform, expanding 
opening, promoting development, and maintaining stability. 
  These 20 characters give much food for thought. First, 
reform, development, and stability are arranged in a certain 
sequence, and deepening reform is placed first. The three 
things will be coordinated and integrated in a dialectical way. 
Second, the word "quickening" is not put before the words 
"reform" and "development," but this does not mean that reform 
and development need not be quickened. Instead, the key point 
in this year's work is to ensure coordinated operations in the 
aspects of reform, development, and stability. Third, 
importance is attached to stability. Fourth, stress is laid on 
grasping the opportunity. Undoubtedly, seeking a prudent path 
of reform, opening, development, and stability is the core of 
the 20-character guideline. 
  Zhu Rongji, who continued to play a role as a 
trouble-shooter 
in the CPC top leadership in recent years, recently once again 
took resolute action to deal with some difficult problems. 
  According to the 20-character guideline laid down by Jiang 
Zemin, this year's guideline for the monetary work in China is: 
Continue to rectify the monetary order, steadily advance the 
monetary reform, strictly control the gross quality of credit 
funds, and effectively exercise monetary management and 
supervision. Before the Chinese New Year, Zhongnanhai 
eventually formulated the macrocontrol principle for this year's 
economic operation: First tightening control and then relaxing 
control, and pursuing an economic policy for "a high growth rate 
and intensive operation." 
  Whether or not the size of investment in fixed assets is 
reasonable is a key factor for determining whether China's 
economy is able to maintain stable growth and prevent serious 
inflation. Zhu Rongji precisely decided to take action on 
this point. The "monetary commander-in-chief" issued an order: 
"Beginning this year, the credit funds for infrastructural 
facilities and key projects in basic industries will all be 
arranged and coordinated by the newly established Development 
Bank of the state;" "No loan will be offered to projects going 
beyond the gross size of credit, to projects which are started 
without the approval of the authorities, and to any projects 
which are turned from a whole to parts; and not even one single 
penny can be given to any one such project." RENMIN RIBAO 
also published a commentator's article to cool down the 
excessive enthusiasm of the local authorities for increasing 
investment. 
  Reportedly, when told that a province planned to build more 
than 10 airports this year, Zhu Rongji was very angry and 
openly blamed some local officials for being "unrealistic." 
Sources said that he was determined to keep the size of 
investment in fixed assets below 1,450 billion yuan. At the 
same time, the State Council issued a red-headed document, 
ordering the local authorities and the relevant departments to 
strictly scrutinize new construction projects and shorten the 
front of construction. The State Planning Commission then 
formulated the concrete measure for turning enterprises into 
investment bodies. According to the measure, construction 
projects will not be started until legal persons are formed, and 
legal persons will take full responsibility for the whole 
process of investment. The corporation responsibility system 
will be adopted in order to change the situation in which 
investment results are poor and no people are responsible for 
investment. The top authorities are also quickening the 
process of investment legislation. 
  Thus, according to the speculation of the experts in the 
State Information Center, the pace of investment growth in fixed 
assets will be temporarily slowed, and capital construction 
investment made by state-owned units in the first quarter of 
this year will be 36 percent, which is slightly lower than last 
year's average. At the same time, however, the State Council 
will increase investment in basic industries in order to prevent 
the situation from exceeding the limits in adjustments. 
  On the other hand, Zhu Rongji also made great efforts to 
advance taxation reform. This indicated that the financial 
system in China would enter a new path; the new taxation system 
will become a mechanism for stabilizing the growth in central 
finances and will increase the macrocontrol capacity of the 
central policies; the local authorities will pay more attention 
to fostering tax sources; and the state budgets will certainly 
play a tougher controlling role and the results of financial 
expenditure will be gradually enhanced. In order to give 
stronger guidance to taxation reform, the State Council decided 
that Finance Minister Li Zhongli was concurrently appointed to 
be director of the State Administration of Taxation, and Jin 
Xin, former director of the taxation administration, was 
appointed to be deputy director (remaining at the 
full-ministerial level). Six sets of taxation rules were put 
into practice on a trial basis. In order to remove consumers' 
misgivings, Jin Xin led taxation officials to the streets to 
explain the new tax rules to the general public. Before the 
Chinese New Year, six ministerial- level officials gave a series 
of lectures through CCTV, and the first lecturer was Jin Xin. 
  Various signs showed that the Chinese authorities had 
gradually replaced administrative control with market regulation 
and control. The most effective means of economic control was 
the issuance of currency and the retrieval of currency from 
circulation. The two major economic levers, the interest rates 
and the tax rates, were also used to adjust economic 
development. It seemed that Zhu Rongji was learning key skills 
through practice, and was trying to bring the runaway economy 
under effective control. Sources in Beijing said that Zhu 
Rongji and other officials had always tried to bring the rate of 
economic growth and the index of inflation below 10 percent. If 
they achieve this target, the economic environment for China's 
reforms in the second half of 1994 will become much more 
favorable. Changing from "urgently applying the brake" to a 
"soft landing," the mainland economy may be free from the 
repetition of a "hard landing" as in previous years. 
  Recent facts showed that the CPC top leadership was 
adjusting 
some specific steps promptly in order to cope with the stern 
situation. Some reform measures may be postponed, but this does 
not mean that the authorities will backtrack from reform. 
  There were four main aspects in recent adjustments: 
Exercising macrocontrol in order to prevent major ups and downs 
and to create a more benign environment for the adoption of new 
reform measures; prudently advancing reform and development to 
make steady and solid progress and to prevent major errors; 
improving the reform plans and ensuring that they are 
well-coordinated and feasible and are put into practice in 
opportune moments; preventing reckless action across the board 
and ensuring solid results in reform and development. Recently, 
Zhu Rongji particularly pointed out: "The reform orientation of 
changing the specialized banks into commercial banks must be 
kept firmly, but this is a long-term task and only the first 
step will be taken this year. There must be no reckless action 
across the board [bu yao gua feng 0008 6008 0450 7364]. The 
remark reflected the intention of the CPC top leaders to 
postpone certain reform measures. 
  Some economic experts commented positively on the CPC top 
authorities' adjustment steps, and said that this was a 
pragmatic and feasible approach. Most of them held that when 
facing the dilemma, the authorities should not recklessly 
advance or flinch from difficulty, and the sensible approach at 
the current stage was to make minor adjustments and make stable 
and solid development. 
  Of course they also found that, in the course of developing 
the market economy, some reform measures were changed shortly 
after they were put into practice, and brought about various 
abnormal phenomena as a result of various backward economic 
relations caused by the combination between the disadvantages of 
the planned economy and the disadvantages of the market economy. 
Therefore, economist Fang Hengshan, who participated in the 
formulation of the "50-point" document on the market economy, 
openly issued an urgent call for solving this problem. The 
experts held that at this moment, the adjustment of the reform 
steps would be favorable to removing the misunderstanding of the 
market economy and the reform measures in some localities and 
departments. At the same time, they also warned the authorities 
against softening their determination for reform while facing 
various difficulties. Although reform is facing increasing 
risks, the risks would be even greater if reform were not 
carried out. Economist Wu Jinglian held that fighting 
fragmentary battles outside the establishment was not cheaper. 
Economist Wen Tiejun held that the impact of various factors 
might force the process of reform to slow down this year. 
  The general view of China's economic situation before the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress clearly 
showed the intention of Zhongnanhai: This year, economic reform 
should mainly lay a solid foundation for the across-the-board 
adoption of the market economy and for more intensive reforms 
between 1994 and 1996 in order to achieve the objective of 
establishing the market economic structure on a full scale by 
the end of 1996. The efforts to carry out prudent reforms and 
to make effective development will exist throughout the whole 
process of the tough reform battles in 1994.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A 
summing-up and analytical report recently published by the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce revealed that more than 
150,000 cases of involving violations of economic laws and 
regulations were investigated and handled last year throughout 
the country, and nearly 30,000 were major and serious cases. 
The number of such major and serious cases increased by a large 
margin as compared with that in 1992. Of these cases, 834 were 
transferred to the judicial organs. 
  According to the analysis, as compared with the situation in 
1992, some new changes were found in illicit business activities 
handled by industrial and commercial administrations in all 
parts of the country. 
  First, the total number of cases decreased, but the number 
of 
major and serious cases increased by a margin as large as over 
90 percent. 
  Second, the total amount of fines rebounded after decreasing 
for a number of consecutive years. The total of fines and the 
value of confiscated goods amounted to over 800 million yuan in 
1993 and increased by more than 10 percent over that in 1992. 
  Third, more state-owned and collective units were involved 
in 
illicit business activities. In the more than 30,000 major and 
serious cases being handled last year, over 11,000 cases 
involved state-owned units and over 7,500 cases involved 
collective units. Both numbers were larger than those of the 
previous year, and they accounted for 63 percent of the total 
number of major and serious cases. 
  Fourth, cases of smuggling and selling smuggled goods and 
cases of making and selling counterfeit and inferior goods 
accounted for a large proportion in the cases of violations of 
economic laws. According to incomplete statistics in 11 
provinces, including Shandong and Liaoning, they discovered and 
handled more than 23,000 smuggling cases last year. In the 
whole country, more than 4,100 major and serious cases of making 
and selling counterfeit and inferior goods were investigated and 
handled, and the number increased by 18 percent over that of the 
previous year. 
  In addition, some new forms of illicit business activities 
continued to appear, including the cases of foreign exchange 
speculation in the black market with the lure of "high 
investment returns in futures trading." The Industrial and 
Commercial Administration of Shenzhen City discovered 72 cases 
of such activities last year, and the value of fines and 
confiscated goods exceeded 2 million yuan.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "More Courts To Protect Trademarks and </F>
Patents"] 
  [Text] More courts are being set up to handle intellectual 
property rights disputes in a bid to protect foreign and 
domestic companies and individuals. 
  The drive is a nationwide effort to safeguard trademarks, 
copyrights and patents, a court official said. 
  Intellectual property rights courts have begun handling 
cases 
in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Haikou in 
the past few months. 
  The country's first courts, set up last July in the Beijing 
Higher People's Court and the Beijing Intermediate People's 
Court, have heard 125 cases and issued rulings on 87 of them. 
  The cases included the well-known dispute over the computer 
input method for Chinese characters known as the five-stroke 
system. 
  The system's inventor, Wang Yongmin, won 500,000 yuan 
($57,500) compensation when the court supported his claim that 
the Beijing- based China Southeastern Technology and Trading 
Company had pirated his patented invention. 
  In Shanghai, special courts face a growing number of 
disputes 
from around the coast and they have already handled more than 
600 cases since they were set up last month. 
  Courts in Fujian have investigated 47 suits. 
  The network focuses on protecting the trademarks, patents 
and 
copyrights of domestic and foreign firms to promote the 
country's development and investment climate. 
  It is an important step in the country's "progressive 
approach" to strengthening the protection of intellectual 
property, said an official with the Supreme People's Court. 
  China introduced a patent law in 1991, a copyright law in 
1992 and revised its trademark law last year. 
  These enable overseas companies to file a complaint with a 
Chinese court if they feel their rights have been broken. 
  The official also said China has joined the World 
Intellectual Property Rights Organization and adopted several 
multilateral accords to bring the country's legal system more 
closely in line with international practice. 
  The agreements include the Paris Pact on Industrial Property 
Rights Protection, the Madrid Agreement concerning the 
international registration of trademarks, the Patent 
Co-operation Treaty and the Berne Convention for the Protection 
of Literary and Artistic Works.

<F P=106> ["Roundup: Yangtze River Valley Becomes Favorite of Foreign </F>
Investors"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, March 29 (XINHUA) -- The Chang Jiang 
river valley, boasting a strengthened economic foundation, has 
become a favorite area for foreign investment. 
  A survey shows that 130 transnational corporations have 
established 300 projects involving contractual investment 
totalling three billion U.S. dollars in Shanghai, China's 
largest economic center, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hubei 
provinces. 
  Included are one quarter of the world's 100 largest 
transnational industrial corporations. 
  Shanghai has witnessed the establishment of 204 projects 
with 
a total contractual investment of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars by 
128 transnational corporations; and Jiangsu, one of China's most 
economically-developed provinces, has approved the setting up of 
60 projects funded by transnational corporations. 
  Ningbo, one of China's 14 open coastal cities in Zhejiang 
Province, and Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, 
have reported an increase in the numbers. 
  These projects funded by transnational corporations are in 
the fields of motor vehicle manufacturing, electronics and 
telecommunications, computers, biochemicals, new materials, 
precision instruments and port construction. 
  Economists here agreed that transnational corporations have 
boosted their confidence in making investment in the Chang Jiang 
river valley. 
  Robert Allen, chairman of the board of directors of the 
AT&amp;T 
company of the United States, said that China is developing 
toward a modern society and is in need of a host of advanced 
products. Therefore, his company will pursue a long-term 
investment strategy in China. 
  According to the chairman, the first project, the Shanghai 
AT&amp;T company, has become a key enterprise through four years' 
hard effort. Its products now occupy one-fourth of the market 
on the mainland. 
  According to the latest statistics, the Chang Jiang river 
valley has more than 30,000 foreign-funded projects involving 
more than 35 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for one-fourth of 
the total foreign investment on the Chinese mainland. 
  So far over 10,000 projects have gone into operation, and 80 
percent of them are profitable. 
  Investments made by transnational corporations in the Chang 
Jiang river valley are concentrated on pillar industries, 
infrastructure facilities, real estate, tourism facilities and 
the land development by large tracts. 
  At present, a number of Hong Kong companies are cooperating 
with Shanghai in improving its urban transport facilities and 
constructing a commercial center. 
  The Shanghai municipal government plans to open more markets 
and construction of infrastructure facilities including a power 
plant, a subway and an airport to attract foreign investment, 
from transnational corporations in particular, this year. 
  Construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park, a 
Singapore-Chinese joint venture, is proceeding smoothly. 
  The largest Sino-foreign project in Jiangsu Province, the 
industrial park, which covers 70 square kilometers, is receiving 
streams of overseas investors. 
  So far the park has concluded cooperative contracts on more 
than 50 projects with a sum of three billion U.S. dollars on 
contract. 
  The projects are in the electronics, machinery, textiles, 
and 
tourism industries. 
  Port construction in Shanghai, Nanjing, Lusi, Ningbo and 
Wuhan along the Chang Jiang river has attracted strong 
investment from Hong Kong. 
  According to some investors, the Chang Jiang river valley, 
in 
particular the Chang Jiang river delta consisting of Shanghai, 
Jiangsu and Zhejiang, has been provided with a better economic 
foundation, talented people and improved infrastructure 
facilities. 
  The densely populated area will offer conditions and market 
for foreign-funded enterprises to prosper.

  [Text] Beijing will set up a top-level academy to 
spearhead research in economic liberalization and other aspects 
of reform. 
  Due to open in the summer, the China Academy for Research in 
Reform will study ways to bring the Chinese economy into line 
with international norms. 
  The State Commission for the Reform of the Economic 
Structure 
vice-minister, Wu Jie, will be the academy's first head. 
  Mr. Wu, 58, a leader of the liberal faction of the party and 
a former vice-governor of Shanxi province, is the son of the 
late vice-president Ulanfu. 
  Economic sources in Beijing said Mr. Wu was recruiting 
senior 
staff for the academy, which will be affiliated with the 
commission. 
  They said Mr. Wu, who spent two years researching economics 
and information technology in the United States, was mainly 
looking for young academics and cadres with exposure to Western 
economies. 
  The sources said while the academy was a ministerial-level 
unit its operations and methodology would be different from 
similar institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
(CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). 
  "The new academy accepts funding and research grants from 
foreign institutions and foundations and has reportedly 
collected pledges of US$50 million (HK$385 million)," said a 
social scientist close to the new institution. 
  "It may have a more liberal policy than either CAS or CASS 
in 
inviting Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas scholars to teach and do 
research there." 
  Aside from economic reform, the academy will look into ways 
to modernise the political structure, social policy, education 
and culture. However, analysts in Beijing said it was unlikely 
it would devote itself to studies of Western-style democratic 
institutions. 
  They said the Research Institute for the Reform of the 
Economic Structure was dissolved after the Tiananmen Square 
crackdown because of its advocacy of political liberalisation. 
The research institute was also a primary thinktank for ousted 
party chief Zhao Ziyang. 
  Analysts said, however, that the new academy enjoyed the 
backing of patriarch Deng Xiaoping, who earlier this year did 
the Chinese calligraphy for its official plaque. The 
establishment of the academy coincides with the decision by the 
leadership to roll back those market reforms that would 
exacerbate social problems. 
  It is understood that the liberal wing of the party, 
including former associates of Mr. Zhao and the late party chief 
Hu Yaobang, have backed the academy. Mr. Wu, who is tipped for 
further promotion, and his associates have recently made trips 
to the coastal areas to learn more about the prospects of market 
reform.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- China will inject 
1.66 billion yuan into its gold industry this year, to upgrade 
gold production technology and develop gold mine construction. 
  Jiao Zhi, president of the Gold Administration under the 
State Metallurgical Industry Ministry, said here today that this 
year the country's gold production will still be directed by a 
state plan, and the purchasing of gold will still be monopolized 
by the state. 
  He said that this year's main task for the gold trade is to 
put two management regulations into effect, one of which 
concerns introducing foreign investment, and another focusing on 
the use of geological prospecting foundation. 
  The two regulations were raised before the State Council 
last 
year. 
  Jiao also asked the gold administrative department to help 
the central bank to establish a standard domestic gold market 
and revise management rules on purchasing and selling of gold 
and silver. 
  He said that this year, the gold industry should try to 
collect funds through multi-channels, including attracting 
foreign investment, in order to better develop gold resources. 
  So far, China's gold trade has cooperative ties with more 
than 20 countries and regions, such as the U.S., Canada, 
Australia and South Africa. 
  As Jiao disclosed, last year the amount of gold purchased by 
the central bank decreased by 32 percent, compared with that of 
the previous year. 
  However, the country's gold production witnessed an increase 
of 7.5 percent. 
  Jiao attributed the situation to the low gold-purchasing 
price set by the government, the emergence of original local 
gold markets, and a serious problem with gold smuggling. 
  "But since the government readjusted its gold management 
policy in last September," Jiao noted, "The amount of gold 
purchased by the central bank has seen a sharp rise." 
  For the last four months of last year, the amount of gold 
sold to the bank was nearly twice that for the first eight 
months. 
  Jiao finally explained that last year, gold prospecting 
teams 
submitted 103 reports, which provided abundant information for 
gold production. 
  In other respects, the economic benefits of the gold 
industry 
jumped 74 percent over the previous year. The gold trade 
yielded a huge profit of over eight hundred million yuan.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- A new national company 
specializing in China's maize exports was set up here today. 
  The China National Maize Company, the country's sole agent 
handling maize export business, was jointly established by the 
China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export 
Corporation, China Grains Trade Company and nine other companies 
in the cereals and oils trade of the main producing provinces. 
  The company's president, Sun Zhenchi, said that the new 
company, set up in the light of the spirit of the country's new 
reform policy that major commodity items should be managed with 
joint efforts in a unified manner, will give full play to the 
strengths of each partner and play the role of a lever in 
adjusting the domestic supply according to the changes in the 
world market. 
  He said that the setting-up of the new company would bring 
new vitality to the nation's foreign trade development. It will 
join all strands of maize export together to improve the quality 
and standard as well as to increase the competitiveness of 
China's maize in the world market. 
  China's annual maize exports make up about 70 percent of the 
country's total export volume of grains.

  [Text] Kaohsiung, March 28 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] Navy on Monday [28 March] took delivery of the second of 
the eight missile frigates it has ordered from the China 
Shipbuilding Corp. 
  The ceremony, presided over by Vice President Li Yuan-zu on 
behalf of President Li Teng-hui was witnessed by more than 100 
guests, including National Defense Minister Sun Chen and Admiral 
Liu Ho-chien, chief of the general staff. 
  "The purpose of strengthening our military power is for 
defense, not offense. It is for sustaining peace, not for 
provoking war," Li said. 
  Construction of the warship, named "Cheng Ho" after a noted 
Ching dynasty admiral, began on Dec. 21, 1990. 
  The first frigate went into service last May and the last 
one 
is scheduled to begin service by October 1999. 
  The eight 4,200-ton frigates, which will eventually cost the 
Navy more than NT [new Taiwan] $40 billion (US$1.5 billion), are 
to replace part of the Navy's aging fleet. According to the 
International Institute for Strategic Studies, the ROC Navy had 
24 destroyers and nine frigates as of the end of 1992. 
  Taiwan also agreed on a US$4.8 billion deal in 1991 to buy 
16 
Lafayette-class frigates from France. 
  With a maximum speed of 27.5 nautical miles per hour, each 
of 
the frigates will be armed with locally-manufactured Hsiung-feng 
ship- to-ship missiles, US standard ship-to-air missiles, anti 
submarine torpedoes, and a Phalanx weapons system built by the 
General Dynamics Corp. of the United States.

  [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P. K. Chiang left for Vietnam Saturday [26 March] in a new 
effort to promote bilateral trade ties. 
  He will first visit Ho Chi Minh City and then proceed to 
Hanoi Sunday. 
  Chiang said prior to his departure that he will meet with 
Vietnamese officials on issues involving agriculture and 
investment cooperation during his four-day visit. 
  Taiwan farm experts are looking to giving a helping hand to 
Vietnam in such fields as aquaculture, ocean fishing, 
forestation, and hog-raising, while the government's 
international economic cooperation development fund is 
considering providing soft loans for Vietnam's farm 
mechanization projects, he elaborated. 
  On investment ties, he noted, one major concern is runaway 
land prices caused by Vietnam's new land law, which became 
effective late last year. Construction of an industrial complex 
exclusively for Taiwan investors in Hanoi has been delayed 
because of the land price increase. 
  Chiang added that state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp., I Mei Foods 
Co. Ltd., and King Car Food Industrial Co. Ltd. will enter into 
a joint venture with two Vietnamese sugar companies at the end 
of this month. President Enterprises Corp. is also mulling a 
food investment project in the Indochinese country. 
  The minister also pledged that he will consult with 
Vietnam's 
financial officials on the application by the Medium Business 
Bank of Taipei to open a branch in Hanoi. The bank submitted 
the application to the Hanoi government last May. 
  Currently, the International Commercial Bank of China has a 
representative office in Ho Chi Minh City and the Cathay 
Investment and Trust Co., Ltd. maintains a branch in Hanoi. 
  Other Taiwan banks including Chiao Tung Bank, the first 
Commercial Bank, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, the Farmers Bank of 
China, and Chinatrust Commercial Bank are also gearing up to 
follow suit. 
  Meanwhile, Chiang said he will discuss an agreement to avoid 
double taxation and an accord on a temporary import system in 
order to facilitate bilateral trade relationships. 
  Two-way trade between Taiwan and Vietnam totaled US$589.3 
million in the first 11 months of 1993, with Taiwan enjoying a 
surplus of US$311.1 million. 
  Taiwan was the largest foreign investor in Vietnam at the 
end 
of 1993 with 117 investment projects totaling US$1.53 billion.

<F P=106> [By Christiaan Virant] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- A recent Gallup Poll of 
world consumers that rates Taiwan products below those of 
Mainland China in quality has angered business executives and 
trade officials here. 
  The poll found that respondents believed products from the 
United States, Japan and Germany topped other countries in terms 
of product quality, followed by Mainland China, Taiwan and 
Central American nations. 
  "This rating flies in the face of international praise for 
Taiwan products," Stan Shih, chairman of the Brand International 
Promotion Association told reporters after reading the poll 
results. 
  Shih said the poll was conducted by the US-based Gallup 
Organization and divided responses into three areas, North 
America, South America and the rest of the world. 
  The arbitrary division may have influenced the survey 
outcome, Shih said. 
  "Those surveyed from countries with poor educational 
standards may have confused Taiwan with Thailand or thought of 
Taiwan as part of Mainland China," he added. 
  Secretary-General Huang Hsing-kuo of the private Foreign 
Trade Association explained that the low product quality rating 
also may have resulted from a high number of survey responses 
from India and Latin America. 
  "Taiwan product promotion efforts target the US and Europe 
and not other areas of the globe," Huang explained. 
  "As a result, Americans and Europeans are well aware that 
Taiwan products are of the highest quality, but people from 
other countries may not know this," he added.

  [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- The Communist Chinese 
military will not attack Taiwan before the year 2000, a military 
expert said Saturday [26 March]. 
  However, Taiwan will be at an increased risk of attack 
during 
the years 2001 to 2010, Niu Hsien-chung, a military strategist 
and author of several war game books told legislators at a 
public hearing on security issues. 
  Beijing will be preoccupied with resolving thorny problems 
related to the retrocession of Hong Kong and Macao until the 
turn of the century, ruling out the possibility of any attack on 
Taiwan, Niu said. 
  Niu was at the Legislative Yuan to comment on the recently 
published Ministry of National Defense White Paper. 
  Niu said that the white paper lists six reasons and ways for 
a communist offensive against Taiwan, but did not discuss when 
such attacks would take place. 
  "Timing is vitally important," he said. 
  On the ministry's plan to size down the armed forces to 
about 
400,000 in 10 years, Niu said if the plan is a must, it should 
be carried out in five years rather than 10. 
  He added that the White Paper only dealt with military 
maneuvers against Taiwan. "As a matter of fact," he said, 
"non-military attacks would be even more deadly." 
  The white paper claims that the foremost event which might 
trigger a military attack from Beijing would be a declaration of 
independence by Taiwan. 
  Other major events include internal large-scale chaos or 
riots within Taiwan, foreign intervention in the internal 
affairs of Taiwan, refusal to hold reunification talks with the 
mainland, the development of nuclear arms on the island, and 
political instability in the post-Deng Xiaoping era, which might 
lead to a communist attack on the island. 
  According to the white paper, some of the six ways the 
mainland could possibly attack Taiwan include a sudden missile 
offensive against targets on Taiwan's western coast or seizing 
upon fishing disputes to trick Taiwan's Navy into a maritime 
confrontation. 
  The communists may lure Taiwan air and naval forces into 
battle after first attacking Taiwan-held offshore islands. 
Mainland forces could also launch a rapid-fire invasion and 
take over Taiwan-held islands, the white paper said.

  [Text] Geneva, March 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan has taken a step 
forward in its bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), a Taiwan delegate said here Friday [25 March] 
after wrapping up bilateral tariff reduction talks with six 
countries. 
  Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign 
Trade 
told a group of Taiwan reporters that all the six countries -- 
Hungary, South Africa, Chile, Turkey, New Zealand and Australia 
-- have reaffirmed their support for Taiwan's GATT entry during 
the tariff reduction talks. 
  Huang, who arrived in Geneva March 20 at the head of a 
14-member delegation for the first-round tariff talks with the 
six countries in connection with Taiwan's GATT bid, said the 
talks proceeded smoothly. 
  "Nevertheless, all of the six countries have asked US to 
remove tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in accordance with 
GATT requirements," Huang noted. 
  They were particularly concerned with Taiwan's quota and 
area 
restrictions on farm trade and some industrial products, such as 
compact cars, Huang said. 
  "We must accelerate trade liberalization and adjust our 
agricultural development strategies in order to facilitate our 
GATT bid," Huang added. 
  Taiwan will hold further bilateral or multilateral tariff 
talks with the six countries later this year. Taiwan already 
held informal bilateral tariff reduction talks with the United 
States, and more than 10 other countries have requested similar 
talks with Taiwan. 
  Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and 
is expected to become a full member by the end of this year. 
Huang, who is leaving here for home Sunday, said he will return 
to Geneva in May to attend a meeting of the GATT working party 
screening Taiwan's GATT application.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- The British Hong Kong 
Government's recent endorsement of the proposed amendments to 
"The New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill" has aroused intense 
discontent among indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories. 
A spokesman of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office today issued a statement on this matter, saying that soon 
after Britain rented the "New Territories" by force with an 
unequal treaty, it declared that all the lands in the new 
territories belonged to the British Royal Family, thereby 
peremptorily depriving the indigenous inhabitants of the New 
Territories of land ownership. As this was unreasonable, 
indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories rose up in 
protest. A regulation adopted later requiring the indigenous 
inhabitants to pay only nominal rent was the result of the 
struggle of indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories. 
Therefore, it is imperative to protect the traditional 
legitimate rights and interests of the New Territories 
inhabitants. This has been written into the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law and it cannot be changed. 
  The spokesman said: Annex III of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration clearly provides that rural lands leased to 
indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories "shall remain 
unchanged so long as the property is held by that person or by 
one of his lawful successors in the male line." The 
interpretation given by the British side during the Sino-British 
negotiations is that the only way to establish who are the 
descendants of the indigenous inhabitants is to trace back their 
ancestors through the male line. Children of a family 
customarily use their father's last name, and it by no means 
implies discrimination against women. We must, however, not 
confuse these traditional rights and interests of the New 
Territories indigenous inhabitants with discrimination against 
women. 
  The spokesman emphasized: Our stand is that the concept of 
"indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories" that is written 
into the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic 
Law should not be scrapped, nor should the legitimate rights and 
interests of the aforementioned indigenous inhabitants won from 
Britain as a result of their struggle be abandoned or nullified. 
The spokesman said: It is only natural that the British Hong 
Kong government, which endorsed the amendments to the 
aforementioned bill without first consulting the indigenous 
inhabitants of the New Territories, aroused intense discontent 
among the indigenous inhabitants. He emphasized that the 
British Hong Kong government must face up to the discontent of 
the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, and 
appropriately handle this matter by way of full consultations 
with the indigenous inhabitants, and in accordance with the 
provisions of the Hong Kong Basic Law so as not to artificially 
create social upheavals and division.

<F P=106> [By Political Editor Chip Tsao, and Stacy Mosher] </F>
  [Text] Any change to the law on land inheritance in the 
New Territories will be reversed after the 1997 handover, a 
senior Chinese official in Beijing told EASTERN EXPRESS last 
night. He was responding to the row over proposals initiated by 
a legislative councillor, Christine Loh, to give women the right 
to inherit property in the New Territories. 
  "Article 40 of the Basic Law stipulates that the lawful 
traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants 
of the New Territories shall be protected," the Chinese official 
said. "Loh's amendment to the laws governing indigenous 
inheritance right is supported by the Hong Hong government. It 
is intended to be divisive, instigating internal struggle among 
Hong Kong people. Loh's amendment undermines Hong Kong's 
stability. It is deceptive as it calls for sexual equality. 
The future Hong Kong government will act in accordance with the 
Basic Law but not follow things set out by them (Loh and the 
Government)." 
  A senior Hong Kong government official criticised the 
warning. "Nobody has the right to prejudge the SAR [special 
administrative region] legislature," he said. "It is a part of 
autonomy enjoyed by the future SAR under the Joint Declaration. 
Chairman Mao Zedong said: `Women hold up half the sky'." 
  Simon Li, a retired high court judge and former member of 
the 
Basic Law drafting committee and current Preliminary Working 
Committee member, said the rights of the New Territories' 
indigenous people were secured by the Joint Declaration and 
"nothing in this world is equal". Li said Loh's visit to the 
New Territories villages was undemocratic. "In the old days, 
when Emperor Chin visited a place, he used to be escorted by a 
hundred carriages," Li said. "Now some democratic legislators 
have to be protected by 400 policemen." 
  Heung Yee Kuk members agreed to form a "Headquarters for the 
Struggle to Protect Home and Tribe" after a meeting yesterday 
discussing Loh's amendment to the New Territories Land 
(Exemption) Bill. Members vowed to pursue their campaign by 
peaceful means. 
  Attention has focused on the Fanling village of Lung Yeuk 
Tau 
and the Sha Tin village of Kak Tin in preparation for today's 
visit by Loh's subcommittee on women's affairs to exchange views 
with villagers on inheritance laws and women's rights. Earlier 
this week nearly 1,000 villagers rallied outside Legco [the 
Legislative Council] to protest against Loh's proposal. A 
United Democrats legislator, Lee Wing-tat, was assaulted and 
demonstrators supporting the amendment reported being attacked. 
Loh was the target of verbal fury, with some saying that she 
would be "raped and buried" if she set foot in the New 
Territories. Police declined to confirm rumours that hundreds 
of uniformed officers will be deployed to maintain order during 
the visit.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 26 (XINHUA) -- The British Hong 
Kong Government, by supporting amendments to the law governing 
indigenous inheritance right in the New Territories, contravenes 
the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, said a 
Hong Kong-based Chinese official. 
  Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong branch, made the remarks Friday [25 March] in response to 
reporters' questions about the amendment to the New Territories 
Land (Exemption) Bill, which was proposed by a legislator and 
supported by the Hong Kong Government. 
  Since the law amendment is an important matter straddling 
the 
1997 handover, Zhu said, consultations between China and Britain 
are necessary according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  As for the traditional interests and rights of the New 
Territories inhabitants, Zhu said the Basic Law of the future 
special administrative regions has specific stipulations. 
  Article 40 of the Basic Law says that "the lawful 
traditional 
rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the `New 
Territories' shall be protected by the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region." 
  Article 122 says that "in the case of old schedule lots, 
village lots, small houses and similar rural holdings, where the 
property was on 30 June 1984 held by, or, in the case of small 
houses granted after that date, where the property is granted 
to, a lessee descended through the male line from a person who 
was in 1898 a resident of an established village in Hong Kong, 
the previous rent shall remain unchanged so long as the property 
is held by that lessee or by one of his lawful successors in the 
male line." 
  Zhu pointed out that the Legislative Council, an advisory 
body of the Hong Kong British authorities, has no right to make 
law amendment. 
  He criticized some people for trying to cause divisions and 
confrontation among the Hong Kong people and sabotage social 
stability in the territory by taking advantage of the amendment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Appeal to Beijing"] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong's giant property companies are fond of 
calling on the Government to take the heat out of the property 
market by releasing more new land for building. Now, having 
apparently failed to make much of an impression on the Hong Kong 
Government, Cheung Kong chairman Li Ka-shing has revealed he has 
also been asking the Chinese Government to give the green light 
to increase the land supply. 
  Beijing is certainly the right address for such a request. 
And it is tycoons like Mr Li, whose mainland links have long 
given them the ear of the Chinese leadership, who are in the 
best position to deliver it. 
  In the current state of Sino-British political relations, 
the 
Hong Kong Government would be virtually helpless to push through 
any increase, even if it were convinced of the need. The 
failure of Governor Chris Patten to offer any concrete solutions 
to the property speculation problem led to an overnight sit-in 
last night by 11 United Democrat legislators. Although land 
releases beyond the strict minimum of 50 hectares a year laid 
down by the Joint Declaration are technically possible, they 
have to be agreed jointly with the Chinese through the Land 
Commission. 
  It would take someone of Mr Li's stature and influence to 
get 
the Chinese side to be more cooperative. However, the question 
remains whether even Mr Li is able to push China into meeting 
their needs. If keeping a stranglehold on land supply is seen in 
Beijing as a crucial bargaining chip with Britain, there will be 
no increase in the amount of new land for a while yet. 
  An indication of China's negative thinking is the row over 
the release of 62 hectares of land for the construction of the 
airport railway. If China persists in demanding the new land be 
phased in gradually under the 50-hectare quota, it will 
seriously delay the completion of the project and sharply reduce 
the amount of new land available for other projects. It surely 
will win over many Hong Kong people's hearts if Beijing agrees 
to release more lands promptly. 
  Mr Li and his fellow Hong Kong Affairs advisers have been 
claiming that it is a shortage of land, not the hoarding of 
completed flats, which has been pushing up prices. 
Nevertheless, the Consumer Council estimates that about half of 
the flats completed last year have remained vacant. Whom do 
these empty flats belong to?

"Trying To Be Clever Only To End Up With a Blunder; Trying To 
Hide a Mistake Only To Make it More Conspicuous--Brief 
Commentary on the `Secret Constitutional Amendment' Incident by 
the British Hong Kong Government"] 
  [Text] Perhaps Hong Kong Governor Patten himself never 
expected that the "secret constitutional amendment," which was 
aimed at paving the way for his "constitutional reform" in the 
Legislative Council [Legco], has now thrown him into a 
predicament and damaged his credibility. 
  The so-called "secret constitutional amendment" was 
disclosed 
a few days ago by a Hong Kong newspaper. "Guided" by the 
British Hong Kong Government last July, the paper disclosed, the 
British Privy Council amended the "Letters Patent," the 
constitutional law of Hong Kong, without informing the members 
of Hong Kong's Legco. The original provision on the formation 
of Legco, that is, 3 ex-officio seats, 8 appointed seats, and 39 
seats returned by elections was amended to 20 seats returned by 
direct elections, 30 returned by functional constituencies, and 
10 returned by the election committee. This attempt by the 
British Hong Kong Government in the "constitutional amendment" 
is quite obvious, that is, offer constitutional grounds to Legco 
to adopt Patten's "constitutional reform" for the Legco 
elections in 1995. Otherwise, the legislation on 
"constitutional reform" adopted by Legco without relevent 
amendments made to the "Letters Patent" could be regarded as a 
"violation of the constitution." Fully confident that his 
"constitutional reform" will be adopted "intact," Mr. Patten 
made preparations in advance in the first half of last year and 
completed the "constitutional amendment" process in a bid to 
implement his package after its adoption by Legco. 
  However, Patten neglected two points: First, he has said 
volubly that the 1994/1995 elections should be "fair and open" 
and that "everything will be ultimately determined by Legco." 
When China and Britain started negotiations on the 1994/1995 
elections, he also threatened that even an agreement between the 
two sides must eventually be determined by Legco. How could the 
formation of Legco in 1995 be determined by an amendment to the 
"Letters Patent" before Legco has made a decision on the 1995 
electoral package and before Legco has debated the said package? 
Legco's deliberations on the 1995 elections would then be 
meaningless. Patten knows quite well that the "Letters Patent" 
is not an ordinary document which can be willfully amended. 
Moreover, the above amendment has been adopted by the Privy 
Council and signed by the British Queen. This "constitutional 
amendment" move by the British Hong Kong Government is indeed 
mysterious. Why did they do it so stealthily and in secret? 
This is diametrically opposed to Mr Patten's "open" motto! No 
wonder Legco members feel they are being cheated. We can see 
more clearly that the governor's "democracy" is but a soap 
bubble which can be easily pricked. 
  Second, Patten has all along refused to admit that the 
foreign ministers of the two countries had reached agreements 
and understanding on the number of directly elected seats for 
the 1995 elections in letters exchanged in early 1990. Later, 
although the British side reluctantly agreed to take the Joint 
Declaration, the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and 
understanding reached between the two countries as the basis of 
the talks between the two sides, the British side never 
abandoned its "three violations" stance, which included its 
refusal to abide by the agreements and understandings reached 
between the two governments. This was precisely the reason 
which led to the termination of the talks. Nevertheless, 20 
seats returned by direct elections, 30 returned by functional 
constituencies, and 10 returned by the election committee set 
out in the constitutional amendment to the "Letters Patent" and 
adopted by the British Privy Council are identical with those 
set out in the agreements and understandings reached between the 
Chinese and British foreign ministers in their letters exchanged 
in early 1990. We would like to ask: Since the British side 
does not admit that the two countries had reached agreements and 
understanding on the number of directly elected Legco seats in 
1995, why has it amended the "Letters Patent" in this way? 
Thus, it is clearly obvious that the British side knew well 
whether or not the two governments had reached agreements and 
understanding on the 1995 elections and the question of 
convergence with the Basic Law. 
  Mr. Patten's negligence of these two points has thrown him 
into a predicament. In the face of discontent and condemnation 
from within and outside Legco, he put on a show, saying that it 
was but "a storm in a teaspoon" in an attempt to turn a big 
problem into a small one and a small one to nothing. However, 
no matter how experienced Mr. Patten is in playing the tricks of 
a politician, his high-sounding words of "openness and fairness" 
and striving for "democracy" for Hong Kong people collapse by 
themselves. Moreover, his perfidy and violation of the 
agreements and understandings reached between the two 
governments will be exposed to the public. 
  "Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet." This is 
a misfortune which no politician who think himself clever can 
evade.

  [Text] The former secretary for education and man-power, 
John Chan, and the former secretary for treasury, Yeung Kai-yin, 
confirmed yesterday they had turned down invitations to join 
Beijing's third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers. About 50 
more Hong Kong affairs advisers will be appointed in Beijing 
after the Easter holiday next month, a Chinese government 
official said. 
  Chan said the Chinese had approached him in an informal way, 
indicating their intention of inviting him to join the body. 
This was to avoid embarrassment had an official invitation been 
turned down. Chan told the Chinese that he preferred not to 
accept an offer, saying it was a personal decision. "I don't 
think I need to explain why," he said. Chan left the civil 
service last June after a 27-year career to become managing 
director of Kowloon Motor Bus. 
  Yeung, who also resigned last year, gave the same reason for 
not accepting Beijing's offer. "I've made it public that if I 
am asked either by the Chinese government or the Hong Kong 
government to give my personal views on any matters to the 
extent possible, I will do so if I can without taking any 
further position," Yeung said. "I don't need any title." 
  A locally-based Chinese official refused to confirm Chan and 
Yeung's rejection but said it was a matter for individuals 
whether to accept. China has invited several former civil 
servants to be advisers, including Sir David Akers-Jones, the 
former chief secretary, and Wong Ying-wai, the former 
administrative officer.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Suifeng (1728 4482 1496): "New Political </F>
Body `123 Democratic League' Founded in Hong Kong Today"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
"123 Democratic League," composed of 82 persons from various 
circles in Hong Kong, was officially founded today. A founding 
declaration was issued which stated that this league is an 
organization participating in political affairs on the principle 
of "basing itself in Hong Kong, keeping in view the two sides of 
the Taiwan Straits, and concerning itself with the development 
in three regions." Its aim is: "To support China's peaceful 
reunification, promote sincere exchanges between the two sides 
of the straits, and safeguard prosperity and mutual benefit in 
the three regions." 
  Today, the "123 Democratic League" held its first general 
meeting and elected its first central committee, with 20 
members. Chairman of the central committee Jen Shan-ning [0117 
0810 2899] said to our staff reporter: The political program of 
the league provides that concern for Hong Kong affairs is the 
league's most important task, and that besides giving top 
priority to Hong Kong, the league especially wishes to make 
great efforts to promote Hong Kong's communications and 
exchanges with the mainland and Taiwan. He pointed out: Many 
people say the 21st century is a century for the Chinese; Hong 
Kong is an outstanding community in Chinese society, and 
therefore will play a very important role in the 21st century. 
Yet Hong Kong is facing a major change in 1997. What direction 
Hong Kong will head after 1997 and how Hong Kong's relations 
with the mainland and Taiwan will change are very much worth 
studying. In this respect, the Democratic League bases itself 
in Hong Kong and wishes to have the opportunity to represent the 
interests of Hong Kong people and to communicate with both sides 
of the straits. 
  Jen Shan-ning made no attempt to conceal the fact that some 
founding members of the Democratic League graduated from Taiwan 
colleges and have a good knowledge of Taiwan. However, he did 
not accept labeling the league as a "pro-Taiwan" or "right-wing" 
political group. He said: The Democratic League has quite a 
large capacity, and hopes that the exchanges between the two 
sides of the straits and among the three regions will be 
predominantly in the form of dialogue. It does not wish to see 
any confrontation, and regards as worthwhile anything that will 
contribute to communications, exchanges, and mutual benefit 
among the three regions.

  [Text] China's political think-tank preparing the 
mainland's takeover of Hong Kong fears the territory faces a 
post-1997 leadership vacuum because of a lack of eligible senior 
administrators. Members of the Preliminary Working Committee 
(PWC) are already voicing concerns over the positions of the 
chief executive and principal officials of the post-1997 Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) because the posts must be filled by 
Chinese nationals without right of abode elsewhere. They 
believe that with the high proportion of foreign passport 
holders in senior civil service ranks, few senior civil servants 
in Hong Kong will meet the eligibility criteria. 
  Hong Kong leader of the Government and Administration Group 
for the PWC, Leung Chun-ying, said: "(Up to) 50 to 60 per cent 
of the heads of department are expatriates. The remainder -- 
Chinese nationals -- hold either foreign or British passports. 
We are facing the problem of finding enough competent people to 
fill these SAR positions and still be compatible with the Basic 
Law," Mr Leung said. "It is an issue the PWC has identified as 
important to the smooth transition of Hong Kong to an SAR." 
  The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which stipulates 
the 
terms under which Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule, and the 
Basic Law, the territory's post-1997 constitution, state the 
chief executive -- the position which will replace that of 
colonial governor -- and principal officials must be Chinese 
nationals without right of abode elsewhere and must be appointed 
by China. The posts of Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of 
departments, Directors of Bureaus, Commissioner Against 
Corruption, Director of Audit and Commissioner of Police, would 
be filled by Chinese citizens. 
  Mr Leung articulated PWC members' fears, saying the 
possibility of a through-train for senior civil servants to 
retain their posts beyond 1997 was becoming difficult because of 
the high number of foreign passport holders. Concerns over the 
eligibility and number of candidates for top civil servants 
follows PWC recommendations late last month that the chief 
executive be chosen 18 months early because of increasingly 
fractious relations with Britain over Hong Kong's future. That 
advice, also voiced by Mr Leung, would see a shadow governor to 
Chris Patten before British rule ends. 
  Mr Leung carried his criticisms of the civil service 
further, 
claiming senior officials lacked the necessary knowledge of 
China affairs to aid a smooth transfer. He called on the Hong 
Kong Government to delegate a number of high-ranking officials 
to be posted in Beijing to enhance liaison and understanding 
between both administrations. Mr Leung said local officials' 
knowledge of China "lagged behind" by at least 20 years and 
called on the Hong Kong administration to catch up to ensure a 
smooth transition.

  [Text] Who wants to be a civil servant? Not Hong Kong's 
young people, it seems, who quake at the thought of a job in 
government. No challenge, no prospects, they claim. With 
rumours rife of a mass exodus from the ranks in the run-up to 
1997, more than a few eyebrows in Government House are bound to 
be raised by a survey suggesting there will not be many willing 
to fill the void. 
  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Michael Sze, told 
legislators on Thursday there was sufficient existing talent who 
could be promoted to fill vacant senior posts. But a poll of 
513 people between the ages of 15 and 29 showed more than half 
had no intention of applying to join the civil service. Only 30 
per cent wanted to join, the survey conducted by the Hong Kong 
Federation of Youth Groups showed. "The poll indicates that a 
smooth transition is still of great concern to the young people 
in the run-up to 1997," a spokesman said.

  [Text] Seven men and a woman returned positive HIV 
antibody tests last month, bringing the number of HIV-infected 
persons in Hong Kong to 429. The Department of Health believes 
the new patients all contracted the potentially lethal virus 
through heterosexual activity. Four HIV carriers developed the 
deadly AIDS virus last month. There have been 99 confirmed AIDS 
cases in Hong Kong, and 65 of them have already died. 
  The Hong Kong Red Cross blood transfusion service has 
recorded 29 people with the AIDS virus. An AIDS Foundation 
member, Patrick Li, called on the public to stop using the 
transfusion service to find out whether they are HIV carriers. 
The Department of Health and the AIDS Foundation offered free 
and confidential AIDS tests, Li said.

  [Text] China has expressed support for North Korea's 
position on the nuclear issue by asking visiting ROK President 
Kim Yong-sam to suspend the ROK-U.S. Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK. 
  Shen Guofang, a spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry, said 
this to reporters yesterday [28 March] after talks between 
President Kim Yong-sam and PRC President Jiang Zemin. He 
clarified that China has no intention of pressuring North Korea 
on the nuclear issue, saying that China has made efforts in its 
own way, but the role it can play is restricted and that, since 
North Korea is a sovereign country, no other country is in the 
position of telling or requiring it to do anything.

  [Text] Amman, March 28 (XINHUA) -- King Husayn today 
summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent member countries 
of the U.N. Security Council on the huge loss Jordan has 
suffered as a result of the international sanctions against Iraq. 
  The king briefed the ambassadors from the United States, 
Britain, France, Russia and China, the five permanent members of 
the U.N. Security Council, on the severe economic loss on the 
kingdom brought about by the enforcers imposing sanctions 
against Iraq. 
  The U.S.-led enforcers were earlier reported to have stepped 
up efforts to inspect Aqaba-bound ships recently, triggering an 
outcry in the kingdom. 
  The parliament last week called on the government to link 
Jordan's return to the Arab-Israeli negotiation table with the 
lifting of the blockade of Aqaba, and the kingdom subsequently 
lodged a protest with the United States against the siege. 
  Information Minister Jawad al'Anani said Saturday [26 March] 
that the U.S.-led task force monitoring the trade embargo 
against Iraq has inspected a total of 1,700 vessels since 1991 
but has not detected any contraband materials in breach of the 
embargo. Only food and medical supplies are exempt from the 
sanctions. 
  In recent months, Jordanian officials have lodged complaints 
for many times with visiting foreign dignitaries including U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. 
  On Saturday, a cargo ship carrying freight for Jordan coming 
through the Red Sea will be inspected on shore instead of high 
seas in what was viewed as a precedent-setting event, the first 
since the imposition of international sanctions against Iraq. 
  The ship, a 13,000-tonne German vessel carrying 3,000 tonnes 
of general cargo for Jordan, was prevented from proceeding 
toward Aqaba on March 18 by the U.S.-led enforcers. After four 
inspections, the enforcers ruled on Wednesday that the ship, 
Skyman, could not be allowed to proceed to Aqaba since they did 
not have "accessibility" to inspect some of the cargo. 
  The vessel proceeded to a gulf port to unload cargo destined 
there before returning to the Red Sea for a new inspection with 
better cargo accessibility. 
  One source said that "it was half way to a gulf port from 
the 
Red Sea when an agreement was reached after the Jordanian 
Government intervention that the vessel could be inspected at 
Aqaba port rather than the Tiran Straits," where the inspections 
usually take place. 
  "Subsequently, it was recalled to Aqaba," he said. 
  It was not immediately known what response the ambassadors 
had made in the meeting with the king, but observers here said 
that the summon of the ambassadors was a continued effort by the 
kingdom to lift the siege of Aqaba.

  [Text] CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin gave instructions 
early this month urging the authorities concerned to take 
precautionary measures earnestly and to keep pro-democracy 
activists under strict control. 
  Information has it that the Beijing government has adopted 
some special measures to deal with dissidents, worried that a 
democratic movement could emerge again on the 15th anniversary 
of the Beijing Xidan Democracy Wall movement and the fifth 
anniversary of the 4 June Incident this year. In view of the 
fact that the "two sessions" was in progress and a large number 
of foreign reporters had gathered in Beijing covering events, 
the departments concerned were asked to act more cautiously when 
carrying out their mission, but they were still given the go 
ahead to take strong action against pro-democracy activists in 
case the latter "refused to take advice." 
  It is said that concern about Deng Xiaoping's health is 
another factor causing the CPC higher leadership to keep a high 
vigilance against any moves by dissidents in Mainland China.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- A nuclear industry 
exhibition opened here today. 
  On display are equipment and technology of nuclear power 
plants, recycling of nuclear fuel, radioisotope products and 
nuclear waste treatment equipment. 
  About 80 nuclear companies from China and abroad contributed 
to the exhibition, including some of the world's leading nuclear 
companies, such as the Framatome company, the Power Industry 
Corporation from France and Westinghouse from the U.S. 
  The exhibition is co-sponsored by the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade, the Chinese Nuclear Society 
(CNS) and the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation. 
  The exhibition aims to promote foreign exchanges and 
cooperation in this industry, and to promote peaceful use of 
nuclear technology, said a CNS spokesman. 
  He said that as a standing member of the International 
Atomic 
Energy Association [as received], China has had relations with 
more than 40 countries and regions and has trade relations with 
100 foreign clients. 
  With China's rapid economic development, the country has 
made 
great progress in isotope and radiation technology, radiation 
processing and nuclear instrumentation, he said. 
  The first Chinese nuclear power plant, Qin Shan nuclear 
power 
plant in east China's Zhejiang Province, is now safely and 
efficiently operating, while the first unit of the Daya Bay 
nuclear power station bordering Hong Kong in Guangdong Province 
recently went into commercial operation. 
  Some other provinces and cities, especially coastal areas, 
are planning to build more new nuclear power plants.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Implement the `Budget Law,' </F>
Tighten Restrictions on Budgets"] 
  [Text] The "PRC Budget Law" has been adopted by the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress and will be 
implemented from 1 January 1995. This is an important legal 
basis for our country's legal administration of finance, as well 
as a vital step in strengthening the construction of a socialist 
legal system. 
  Budgeting is one of the key means for a country to manage 
its 
social and economic affairs and implement macroscopic regulation 
and has a very important position in the whole country's 
political and economic life. As early as the initial period of 
our country's founding, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The 
state budget is a big issue which reflects the whole country's 
policies because it prescribes the scope and direction of 
government activities." Over the past 40 years or so, our 
country's budget administrative work has constantly improved and 
strengthened, whereas all the people strived to earn more and 
spend less, ensure the supply of funds for key construction 
projects, and promote the rapid development of the undertaking 
of building socialism. The achievement has been remarkable. 
  However, we should also see that over a long period of time, 
we have not drawn up a basic law in budget administration, and 
there are a lot of problems in working out, examining and 
approving, implementing, revising, finally accounting, and 
supervising a budget. For example, the procedure for working 
out a budget is unclear, the rights and duties of budget 
administration are not defined, the procedure for examining and 
approving the budget are not strict, we are not conscientious in 
implementing the budget, and we are slack in budget supervision. 
As a result, budgets do not have the necessary legal solemnity, 
thus leading to the emergence of such phenomena as overspending 
and capital waste. The implementation of the "Budget Law" will 
definitely help overcome the above-mentioned problems, heighten 
the legal effect of budgets at all levels, and give full play to 
the various functions of a budget. Meanwhile, the "Budget Law" 
has an important bearing on ensuring the smooth implementation 
of financial and taxation reform, strengthening the State's 
macroscopic regulation, and promoting the healthy development of 
the socialist market economy. 
  The "Budget Law" unequivocally prescribes the duties and 
competence of the budget administrations of people's congresses, 
governments, departments, and units at all levels. Thus, organs 
of power and executive organs at all levels are requested to 
handle their work in strict accordance with legal provisions to 
ensure the true implementation of the "Budget Law." People's 
congresses and their standing committees at all levels must, in 
light of the provisions of the "Budget Law," conscientiously 
exercise the power of examining and approving budgets and final 
accounts, the power of examining and approving budget revisions, 
the power of supervising budgets and final accounts, and other 
functions, thus making their budgets genuine indexes. 
Governments at all levels must work in strict accordance with 
the provisions of the "Budget Law" to conscientiously draft 
their budgets and final accounts and organize well budget 
implementation. On discovering any violation of the provisions 
of the "Budget Law," they should seriously handle it, 
conscientiously correct it, and thoroughly stop practices 
transgressing budget provisions to safeguard the legal solemnity 
of budgets. Financial departments at all levels and various 
departments and units must also exercise their functions and 
perform various duties undertaken by them in accordance with the 
law. 
  With the implementation of the "Budget Law," the work of 
budget administration will advance to a new stage on a 
legalized, standardized, and scientific path, thus enabling the 
work of budgeting to make new contributions to the establishment 
and development of the socialist market economy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan 
and Mainland China again failed to agree on the the settlement 
of cross-Taiwan Strait fishing disputes and the repatriation of 
illegal mainland Chinese immigrants and hijackers during 
cross-strait talks Tuesday [29 March]. 
  The ongoing round of talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) resumed here Tuesday morning 
after a one-day recess. 
  SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu said after the 
morning session that the two sides again discussed several 
essential points, including the use of binding arbitration to 
resolve cross-strait fishing disputes, "automatic repatriation" 
of illegal mainland immigrants and exemptions to repatriation of 
mainland or Taiwan residents who hijack planes from the other 
side of the Taiwan Strait to their homeland. 
  "As Beijing is still reluctant to recognize Taiwan's legal 
jurisdiction, the two sides failed to narrow their gaps on these 
key issues during the morning talks," said Hsu, who is heading 
the Taiwan delegation to the current round of talks. 
  Taiwan is hoping to automatically repatriate illegal 
mainland 
immigrants while Beijing insists that prior consultations be 
held before each repatriation. The large number of illegal 
mainland immigrants, some of whom have been in Taiwan detention 
centers for more than one year, has placed a huge financial 
burden on Taiwan. 
  SEF delegates and their mainland counterparts agreed to meet 
again Wednesday morning. However, Hsu said he believes the 
chances are slim for the two sides to reach any agreement on the 
three issues during the current round of talks. 
  ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Sun Yafu said the Wednesday 
session will be devoted to putting final touches on this round 
of talks and discussing the timing for the next meeting. 
  The current round of talks began last Friday and are 
scheduled to end Wednesday. This is the fourth round of 
SEF-ARATS talks on the three issues since the heads of the two 
organizations met in Singapore last April. The two sides have 
not reached any accord on the issues in subsequent talks held in 
Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei during the second half of last year. 
  The SEF delegation is scheduled to leave here for home 
Thursday.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- The traditional lawful 
rights of the original residents in the New Territories in Hong 
Kong must be protected and not be revised at will, a spokesman 
said here today. 
  A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under 
the State Council made this statement when asked about the 
revisions presumptuously agreed by the Hong Kong authorities on 
the draft immunity regulation on land in the new territories. 
The revisions have caused strong protests from original local 
residents. 
  The spokesman pointed out that the concept of "original 
residents in the New Territories" and the lawful rights of 
original residents, which were written into the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, should not be removed. 
  The Hong Kong authorities should take the protests of the 
residents into consideration and handle the issue properly 
through full consultation with the original local residents in 
accordance with the Basic Law, thus avoiding man-made social 
instability and separation, he said. 
  The spokesman noted that the British authorities had 
announced in 1898 that all land in the New Territories belonged 
to the British royal house following its forced lease of the 
land through unequal treaties, depriving original residents of 
the New Territories of their land-owning rights. 
  That announcement was persistently resisted by local 
residents. As a result, the later draft immunity regulations on 
land in the New Territories ruled that farmland owners need only 
hand in nominal rents. 
  Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration rules that 
the rent on rural land leased by original residents in the New 
Territories "shall remain unchanged so long as the property is 
held by that person (one who was in 1898 a resident of an 
established village in Hong Kong) or by one of his lawful 
successors in the male line."

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar -- At a luncheon meeting with Prime 
Minister Hosokawa on 20 March, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
touched on Japan-China cooperation in the field of automobiles 
and urged Prime Minister Hosokawa to promote the Japanese auto 
industries' access to the Chinese auto parts market, including 
engines. At the same time, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stressed 
that China will guarantee the quality of Chinese-made rice to be 
imported by Japan. 
  With regard to the auto issue, Vice Premier Zhu said that 
since Japanese companies were reluctant to establish joint 
venture projects in the 1970's, China asked for the cooperation 
of such auto manufacturers as Germany's Volkswagen; that the Big 
Three of the United States have recently started producing auto 
parts in China while Korean companies have indicated their 
intention to produce auto parts; and that Japanese industries 
now can probably afford to cooperate in the area of auto parts 
production.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Mar -- The total amount and all the 
details of the projects connected with the fourth series of 
yen-based loans expected to begin in 1996 which the Chinese 
Government has requested from the Japanese Government have been 
disclosed. In the past, yen-based loans were provided at a 
period of five to seven years. However, the two governments have 
agreed to shorten the term of the fourth series of loans to 
three years. The Chinese Government has simultaneously 
submitted a list of loan requests for a period of five years, 
with the period divided into a first term of three years and a 
second term of two years, and with the amount totaling 
approximately 1.5 trillion yen [Y], which is nearly twice the 
Y810 billion set for the third series of yen-based loan, the 
largest amount requested for the six-year period so far. At the 
same time, the number of projects--mainly for improving the 
industrial infrastructure--has climbed to 71. One project 
costing as much as Y1 trillion has been planned for the first 
three-year term. However, in providing economic aid the Japanese 
Government has requested China suppress its military 
expenditures. Moreover, the Japanese Government itself is 
currently in a severe financial situation. Therefore, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is scheduled to visit China on 
19 March, will face difficulties in dealing with this issue. 
  The Chinese Government has doubled its request for yen-based 
loans because, with the high degree of economic growth, it has 
become conspicuous that China is in short supply of such 
infrastructures (social foundation for production) as 
transportation, energy, and ports. As stated by a Chinese 
government source, judging that "in order to continue this high 
growth the urgent task lies in improving the infrastructure," 
the Chinese Government has decided to make this large-scale 
request to the Japanese Government. 
  Among large-scale projects planned for the first term are 
one 
for transporting huge amounts of coal from inland to coastal 
areas so as to solve the energy shortage problem in the coastal 
areas, and projects for building the Longtouqiao Dam in 
Heilongjiang Province and a hydroelectric power station in 
Yunnan Province. Among projects worked out for the second term 
are one for preventing droughts in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region, and one for promoting environmental protection such as 
eliminating air pollution in Shenyang.

  [Text] Beijing, 24 March -- Touching on China's possible 
reaction at the UN Security Council [UNSC] over the issue of 
North Korean nuclear weapons development, a reliable source in 
Beijing said on 24 March that "China will probably not exercise 
its veto right." In this way, the source hinted at the 
possibility that China may abstain from voting should it be 
forced to express its final stand on the issue of imposing 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  China's stand on the nuclear issue is clear. It is calling 
for a settlement through dialogue between countries and 
organizations concerned, insisting that sanctions or pressure 
"will complicate the situation and create tension on the Korean 
peninsula," (according to Premier Li Peng). Reportedly, China 
at the UNSC is asking other permanent members of the Security 
Council not to impose sanctions against North Korea. It is also 
said that China's true intention is to avoid the possibility of 
being forced to say either "yes" or "no" to the sanctions. 
  Regarding China's possible reaction at the UNSC, the source 
pointed out a "subtle change" in speeches made by Chinese 
officials at the UNSC on the nuclear issue. The source said 
that although Chinese leaders were saying at the initial stage 
that they would "oppose" applying sanctions against or pressure 
on North Korea, they are now saying that China will "not 
approve" it. For example, Premier Li Peng said during his 
January meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and at a news 
conference held on 22 March that China would "not approve" 
sanctions against North Korea. According to the source, this 
change is an indication that China after all will not oppose the 
idea of imposing sanctions against North Korea but will choose 
not to vote.

<F P=106> [Article signed ABS/PHF/RHR: "BLEU-Chinese Trade Will </F>
Continue To Grow Says Chinese Minister"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA database] 
  [Excerpt] Beijing, 3 Mar (BELGA) -- Trade between the 
Belgian- Luxembourg Economic Union [BLEU] and China will 
continue to grow in 1994. Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert 
Urbain was assured of this by his Chinese counterpart Wu Yi at 
Thursday's opening in Beijing of the tenth meeting of the 
BLEU-China Joint Committee [for Trade], despite the already high 
level of trade between the two countries -- worth more than $1 
billion in 1993. 
  Mrs. Wu did not specify whether Chinese exports to the BLEU 
will increase more, or vice-versa, but the total Chinese foreign 
trade deficit in 1993 gives reason to believe that the former 
hypothesis will prevail. 
  Internal growth in China will remain high, and high 
technology imports will continue, especially from the member 
states of the European Union [EU], said Mrs. Wu, who sees in 
this an argument for rejecting the reservations voiced by 
members of the EU concerning the efforts deployed by China to 
conform with GATT standards. She contests the accusations of 
dumping, and insists on the continuous growth of foreign 
investments in China. 
  The leading foreign investment there at the moment is namely 
the construction of the Shanghai Bell factory, which represents 
an investment of more than 9 billion Belgian francs [BFr], for 
which a loan worth over $125 million is about to be granted, 
specified Minister Urbain. When it goes into production in 
Putong in 1994, this factory will be the largest production unit 
in the world for digital telephone lines (5 billion lines per 
annum -- BELGA editor's note), employing 2,700 people who will 
figure among the most productive employees in China. Moreover, 
it is a long-term investment, for the joint venture has been 
extended until 2013. 
  For its part, ATEA-Belgium [Telephone and Electricity 
Workshops, Antwerp], which is trying hard to compete with 
Alacatel-Bell, is making ready to supply the central provinces 
of China with telecommunications equipment worth $133 million. 
Currently, the company is waiting for a green light from the 
regional subsidiaries of the Bank of China. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 -- The 7th session of the Polish- 
Chinese Inter-governmental Commission for Economic and Trade 
Cooperation, held in Beijing on Monday, sized up the state and 
prospects for the development of bilateral economic cooperation. 
On the Polish part, the session was chaired by Minister of 
Transport and Maritime Economy Boguslaw Liberadzki and on the 
Chinese by Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Wu 
Yi. 
  The commission, that had assembled for the first time in 
1991, assessed positively the renewed rise in Polish-Chinese 
turnover over the past three years. Last year, its value 
amounted to 397 million dollars, according to Poland, and to 472 
million dollars, according to China, and was higher by 125 per 
cent as compared with 1992. 
  The protocol signed by the commission on Monday shows that 
mining, power, aviation, electronic, light, chemical and food 
processing industries and transport offered the greatest 
opportunities for the development of Polish-Chinese economic 
cooperation. Working groups are to seek concrete possibilities 
of cooperation in these areas. 
  On Monday, Minister Liberadzki met Chinese Deputy Foreign 
Minister Tian Zengpei [name as received] and on Tuesday he will 
hold talks with Communications Minister Huang Zhendong. On 
Tuesday and Wednesday, members of the Polish delegation 
representing Polish Ministries of Industry and Trade, Foreign 
Economic Relations, Finances, Agriculture and Food Economy, the 
Cabinet Office, commercial bank and the Agriculture Market 
Agency will hold talks with delegates of similar Chinese 
ministries, offices, institutions and enterprises. On Thursday, 
the Polish delegation will be received by Chinese Deputy Prime 
Minister Li Lanqing.

  [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reporter on 8 March, Deng Rong, third daughter of China's 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, said, "My father's health is now 
poorer than three years ago, but he is not ill and is in good 
health." In this way, the Chinese leader's daughter stressed 
that her father Deng Xiaoping is still in good health. In the 
interview, Deng Rong disclosed that CPC General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin and Premier Li Peng have often called on her father to 
seek his advice on major issues. Deng Rong is in Japan to 
commemorate the publication of Japanese edition of her book: 
My Father, Deng Xiaoping. 
  Explaining her father's daily life, she said he does not 
skip 
his daily three-km walk and he still strengthens his body at the 
age of 90. In the interview, she said, "His regular life appears 
to be a key to his long life." Commenting on television news 
reports in February showing her father's blurred eyes, Deng Rong 
said: "My father's eyes were blurred by camera flashes. My 
father's eyes are so good that he can read 10 pages of newspaper 
every morning." 
  In the interview, Deng Rong said: "Her father sees the 
reversion of Hong Kong to China as an end to the humiliating 
chapter in Chinese history and as a great issue on which he 
himself was involved in negotiations." She went on to say: "My 
father wants to visit Hong Kong by car and stand on its soil 
even for a minute. This is what my father desires the most." 
  In another interview that day, Deng Rong touched on the 
Tiananmen incident in June 1989 and said: "Now, China is 
entering an era of political stability and economic development, 
and I believe that my father does not repent for his handling of 
the incident," adding that the comment represents "her personal 
view." On Mr. Deng's advice to General Secretary Jiang Zemin, 
Deng Rong said, "My personal view is that when my father is 
asked to make a judgment on options, he always adds something." 
In this way, she stressed that her father stays away from the 
affairs of state.

  [Text] SANKEI SHIMBUN interviewed Deng Rong (44), third 
daughter of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping (89) and vice 
president of the Japan-China Friendship Liaison Association, in 
a Tokyo hotel on 9 March. Explaining how her family spent Lunar 
New Year, Deng said: "During his stay in Shanghai, my father 
played bridge with his colleagues." In the interview, she also 
revealed that she has devoted herself to writing after resigning 
from a research office. 
  She is in Japan to attend a commemoration of the publication 
of the Japanese edition of her book My Father, Deng 
Xiaoping which has been published in China and Hong Kong. 
  Touching on her father's health, she said: "My father quit 
smoking New Year's Day 1989 at the urging of doctors. He drinks 
two small glasses of Shawxing liquor at meals and takes 
medicine. Although I do not know what kind of medicine he takes 
unless I ask the doctors about it, I assume the medicine is a 
vitamin." 
  In the interview, the Chinese leader's daughter added: "My 
father stayed in Shanghai from mid-December last year to 
February this year during this Lunar New Year. He enjoyed his 
stay in the city, dining with his grandchildren. He played 
bridge three times with his colleagues. He appeared to have won 
only one game." 
  She raised the subject of dancing while speaking of the 
Lunar 
New Year, saying: "I am very good at dancing. Will you dance 
with me?" 
  Asked to comment on reports that she works as "secretary to 
her father," she said with a sweet smile: "The reports are 
incorrect." 
  In the interview, she stated: "My father's hearing is very 
poor, and it is my duty to translate what he speaks in the 
Sichuan dialect into Mandarin. Another duty is to record my 
father's remarks." During the interview, she also said: "I am 
my father's hearing aid." She went on to say that she hands 
over records to her father's secretaries, and therefore she is 
the "secretary to my father's secretaries."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Gao Luchin, director of the PRC's </F>
State Patent Office, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given -- first two paragraphs 
are introduction] 
  [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reporter, Gao Luchin, director of the PRC's State Patent Office, 
said China is in support of moves by Japan and Europe to 
coordinate the world patent system and to adopt a unified global 
principle of first patent application. In the interview, the 
Chinese official in charge of patent affairs said Beijing 
intends to attract more foreign businesses by revamping its 
current patent system to further develop China's economy. 
  Following is a summary of the interview. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How does China view moves to 
coordinate the world patent system? 
  [GAO] In order for the world economy to develop, it is 
necessary to make technology invented by certain nations freely 
transferable across borders. If terms for the acquisition of 
patents and the method of their protection differ from country 
to country, this situation would cause international disputes 
such as patent infringement. It is indispensable to create a 
world patent system to avert such international disputes. The 
United States is the only nation which maintains the principle 
of first invention, but China intends to ask that country for an 
early shift to the principle of first patent application in the 
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and other 
international organizations. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The world sees China as a highly 
potential market. How does China plan to attract foreign 
capital and technology? 
  [GAO] Japanese and other foreign enterprises see China as a 
market that will grow in the future. China is willing to 
introduce technologies held by foreign firms which can serve to 
develop China's economy. In order for the enterprises of many 
nations to easily make business inroads into China with their 
own technologies and gain access to the Chinese market, China 
needs to protect their intellectual property rights effectively 
and correctly. 
  To that end, China intends to simplify the current 
procedural 
process in a bid to shorten the period of patent examination for 
the acquisition of patent rights and work to strengthen the 
examination system to protect property rights correctly. 
Specifically, in order for technologies of foreign firms and 
inventors to be properly protected, China intends to work 
towards improving the management of the patent system by 
promoting both an exchange of experts with foreign nations and 
an exchange of views with officials in charge of patent affairs 
in the firms of industrialized nations. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Would you explain how China is 
working to revamp its patent system and how it will work to do 
in the future? 
  [GAO] China first introduced the patent system in 1985, nine 
years ago. The history of China's patent system is short 
compared with that of Japan, Europe, and the United States. It 
can be said China was able to introduce a modern patent system 
on the model of patent systems in industrialized nations. China 
sweepingly amended the Patent Law in March 1993, and now the law 
gives the same protection to patent rights as those of 
industrialized nations. 
  China aims to join GATT as a member nation. China has taken 
steps to protect its manufacturing technology and to adopt a 
patent system on materials in line with the contents of the 
Intellectual Property Right Accord hammered out last December at 
the Uruguay Round. In the future, China seeks to join the 
Budapest Convention on the international consignment of 
microorganisms.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar -- During talks with Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 20 March, Chinese Premier Li Peng 
touched on the reform of the United Nations which Japan has 
proposed. He said: "I support the idea of reforming the UN 
Security Council at an appropriate time." However, he added: 
"Because it will affect interests of various countries, careful 
consideration is necessary." 
  It is said that by these remarks, Li indicated China's 
cautious stand about giving support to Japan for its bid to 
become a permanent member of the UN Security Council through its 
reform.

<F P=106> [Interview with Long Yongtu, director of the International </F>
Bureau of the Ministry of International Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, by Yuki Nagamochi; place and date not given] 
  [Text] A working-level meeting to examine China's 
application to join GATT will start in Geneva on 15 March. 
Fundamentally, Japan, the United States, and European nations 
support the application to help China, which is making a 
remarkable economic development, get used to the rules of 
international trade. However, there is a gap between the 
demands of China and other countries. This paper interviewed 
Long Yongtu, director of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Economic Cooperation International Bureau and leader of a 
Chinese negotiation team, and heard "what China has to say." 
  [Nagamochi] Lately, China is stressing its "flexibility" at 
negotiations for joining GATT. Why? 
  [Long] "The GATT member nations began to talk with us about 
the emergency restriction on imports of Chinese products. To 
us, this is discrimination. However, they explained to us that 
it is a temporary measure which will be taken until China 
establishes a market economy. This is the reason." 
  "However, it is still uncertain if we will ultimately accept 
it. Such matters as a guarantee that it is a temporary measure 
and that China will be allowed to have thorough discussions with 
our partner nations until imposition of the restriction will be 
preconditions for our acceptance. We will start official 
discussions with the GATT members on such points." 
  [Nagamochi] China's average tariff rate is about 30 percent. 
It is still high. Is China ready to lower tariffs? 
  [Long] "Needless to say, we will make significant reductions 
on the basis of the agreement, reached at the Uruguay Round, on 
lowering tariff rates. We already submitted our schedules for 
abolishing the system of issuing import permits for many goods." 
  [Nagamochi] China is assuming the stand that "unreasonable 
demands that transcend the level of our economic development 
cannot be accepted." 
  [Long] We want to be treated as a developing country. For 
example, World Trade Organization (WTO) member nations are 
required to abolish their restrictions on business activities of 
foreign-affiliated companies in their countries in two years if 
they are developed countries. It is four years for developing 
countries. China can abolish its restrictions in five years. 
  The American delegates, who visited China recently, made 
unreasonable demands. We are applying for GATT membership on 
the basis of our own needs. We will actively introduce measures 
with the aim of joining GATT. However, we will not join GATT if 
it will harm our economic and trade interests.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
met with Susumu Nikaido, former vice president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party who is now visiting China, in Beijing on 14 
March. During this meeting, Jiang emphatically repeated: "Even 
if China continues to grow and becomes powerful in the future, 
it will never become a military threat." He thus refuted 
growing warnings by China's neighbors, who are now alarmed by 
its sharp increase in military spending, that the country will 
become a threat to them. Jiang also indicated he was looking 
forward to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China 
starting on 19 March, and said: "I want to discuss various 
issues with Prime Minister Hosokawa, too."

  [Text] United Nations, March 29 (XINHUA) -- China cannot 
accept a Security Council resolution on the nuclear issue in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a Chinese United 
Nations diplomat said today. 
  "As far as the present stage is concerned, we cannot accept 
the Security Council resolution, either its form or content," 
said Chen Jian, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the 
United Nations. 
  He made the remark while answering reporters' questions 
outside the Security Council chamber, where council members had 
just finished private consultations on the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  "But", he said, "China could consider a presidential 
statement of mild, constructive and objective nature, which will 
urge the parties to implement the agreements they have already 
reached." 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suspended its 
nuclear inspections in the DPRK, blaming the DPRK for not 
allowing it to take samples from nuclear sites. 
  The DPRK responded by saying the IAEA demand went beyond the 
previous agreement between the two sides. 
  "We think it was counterproductive for the Security Council 
to exert pressure on the parties because this will complicate 
the issue and put the parties into the corner, impossible, or 
less possible, to move around," Chen said. 
  Chen further explained that China takes this position 
"because China is concerned about the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula and the maintenance of peace and stability in 
the region." 
  "So every action the international community takes ought to 
promote dialogue between the parties so as to achieve these two 
aims of denuclearization and the maintenance of peace and 
security," he said. 
  Chen said China has seen some progress toward the solution 
of 
the issue through the approach of dialogue. 
  "The present difficulty is a rhythm in the course of 
implementing the agreement which was reached between the DPRK 
and the IAEA on March 15," he said. 
  "That is the nature of difficulty, so we should resolve the 
issue through further discussions by the parties concerned," he 
added.

<F P=106> ["Russia To Provide Aid If DPRK Invaded" -- XINHUA headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov said here today that Russia would 
provide aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea if the 
latter is invaded without any provocation. 
  Speaking at a press conference, Panov said that the 
agreements signed by the former Soviet Union and DPRK are still 
effective, but Russia will make decisions on the basis of its 
own analysis. 
  Panov also briefed reporters on Russia's new proposal for 
solving the crisis in the Korean peninsula. 
  According to Panov, the situation on the Korean peninsula is 
so tense that it is on the verge of war. He suggested that an 
international conference be held among China, the United States, 
Japan, Russia, DPRK, the Republic of Korea, as well as the 
United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  He said that such a conference should first of all discuss 
how to guarantee the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula 
including the joint announcement on a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula by both sides of Korea. 
  Panov suggested the international conference be held first 
in 
Geneva and then in Pyongyang and Seoul in turn. 
  He said the United Nations and IAEA have made great efforts 
to solve the Korean issue, but the results are not always 
satisfactory. 
  He added that all related parties are considering Russia's 
new proposal.

Fenyong (6328 1164 0516); Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in 
Chinese at 0403 GMT on 17 March transmits a service message 
canceling the following item and asking it be replaced with 
another version; differences between the two items noted below] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Fourth World 
Conference on Women will be held in Beijing in 1995. A total of 
30,000 people are expected to attend the conference. This will 
be the largest international event hosted by our country, and no 
woman in China or other countries has not paid attention to it. 
How is the [variant version reads: ...our country, and it has 
attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign women. How is 
the... (rephrasing)] host of the conference, China, making the 
preparations for the conference? Kang Ling, who is currently 
attending the Second Session of the Chinese [variant version 
reads ...Second Session of the National Committee of the 
Chinese... (adding "the National Committee")] People's Political 
Consultative Conference and secretary of the All-China Women's 
Federation [ACWF] Secretariat, answered this question in a 
highly [variant version reads ...Federation Secretariat, 
answered in a highly... (deleting "this question")] affirmative 
tone: "Our government places great importance on the conference 
to be held in Beijing. Preparations for the conference have 
been satisfactory." [variant version reads: ...on the 
conference. Preparations have been satisfactory." ... (deleting 
"to be held in Beijing" and "for the conference")]. 
  Kang Ling said: In August 1992, the State Council 
established the Chinese Organizing Committee for the Fourth 
World Conference on Women, whose chairperson is Peng Peiyun. 
The Chinese Organizing Committee is composed of [variant 
version reads: ...Conference on Women headed by Peng Peiyun. It 
is composed of... (replacing "whose chairperson is" with "headed 
by" and "The Chinese Organizing Committee" with "it")] 30 units 
and 37 members, 12 of whom are female ministers or vice 
ministers and four are officials in charge of nongovernmental 
organizations [NGO's]. Under the organizing committee are five 
functional subcommittees and one office, with the subcommittees 
being tasked, respectively, with propaganda and mobilization, 
committee affairs, administration, and finance and security. 
The [variant version reads: ...with the subcommittees taking 
charge, respectively, of propaganda and mobilization, committee 
affairs, administration, finance, and security. The... 
(replacing "being tasked, respectively, with" with "taking 
charge, respectively, of" and rephrasing)] functional 
subcommittees have drawn up detailed annual work plans and 
monthly progress plans. All kinds of preparations are 
proceeding in an intensive and orderly manner. Madame Gertrude 
Mongella, secretary general of the Fourth World Conference on 
Women, and Kunren Supalada Mashadi [transliteration of name as 
received], chief convener of "Forum '95," led fact-finding 
delegations to Beijing last June and in mid-February of this 
year, respectively. Expressing satisfaction with the 
preparatory work for the conference, they decided to hold the 
conference at the International Convention Center in Beijing, 
and agreed to hold the opening and closing ceremonies in the 
Great Hall of the People. 
  Kang Ling specifically discussed the work, entrusted to the 
ACWF by the Chinese Organizing Committee, of the committee for 
the forum of NGO's in the host country. She said: The NGO's 
forum is the main venue where mass organizations will discuss 
women's issues. The forum, which has attracted many 
participants, will discuss a wide range of issues. The forum's 
primary theme is "Equality, Development, and Peace"; its 
secondary theme is "Health Care, Education, and Employment." 
The forum will take the form of symposiums of varying sizes or 
special-topic seminars where each of the participants can 
express his or her views freely. As the host, the ACWF should 
organize Chinese women to participate in the forum's activities. 
It is expected that 5,000 people in China are expected to 
attend the forum, surpassing the number from any of the host 
countries in previous conferences. Through the forum, Chinese 
women will make friends with their counterparts in other 
countries, share experiences, and learn from each other so as to 
let the world understand China and to inform Chinese women about 
the world. 
  CPPCC member Kang Ling also discussed the significance of 
the 
upcoming World Conference on Women in promoting our country's 
work toward women. She said: The Third World Conference on 
Women was held in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, in 1985. The 
conference formulated the "Forward-Looking [variant version 
reads: ...was held in the capital of Kenya in 1985, and it 
formulated the "Forward- Looking... (rephrasing)] Strategy of 
Nairobi on the Development of Women." The Seventh Chinese 
Women's Congress set 10 goals regarding the development of our 
country's women in this century in accordance with the 
objectives outlined in the "Nairobi Strategy" and in light of 
China's realities. 
  She said: In ushering in the World Conference on Women, our 
government and people will advance these goals in real earnest, 
working to develop our women's programs in keeping with the 
excellent situation where reform is deepening and various 
economic and social services are flourishing. 
  A large number of women throughout the country are not only 
concerned about the World Conference on Women's convocation but 
have also expressed a strong desire to get involved. Many 
female comrades wrote to the [variant version reads: ...get 
involved. Many people wrote to the... (replacing "female 
comrades" with "people")] Chinese Organizing Committee and the 
ACWF expressing the hope that they would be able to attend the 
conference or deal with some matters related to the conference. 
Kang Ling said: The feelings of the broad ranks of female 
comrades are understandable. What is important is that they 
should work efficiently in their respective jobs; this is how 
they support and take part in the conference's activities. 
  Kang Ling said joyously: Leading comrades from many 
government departments not only actively support the organizing 
committee's work but have also signaled their intention to get 
involved. Taking the World Conference on Women as one's own 
affair is something that we should feel happy about. 
  In closing, she told the reporters: The ACWF will [variant 
version reads: ...feel happy about. She indicated: The ACWF 
will... (merging grafs and rephrasing)] will try its best to 
support and coordinate the various preparations being made by 
the government to make the conference a complete success.

  [Text] Wuhan, March 29 (XINHUA) -- China will continue to 
gain support from United Nations organizations in providing 
health care for mothers and children in the country's poor 
areas, as well as population-control services. 
  The UN Children's Fund and Population Fund have decided to 
prolong the term of the project called "Health Care for Mothers 
and Children, and Population-Control Services in China," and 
continue to shore up the project by adopting interim measures. 
  "This is because China has won credit from the international 
organizations in carrying out the project plan and achieved 
marked progress in lowering the mortality rate of mothers and 
infants," said a spokesman for an ongoing work conference held 
by the three sides in Yichang, in central China's Hubei Province. 
  The program started in 1990 to cut the mortality rate of 
mothers and infants in the country's poor areas, and to enable 
the grassroots medical bodies to provide better health care for 
them as well as effective birth-control services. 
  The project covers 300 poor counties in 27 provinces and 
autonomous regions. 
  The authorities believe that it is imperative for China to 
meet its promise of "Health Care for Everyone by 2000." 
  Chinese government agencies at all levels have poured 275 
million yuan into implementing the programs. A total of 360,000 
medical workers have received special training, and 6,850 towns 
and 97,753 villages have received basic medical equipment 
through the project. 
  Another five counties are to be included in the project. 
  The officials disclosed that the mortality rates of mothers 
and infants in China are respectively 0.95 per 1,000 and 3.1 
percent, much lower than the averages for developing countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Separate Trade From </F>
Human Rights"] 
  [Text] Following U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's visit to China in mid-March, whether the United 
States will extend China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status has 
become the focus of attention of the United States, China, and 
the relevant countries and regions. Christopher originally 
intended to apply the question of MFN to put pressure on China, 
urging the country to improve its "human rights" situation. The 
Chinese side frankly told him, however, that "China will never 
accept the human rights values of the United States." Moreover, 
China opposes linking trade with the question of human rights. 
As a result, the ball has again reached the U.S. court. What 
course should be followed? The United States is indeed facing 
an important choice. 
  On 16 March, the third day after Christopher's visit to 
China, U.S. President Clinton made his first response. In 
Sino-U.S. relations, he said, "the question of human rights is 
important, but so are other issues." He also promised that the 
utmost effort will be made to remove the differences between the 
two countries and expressed his determination to resolve the 
contention with China on the question of human rights. The 
Chinese Government immediately pointed out that his remarks 
constituted "a positive sign." Following that, calls for 
extending China's MFN status were made one after another from 
various U.S. circles, and all were opposed to the linkage of 
human rights and trade. Former President Bush, former 
Secretaries of State Kissinger and Vance, and other major 
figures from the political circles personally made appeals, 
which were followed by large numbers of entrepreneurs, 
economists, parliamentary members, and government officials, 
gradually forming a powerful opinion. 
  The WASHINGTON POST pointed out frankly in an article that 
the revocation of China's MFN status would be "a big economic 
mistake" by the United States. In addition to harming China's 
economic interests, it will also harm U.S. economic interests. 
As a matter of fact, China had pointed out long ago that 
Sino-U.S. relations are based on common interests rather than 
the same ideology and political system. Many Americans also 
made estimates of the U.S. economy. The chairman of the 
U.S.-China Commerce Committee said that the volume of U.S. 
exports to China totaled $9 billion last year. Once China's MFN 
status is revoked, the Chinese side will undoubtedly retaliate, 
which will in turn affect U.S. trade with China. Another 
chairman of the U.S. Shoe Wholesale and Retail Association said 
that Chinese shoes account for half of the U.S. market. If 
imports from China are ceased, the prices of shoes will soar. 
If China's MFN status is revoked, some people predicted, 
inflation in the United States will increase by at least 0.15 
percent annually. 
  According to U.S. officials, as Clinton made an executive 
order last year, linking China's MFN status to the question of 
human rights, the United States had to ask China to accept its 
human rights request, though it did not want bilateral trade 
ties to be affected. In fact, the United States has gotten 
caught in a web of its own spinning. It is true that the U.S. 
President's executive order will not work in China. Although 
human rights and trade are two different matters, the United 
States tried to lump the two together in an attempt to exert 
pressure on China. In the end, however, it bound its own hands 
and feet. Whoever started the trouble should end it, and it is 
unlikely that China will help the United States extricate itself 
from this predicament. Since the U.S. President issued an 
executive order last year linking human rights with trade, he 
must have an option available for separating the two this year. 
  The status quo of human rights in the United States also 
needs to be improved. The poor human rights record of the 
United States is known to all. The British weekly the ECONOMIST 
has asked: How would the Americans feel if foreign countries 
had imposed trade sanctions against the United States for its 
poor human rights record in 1955? How could the United States 
prove that its human rights situation has improved if the trade 
sanctions had continued to the present day? If trade is used as 
the method, the weekly pointed out, besides the adverse 
influence on China and the United States, it will get out of 
control and affect other countries and regions. 
  The U.S. paper the NEW YORK TIMES said in a report published 
the day before yesterday that the economic authority under 
President Clinton had reached a common understanding: The U.S. 
annual practice of making use of human rights to threaten the 
revocation of China's MFN status is outdated and should be 
replaced. The report also said that this proposal is making the 
rounds at the White House and the State Department. "It seems 
that this mentality has taken ground in Congress." Of course, 
these moves are worth welcoming. The settling of the MFN issue 
once and for all is in conformity with the fundamental interests 
of the China and the United States. As the United States has 
not yet made a decision, we still have to wait and see. The 
question of MFN has great relevance for Hong Kong. As for 
China, it is prepared for either of the two outcomes: "It is 
hoping for the best result, but is also prepared for the worst."

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Li Wenyun (2621 2429 0061): "U.S. Arms </F>
Industry Quickens Pace of Turning to Production of Civilian 
Goods"] 
  [Text] After the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Government 
stressed the need to shift the focus of investment in research 
and development from the arms industry to the field of civilian 
technology to promote adjustment of the industrial structure and 
to ensure the U.S. leading position in comprehensive strength. 
  In the course of shifting to civilian production, U.S. arms 
industry changed in two ways. First, it made a policy change; 
second, it made technical changes. In February 1993, shortly 
after President Clinton took office, he announced a new 
technology program in California. The program included the 
adoption of some major actions to shift federal institutions 
which originally concentrated on weaponry and energy research to 
the development of civilian commercial technologies, such as 
information, biological, superconductor, and environmental 
protection technologies. Public opinion in the United States 
held that industrial policy might "give rise to a major change 
in the balanced relationship between civilian research and 
development and military research and development." In March 
1993, the Clinton administration announced a five-year plan for 
shifting the arms industry to civilian production between 1993 
and 1997. The key points of this plan are as follows: 
Investing $20 billion in five years to support the cooperation 
of various research organs of the government and industrial 
circles (including the arms industry) in developing technologies 
serving both military and civilian purposes; promoting 
commercialization of military technology to promote economic 
growth and also protect the foundation of the national defense 
industry; giving vocational retraining to people who lose their 
jobs in the arms industry, and helping communities which suffer 
losses due to the closedown of industrial arms enterprises. For 
this purpose, the government planned to allocate $5.2 billion 
for job placement for personnel, and $4.7 billion to develop 
projects serving both military and civilian purposes. In 
addition, last year, the United States scrapped the extremely 
costly "Star Wars" program which had been carried out for 10 
years, suspended construction of the super-class super collider, 
and reduced the scale of the "Liberty" space station. This 
indicated that the Clinton administration laid greater stress on 
the civilian arena when arranging the key points of scientific 
research and technological development and the movement of 
budgetary funds. The gigantic arms industry in the United 
States was the outcome of the arms race in the period of the 
Cold War. Most advanced technologies in the United States were 
first developed and applied in the military field before they 
were applied to civilian projects. However, in the new 
circumstances, although military strength remains of great 
importance for the United States, the existence of a gigantic 
industrial arms system was obviously no longer suited to the new 
situation. In order to increase its strength as the dominant 
power in international affairs, the United States needed the 
backing of great economic strength. Thus, it was quite natural 
that its national defense industry was shifted to serve civilian 
purposes. 
  As far as the change in production was concerned, in the 
words of people in the circles of the U.S. arms industry, they 
were going to set up "more flexible production lines." They 
held that the change in production did not merely mean the 
production of new products; instead "the inflexible production 
lines and hard tools should be replaced with soft tools, 
flexible machines, and fast-reacting work teams." Thus, more 
than one product could be manufactured with the same equipment. 
That is to say, the main orientation in the shift of production 
in the arms industry was to develop technologies that served 
both military and civilian purposes. Contractors who previously 
only received orders from the Pentagon were encouraged to 
develop technologies that could be applied to civilian 
production and would also be able to serve national defense 
purposes. The "double-purpose" orientation was fully stressed 
in the Clinton administration's five-year plan. The technology 
reinvestment part of the five-year plan included eight specific 
projects, and six of them were directly related to the 
"double-purpose" pattern. For example, the "key technological 
cooperation plan for national defense and civilian purposes," 
the "commercial-military integrated cooperation plan," and the 
"plan for promoting the dual-purpose technologies," all served 
the purpose of developing technologies which had commercial 
value and also had the prospect of being applied to the military 
field. 
  In the course of shifting military industry and technology 
to 
civilian production, American scientists and technologists were 
aware that special attention had to be paid to structural change 
in basic research; otherwise, the momentum of development would 
not last long. In addition, in the course of structural change, 
a large number of structural layoffs may happen. This is a 
major problem concerning jobs for 1 million civilian staffers 
and 1 million military personnel, and must be properly solved.

  [Text] Damascus, March 29 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher will make a fresh tour of the Middle 
East in the second half of April before the resumption of the 
Arab-Israel bilateral peace talks in Washington, a Syrian 
newspaper reported today. 
  The newspaper "AL-BA'ATH," mouthpiece of the ruling party, 
called today on the U.S., a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace 
process, to play its supposed role for achieving the objectives 
of this process. 
  The paper argued that the U.S. is capable of putting 
pressure 
on Israel to commit itself to adhering to the peace process in 
both words and deeds. 
  The Arab parties involved in the peace talks include Syria, 
Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. 
  According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, 
Christopher's coming tour of the region is intended to hold 
preliminary talks with the parties involved in the Middle East 
peace process to remove the obstacles to the resumption of the 
peace negotiations and set a date for such resumption. 
  Arab political sources in Damascus maintain that Christopher 
is likely to make some progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track 
of the peace negotiations, which will enable him to focus on 
pushing the peace process forward. 
  Yet the sources hold that Christopher's task of persuading 
the Arab parties, particularly Syria, to resume the Washington 
talks would not be an easy job because Syria adheres to its 
consistent stand. Syria insists that peace can be achieved only 
on the basis of a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories and the full restoration of the Palestinian 
people's rights, especially their rights to repatriation, 
self-determination and the establishment of an independent state. 
  The sources add that Syria adheres to the peace-for-land 
principle and condemns Israel's intransigent stand which 
consists in its insistence on considering the security 
arrangements to be made in the Golan Heights without showing 
willingness to withdraw completely from there.

  [Text] While attending the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC] in Beijing, Jia Qinglin, Fujian 
Provincial CPC Committee secretary and Fujian governor, said: 
Thanks to the deep-going reform, an export-oriented economic 
structure is gradually taking shape in Fujian. As one of the 
country's pioneers in respect of opening up to the outside 
world, Fujian has built a large number of special economic, 
economic and technological development, coastal open cities and 
open development, Taiwan investment, bonded, high and new 
technological and industrial development, state-level tourism 
and vacation, and urban construction and development zones 
invested and managed by foreign entrepreneurs. Fujian has now 
become one of the most advanced provinces and regions in the 
whole country in terms of reform scale, scope, and policy 
coverage. By the end of last year, Fujian had approved the 
establishment of nearly 13,000 foreign-funded enterprises, 
absorbed more than $5.98 billion of foreign capital, and put 
into operation more than 5,700 enterprises run with three types 
of capital [foreign, Overseas Chinese, and both Chinese and 
foreign capital]. 
  Jia Qinglin stated: Last year, Fujian's domestic gross 
national product registered a 25.4 percent increase over the 
previous year, thereby attaining the goal of quadrupling the 
gross national product one year ahead of schedule. Moreover, 
Fujian's financial revenue topped 100 million yuan for the first 
time. Thanks to the fast growing export-oriented economy, 
Fujian witnessed benign economic growth in 1993. 
  Jia Qinglin noted: This year, despite the introduction of 
new tax and unified exchange rate systems, Fujian's 
export-oriented economy has displayed an incessantly strong 
momentum and vitality. The contracted amount of foreign 
investment and actual amount of foreign investment in the 
province's newly approved enterprises run with three types of 
capital in the January-February period totalled more than $1.33 
billion and $380 million respectively, representing a 11.2 
percent increase and a 49.5 percent increase over the same 
period of last year. Moreover, the province's total export 
volume in the January-February period reached $840 million, 
representing a 44.1 percent increase over the same period of 
last year.

  [Text] The Second Session of the Seventh Jiangsu 
Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] opened ceremoniously in Nanjing 
on the afternoon of 22 February. Chen Huanyou, secretary of the 
Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee, gave an important speech at 
the meeting. Sun Han, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial CPPCC 
Committee, delivered the work report of the Seventh Jiangsu 
Provincial CPPCC Committee Standing Committee at its request. 
  Chen Huanyou said: The second session of the seventh 
provincial CPPCC committee is an important meeting held at an 
important juncture when Jiangsu is restructuring its economic 
system in accordance with guidelines laid down by the 14th 
National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee. The meeting will be significant for 
mobilizing all CPPCC organs and members, democratic parties, 
industrial and commercial federations, mass organizations, and 
people of all walks of life in Jiangsu to achieve greater 
successes in CPPCC operations and to expedite Jiangsu's reform, 
opening up, and modernization. On behalf of the Jiangsu 
Provincial CPC Committee, he warmly congratulated the session 
and extended his cordial regards to all CPPCC members, all CPPCC 
organs, democratic parties, industrial and commercial 
federations, mass organizations, and people of all walks of life 
in Jiangsu. 
  After briefly reviewing the fruitful results which Jiangsu 
achieved last year in seizing opportunity, deepening reform, and 
opening up wider to the outside world, as well as simultaneously 
promoting a material civilization and socialist ethics, Chen 
Huanyou pointed out: These successes are the results of the 
hard work done by the vast number of cadres and people in 
Jiangsu--including all CPPCC organs, democratic parties, 
industrial and commercial federations, mass organizations, and 
people of all circles--under the correct leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council. CPPCC organs at all 
levels in Jiangsu and the vast number of CPPCC members have 
played an important role in the overall development of Jiangsu. 
  Chen Huanyou also pointed out: 1994 is a very crucial year 
for expediting reform, opening up, and modernization in 
accordance with the guidelines laid down by the 14th National 
Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee. Seizing the opportunities, deepening reform, 
opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, 
and ensuring stability are requirements of overall importance 
set for the entire party and the entire country by the CPC 
Central Committee. Work in all quarters must obey and serve 
these requirements. While doing our work, we must fully adhere 
to the general policy set for accomplishing this year's 
assignments, and must pay special attention to properly handling 
the relationship between reform, development, and stability. 
This year's assignments are formidable. Under such 
circumstances, people's political consultative organs are 
important organs for multiparty cooperation and political 
consultations under the CPC leadership, as well as important 
avenues for fostering a socialist democracy. We must improve 
CPPCC operations and make this year's assignments successful by 
continuing to unite all forces which can be united and by 
mobilizing all positive factors. 
  Chen Huanyou urged the provincial CPPCC committee to do 
three 
things. First, achieve a consensus of view by thoroughly 
studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the "decision" made by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. To 
promote unity and cooperation among member units and people of 
various circles, to properly perform their basic political 
consultative and democratic supervisory duties, and to attain a 
higher level of participating in administration and state 
affairs discussion, members of the provincial people's political 
consultative committee must thoroughly study and comprehend the 
theory and decision until a consensus of views and common 
understanding have been achieved. Second, members of the 
provincial CPPCC committee must earnestly perform their basic 
political consultative and democratic supervisory duties so as 
to contribute to Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. The provincial CPPCC committee must organize and 
mobilize its members to investigate, inspect, and discuss 
decisions in a planned manner as well as come up with ways and 
means for reform, opening up, economic construction, social 
development, and other major issues. The provincial CPPCC 
committee must make active efforts to promote the development of 
science and technology, education, culture, health, sports, and 
other social services; it must contribute its wisdom and 
strength to Jiangsu's socialist spiritual construction. During 
the course of improving party conduct, promoting administrative 
ethics, and fighting corruption, the provincial CPPCC committee 
must intensify its supervision. In safeguarding social 
stability, it should actively assist party committees and 
government departments in handling all types of contradictions 
among the people and in dissolving all factors of instability so 
that stability and political unity can be maintained. 
  Third, the provincial CPPCC committee must foster democracy 
and unite more closely so as to consolidate and develop the 
patriotic united front. As reforms continue to deepen, a 
stronger and broader patriotic united front has become even more 
essential for expediting economic construction. This is an 
important mission placed on the shoulders of the people's 
political consultative organs during the new period. While 
doing its work, the provincial CPPCC committee must foster 
democracy, unite more closely, and display the spirit of 
providing democratic consultations. It should give full scope 
to the roles played by all democratic parties, industrial and 
commercial federations, and mass organizations. It should 
strive to create a democratic, united, and harmonious 
environment, and to unclog and broaden all democratic channels. 
To promote the great cause of the motherland's peaceful 
reunification, it should also strive to broaden the patriotic 
united front overseas. 
  In conclusion, Chen Huanyou stressed: The party must provide 
stronger leadership over CPPCC organs. Party committees at all 
levels must do an even better job in upholding all rules 
governing political consultations and democratic supervision. 
Meanwhile, they should actively create conditions essential for 
CPPCC members to participate in administration and state affairs 
discussion, and should give CPPCC organs the support they need 
for carrying out their projects so that CPPCC organs can give a 
broader scope to their roles. 
  In his report, Sun Han pointed out: Since the seventh 
provincial CPPCC Standing Committee began operating a year ago, 
it has, under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC 
Committee, extensively rallied all democratic parties, mass 
organizations, patriots without party affiliation, and 
representatives of various circles in Jiangsu; organized and 
guided members to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as 
the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee; actively carried out political 
consultations and democratic supervision, centering around 
Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization; actively 
established relations with friends overseas for the motherland's 
reunification; continued to collect cultural and historical 
material; and strengthened itself so that its members can 
function more effectively as a whole. All this shows the 
provincial CPPCC committee has achieved new success in 
consolidating and developing the patriotic united front; in 
expediting Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization; in 
building a better socialist democratic and legal system; and in 
promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. 
  Speaking on projects for 1994, Sun Han stated: In accordance 
with the basic policy of the party and the state, as well as the 
provincial party committee's planning, we will continue to 
organize and guide our members to study the third volume of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress; will 
follow through with the "decision" made by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and actively carry 
out consultative and supervisory activities, centering around 
economic construction; will establish stronger relations between 
members of the provincial CPPCC committee and people of all 
walks of life in society; will actively carry out theoretical 
studies about operations of CPPCC organs; and will continue to 
build CPPCC organs into stronger bodies. I hope CPPCC organs at 
all levels and their members will work with one heart and mind, 
make concerted efforts, and make greater contributions to 
achieving the grand objectives set for Jiangsu's reform and 
development. (excerpts of the report will be issued separately)

chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee. Vice Chairmen Chen 
Suiheng, Zhang Chenhuan, Peng Sixun, Xu Yingrui, Han Wenzao, 
Tong Fu, Sha Renlin, and Dai Shuhe as well as Secretary General

<F P=106> ["Provincial CPC Committee and Government Hold Spring </F>
Festival Mass Greeting"] 
  [Excerpts] On the morning of 8 February, the provincial 
CPC Committee and government held a spring festival mass 
greeting at the Zhijiang Hotel where party, government, and 
military leaders at provincial and city levels as well as 
personages of various circles met to celebrate the spring 
festival with a cup of tea. [passage omitted] 
  Li Zemin said: Over the past year, we have comprehensively 
carried out the guiding spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and 
marched forward along the road of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. People across the province have overcome 
difficulties and promoted overall economic and social 
development by further emancipating their minds, seeking truth 
from facts, seizing opportunities, earnestly carrying out 
reforms, and working in a down-to-earth manner. We have 
stabilized and strengthened agricultural foundation and promoted 
rural reform. We have accelerated the change of enterprises' 
management mechanisms, readjusted the economic structure, 
improved the construction of infrastructure projects, strived to 
broaden the scopes and fields of the drive to open to the 
outside world, and improved the structure and level of export- 
oriented economy. In light of new problems cropping up during 
the course of rapid economic development, we have followed the 
requirements of the central authorities to strengthen and 
improve macro-economic control. In addition, we have paid 
attention to the drive of deepening reform and opening wider to 
the outside world so as to gradually solve outstanding 
contradictions and problems in our economic life. As a result, 
Zhejiang has maintained a good momentum in sustained, rapid, and 
sound economic development. According to initial statistics, 
Zhejiang's gross provincial product reached 164.5 billion yuan 
in 1993, an increase of 25 percent over 1992. We have adhered 
to the principle of attaching equal importance to both spiritual 
and material civilization construction. We have formulated a 
provincial program for carrying out spiritual civilization 
construction. We have actively explored ways to build our 
party. We have conducted new elections for local people's 
congresses at provincial, city (prefecture), county, and village 
(township) levels. We have strengthened the style of thinking 
and work among our leadership and the construction of 
grass-roots party units. We are carrying out the current task 
of the anticorruption struggle in accordance with the plan of 
the central authorities and have achieved some initial results. 
The construction of a socialist democratic legal system has 
been strengthened. We have done a great deal to improve all 
facets of public security and achieved marked results. Thanks 
to common efforts made by the broad masses of cadres and people, 
Zhejiang's political and social situation is stable. Our 
economy and people's livelihood have been improved. We have 
achieved new results in all undertakings. On behalf of the 
Provincial CPC Committee, the provincial people's congress 
standing committee, provincial government, and provincial 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I would like 
to extend my sincere thanks and highest respect to the broad 
masses of cadres, personages of all circles, and PLA personnel, 
armed police, and public security personnel who have worked hard 
on all fronts and made contributions to the drive of socialist 
modernization in our province. 
  Li Zemin said: The year 1994 is crucial for the reform drive 
and economic development. This is also a year for 
conscientiously carrying out the goal and various tasks put 
forward by the Ninth Provincial CPC Congress. Our overall 
requirements are as follows: We should continue to take Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the basic line of the party as our guidance, comprehensively 
carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress, 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
the Ninth Provincial CPC Congress. We should accelerate the 
establishment of a socialist market economy; maintain a good 
momentum for sustained, rapid, and sound economic development; 
maintain political stability; and promote overall social 
progress. In the new year, all our tasks must be subject to and 
serve the general goal of deepening reform, opening up wider to 
the outside world, promoting economic development, and 
maintaining stability. We should correctly handle the 
relationship between reform and economic development and 
stability. We should insist that development is the last word. 
We should promote economic development by depending on reforms 
and push forward reforms and economic development in an 
environment in which the economic, social, and political 
situations are stable. We should achieve long-term stability by 
conducting reforms and economic development. We should focus on 
economic development and switch our efforts to the track of 
genuinely enhancing economic performance. We should promote 
structural readjustment, technical progress, business 
management, and overall economic quality among our enterprises 
by conducting reform, reorganization, and transformation. 
Continued efforts should be made to give priority to increasing 
agricultural production and deepening rural reform so as to 
promote an overall economic development in rural areas. We 
should try every possible way to ensure the harvest of grain and 
other farm produce and to enhance peasants' incomes. 
We should actively and carefully push forward various reforms 
in accordance with the requirements of the central authorities, 
properly handle the relationship between all sectors, strengthen 
and improve macro- economic control, further change the 
management mechanisms of enterprises, explore effective ways to 
establish modern enterprise systems, attach great importance to 
cultivating and developing the market system, do a good job in 
promoting supplementary reform in social security, and ensure a 
fine order for economic operations. More efforts should be made 
to open wider to the outside world. We should try to increase 
the total amount and the quality level of export products. We 
should maintain a good momentum of expanding foreign trade and 
utilizing foreign funds. We should adhere to the principle of 
paying attention to spiritual and material civilization 
construction, conscientiously strengthen the building of the 
party, organize cadres and people to study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the decision of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
arm party members and the great masses of cadres and people 
across the province with the theory of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. In light of the guiding spirit of the 
provincial program for carrying out spiritual civilization 
construction and the 10th plenary session of the eighth 
provincial CPC committee, we should carry out spiritual 
civilization construction in a thoroughgoing manner, correctly 
handle various social contradictions, improve all facets of 
public security, strengthen the construction of socialist 
democracy and the legal system, unswervingly conduct the 
anticorruption struggle, further improve party work style, build 
a clean government, and extend every effort to maintain social 
and political stability. 
  Li Zemin emphatically said: To carry out this year's work 
well, we should work harder and persist in the party's 
ideological line, characterized by emancipating the mind and 
seeking truth from facts; in the party's basic work line of 
doing everything for the people; performing all tasks by relying 
on the people; and coming from the masses and going to the 
masses; and in the integration of the ideological line and the 
mass line of the party. In our practical work, we should listen 
to the opinions expressed by the people, try to understand their 
feelings, care about the problems of the people, truly solve the 
problems that have direct bearing on the interests of the 
people, show respect for the wishes of the people and their 
pioneering spirit, and properly guide and protect their 
initiative so as to give it full play. Only by closely relying 
on the people can we overcome all difficulties cropping up 
during the course of our progress and continuously push forward 
the undertakings of reform and national construction. [passage

"Struggle Hard To Attain Comparatively Well-Off Level in the 
Capital"] 
  [Text] Beijing, capital of the PRC, is not only the 
political and economic center of the whole nation and the heart 
of domestic and international exchange, but is also a 
comprehensive industrial city with a whole variety of 
departments. With the opening up, Beijing has called forth its 
new energy and vitality. Currently, the more than 10 million 
people of various nationalities in the city are struggling hard 
for all-round social and economic development in an effort to 
attain the well-off level in the capital three years ahead of 
schedule. 
  This past year of 1993 has witnessed tremendous achievements 
in all construction work in Beijing. Its national economy has 
developed in a sustained, rapid and healthy manner [chixu, 
kuaisu, jiankang di xiangqian fazhan 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 
1660 4104 0686 0467 4099 1455]. The yearly gross domestic 
output value reached 85.2 billion yuan, a 12 percent increase 
over the previous year. In agriculture, there was a good 
harvest for the sixteenth successive year. The growth rate in 
industrial output value came to 18.5 percent. The tertiary 
sector saw exceptionally rapid development, giving rise to an 
all-round flourish in commerce, tourism, finance, insurance, and 
real estate, as well as an upsurge of new undertakings, such as 
information and consulting services. An abundance of modern, 
high-level, commercial facilities rose straight from the ground 
in the city; the marketplace enjoyed brisk sales; and the total 
retail sales volume amounted to 5.49 billion yuan, a 27 percent 
increase. To meet the needs of a developing socialist market 
economy, large-scale trading centers for oil, tobacco, building 
materials, and industrial consumer goods have been set up and 
gone into operation one after another, resulting in an 
ever-greater increase in the volume of trade. The income and 
purchasing power of city residents also rose rapidly. An 
opening market has great potential,s indicative of bright 
prospects for development. Eye-catching changes have taken 
place in both urban and rural areas. Urban infrastructural 
construction has recorded marked progress, accomplishing a host 
of major projects in water, electricity, gas, heat supply, and 
roads and communications. In urban housing, 5.5 million square 
meters have been completed, initiating the "Well-Off Housing 
Project" aimed at improving the living conditions of city 
dwellers. Remarkable achievements also were made in tree 
planting and afforestation of the environment. Science, 
technology, and education registered all-round development. The 
comprehensive reform work in the first light industry and first 
commercical departments was carried out in an all-round way. 
State- owned large and medium-sized enterprises quickened their 
step in transforming management systems. The "Tianlong", 
"Tianqiao", "Renjie" and "Stone" bonds were floated in Shanghai, 
Shenzhen, and Hong Kong, respectively, making a new breakthrough 
in the trial introduction of the shareholding system. 
Explorations in marketplace construction, social security, 
transference of the right to use state-owned land, and the 
transformation of the management functions of government 
institutions were made, and positive results were achieved. The 
policy of opening up was implemented in unprecedented width and 
depth. So far the city has approved the establishment of 7,321 
foreign-funded enterprises, and the number of multinational 
companies and international consortia that have come to invest 
in Beijing has multiplied. Exchanges with foreign countries in 
economics, culture, and science and technology have been very 
active. Apart from the 14 large cities in the world with which 
Beijing has friendly relations, it established friendly 
relations with the capital cities of four more countries last 
year, and it has kept up friendly ties with nearly 100 cities in 
the world. Tourists coming from outside mainland China totalled 
2 million. 
  The year 1994 is a crucial one, when Beijing will strive to 
attain the comparatively well-off level three years ahead of 
schedule and will march toward higher objectives. It is also an 
important year for Beijing to speed up the socialist market 
economy reform. In light of the goals put forward by the 
party's 14th national congress, the municipal government has 
decided on its general guiding principle, which is to emancipate 
our minds, firmly grasp opportunities, make breakthroughs in key 
projects, and advance with greater strides in reform and 
construction in order to achieve the well-off level ahead of the 
schedule. The whole city will do its utmost -- with the 
accessible maximum standards in view -- further to promote 
reform and opening up and to push forward the cause of 
modernization construction. 
  First, we must carry out reform in revenue and expenditure, 
finance, investment, planning, and foreign trade, with the 
construction of a modern enterprise system and a macrocontrol 
system as the key; we must accelerate the establishment of the 
market system; and we must develop vigorously the production 
materials, finance, labor force, real estate, technology, and 
information markets, with the construction of the production 
materials market as the key link. We must continue to implement 
reform in the social security and housing systems; to further 
deepen reform in the countryside, with the raising of 
agricultural labor productivity as the goal, and with a modern 
agricultural enterprise system set up at the core; and to 
perfect reform in education and other areas. 
  Second, we must emphasize the utilization of foreign capital 
and further expand the opening up. We must accelerate the 
growth of foreign-invested enterprises, and attempts must be 
made to improve the investment environment and to broaden the 
areas for foreign investment. We must guide foreign investment 
toward the construction of infrastructural facilities, toward 
the transformation of old and run-down housing, and toward weak 
links in the city's national economy. We must actively promote 
trade and non-trade undertakings, and must cultivate overseas 
enterprises energetically. We must foster domestic and foreign 
markets by making better use of domestic and foreign resources, 
and must extensively encourage international exchange. 
  Third, we must stimulate economic growth so as to make new 
breakthroughs. The domestic gross industrial production value 
is expected to grow by 10 percent or more. We must further 
perfect the industrial structure. We must develop high-yield, 
high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, and must 
accelerate the construction of hilly regions. We must gather 
our forces to develop supporting and key industries, and to 
enhance the overall quality of manufacturing and the 
modernization level. Taking advantage of Beijing's strength, we 
must develop the tertiary sector in a big way so as to cater to 
the needs of the developing market economy and to build Beijing 
into a modern international metropolis. According to the 
revised General Planning of the Municipality of Beijing, to be 
implemented up to the year 2010, it is imperative to speed up 
the construction of infrastructural facilities with utmost 
efforts and determination. Billions of yuan of investment will 
be put into electricity, transport, water supply, fuel, posts 
and telecommunications, totaling more than 30 large-scale key 
projects. We must accelerate the transformation of the old part 
of the city, do a good job in the "Well-Off Housing Project" in 
order to improve city dwellers' living conditions as quickly as 
possible. We must make efforts to afforest the city and protect 
its environment; to place education, science, and technology in 
a strategic position; and manage to run well the city's New 
Technological Industrial Experimental Zone, the Beijing Economic 
and Technological Development Zone, and other smaller industrial 
zones in various districts and counties; and increase investment 
in education through diverse channels and train more qualified 
personnel for the 21st century. While quickening the pace of 
opening up and modernization construction, it is imperative to 
strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and socialist 
civic virtue, to try to maintain and develop the current 
excellent situation of stability and unity, and to make 
unremitting efforts to achieve the grand goal of the capital 
city's modernization construction. 
  We are convinced that with the concerted efforts of the 
entire population of the city, Beijing will march into the 21st 
century with a completely new face, and will join in the ranks 
of modernized, international metropolises.

<F P=106> [By Kong Qicai (1313 0366 2088): "Hebei Provincial Leaders </F>
Discussed Program for Making the Province Strong With CPPCC 
Members"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 28 February, the second session of 
the seventh provincial committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held the second 
meeting. At the meeting, CPPCC members talked freely and 
suggested ways and means for making the province strong. 
Provincial Leaders Cheng Weigao, Ye Liansong, Li Bingliang, and 
Guo Hongqi conscientiously heard the CPPCC members' opinions at 
the meeting. 
  Present at the meeting were Li Wenshan, chairman of the 
provincial party committee; Zhang Runshen, Wang Shusen, Huang 
Feng, Zhao Huichen, Ma Xinyun, Yu Zhenzhong, Chen Hui, and Zhao 
Yan, vice chairmen of the provincial CPPCC committee; Li Wenzao, 
secretary general of the provincial CPPCC committee; and Wang 
Jian, Yuan Qinghe, and Zhang Xu, principal responsible persons 
of the provincial democratic parties and mass organizations. 
  CPPCC members Yu Zhenzhong, Gao Daoshen, Tian Zhijie, Li 
Debao, Zhang Jiashu, Chen Hui, Zhang Mugang, Wei Hua, and Zhang 
Xu made speeches in succession. Their subjects were related to 
industrial and agricultural production, education, improvement 
of administrative honesty, and development of private and 
individual sectors of the economy. They affirmatively made 
opinions and suggestions on setting up the modern enterprise 
system, urgently cultivating modern entrepreneurs, further 
intensifying the dynamics of halting the deficits of 
money-losing industrial enterprises, processing of farm and 
sideline products, promoting "high-yield, high-efficiency, and 
good-quality" agriculture, not being an educationally weak 
province at the time of building an economically powerful 
province, strengthening the improvement of administrative 
honesty, and deeply and constantly waging the struggle against 
corruption. 
  Cheng Weigao maintained that the CPPCC members made good and 
accurate criticisms, analyses, and suggestions and also 
expressed his views on each and every member's speech. He 
agreed to the members' viewpoints and maintained that we still 
have to rely on outstanding entrepreneurs in order to develop 
good products and achieve technological transformation. With 
good entrepreneurs, enterprises will be able to make faster 
development and their staff and workers' living standards and 
benefits will be greatly improved. He pointed out: An 
entrepreneur who is not competent for his job at one plant must 
not be transferred to another. A plant director must not act as 
a secretary when he fails to act well as a plant director. From 
now on, in line with the regulations as stipulated in the law 
governing companies, companies should set up boards of directors 
and invite, through a selective process, plant directors and 
managers. Those who are responsible for enterprises' bankruptcy 
will lose the qualifications for being invited as enterprise 
leaders for several years. The situation of not awarding those 
with contributions to enlivening enterprises and assuming no 
responsibility for the poor management of enterprises must be 
changed. The departments concerned should positively cultivate 
entrepreneurs when entrepreneurs should upgrade their abilities 
and quality in the course of competition. 
  Cheng Weigao also said: The enterprises' complete and 
partial suspension of operation due to losses affects economic 
development and social stability. There are many factors for 
enterprise losses. Thus, the governments at various levels 
should go deep to the grass roots to conduct investigation and 
study among enterprises one after another to seek ways and make 
countermeasures. 
  In regard to a CPPCC member's opinions on developing high- 
efficiency agriculture, Cheng Weigao said: An important factor 
for increasing agriculture's economic results and peasants' 
income is to achieve intensive processing of farm and sideline 
products. The peasants cannot become fairly well-off if they 
only develop grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. By 
developing grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, they can only 
become sufficient in food and clothes. So, it is necessary to 
develop intense processing of forest fruits, melons, vegetables, 
livestock products, aquatic products, and farm and sideline 
products. The key to developing processing of farm and sideline 
products is to develop markets, to link international markets 
with domestic ones, and to take markets as a lead to promote the 
development of processing and cropping industries. 
  In line with a CPPCC member's opinion on accelerating 
technological transformation among large and medium-sized 
chemical industrial enterprises, Cheng Weigao said: Chemical 
industry, as a pillar industry and a key trade of our province, 
has brought our province's advantages into play and helped 
promote the readjustment of the province's industrial structure. 
However, chemical fertilizers account for a larger proportion 
in the province's chemical industrial trade when the chemical 
industrial raw materials and fine chemical industry account for 
an excessively small proportion. This is a problem. Our 
province has no large-scale petrochemical industrial enterprises 
but only a few salt chemical industrial enterprises. We have 
not yet made a start or a breakthrough in developing the coal 
chemical industry. The chemical industrial trade has to launch 
several big battles and firmly develop key capital construction 
and technological transformation projects. Chemical fertilizer 
enterprises should also develop "chemical-based fertilizers and 
combine fertilizers with chemicals." 
  Cheng Weigao paid attention to a CPPCC member's opinion on 
attaching importance to education in the course of building an 
economically powerful province, and also stressed the necessity 
to increase input in education and to conduct educational reform. 
  In regard to the issue of opposing corruption and advocating 
administrative honesty, Cheng Weigao said: Last year, we 
conscientiously attended to the work in this regard and made 
appropriate achievements. This year, we should make unswerving 
efforts to attend to it in a better and firmer manner. 
  In regard to the issue of opening to the outside world, 
Cheng 
Weigao stressed: Hebei should fully use the advantages of 
Beijing and Tianjin to develop the export-oriented economy. The 
key to developing the export-oriented economy is to create a 
good investment environment, particularly an intangible 
environment, for foreign traders. It is necessary to stress 
reputation and efficiency, to offer good service, and to upgrade 
the quality of the Chinese cooperation partners. 
  Cheng Weigao readily agreed to the suggestion on 
accelerating 
the development of private and individual sectors of the 
economy. He said: Government departments equally treat 
state-owned, collective, individual, and private enterprises 
according to the market economy's requirements. The CPPCC 
members have conscientiously played the functions for political 
consultation and democratic supervision and provided many 
affirmative opinions and suggestions for the party and the 
government. On behalf of the provincial party committee and 
government, I express heartfelt thanks to them. 
  Governor Ye Liansong conscientiously heard the CPPCC 
members' 
speeches, made written instructions on each and every member's 
opinions and suggestions, and transmitted the instructions to 
relevant departments and leaders for conscious study and 
implementation. 
  Ye Liansong's written instructions on CPPCC Member Gao 
Daoshen's opinion on halting the deficits of industrial 
enterprise read: From the beginning of the year, the 
provincial, city, prefectural, and county committees for foreign 
economic relations and trade (economic commissions) and the 
departments in charge of enterprise work should strengthen the 
dynamics of halting deficits and work out different 
deficit-halting measures for different enterprises. The 
provincial government may organize personnel of the committees 
for foreign economic relations and trade, industrial departments 
and bureaus, and industrial and economic federations; and sent 
them deep to Handan, Xingtai, and the cities, prefectures, and 
enterprises with prominent problems to conduct on-the-spot 
investigation and study and to solve the problems on the spot. 
  Ye Liansong's written instructions on CPPCC Member Zhang 
Mugang's opinions, made on behalf of the provincial Chinese 
peasants and workers democratic party, on strengthening the 
improvement of administrative honesty and deeply and constantly 
waging the struggle against corruption read: CPPCC member Zhang 
Mugang's speech is very good. We should unswervingly grasp the 
improvement of administrative honesty and the struggle against 
corruption. I will ask Comrade Youhui to transmit this to the 
supervisory department for conscientious study and realistic 
implementation. 
  Wang Manqiu, vice chairman of the provincial CPPCC 
committee, 
chaired today's meeting.

<F P=106> [By Han Shaojun (7281 4801 6511): "Cheng Weigao, secretary </F>
of the Hebei Provincial CPC Committee, Attends Spring Festival 
Forum of Specialists of Provincial-Level Propaganda and Cultural 
Departments Held on 4 February"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 4 February, the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government cosponsored a forum to 
welcome the arrival of the Spring Festival which was attended by 
specialists of the provincial-level propaganda and cultural 
departments. The provincial leaders sincerely talked with well- 
known specialists, scholars, and artists of the province's 
theoretical, press and publication, and artistic circles. They 
jointly bid farewell to the outgoing year and welcomed the 
arrival of the new year. Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, first extended earlier new year 
greetings to the participants. They also pointed out in his 
speech: The propaganda, ideological, and cultural fronts across 
the province should firmly grasp the fundamental guiding 
principle of the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, submit themselves to and serve the overall 
situation of building an economically powerful province, go deep 
to the reality and the grass roots, strive to cultivate a large 
number of specialists of various categories, and enliven the 
province's undertakings theory, press, publications, culture, 
and artistic undertakings. 
  The specialists, scholars, and artists talked freely at the 
forum. In line with their actual conditions, all departments 
reviewed the fruitful achievements in carrying out the 
propaganda and ideological work and building the spiritual 
civilization made over the past year. Simultaneously, they set 
forth many good opinions and suggestions on further achieving 
the work of the propaganda and cultural departments in the new 
year. 
  After hearing their opinions, Cheng Weigao set several 
demands and expectations on the specialists, scholars, and 
artists participating in the forum. 
  First, they should further strengthen the study of the 
theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
ceaselessly upgrade their ideological and political level. 
Comrades on the propaganda, ideological, and cultural fronts 
should pay particular attention to and conscientiously study the 
third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
and comprehensively and deeply understand the basic guidelines 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important statements. 
Simultaneously, they should study the speeches made by the 
central leading comrades at the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference, persistently arm their brains with 
the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
and upgrade their political and ideological level. Only then 
will their research and creative findings accurately embody the 
line, principles, and policies of the party, be more 
instructive, and be permeated with the significance of the 
times; and really ensure that the people are armed with 
scientific theories, guided with accurate media, portrayed with 
lofty spirits, and mobilized with outstanding works. 
  Second, they should carry out a good style of study 
characterized by linking theory with practice and further 
enhance the awareness of serving the economic construction, 
reform, opening up, and the socialist market economy. Relying 
on deepening reform is the key to achieving the propaganda, 
ideological, and cultural work. Comrades should attach 
importance to going deep to reality and positively dedicate 
themselves to the great practice in which the masses engage 
themselves in the development of socialist modernization in an 
effort to find a new situation, study new problems, sum up new 
experiences, and answer new questions. We should create 
excellent, healthy, solemn, elegant works which the broad masses 
of the people are fond of, that conform to the spirits of the 
times, and that are conducive to mobilizing the masses to engage 
in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization so as to 
enrich the people's cultural life, inspire their fighting will, 
mobilize their enthusiasm, and provide powerful spiritual 
motivation for building an economically powerful province. 
  Third, they should enthusiastically cultivate skilled 
persons 
and have increasingly more people become worthy and capable 
persons. In a sense, promoting and cultivating a large number 
of young skilled persons in a rapid manner and having them make 
achievements and contributions soon has more far-reaching 
significance than direct achievements of veteran comrades. We 
can believe that if we show more concern for and make more 
efforts to cultivate the younger generation, the propaganda and 
cultural workers contingents will have a well-balanced lineup, 
become more powerful, and have grand momentum. 
  Fourth, they should provide more constructive opinions and 
suggest ways and means to build an economically powerful 
province. The specialists, scholars, and artists present at the 
forum are our comrades as well as our friends. I hope that you 
will provide more opinions, criticisms, and suggestions on the 
work of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government, the propaganda and ideological work, and the 
spiritual civilization. So long as you provide more good 
opinions and think out more good methods we will be able to pool 
the wisdom of the masses, choose and follow what is good, make 
more democratic and scientific policy decisions, and ensure that 
predetermined progress is made. 
  Cheng Weigao also stressed: Party committees and governments 
at various levels should strengthen leadership over the 
propaganda, ideological, and cultural work. According to the 
guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference, we should conscientiously persist in the principle 
of "taking a two-handed approach and being sure that both hands 
are tough;" focus our efforts on achieving work in the 
theoretical, media, ideological and educational, and main melody 
spheres; provide more assistance; come up with more topics; set 
forth more demands; and comprehensively achieve the propaganda 
and ideological work. As for the specialists, scholars, and 
artists on the propaganda and cultural fronts, we should 
politically show more concern for them, provide them with more 
assistance in their work, and take more care of their livelihood 
so as to have them bring their functions into play in the course 
of building an economically powerful province. 
  Han Licheng, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and director of the propaganda department, 
chaired the forum. He urged that the all departments and 
bureaus under the provincial-level propaganda front to 
conscientiously study and implement the guidelines of the 
speeches made by Comrade Jiang Zemin and Comrade Li Peng at the 
national propaganda and ideological work conference as well as 
the guidelines of Comrade Cheng Weigao's speech made today, 
grasp strong items, create first-grade achievements, and elevate 
the province's propaganda and ideological work to a new height. 
Simultaneously, party committees at various levels and leaders 
of all departments should pay attention to caring for, 
respecting, cherishing, and treasuring the specialists on the 
propaganda front; make friends with experts; establish close 
contacts with them; show concern for their thinking, work, and 
livelihood; conscientiously listen to their opinions and 
suggestions; sincerely help them solve their working and living 
problems; and create a good, relaxed, and favorable environment 
for bringing their wisdom and intelligence into full play. 
  Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee; and Liu Zuotian, vice governor of the provincial 
government, attended the forum. 
  Present at the forum were some specialists, scholars, and 
artists, namely Lu Jie, Wang Genwang, Yan Jiang, He Huaming, 
Zhao Wenxin, Ye Zhen, Lou Huguang, Yin Jianyi, Tang Yuxi, Xu 
Ruigeng, Deng Yusui, Zhao Guide, Liu Xiyuan, Niu Suqin, Dong 
Tianen, Xu Guangyao, Tie Ning, Zhao Chong, Pan Peiming, Zhang 
Jun, Han Yu, Sun Demin, Luo Huilan, Zhang Huiyun, Qi Huatan, 
Zheng Shaozong, Liu Shoulin, Li Yanpeng, Li Zheng, Wang Shuying, 
Yang Xiaoli, Yan Lanshen, Sun Baocun, Wang Yongxiang, Niu 
Fengrui, Chen Yaobin, Zhang Yongquan, Zheng Xiting, Bai Yumin, 
Dong Shurong, and Yang Diantong.

  [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, inspected Jinnan District to check its preparations 
for spring farming and to conduct an investigation and study of 
rural work on 27 February. Gao Dezhan stressed: At present, 
leaders at all levels in Tianjin and the suburban counties, and 
relevant departments should find out problems in spring farming, 
formulate measures, go to the grass roots to render service and 
do practical things, and guarantee a steady increase in summer 
grain and the annual agricultural production. 
  Gao Dezhan and Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing 
committee of the municipal party committee and secretary 
general, made use of the time on Sunday to inspect Gangtian 
Motorcycle Company-- a village- run enterprise in Haihewan 
Village in Shuanggang Town--with simple means of transportation 
and few people in their company. They highly praised Gong 
Shiquan, chief manager of this company, for his outstanding 
achievements in successfully running a plant to make the village 
prosperous, and urged him not to forget agriculture while 
grasping industry, and made redoubled efforts to grasp the 
project related to grain and vegetable production. Gao Dezhan 
and other leaders also travelled to the families of Zhao Yonglin 
and his brother--two crops cultivation households in Shuanggang 
Village--to ask them about the cultivation situation, marketing, 
and income in cultivating vegetables under plastic sheets. 
After that, they visited an exclusively foreign-funded 
enterprise-- Bokelai Daily Necessary Company, Limited--and 
Nanyanxiang Jingjing Decorating Lamps Company, Limited. 
Braving the sudden cold spell in spring, Gao Dezhan also 
travelled to Datianli of Beizhongtang Village in Shuangya 
Township to inspect its preparations for plowing. He learned 
from the village cadres about the situation of plowing, 
irrigation, and the storage of seeds and chemical fertilizers, 
and asked in details about the income, living, and farming 
enthusiasm of peasants. 
  During a forum with district and township cadres, Gao Dezhan 
pointed out: This year we should act in line with the demand of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council on further 
strengthening agricultural and rural work, comprehensively 
develop the rural economy, and strive to increase the income of 
peasants. He put forward four specific demands: 1) Pay 
Attention to stabilizing and increasing the output of grain, 
cotton and oil- bearing crops, actively develop the nonstaple 
food project, actively readjust the agricultural structure, 
including the planting and breeding industries, and develop 
high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming. This 
year the increase in the total agricultural output value should 
be higher than that of last year and must not be lower than the 
national average level of increase. 2) Actively develop township 
enterprises, accelerate the development of tertiary industry and 
of individual and private enterprises, develop diversified 
undertakings, comprehensively invigorate the rural economy, and 
ensure that the increase in the total product of the rural 
society will not be lower than that of last year. 3) Further 
strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the rural 
areas, accelerate the building of well-off star villages, do a 
good job in comprehensive management of public security, and 
turn more townships and villages into civilized, prosperous, 
and stable new rural areas. 4) Try by all possible means to 
increase the income of peasants, raise their living standards, 
and through economic development, strive to increase the 
financial revenue of suburban counties, and strengthen the 
momentum for developing township enterprises. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: To implement all tasks in the rural 
areas, leading cadres at all levels should further enhance their 
ideology and understanding and fully recognize the foundation 
status of agriculture; firmly cultivate the idea that when the 
rural areas are stable, all sectors will be stable and when the 
rural areas are prosperous, Tianjin will also become prosperous. 
We should pay great attention to rural work and agricultural 
production, and promote comprehensive rural economic development 
and social progress. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: A year's plan will start in spring. At 
present, it is time for making plowing preparations. We must 
seize this opportunity and concentrate energy on making 
preparations for plowing. He said: At present, there are many 
difficulties lying ahead in agricultural production, the drought 
situation is serious, the prices of some agricultural means of 
production have been raised, and leading comrades of some 
localities have failed to pay full attention to agricultural 
production. Leaders at all levels must recognize the grim 
situation in agricultural production and pay great attention to 
it. March is a period of crucial importance for our 
municipality to make preparations for plowing. Districts and 
counties charged with agricultural production tasks must urge 
their cadres at all levels, from the party committee to the 
government, to take action to combat drought to protect the 
seedings of winter crops, to reap a bumper harvest of summer 
grains, to strive to achieve good harvests during the whole 
year, and to achieve highly efficient and good-quality 
production of nonstaple foods, such as cotton and oil-bearing 
crops. It is necessary to grasp all spring plowing tasks, 
including the preparations for seeds, chemical fertilizers, and 
agricultural chemicals, popularization of science and 
technology, and technical guidance. Meanwhile, we should conduct 
in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among 
peasants and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of 
peasants in spring plowing. All localities should assign the 
responsibility to all levels and make all levels and the 
peasant households to assume responsibility over each plot of 
land. Gao Dezhan stressed: Relevant departments in Tianjin and 
in suburban counties and leaders at all levels should further 
change work style, and should not be content with a general 
call. They should find out problems in spring plowing, 
formulate measures, go to the grass roots, render service, do 
practical things, and ensure that this year's agricultural 
production and rural economic development objectives will be 
fulfilled. 
  Gao Dezhan encouraged the masses of cadres in Jinnan 
District 
to fully use their own advantages and favorable conditions, 
advance in a pioneering spirit, and invigorate Jinnan.

  [Text] A few days ago, the municipal government held a 
municipal work conference on deepening industrial enterprise 
reform. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, 
made a speech at the conference. In his speech, he stressed the 
necessity to take reform as motivation and take efficiency as a 
key link, to deepen reform, to make comprehensive improvement, 
to change the managerial mechanisms of enterprises, to 
positively create conditions for enterprise reform, to 
conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for 
fulfillment of fixed targets, to carry out package reform, to 
make a breakthrough in key areas, to concentrate energy on 
enlivening and achieving industrial enterprises, to change the 
appearances of industrial enterprises as soon as possible, and 
to restore the prestige of Tianjin's industry. 
  Gao Dezhan made an important speech at the conference. In 
her speech, Li Huifen, vice mayor of the municipal government, 
set forth specific requirements for reforming the industrial 
enterprises. Responsible comrades of the municipal economic 
commission, made specific arrangements for deepening the 
industrial enterprises. At the conference, the leading cadres 
at or above the bureau level on the industrial front submitted 
to the municipal government letters of responsibility for 
fulfillment of fixed tasks. The machinery bureau and the 
Tianjin magnetic products company introduced their experiences 
at the conference. 
  Gao Dezhan said in his speech: Since the beginning of this 
year, the broad masses of cadres and the staff and workers of 
the industrial front have conscientiously implemented the 
guidelines of the second session of the sixth municipal party 
committee and the municipal economic work conference, rapidly 
taken action, firmly attended to their work, and solidly carried 
out their jobs. So, the situation in the first two months was 
very good. That various industrial bureaus and the municipal 
economic commission submitted letters of responsibility for 
fulfillment of fixed tasks to the municipal government today 
embodies the high sense of enterprise and the sense of high 
responsibility possessed by the leaders at various levels on the 
industrial front. This is a major measure for fulfilling the 
1994 tasks for deepening enterprise reform and promoting 
economic development. He hoped that the comrades on the 
industrial front should continue to make efforts, maintain and 
develop the current gratifying situation, make new improvements, 
big breakthroughs, and big headway in this year's industrial 
production. 
  Gao Dezhan set forth three opinions on industrial 
enterprises' reform and development. 
  First, we should deepen reform, make comprehensive 
improvement, and concentrate efforts to achieve and enliven 
industrial enterprises. Gao Dezhan said: Enterprises should be 
taken as a foundation in developing the economy. Enterprises 
are the foundation. Only when enterprises are vigorous will 
Tianjin become prosperous and vitalized. Tianjin has a good 
foundation and many favorable conditions for development. 
However, the municipality is also confronted with many 
difficulties and problems. We should rely on vitalized 
enterprises and enterprises' good economic results to solve 
these problems. The industrial department should adopt major 
measures to change the appearances of the enterprises having 
difficulties, accelerate the development of good enterprises, 
and enhance the strength of the municipality's industries. We 
should be determined and actively go into action to vitalize 
enterprises. The leaders at various levels should enhance the 
sense of urgency, the sense of crisis, and the sense of 
responsibility to enliven enterprises as soon as possible. To 
enliven enterprises, we should foster the idea of relying on 
reform to promote development, take reform as motivation, take 
efficiency as a central link, give different instructions to 
different enterprises, and make comprehensive improvement. 
  We should do a good job in using foreign capital, 
readjusting structures, intensifying management, developing 
products, and conducting technological transformation, and 
building leading bodies. By deepening reform, changing 
mechanisms, and increasing economic results, we should ensure 
that more is handed over to finance, that enterprises obtain 
more, and that staff and workers gain more. We should focus the 
deepening of enterprise reform on changing the enterprise 
managerial mechanism; continue to implement "the enterprise law" 
and "regulations" well; no longer limit small accounting units 
within enterprises; deepen the reform of the labor personnel, 
wage, and distribution systems; streamline organizations; and 
reform and perfect the organizational managerial system. In 
addition to enhancing internal functions, enterprises should 
also positively create good external conditions. It is necessary 
to vigorously advocate the practice of doing solid deeds for 
enterprises. The departments in charge of the overall work, the 
departments in charge, and administrative and law enforcement 
departments should support enterprises and turn on green lights 
for enterprises' reform and development. We should go deep to 
the grass roots to actively serve enterprises, try every 
possible means to help enterprises solve their problems, and 
adopt realistic measures to continuously reduce enterprises' 
burden. 
  Second, we should conscientiously implement the system of 
responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks and ceaselessly 
upgrade the leadership level. Gao Dezhan said: Carrying out 
this system is a specific indicator for doing solid work and 
firmly fulfilling tasks as well as an important guarantee for 
promoting work and fulfilling tasks. So, at the time of 
defining targets and implementing tasks, we should be sure to be 
realistic, rigid, and perfect. That is, tasks should be 
assigned to individuals; targets should be advanced and fixed 
persistently according to high standards, high starting points, 
and the general requirements of the municipality; and the 
contents of the tasks should be complete and reach general 
levels. On the basis of grasping the work of his own 
department, each and every leading cadre at or above the bureau 
level on the industrial front should take charge of the work of 
two good enterprises and two money-losing enterprises, use the 
experiences of the good to promote overall work, and strive to 
make key breakthroughs. We should persist in the system of 
responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks and regularly 
examine the implementation of the system. It is necessary to 
examine and assess every season to make a general assessment at 
the end of the year. The assessment should be linked with the 
assessment of cadres' political achievements. 
  Third, we should comprehensively implement the "222 
project," 
change as soon as possible the appearances of the industries, 
and restore the prestige of Tianjin's industries. Gao Dezhan 
said: The second plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee set forth the necessity to implement the "222 
project." That is, grasp two large key enterprises, namely the 
general vehicle industrial corporation and the steel tube 
company; grasp 20 municipal-level key enterprises; and grasp 200 
key enterprises at the bureau, district, and county level. 
These enterprises are key enterprises of Tianjin as well as 
pillar industries. They must attain advanced international and 
domestic levels, become enterprises with large amounts of 
profits and taxes, and play a decisive role in the 
municipality's economic development. Upon the successful 
accomplishment of this project, these enterprises will become a 
model of reform and management and make greater contributions to 
developing the economy in a better and faster manner. All 
fronts should pay high attention to this project, make concerted 
efforts to grasp it, perfect plans, implement measures, give 
preferential treatment to key enterprises, and carry out the 
project in a ladder- like manner. We should concentrate energy 
on grasping the work of key enterprises to promote the work of 
the ordinary ones, ensure that good enterprises improve and 
groups of good enterprises emerge, also carry out the principle 
of selecting the best and eliminating the bad, gradually balance 
the paths, embark as soon as possible on the orbit of taking a 
favorable turn in Tianjin's industries, and realize the grand 
target of restoring the prestige of Tianjin's industries.

  [Text] The municipal party committee held a propaganda and 
ideological work conference and an organizational work 
conference on 26 February to conscientiously implement the 
guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference and the national forum of directors of organization 
departments and, based on Tianjin's reality, to study and 
arrange Tianjin's propaganda and ideological work and 
organizational work. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal 
party committee, gave an important speech at the opening 
ceremony of these two conferences. He emphasized: Leaders at 
all levels and comrades on the propaganda work front and 
organizational work front in Tianjin should have a clearer 
understanding of the overall interest of the work of the entire 
party, subordinate to and serve this overall interest, raise 
spirit, work in a down-to-earth manner, open up a new situation 
in propaganda and ideological work and in organizational work, 
and provide an effective ideological guarantee and 
organizational guarantee for Tianjin's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. 
  Gao Dezhan's speech consisted of three parts: 1) The issue 
on clearly understanding the overall interest of the work of the 
entire party and thoroughly implementing the guidelines of the 
second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee, 2) The issue on conscientiously implementing the 
guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference and strengthening and improving propaganda and 
ideological work, and 3) The issue on conscientiously 
implementing the guidelines of the national forum of directors 
of organization departments and further strengthening 
organizational work. 
  Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee, presided over the conferences. 
  The major guidelines of the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference and the national forum of directors 
of organization departments were relayed. 
  Attending were municipal leading comrades Li Shenglin, Yang 
Zhihua, Fang Fengyou, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng 
Zhiying, Wang Hongjiang, and Zhang Guanwen. 
  Gao Dezhan said in his speech: At the national propaganda 
and ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin gave 
profound expositions on the basic principles for the work of the 
entire party for this year and the overall interest of the work. 
We must earnestly study and profoundly understand them and make 
propaganda and ideological work, organizational work, and the 
work in various fields of the party subordinate to and serve the 
endeavor of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open 
wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain 
stability," which meets the overall interest. The guidelines of 
the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee are totally in conformity to the principles for the 
work of the entire party and the overall interest of the work as 
defined by the party Central Committee. We should 
conscientiously implement the arrangements of the party Central 
Committee and, focusing on the overall interest of the work of 
the entire party, implement more thoroughly the guidelines of 
the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee and comprehensively fulfill all the targets and tasks 
as put forward in the major points of the municipal party 
committee's 1994 work. 
  Gao Dezhan said: Since the second enlarged plenary session 
of the sixth municipal party committee, all departments, 
committees, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus have 
conscientiously relayed and implemented the guidelines of the 
session, stepped up efforts to start up work, and carried out in 
a down-to-earth manner. They had a fairly good beginning and a 
very good development trend. However, this was only a beginning, 
and the development in different localities and departments was 
also uneven. Thus the tasks remain very arduous to fulfill the 
work targets put forward by the municipal party committee. To 
make this year's work successful, we should continue to pay 
attention to the following key areas from ideological 
understanding to specific practice and continue to raise our 
leadership level and work level. First, we should firmly 
embrace the awareness of opportunity and the awareness of 
development and further enhance the sense of urgency and 
responsibility. Second, we should fully understand that reform 
and opening up are the motivation and the basic way of 
development and firmly embrace the idea of relying on reform to 
promote development. 
  Third, we should persistently take economic construction as 
the central task, muster efforts to promote the economy, and 
maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
We should attach importance not only to the increase in the 
total supply and total demand, but we should also attach 
importance to the improvement of the quality of economic 
development. In developing the economy, we should have new 
ideas and should devote great efforts to and achieve major 
breakthroughs in adjusting the structure, strengthening 
management, achieving technological advance, ending deficits and 
increasing profits, raising efficiency, and improving the 
quality of staff members and workers. Fourth, we should have a 
good command of the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability. Fifth, we should persistently take the "three 
advantages" as the basic criterion for judging all work, strive 
to develop social productive forces, enhance the economic 
strength, and upgrade people's living standard. We should keep 
the interests of the masses in mind, do everything for them, 
rely on them in doing work, and exert utmost efforts to seek 
benefits and do practical work for them. Sixth, we should 
persistently "attend to two tasks and be competent in both." 
Economic construction should be promoted to a new height, and so 
should the spiritual civilization. We should strengthen 
propaganda and ideological work; strengthen democracy and the 
legal system; step up efforts to comprehensively improve public 
security; actively develop all social undertakings; promote 
overall social progress; and make sure that economic and social 
undertakings develop in a coordinated manner. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The general demand on Tianjin's propaganda 
and ideological work for this year is to conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the important speeches delivered by 
Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades at the national 
propaganda and ideological work conference, take Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the basic guide, arm the people with 
scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion, 
mold them with noble spirit, encourage them with outstanding 
works, provide an effective ideological guarantee and a good 
media environment for accelerating the establishment of the 
socialist market economy system, facilitating sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development, safeguarding social stability, 
and promoting overall social progress, and mobilize, unite, and 
encourage party members and the masses more successfully to 
advance Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. 
Gao Dezhan said: In the great cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, propaganda and ideological work 
shoulders great missions and has a direct bearing on the overall 
situation of the modernization drive. Leading cadres at all 
levels should enhance ideological understanding and have more 
initiative and stronger sense of responsibility in making 
propaganda and ideological work successful. In the new 
situation, this work merits more attention and should never be 
neglected; and it should only be greatly strengthened and 
improved and never be weakened or become stagnant. 
  Gao Dezhan emphasized: In compliance with the requirements 
put forward in Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech, the 
propaganda and ideological front should persistently take 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as the basic guide and strive to achieve 
success in the four aspects of work. First, it should 
thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and use this 
theory to arm the minds of the vast number of party members, 
cadres, and the masses. This is the most important task for the 
propaganda and ideological front. The propaganda and 
ideological front should continue to intensify the study of 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
exert more efforts to read it in the origin, master its essence, 
integrate theory with practice, and unify thinking to guide 
work. It should further intensify theoretical propaganda and 
theoretical study. Second, it should persist in the correct 
media guidance and do a better job in the propaganda by the 
media. In carrying out propaganda and media work, it should 
adhere to the party's basic line, unswervingly maintain 
political unity with the party Central Committee, uphold the 
principle of unity, stability, encouragement, and propaganda 
through positive examples, and make sure that the political 
orientation is firm and correct, the propaganda style is healthy 
and progressive, sensitive issues are properly handled, and a 
good media environment is created for reform, development and 
stability. 
  Third, it should intensify ideological and moral education 
and carry out the activities to build the spiritual civilization 
in a down-to-earth manner. Fourth, it should greatly advocate 
the main melody, make culture and art flourish, and strive to 
provide more and better nourishment for the minds of the masses. 
He pointed out: Party committees at all levels should attach 
great importance to propaganda and ideological work, 
conscientiously hold the responsibility for it, truly place it 
high on their agenda, and comprehensively strengthen leadership 
over it. They should enforce strict system of responsibility 
for work targets, make earnest efforts to attain them, and pay 
close attention to and make conscientious efforts in all the 
work of the propaganda and ideological front. 
  Speaking on further strengthening organizational work, Gao 
Dezhan said: The tasks of the organizational work for this year 
are very heavy. The general demand is to take Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide and, 
proceeding from the overall interest of the work of the entire 
party, strive to meet the needs of the new situation, achieve 
success in party building, step up efforts to improve leading 
bodies at all levels, strengthen and improve grass- roots party 
organizations and the education and management of party members, 
and provide an organizational guarantee for deepening reform, 
opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, 
maintaining stability, and facilitating overall social progress. 
This year, we should take party building as key work, persist in 
the practice of making the party take charge of party affairs, 
and run the party strictly. Party organizations at all levels 
should concentrate effort on party building and devote more 
efforts to it. They should focus on the economy to promote party 
building, promote the economy by making party building 
successful, and achieve notable results in improving ideology, 
organization, and work styles. In strengthening party building, 
we should particularly achieve success in improving leading 
bodies at all levels; win greater results in improving their 
ideology and work styles; make a great step forward in the 
system whereby cadres can be promoted and demoted as required 
and in the exchange of cadres, the training and promotion of 
outstanding young cadres, and the education, theoretical study, 
and vocational training of cadres; and open up a new situation 
in the organizational work. In his speech, Gao Dezhan put 
forward clear demands on the endeavors to improve the ideology, 
work styles, and organization of leading bodies at all levels, 
greatly train and promote outstanding young cadres, and make the 
party's grass-roots organizations still better. 
  In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: Propaganda and ideological 
work and organizational work are important work concerning the 
overall situation, and they play a very important role in the 
party's attainment of all tasks. The propaganda and ideological 
front and the organizational work front bear heavy 
responsibilities, and the municipal party committee places great 
expectations on them. It is hoped that party committees at all 
levels will conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 
national propaganda and ideological work conference and the 
national forum of directors of organization departments and, in 
line with the arrangements of the second enlarged plenary 
session of the sixth municipal party committee, adopt effective 
measures to make propaganda and ideological work and 
organizational work still more successful, create a new 
situation, and make still greater contributions. 
  Attending the conferences were major party and government 
responsible comrades, comrades in charge of propaganda and 
ideological work and organizational work, directors of 
propaganda and organization departments, and responsible 
comrades of all the units of propaganda departments, totaling 
more than 1,200 persons.

  [Excerpts] The democratic appraisal of the official 
performances of party and government leading bodies and leading 
cadres of various departments, commissions, offices, districts, 
counties, and bureaus in the municipality successfully concluded 
in early January this year. During the appraisal, 158 party and 
government leading bodies and 829 leading cadres of various 
departments, commissions, offices, districts, counties, and 
bureaus reported their work to the masses and were subject 
themselves to appraisal and evaluation by the masses. At the 
same time, through rectification and correction, these bodies 
and cadres earnestly resolved their conspicuous problems with 
regard to their style of thinking and style of work. The smooth 
progress of this appraisal has encouraged and educated cadres, 
improved the quality and leadership art of cadres, effectively 
reinforced leading bodies, and provided an important 
organizational guarantee for better upholding the party's basic 
line and accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and 
economic development. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal 
party committee, demanded that great efforts should be made to 
summarize the experiences gained from the 1993 democratic 
appraisal and evaluation, and this work should be upheld in a 
systematic manner and be deepened continuously in order to yield 
even greater results in improving the style of thinking and the 
style of work of leading bodies at all levels. 
  Democratic appraisal of the official performances of party 
and government leading bodies and leading cadres of various 
departments, commissions, offices, districts, counties, and 
bureaus is an important measure of the municipal party committee 
to further strengthening leading bodies at all levels. Under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, in line with the 
guidelines of the national organizational work forum, this 
appraisal work attained all of the six demands set by the 
municipal party committee on strengthening leading bodies' style 
of thinking and style of work. In accordance with the 
respective work nature of various departments, commissions, 
offices, districts, counties, and bureaus and with the 
respective personal duties and functions of leading cadres, 
focusing on appraising cadres' actual performances in executing 
the party's basic line, and with the view to comprehensively and 
correctly evaluating the moral integrity, ability, and practical 
performances of cadres, this appraisal included eight contents: 
1) whether leading bodies and cadres conscientiously studied 
and understood Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, persisted in the 
principle of integrating theory with practice, applied Marxist 
stand, viewpoints, and methods to study new circumstances and 
resolve new problems, and firmly and unswervingly implemented 
the party's basic line; 2) whether leading bodies and cadres 
strictly observed party discipline, understood and gave 
consideration to the overall situation, and maintained a high 
degree of unanimity with the CPC Central Committee in ideology 
and politics and in organization and action to ensure the smooth 
implementation of the policies and decrees of the party and the 
state; 3) whether leading bodies and cadres had the spirit of 
reform to make innovations, unified the emancipation of the mind 
with the endeavor to seek truth from facts, and worked hard, 
forged ahead, and bravely blazed new trials in the course of 
deepening reform and expanding the scale of opening up; 4) 
whether leading bodies and cadres fulfilled or overfulfilled the 
tasks, targets, and demands assigned by the municipal party 
committee and the municipal government, scored achievements in 
developing economic and social undertakings and in building the 
socialist spiritual civilization, and made new progress in work 
in comparison with the past; 5) whether leading bodies and 
cadres had a good mental state and a high degree of dedication 
and the sense of responsibility, worked conscientiously, 
fulfilled their duties, quietly immersed themselves in hard 
work, were diligent in performing official duties, tried to 
determine the real situation, told the truth, thought of 
practical methods, attended to concrete work, and strived for 
practical results; 6) whether leading bodies and cadres 
persisted in the purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, 
maintained close ties with the masses, and tried their best to 
do tangible and good deeds for the masses; 7) whether leading 
bodies and cadres conscientiously executed the democratic 
centralism, combined collective leadership with division of 
individual responsibility, consciously safeguarded the unity of 
leading bodies, supported each other, and cooperated with each 
other to form a joint strength; and 8) whether leading bodies 
and cadres observed the central authorities' regulations and 
demands of maintaining administrative honesty, were honest and 
strict with themselves, set an example in resisting and opposing 
negative and corrupt phenomena, such as the abuse of one's power 
to seek personal gain, the trading between power and money, 
extravagance and waste, squandering, bribery, and moral 
degeneration. During the appraisal, various leading bodies and 
cadres conscientiously summarized the eight contents mentioned 
above, and the persons participating in the appraisal conducted 
appraisal item by item and made comprehensive appraisal of 
leading bodies and leading cadres. 
  [Excerpts] The municipal party committee attached high 
important on this work. In the process of doing research for 
this work, Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, and Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the municipal 
party committee and mayor of the municipality, both set a very 
high demand on this work. Comrade Gao Dezhan also personally 
convened a meeting to make arrangements for this work and went 
deep to the units that were under appraisal to participate in 
the appraisal meetings in order to give specific guidance to the 
work. [passage omitted] 
  Thanks to the current appraisal and examination, leading 
cadres' consciousness in studying theories has been enhanced, 
their study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics has been deepened, their 
dedication and sense of responsibility has been strengthened, 
their sense of being diligent and honest in performing official 
duties has been enhanced, the problems concerning the style of 
thinking and the style of work of leading bodies and leading 
cadres, that need to be resolved conscientiously, have been 
defined, and experiences have been gained for resolving 
problems, thus providing conditions for building leading bodies 
at all levels in the municipality. At the same time, the 
feeling of the vast numbers of the masses has been stabilized 
and the initiative of various fields has been mobilized, thus 
laying a foundation for doing the 1994 work from a high starting 
point. 
  In combination with the current appraisal, all units have 
meted out their rectification and correction measures in a 
timely manner with the determination of building themselves well 
and guiding the masses to implement the guidelines of the third 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the second 
(enlarged) plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee in order to push all the work onto a new height. Many 
units have given rise to a vivid situation in which everybody is 
duty-bound to accelerate reform, opening up, and economic 
development.

  [Text] With comprehensively implementing the guidelines of 
the National People's Congress [NPC] session and the national 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] session, and a series of important 
conferences recently held by the state as the main topics, the 
fourth provincial government plenary meeting was held at the 
microwave television conference room of the provincial radio and 
television department this morning. Governor Shao Qihui gave a 
speech, in which he stressed: Leaders at all levels should 
realistically change their work style and turn their ideology 
and work to implementing all tasks. 
  This provincial government plenary meeting was an important 
meeting held by the provincial government after the convocation 
of the second session of the eighth provincial people's 
congress. Governor Shao Qihui first relayed the guidelines of 
the NPC and CPPCC sessions, the national rural work conference, 
the national family planning work conference, the State Council 
conference on maintaining social stability, and the State 
Council conference on anticorruption work, and relayed the 
important directives which leaders of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council had given for our work, and 
devised specific measures for grasping this year's work. 
  On agricultural work, Governor Shao said: At present, spring 
plowing is now in full swing and wheat sowing is being 
successively carried out from the south to the north. All 
localities should seize the opportune moment to carry out spring 
plowing, rationalize the farming structure, implement the grain 
farming plan, and guarantee the farming acreage of beet, flax, 
and flue-cured tobacco. It is necessary to extensively raise 
production funds, and make tapping potential as the point of 
departure. Agricultural loans should be granted in a timely 
manner and payments for the purchase of beet, flax, and 
flue-cured tobacco should be given to peasants rapidly. 
Relevant departments should formulate plans for implementing 
reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system and 
establishing the risk-taking fund for grain in the province in 
line with the central policies. Governments at all levels 
should do a good job in publicizing and explaining this system, 
and strive to implement the grain tasks in the grass roots and 
among peasant households at the earliest possible date. 
  In referring to social stability work, Governor Shao Qihui 
said: At present, our province's social stability work is very 
heavy. We must never neglect it. We should regard stabilizing 
the enterprise contingents as the priority of social stability 
work, realistically guarantee the basic living of the masses of 
workers, and solve the problems on delaying the wages of workers 
and pension for retired workers. Meanwhile, we should actively 
organize workers to provide for and help themselves by engaging 
in production, make proper arrangements for settling workers 
from enterprises which have declared bankruptcy or be merged 
with other enterprises, further attend to helping enterprises 
end deficits and increase profits, and fundamentally solve the 
problem concerning the unstable ranks of workers. Governments 
at all levels should strengthen leadership over the work of 
handling people's letters and visits, form a system of 
rotationally working in the office for handling letters and 
visits, and directly listen to workers' voice and opinions. 
  Governor Shao stressed: To carry out this work, we make pay 
attention to the priorities. This year and for some time to 
come, we should regard the industry of precision and intensive 
processing of farm and side-line products as a new economic 
growing point, designate it as an important task of the 
provincial government and governments at all levels, and strive 
to yield good results this year. Successfully controlling 
commodity prices is also one of the work priorities of the 
provincial government. During the past two months, prices rose 
quite rapidly in our province. We must conscientiously conduct 
a province-wide price inspection, persist in controlling the 
prices of commodities that are essential to people's living, pay 
great attention to the vegetable basket work, and realistically 
implement the system of mayor assuming responsibility. 
  Governor Shao also said: To grasp this work, we must change 
work style. After listing 10 unhealthy trends of leading 
cadres, he said: The provincial government has called on 
government functionaries at all levels, particularly the leading 
cadres, to strengthen study, strive to know the market economic 
theory well, and solve problems personally. 
  Governor Shao stressed at the end of his speech: It is 
necessary to deeply, enduringly, and more effectively conduct 
anticorruption struggle and continue to place the emphasis of 
anticorruption work on grasping three tasks. Leading cadres 
should continue to implement the five stipulations on keeping 
oneself clean and self-disciplined. This year, we should attach 
importance to investigating and handling cases on corruption, 
bribery, abusing power to seek personal gain, and violations of 
law and discipline involving leading cadres. 
  Vice Governor Cong Fukui chaired today's meeting. Sun 
Kuiwen, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, Wang Zhongzhang, and Ma 
Shujie, and other provincial government leaders, and responsible 
persons of various provincial-level organs attended the meeting. 
Leaders of various prefectures and cities watched the live 
broadcast at their own locality.

  [Text] The third plenary session of the discipline 
inspection commission of the Heilongjiang Provincial CPC 
Committee was held in Harbin on 24 March. 
  The main tasks of this session were to relay the guidelines 
of the third plenary session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission and the standing committee meeting of the 
provincial party committee, to sum up and review the 
anticorruption work done in the previous stage, to study and 
arrange the 1994 anticorruption tasks, and to study ways for 
carrying out the anticorruption work in a sustained, profound, 
and effective manner. 
  The session first relayed the guidelines of the third 
plenary 
session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the 
standing committee meeting of the provincial party committee. 
On behalf of the standing committee of the provincial 
discipline inspection commission, Li Qinglin, standing committee 
member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the 
provincial discipline inspection commission, delivered the 
report work. 
  In his report, Li Qinglin basically reviewed the province's 
anticorruption work done in 1993. He said: After the party 
Central Committee arranged the short-term anticorruption 
struggle last August, the party committees, governments, and 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels 
across the province adopted a resolute attitude toward the 
struggle against corruption, actively went into action, and made 
achievements in fulfilling the three tasks for opposing 
corruption. Some of the achievements were comparatively 
noticeable. The main indicators were as follows: Through 
self-investigations, the leading cadres corrected some existing 
problems. More than 24,000 cadres at or above the county and 
section level or 98.4 percent of the total cadres conducted 
self-investigation and self-correction in comparison with 13 
prohibitions. As a result, more than 7,000 problems in 10 
aspects were investigated, and more than 2,200 problems were 
corrected. A number of unlawful and undisciplined cases were 
investigated and handled. Last year, the discipline inspection 
and supervisory organs put 6,438 cases on file and investigated 
and concluded 6,343 cases or 98.5 percent. Of this, 13 cadres 
at the prefectural and department level and 305 county and 
section level were involved in these cases. Noticeable 
achievements were made in straightening out and correcting 
unhealthy trends. The province canceled more than 15,000 
capital collection items and 40 abnormal touring parties that 
planned to go abroad, thus reducing more than 5 million yuan of 
expenses. Simultaneously, we also made better achievements in 
straightening out and correcting activities that party and 
government organs engaged in business and ran enterprises and 
the unhealthy trends within regions and trades. 
  In regard to the 1994 anticorruption struggle tasks, Li 
Qinglin pointed out: In the first half of this year, we should 
grasp three tasks. First, by the end of May, the leading bodies 
at or above the county and section level should hold democratic 
activities with the main content of administrative honesty and 
self-discipline and make self-investigation and self-correction 
in comparison with the five new rules; and in June, they should 
report on and assess their democratic activities. Second, we 
should continue to solve the problems of wantonly collecting 
charges, going out of the country and the border to make trips 
with public funds, and party and government organs running 
enterprises and basically eliminate these problems by the end of 
June. Third, we should thoroughly investigate and know the real 
situation of leading cadres' sedan cars and private houses and 
party and government organs and their working personnel using 
enterprises' capital and being behind in repaying the money to 
enterprises. We should work out plans and relevant policies to 
eliminate the problems. In the latter half of the year, we 
should also grasp three tasks. We should make up the missed 
lessons for the leading bodies' democratic activities and assess 
the administrative honesty of key leading bodies. We should 
clear up leading cadres' sedan cars and private houses and the 
problems that leading cadres use enterprises' money and are 
behind in repaying money to enterprises and strive to make 
achievements by the end of this year. The key departments 
should set up, on a trial basis, the administrative honesty 
system. This year, we should attend to investigating and 
handling unlawful and undisciplined cases. 
  Li Qinglin said: The 1994 anticorruption tasks are extremely 
arduous. We must further implement the responsibility system, 
strengthen the leadership over the struggle against corruption, 
expand the dynamics of the anticorruption work, exert efforts to 
deeply and effectively wage the struggle, strive to thoroughly 
eliminate corruption, pay attention to eliminating both root 
causes and symptoms of corruption, strengthen the media 
propaganda on the anticorruption work, and ensure a sustained, 
deep, and effective progress of the anticorruption struggle.

  [Text] The third plenary session of the discipline

  [Text] During an interview by this station's reporter in 
Beijing yesterday afternoon, Governor Shao Qihui spoke on his 
analysis of the basic principles for Heilongjiang's work. He 
said: For a long time, we have failed to conscientiously handle 
the relationship between reform, development, and stability as 
reiterated in the government work report. We have always 
attached more importance to the total amount of fixed assets and 
shown more interest in developing new projects and increasing 
investment. However, we have not given sufficient attention to 
the available fixed assets and the equipment replacement and 
renovation of old enterprises. As a result, the economy has 
grown rapidly on the one hand, but, on the other, old 
enterprises have experienced difficulties in every step they 
take. Likewise, Heilongjiang has reaped bumper grain harvests 
every year, but peasants' income and local revenue have not 
increased rapidly as grain output has. 
  Governor Shao Qihui analyzed the reasons for such contrast. 
He said: It has resulted both from the problems in our work 
and the oversights and omissions in policies. The basic problem 
lies in our failure in handling well the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability. He continued: To better 
implement major state policies in our specific economic 
activities, we, as the local government, should measure our 
specific work against the government work report and find out 
where we lag behind. We should note both the increase in the 
growth rate of economic development and the increase in the 
number of loss-making large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises; and both the substantial improvement in living 
standard with some people becoming well-off ahead of others and 
the great difficulties in the life of some localities and some 
staff members and workers. To successfully address these 
problems, we should refrain from empty sloganeering. 
  Speaking on Heilongjiang's agricultural economy, Governor 
Shao Qihui said: We should not regard the peasant economy as 
the agricultural economy. While attaching importance to the 
interests of peasants, we should also step up efforts to build 
up local and township and village finance; and while speeding up 
the increase in grain output, we should also accelerate the 
development of the nonagricultural economy so that Heilongjiang 
Province will become a large province in agricultural economy at 
an early date instead of a large province in agriculture.

<F P=106> [China Daily News: "Officials Punished For Explosion at </F>
Coal Mine"] 
  [Text] Five mine officials have been sacked from their 
posts for their responsibility in a January 24 gas explosion at 
a coal mine in Jixi, Heilongjiang Province. 
  China Labour News reported over the weekend that they will 
face trial. Seven other technicians and officials concerned 
have also been dismissed from their official posts. 
  The explosion killed dozens of coal miners and caused 
damages 
of 4.5 million yuan ($517,000). The main factors in the 
mishap-which caused the northeastern provinces biggest death 
toll from mining since 1949--were poor management and violations 
of the Safety Law in Mines and other rules on safety in mines. 
  Labour officials blamed the frequent accidents in this 
industry on the mishandling or shielding of those at fault.

  [Text] The provincial party committee and government held 
a ceremonious commendation rally at the auditorium of the 
provincial party committee office this morning to commend and 
award leading cadres and party and government leading bodies of 
the province's administration who were outstanding in their 
performance of official duties in 1993. Present at today's 
rally were leading comrades of the provincial party committee, 
people's congress, government, and committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, including He 
Zhukang, Gao Yan, Liu Yunzhao, Zhang Dejiang, Wang Jinshan, 
Zhang Yueqi, Zhou Zaikang, Wang Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, 
Quan Zhezhu, Wei Minxue, Sang Fengwen, and Liu Xilin; principal 
responsible persons of city and autonomous prefectural party and 
government leading bodies; all the members of the leading bodies 
of the various departments of provincial organs; principal 
responsible persons of the central units and departments 
stationed in Jilin; and some section-level cadres of provincial 
organs. 
  Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the rally. Gao Yan, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee and governor of Jilin, first 
appraised the performance of official duties by party and 
government leading bodies and leading cadres under the 
administration of the province. On behalf of the provincial 
party committee and government, he also read a decision on 
commending leading bodies and leading cadres who achieved 
outstanding performance of official duties in 1993. He said: 
To comprehensively implement the party's cadre line, improve 
leading bodies at all levels, and encourage a vast number of 
cadres to raise spirits, work in a down-to-earth manner, and 
make contributions to building a developed border province near 
the sea, the organization department of the provincial party 
committee began overall, thorough, and meticulous appraisals of 
the 1993 work in late November 1993. Including work of the 
party and government leading bodies of the eight cities and one 
autonomous prefecture in the province, the leading bodies of the 
88 provincial departments and bureaus and the offices stationed 
outside the province, and 469 leading cadres, appraisals were 
conducted in line with the opinions of the official duty 
performance of the leading bodies and members of the cities, the 
autonomous prefecture, and departments of provincial organs, 
which were discussed and approved by the standing committee of 
the provincial party committee last year. Judging from the 
appraisals, the overwhelming majority of the party and 
government leading bodies for cities, autonomous prefectures of 
the province, and departments of provincial organs were able to 
emancipate the mind, vigorously make progress, seek truth from 
facts, and work in a creative manner in line with the 
requirements put forward at the 14th party congress and the 
sixth provincial party congress; and fulfilled their annual work 
tasks and targets fairly successfully, thus making positive 
contributions to Jilin's development of the economy and other 
various undertakings. The provincial party committee and 
government decided to commend and award party and government 
leading bodies and leading cadres who distinguished themselves 
in the performance of their official duties in building the 
province's two civilizations. 
  First, the 17 leading bodies with outstanding performance of 
official duties, including the Changchun city party committee 
and government, were commended through a circular order, and 
each member of the leading bodies was awarded with 1,000 yuan. 
  Second, (Ma Junqing) and 44 other leading cadres with 
outstanding performance of official duties were commended 
through a circular notice, and each was awarded with a one-grade 
wage increase. 
  Third, the leading bodies of the 10 central departments and 
units stationed in Jilin, including the provincial power 
industrial bureau, were commended through a circular order, and 
each member of the leading bodies was awarded 1,000 yuan. (Yu 
Fu) and 10 other leading cadres were commended through a 
circular notice. 
  Through a circular notice, the rally also commended 25 of 
the 
59 units and 45 of the 298 leading cadres whose performance of 
official duty was fairly prominent in 1993. 
  After the awards were given, He Zhukang, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, gave a speech. On behalf of the 
provincial party committee and government, he first extended 
warm congratulations on the commended leading bodies and 
comrades and also expressed heartfelt thanks to all the cadres 
in the province who made contributions to Jilin's reform, 
opening up, and modernization drive in the past year. 
  He Zhukang said: To meet the needs in the modernization 
drive and in establishing the socialist market economy system, 
the provincial party committee has endeavored to improve leading 
bodies and the contingent of cadres in a very important place by 
actively probing into the reform of the cadre system over the 
past few years. It reformed the system of selecting and 
promoting cadres and adopted the method of [words indistinct] to 
openly select and appoint leading cadres. After this, it 
reformed the system of appraising cadres. Last year, it began 
to appraise the performance of official duties by leading bodies 
and leading cadres under the administration of the province. 
This work has yielded fairly good results although it is just 
in its initial stages. Practice has proven that the system of 
appraisals of leading bodies and leading cadres conforms to the 
direction of the reform of the cadre system. It will play an 
important role not only in improving leading bodies and the 
contingent of cadres but also in upgrading the overall quality 
of cadres and promoting Jilin's work provincewide. We should 
continue to adhere to and extensively apply this system. 
  He Zhukang pointed out: Judging from the inherent impetus of 
the system of appraisal of official duty performance, this 
system is applicable not only to leading cadres at all levels 
but also to ordinary cadres. Therefore, party committees at all 
levels should gradually improve the appraisals of the cadres 
under their respective administration. Organization and 
personnel departments should conscientiously summarize 
experiences and strive to improve this system in the process of 
practice so that it will comply with the system to appraise 
state public servants and lay a good foundation for establishing 
a scientific cadre appraisal system. 
  In his speech, He Zhukang, expounded upon the specific 
common 
characteristics of the leading bodies and leading cadres 
commended for outstanding performance of official duties based 
on the results of the appraisals. He pointed out: These 
prominent characteristics can be summarized as the spirit of 
reform and opening up, the spirit of pioneering the way forward, 
the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the spirit of honesty 
and self-restraint, and the spirit of selfless devotion. These 
five kinds of spirit exemplify the spirit of wholehearted 
service to the people, which is the basic reason behind the 
outstanding performance of these leading bodies and leading 
cadres. We should greatly advocate such a spirit of commending 
these leading bodies and comrades in our future work, on all 
fronts of the province and make Jilin's modernization drive more 
successful. The provincial party committee and government urge 
all party and government leading bodies and leading cadres in 
the province to earnestly learn from the advanced units and 
individuals commended at this rally, further lift spirits to 
work hard, promote unity, rally forces, and, in line with the 
requirements of the central authorities, make sure that 
opportunities are seized to deepen reform, open wider to the 
outside world, promote development, maintain stability, 
comprehensively fulfill the various tasks for promoting the 
economy to a new height as put forward by the provincial party 
committee and government, and promote in a down-to- earth manner 
the grand cause of building a developed border province near the 
sea.

  [Text] The provincial propaganda and ideological work 
conference was held in Changchun on 3 March. He Zhukang, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important 
speech at the conference. He stressed that strengthening 
propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the overall 
situation, and this work should positively facilitate reform and 
opening up as well as the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, facilitate economic and social development, 
and help guarantee social stability. Attending the conference 
were leading comrades of the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government, including Gao Yan, Zhang Yueqi, Wang 
Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, Quan Zhezhu, Wei Minxue, and 
Sang Fengwen. Zhang Yueqi, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee, presided over the conference. At the 
conference held on the morning of 3 March, Xu Zhongtian, 
standing committee member of the provincial party committee and 
director of the propaganda department of the provincial party 
committee, first relayed the guidelines of the national 
propaganda and ideological work conference. 
  That afternoon, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial 
party 
committee, delivered an important speech at the conference. 
Comrade He Zhukang's speech falls into four parts: 1) 
Strengthening propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on 
the overall situation; 2) propaganda and ideological work is 
valued for construction; 3) build a contingent of propaganda and 
ideological workers with good quality; and 4) continue to 
strengthen the party's leadership over propaganda and 
ideological work. 
  In his speech, Comrade He Zhukang said: Right after the 
conclusion of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference, the provincial party committee's standing committee 
listened to and conscientiously studied and discussed the 
guidelines of this conference, defined through research the 
province's opinions for implementing the guidelines and some 
major issues on strengthening propaganda and ideological work, 
and then decided to hold the current provincial propaganda and 
ideological work conference. This provincial conference is 
devoted to relaying and implementing the guidelines of the 
national conference and to further unifying ideas, defining 
tasks, and strengthening leadership in an effort to create a new 
situation in the province's propaganda and ideological work, to 
better exploit propaganda departments' role of propaganda and 
guidance, mobilization and inspiring, and education and 
encouragement in deepening reform, expanding opening up, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability, and to better 
cement the strength of the people throughout the province to 
continuously press forward the magnificent cause of building 
Jilin into a development border and near-the-sea province. 
  He Zhukang said: Over the past 15 years since the 
commencement of reform and opening up, guided by the theory of 
building the socialism with Chinese characteristics and by the 
party's basic line, and based on the realities of reform and 
development, the province's propaganda and ideological workers 
have vigorously armed the people with theory, propagated just 
cases, carried forward the main melody, upheld correct 
orientation of the media, and carried forward the role of 
uniting and inspiring the people, thus helping promote all the 
work of the province. 
  He Zhukang pointed out: Propaganda and ideological work is 
the manifestation of fine tradition and political advantages of 
our party, which has always occupied an extremely important 
position in the work of the whole party. Under the new 
historical condition, the strategic position of propaganda and 
ideological work is tended to be strengthened, rather than being 
weakened. Therefore, during the new period, strengthening 
propaganda and ideological work, correctly guiding ideology and 
public opinions, and firmly controlling the orientation of the 
media have a direct bearing on the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization and on the overall situation of the 
socialist modernization. At present, China's reform and opening 
up as well as the modernization drive have entered a key period. 
Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening 
up, promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute 
the overall situation of the whole party and the whole country. 
Standing on the height of this overall situation, propaganda 
and ideological workers should fully understand the major 
responsibility and historical mission invested on them during 
the new period and should positively and enthusiastically serve 
the progress of reform and opening up. Under the situation in 
which many reform measures have been set forth altogether, the 
dynamics of reform has been increased, and the degree of 
difficulty of reform has been enhanced, propaganda and 
ideological workers should propagate, based on a new starting 
point, the importance and necessity of reform and the series of 
new reform measures adopted by the party and the government. At 
the same time, toward the new contradictions and new problems 
resulting from the readjusted relations of interests, propaganda 
and ideological workers should positively persuade the people 
and answer in vivid and correct terms the questions to the 
common concern of the people in order to turn negative factors 
into positive ones. 
  He Zhukang said: The current world opinion is conducive to 
accelerating China's economic development. Propaganda and 
ideological work should be aimed at creating a good ideological 
and public opinion atmosphere for economic development. 
Propaganda and ideological departments should make great 
efforts to propagate Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic idea on 
accelerating development, strengthen the people's consciousness 
in accelerating development, and disseminate the excellent 
situation and tremendous achievements scored in economic 
construction of the whole country and the whole province since 
the commencement of reform and opening up in order to arouse the 
fighting will of the people and enhance the morale of the 
people. Propaganda and ideological workers should publicize the 
conditions of China and Jilin Province by seeking truth from 
facts, make a scientific analysis of the contradictions and 
difficulties in economic work, guide the masses to show concern 
for the overall situation of economic development, help cadres 
and the masses embrace a new idea on development, and make the 
people more confident in achieving success in reform and 
surmounting difficulties. Propaganda and ideological 
departments should go all out to propagate the theory of market 
economy, popularize modern economic knowledge, and make the 
people more enthusiastic in participating in market economic 
activities. The endeavor of improving the people's quality 
should be regarded as the most fundamental work in the process 
of socialist modernization and, this work should be grasped 
constantly in the perspective of enhancing the long-term 
competitiveness of the province's economy. 
  He Zhukang said: Maintaining social stability is the 
prerequisite for deepening reform and accelerating development. 
Party members and cadres throughout the province as well as the 
propaganda and ideological front must pay high attention to 
various kinds of unstable factors in social activities, give 
full play to the power of propaganda and ideological work to 
give correct guidance, take a clear-cut stand in carrying 
forward healthy tendencies and condemning unhealthy ones, and 
check erroneous ideas at the outset in order to promote and 
safeguard stability. 
  He Zhukang said: Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out that 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line are the 
essential guide to propaganda and ideological work, and the 
major tasks of propaganda and ideological work are to arm the 
people with scientific theory, guide the people with correct 
public opinion, mold the people with noble spirit, and inspire 
the people with excellent works. The above-mentioned guide and 
major tasks have defined the essential objective of propaganda 
and ideological work as strengthening the common understanding 
and the cohesive force of the people of the whole party and the 
whole country. The province's propaganda and ideological work 
must be focused on strengthening the common understanding and 
the cohesive force of the people, on arming all the party 
members and cadres in the province with the theory of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, on using new ideas, that are 
suitable for the modern economy and for the situation of 
economic and social development, to correctly guide public 
opinion and [words indistinct], on firmly and unswervingly 
upholding the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and 
a hundred schools of thought contend, on [words indistinct] and 
strengthening management with the purpose of bringing the 
people's ideas into line with the overall situation of the whole 
party and the whole country. 
  He Zhukang said: Building a contingent of propaganda and 
ideological workers of good quality constitutes an 
organizational guarantee for achieving success in propaganda and 
ideological work. At present, propaganda and ideological workers 
must keep abreast of new demands, carry forward the cause 
pioneered by predecessors, forge ahead into the future, and make 
continued efforts to further strengthen themselves. In 
politics, propaganda and ideological workers should be firm and 
steadfast by embracing a strong sense of dedication and a high 
degree of the sense of responsibility. In profession, they 
should constantly improve their skills to become specialized in 
propaganda and ideological work and should enhance their 
confidence to maintain a good mental state. 
  Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: Strengthening the party's 
leadership over propaganda and ideological work is the 
consistent tradition of our party. During the new historical 
period, party organizations at all levels should all the more 
attach importance to and strengthen leadership over propaganda 
and ideological work. He stressed: Party committees must 
attach importance to propaganda and ideological work, provide 
sufficient and competent cadres for the leading bodies of 
propaganda and ideological departments, give full play to the 
role of propaganda departments under party committees, increase 
the input in propaganda and cultural undertakings, and actually 
help propaganda and ideological departments solve practical 
difficulties and problems. 
  He Zhukang said in conclusion: This year is an extremely 
important year, in which, reform will be promoted in an 
all-round way, and efforts will be made to make breakthroughs in 
major aspects. This year is also the last year to conduct the 
activity of pushing the province's economy onto a new stage in 
three years. The current situation and tasks are important and 
arduous, and the vast numbers of cadres on the propaganda and 
ideological front are shouldering an important mission. The 
provincial party committee expects that the cadres on the 
propaganda and ideological front will enhance their morale and 
do an even higher level of work to mobilize the vast numbers of 
cadres and the masses to forge ahead in unity, to deepen reform, 
to expand opening up, to promote development, and to maintain 
stability in order to make new contributions to building Jilin 
into a developed border and near-the-sea province and to 
building the socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Attending the current provincial propaganda and ideological 
work conference were secretaries in charge of propaganda and 
ideological work of various city, prefectural, and autonomous 
prefectural party committees; directors of propaganda 
departments of these party committees; editors-in-chief of 
office papers of these party committees; principle responsible

directly under the provincial authorities; responsible comrades 
of various departments and commissions under the provincial 
party committee; responsible comrades of various commissions,

work of various people's groups; and principal responsible 
persons of the central press units stationed in Jilin Province

  The activity of awarding outstanding news reports on 
propagating Liaoning was cosponsored by the propaganda 
department of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
press workers association. Nine reports won special awards, 16 
reports won the first-grade awards, and 28 reports won the 
second-grade awards. [passage omitted] 
  Gu Jinchi made a speech at the meeting. On behalf of the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government, he 
extended greetings to the award winners and extended cordial 
regards to the broad masses of press workers who have made 
efforts to promote the construction of the material and 
spiritual civilizations. He also set forth four opinions on 
further achieving news propaganda. First, we should grasp an 
accurate orientation of mass media, bring into full play the 
news propaganda front's instructive and educational functions. 
We should mobilize the broad masses of the cadres and the 
masses to dedicate themselves in reform. Second, closely in 
line with the central work of the provincial party committee and 
the provincial government, we should increase the contents of 
propaganda on economic work and promote a sustained, fast, and 
sound development of the economy. Third, we should 
conscientiously select subjects, strengthen the depth of 
reports, and strive to upgrade the quality and level of news 
propaganda. Fourth, we should strengthen external propaganda 
and further expand Liaoning's influential power at home and 
abroad. 
  Gu Jinchi said: The news propaganda work is of extreme 
importance. The provincial party committee and the provincial 
government have paid high attention to it. The year 1994 is a 
key year to promote the package economic reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas as well as a year when the number of 
major reform measures is more than any other years and the setup 
of the socialist market economic system is accelerated. 
Therefore, strengthening the news propaganda work is of 
peculiar importance. 
  Gu Jinchi said: The propaganda on the promulgation of major 
reform measures is an important content of the news propaganda 
work. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 
14th party congress, particularly the third plenary session of 
the 14th party Central Committee; and also pay attention to 
grasping the central guidelines by handling the relationship 
between the promulgation of major reform measures and the setup 
of the socialist market economic system. The problems that the 
masses pay attention to should accurately be explained and 
positively be guided. We should propagate the contents of 
various reform measures among the cadres and the people; clearly 
explain the relationship between reform and development, between 
reform and the work in other aspects, and between reform and the 
lives of the people; enhance the people's understanding about 
reform and their psychological bearing ability; and form a 
social environment and a mass media environment that are 
conducive to reform. It is not easy to achieve the work in 
these aspects. Therefore, the press workers should not only arm 
their brains with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 
14th party congress but also deeply engage themselves in the 
practice of reform and go deep to the grass roots to catch the 
news of guidance importance and high value to promote the work 
of the overall situation and to deepen the reform work of the 
province. 
  Gu Jinchi said: Concentrating energy to achieve the 
economic construction is a central task of the province. We 
should fully apply various means to conscientiously propagate 
economic construction and concentrate the people's attention to 
achieve modernization and realize the province's second 
pioneering work. The propaganda on economic work should be 
carried out closely in line with the reality of the province. 
In line with the province's economic development strategies and 
ideas, we should prominently increase the dynamics of 
propaganda. The propaganda on economic work should be carried 
out closely in line with the reality of economic construction, 
reform, and opening up. We should be good at abstracting some 
essential things from large amounts of complicated economic 
phenomena, sum up those successful experiences in economic work 
and gained from the practice of production and management 
activities, and propagate them. By so doing will our news 
reports be compiled vividly and profoundly. 
  Gu Jinchi said: News can directly and actively reflect 
political, economic, cultural, and social activities. The 
principle of party spirit of news decides that press propaganda 
prominently has main melody and fully displays the spirit of the 
times. We should reflect the profound changes in the society as 
a whole brought about by reform and opening up; the party and 
government's major measures for leading the construction of 
socialist modernization, particularly the ideas and measures for 
implementing the major policy decisions of the central 
authorities according to Liaoning's reality; the fruitful 
achievements in building material and material civilizations; 
and the mental outlook of the people. We should pay attention to 
the research on the thinking of reports. It is necessary to 
grasp the selection of major subjects. Not only editors in 
chief and radio and television station directors but also 
editorial staff members should make researches on it. So long 
as we often make researches and deliberations will we be able to 
grasp key news points and major subjects and improve the quality 
and efficiency of news propaganda. We should pay attention to 
strengthening the depth of reports, concentrate on disseminating 
major subjects and key typical examples, and bring into full 
play the mass media's guidance role. We should persist in the 
principle of propaganda by giving positive examples, grasp 
hot-debated issues, have the daring to touch the hot-debated 
problems in society, and also give accurate explanations and 
guidance. We should increase reports and commentaries on public 
opinions and increase the ideological contents of reports. It 
is necessary to vigorously encourage press workers to change 
their work style and to go deep to the grass roots to conduct 
investigation and study. 
  Gu Jinchi said: External propaganda is an important 
component part of the propaganda work. The fundamental tasks 
for external propaganda are to foster Liaoning's image at home 
and abroad and to create a good mass media environment for the 
province's reform, opening up, and modernization. Over the past 
years, the external propaganda work has ceaselessly been 
enhanced and played a key role. Besides the concerted efforts 
made by all fronts of the province, the central and overseas 
press units stationed in Liaoning and the key press units of the 
province have made lots of fruitful achievements and made key 
contributions to expanding Liaoning's influential power at home 
and abroad. The purpose to launch the activity of "giving 
outstanding news reports on propagating Liaoning" is to 
strengthen external propaganda and news propaganda and to 
encourage the broad masses of press workers to make more 
introductions of Liaoning to the places at home and abroad. 
Now, many countries in the world are carrying out the strategy 
of opening up. There are frequent international economic and 
cultural contacts. We must make more and faster introductions 
of Liaoning to the outside world. We should be good at using 
the current favorable opportunities, positively improve and 
realistically strengthen external propaganda, bring into full 
play the external propaganda work's functions for guiding the 
mass media in the course of expanding the scale of opening up, 
and have Liaoning enjoy high prestige in the world. 
  Gu Jinchi hoped that in the new year, the broad masses of 
press workers should work harder, create increasingly more 
outstanding works, and make greater contributions to promoting 
the construction of the two civilizations. 
  Wang Chonglu, member of the standing committee of the 
provincial party committee and director of the propaganda 
department, chaired the meeting. Gao Dongxiao, deputy director 
of the propaganda department, introduced the situation relating 
to the selection of news and commentaries. Responsible persons 
of the central press organizations stationed in Shenyang and the 
provincial-level press units and representatives of award 
winners held talks and set forth many good opinions and 
suggestions on how to achieve the news propaganda work.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 13 March at Liaoning Hotel of 
Beijing, the provincial government held a reception for 
reporters. Present at the reception were provincial leaders Gu 
Jinchi, Yue Qifeng, Zhang Guoguang, Wen Shizhen, Zhang Rongmao, 
and Guo Tingbiao; and leaders and reporters of XINHUA news 
agency, RENMIN RIBAO, the Central People's Broadcasting Station, 
and the Central Television Station. The reception was chaired 
by Wen Shizhen, executive vice governor of the provincial 
government. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, made a speech ahead of others at the reception. 
  He said: Liaoning's development cannot be divorced from the 
support of press units. On behalf of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, I express thanks to you. 
  Gu Jinchi said: Liaoning's development targets have been 
defined. After the convocation of the second session of the 
eighth National People's Congress, we will work out new 
development targets according to the guidelines of this session. 
Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and with 
the support of press units, we should continue to develop 
Liaoning and [words indistinct]. I hope that the comrades of 
the press units will develop more opinions and share suggestions 
on Liaoning's development. 
  At the reception, Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech in 
regard 
to the 1993 ideas for readjusting the economic structure and 
doing the second pioneering work as well as the new changes in 
Liaoning's economic pattern. 
  He said: First, the backward agricultural and rural economic 
situation was changed. Last year, the grain output reached 
16,960,000 tonnes. The province not only became self-sufficient 
in grain and major nonstaple foods but also started to export 
some farm and sideline products. Second, the situation where 
local industries developed slowly was changed. The provincial 
party committee and the provincial government clearly set forth 
the ideology of having large industries to guide the development 
of small ones and [words indistinct]. At the time of enlivening 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, we have 
concentrated great efforts to develop local minor industries. 
The output value realized by the local minor industries in 1993 
reached 111.23 billion yuan, an increase of 68.4 percent over 
the previous year. Third, the unitary ownership structure was 
changed. Non-state economy, as a new economic growing point in 
Liaoning's second pioneering work, develops at a fast speed. 
Fourth, the unitary form of revenues was changed. Due to the 
step-by-step formation of new financial resources, such as town 
and township enterprises, district and neighborhood economy, 
tertiary industry, individual and private economy, and three 
kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, the revenues increased each 
passing year. 
  Yue Qifeng said: With these new changes, Liaoning's economic 
structure is more suitable to the needs of the market economic 
development and more conducive to bringing into play various 
advantages and [words indistinct]. All this has brought 
prospects for rejuvenating Liaoning's economy.

worked out plans for several major tasks to be carried out in 
the province this year. He pointed out: It is necessary to act 
in line with the central spirit of seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, 
and maintaining stability, properly handle the relations of 
reform, development, and stability, and under the situation of 
maintaining social stability, guarantee the smooth 
implementation of the reform plans. At present, we should 
attend to agricultural production, seize the opportune moment 
for spring plowing, and guarantee the farming acreage, 
particularly the farming acreage of wheat. He stressed: We 
should realistically organize and guide industrial production 
and end the downward situation in industry. 
  At the end of his speech, Gu Jinchi called on leaders at all 
levels to improve work style, go deeply to the grass roots, 
strengthen grass-roots organizational construction, and do some 
practical things for the grass roots.

  [Text] Shenyang, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Highway 
transportation in northeast China's Liaoning Province has 
undergone rapid development thanks to the flourishing collective 
and private transport sectors as well as increased state input. 
  Joint efforts of state organs, collectives and individuals 
and appropriate competition among them have greatly invigorated 
the province's road transportation and provided a firm 
foundation for its economic development. 
  The volume of Liaoning's road transportation last year 
reached 700 million tons and the number of passengers served 
topped 340 million. 
  Communications and transport services in the province, as in 
the whole country, used to be totally under state control and 
were long haunted by such problems as insufficient carrying 
capacity and slack organization. 
  Along with the country's reform of the transportation 
system, 
collective and individual sectors have begun to play an 
increasingly important role in both road construction and 
transport services. 
  A decade ago, the number of trucks and buses for civil use 
owned by individuals in Liaoning was 4,279, with only 12 
designated to carry passengers. 
  That figure had grown to 51,600 by the end of last year, 
accounting for one-tenth of the province's total and nearly four 
times that owned by provincial transportation departments. 
  In the year 1993, one-fourth of the province's total volume 
of goods delivered through road transportation were handled by 
individual sectors, which also served half of its 160 million 
passengers. 
  The provincial government has also increased input in 
transportation. Last year alone, state investment in highway 
construction reached 1.1 billion yuan.

  [Text] Shenyang, March 19 (XINHUA) -- A movable 
remote-controlled production robot passed appraisal tests Friday 
[18 March] here in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's 
Liaoning Province. 
  This newly-made robot, made by the Shenyang Robot Research 
and Development Center, the cradle of China's robot industry, 
will be used to work in the dangerous and adverse environment in 
the country's sophisticated industrial sector. 
  Also called "remote-controlled automatic cart," the 420 
kilogram- robot with its two operation hands is capable of 
moving up and down staircases and surmount any obstacles. 
  Through remote control and monitoring, the robot is able to 
fix or remove valves and unscrew nails in complex industrial 
facilities. And it can also perform such functions as doing 
operations, monitoring, testing and maintenance so as to ensure 
safety production and increase efficiency.

Mine Has Been Discovered in Fuxin, Liaoning Province"] 
  [Text] The Paishanlou Gold Mine--China's largest gold 
mine, has been discovered in the Fuxin Mongolian Nationality 
Autonomous County in Liaoning Province. 
  The mine was surveyed and discovered by the Liaoning 
Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. Since the 
bureau was founded in 1989, it has organized eight geological 
teams and has spent three years carrying out geological 
prospecting activities in a block section [kuai duan 1040 3008] 
of 800 meters. The geological prospecting results show that the 
Paishanlou Gold Mine belongs to the tough shear belt metamorphic 
hydrothermal type. It is a new type of cold deposit which has 
been discovered in China for the first time. It is 
characterized by a large scale, a single mineral, a high 
percentage of gold, shallow storage, and easy extraction and 
selection. The gold reserves total 430 tonnes. This is the 
most exceptionally large gold mine ever discovered in China. 
  The mine is a key development project in the Eighth 
Five-Year 
Plan. The state will invest 200 million yuan and will build the 
mine into China's largest comprehensive modern gold mine, 
complete with an extraction, selection, and smelting process. 
  The feasibility study of the mine and its overall design 
have 
been completed, and its preliminary work is underway. The mine 
is expected to become fully operational in 1995.

  [Text] Shenyang, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province reported a sharp growth in its construction 
sector last year, with profits reaching 1.743 billion yuan, an 
increase of 20 percent from 1992, a local official said. 
  Mu Suixin, head of the provincial construction department, 
attributed the gratifying achievements to the government's 
macro-control over the fast-increasing construction market. 
  He said that the province's investment in key projects last 
year topped 7.6 billion yuan and the total floor space of 
newly-built urban apartments reached 16.5 million square meters. 
  The official said that the local governments made great 
efforts to establish a sound real estate market structure to 
boost the development of the construction industry. 
  To achieve this goal, he said, a tender and supervisory 
system for construction projects was set up in the province. 
  The number of projects contracted by way of bidding reached 
4,440 last year, accounting for 87.6 percent of the province's 
total, he said. 
  Meanwhile, he added, 14 cities have set up construction 
quality supervisory offices to control the investment and 
quality of the projects. 
  In order to foster and develop a good real estate market, 
the 
province also tightened reins over land development, while 
focusing on the building of the real estate market, he continued. 
  Tenders for developing urban districts were published in 
some 
cities to help the local governments raise funds for urban 
construction. 
  According to the official, 72 real estate business offices 
and services and a number of markets have been built in the 
province for real estate trading, leasing and mortgaging.

  [Text] Shenyang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- People no longer wear 
gauze masks in winter in this once pollution-ridden capital of 
northeast China's Liaoning Province, thanks to years of hard 
work by the city's environmental departments. 
  In winter the city used to be enveloped in choking dust and 
smoke emitted from central heating systems and factories. 
  From dusk to dawn, in particular, the dust became thicker 
and 
thicker. People had to wear gauze masks when they went out, or 
black dust would pile up around their noses and mouths. 
  "In the 1970's, my whole head and face were covered with 
dust 
whenever I went out for a stroll in the morning," said an old 
resident who lives in the city's busy Taiyuan Street. 
  To eliminate contamination sources and fundamentally solve 
the problem of pollution, the city installed contamination 
monitors high above the ground. Any unit whose discharge 
exceeded the standards would be warned or fined. 
  As a result, departments in the city have been forced to 
renovate their obsolete heating systems. By the end of last 
year all the more than 3,000 old-fashioned boilers had been 
replaced. 
  Meanwhile, the city has installed modern central heating 
facilities. 
  According the city's environmental agency, now 90 central 
heating zones have been built across the city, covering over 90 
percent of heat users. 
  The old forests of chimneys have disappeared, and the 
chimneys left no longer emit black soots. 
  Last year Shenyang reduced its smoke and dust by 10,000 
tons. 
  "The present air is much clearer," said the old resident of 
Taiyuan Street, where there is only one chimney in an area of 
800,000 square meters now. "More and more people step out of 
their home to do physical exercises in the mornings these days," 
he said.

  [Text] In his speech at yesterday's [5 March] provincial 
propaganda and ideological work meeting, Acting Governor Zhang 
Wule stressed: We are shouldering a very important task in our 
propaganda and ideological work. Through various effective 
propaganda means, we should arouse people's fighting will so 
that their spirit can be transformed into a powerful material 
force to accelerate the pace of pushing our province's economy 
to a new height. 
  In his speech, Zhang Wule first briefed participants on the 
present situation of economic operations in our province, and 
the good prospects of development. He fully affirmed the 
contributions made by the propaganda and ideological front to 
the economic and social development of the whole province. He 
pointed out: In the course of implementing the series of reform 
measures and policies promulgated by the state this year, 
correct propaganda and guidance in terms of public opinion are 
required. He said vividly: According to materialist dialectics, 
the spirit can be transformed into materials. Doing propaganda 
and ideological work well means creating wealth for economic 
development. He called on mass media and propaganda workers to 
understand the relationship between specific and general 
interests, partial and overall interests, and immediate and 
long-term interests; to conduct well the propaganda concerning 
hot and difficult topics; and to make still greater efforts to 
create a fine public-opinion environment for reform, opening up, 
and the economic construction of the whole province.

  [Text] On the eve of Islam's traditional Erde Festival, 
Yang Huaixiao, member of the provincial party committee standing 
committee and vice governor, led the leading members of related 
departments of the provincial government to visit some mosques 
in Lanzhou and some resident religious and nationality figures 
in order to extend festive greetings to them on behalf of the 
provincial government. The group discussed with them the issue 
of how religious circles should do a still better job of serving 
the maintenance of Gansu's social stability and economic 
construction. 
  In a discussion meeting, Yang Huaixiao indicated that China 
is now at a crucial point in reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization, and that the promotion of economic development 
and the maintenance of social stability are the central tasks 
that stand above all else for the whole party and all of 
society. It is imperative to continue implementing the party's 
policy on freedom of religious belief, and to protect normal 
religious activities in accordance with the law. At the same 
time, it is imperative to strengthen the administration of 
religious activities according to the law. It is hoped that 
friends among religious circles will unite and lead the broad 
religious masses, as always, under the correct leadership of the 
provincial party committee and government; take an active part 
in building the two socialist civilizations; further augment the 
concept of the legal system; and unfold normal religious 
activities within the scope of party policy and state law. It is 
necessary to develop the economy in a big way, take an active 
role in doing a good job of self-support undertakings, and work 
hard to reduce the burden of religious masses. Regarding 
existing and emerging problems, these should be reported to the 
higher level through normal channels so as to consciously 
maintain the stability, unity, and fine situation of the whole 
province, and to make new contributions to Gansu's reform, 
development, and stability.

  [Text] Last year, the development of township and town 
enterprises in our province was at an all-time high, with their 
total production output value reaching approximately 17.7 
billion yuan, an increase of 58.37 percent over 1992. Total 
income in this sector was approximately 15.2 billion yuan, an 
increase of 53.36 percent. Peasants' per capita wage income 
from township and town enterprises has increased by 130 yuan, 
accounting for about one quarter of the peasants' per capita net 
income. 
  Last year, following the official promulgation of the State 
Council's decision on speeding up the development of township 
and town enterprises in the central and western regions, the 
whole province made the most of the resulting favorable 
situation to set off an upsurge of running township and town 
enterprises. Throughout the province, township and town 
enterprises in 14 counties, cities, and prefectures saw their 
development speed increase by more than 80 percent. In seven 
counties and prefectures, township and town enterprises doubled 
their pace of development. Township and town enterprises in 
Jiayuguan city increased their speed by 124 percent. On this 
basis, various localities made use of the new characteristic of 
the rapid development of township and town enterprises to 
transform them based on joint-stock and collective ownership to 
further define the relations between production and 
administrative power and tap investment potential. According to 
statistics, there are more than 3,700 large township and town 
enterprises under joint- stock collective ownership, and more 
than 1.2 billion yuan has been brought in. 
  In the course of developing township and town enterprises, 
various localities have generally attached importance to 
scientific and technical input. Last year, through various 
channels the whole province trained 24,000 qualified personnel 
with different expertise for township and town enterprises, 269 
of whom won middle ranking professional and technical titles for 
their posts.

  [Text] Lanzhou, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Gansu Province has decided to adopt a series of measures to help 
residents living in the province's poverty-hit southern areas to 
become prosperous over the coming seven years. 
  The mountainous southern areas are far from towns and suffer 
from backward transport, farming methods and education. Lacking 
supplies of piped water and electricity, these areas also suffer 
serious soil erosion and frequent natural disasters. They also 
have a large number of mentally retarded people and people 
disabled by endemic diseases. 
  Statistics show that the residents of these areas have a per 
capita net income of below 300 yuan (about 30 U.S. dollars) a 
year, and have long depended on relief funds and grain from the 
central government. 
  According to local officials, the province will earmark more 
money in the coming seven years for the building of farmland 
conservancy works, projects for providing drinking water to 
local residents and livestock and for the installation of more 
transmission lines of electricity for these areas. 
  At the same time, they will also be urged to plant more 
trees, and strengthen the harnessing of small rivers, in a bid 
to improve the environment for agriculture and to make the local 
residents in these areas become self-sufficient in grain. 
  Efforts will also be made to encourage local farmers become 
market-conscious and grow more cash crops. The farmers will 
also be encouraged to set up more rural and township enterprises 
near town and county seats and along highways, with the purpose 
of tapping natural resources in their localities. 
  In addition, the province will implement on a trial basis 
the 
policy of letting economic entities, cadres and other 
individuals contract the construction of help-the-poor projects 
in the southern areas so as to make more residents in the 
poverty-hit areas get well-off as soon as possible.

  [Text] Provincial party Deputy Secretary Yang Zhenjie 
pointed out: It is necessary to fully understand the new 
situation facing our work with nationalities and religions, 
truly strengthen leadership over it, give first priority in our 
work to safeguarding stability and solidarity in areas inhabited 
by minority nationalities, and make efforts to promote the 
economy in these areas. 
  Deputy Secretary Yang Zhenjie made an important speech at a 
provincial meeting on work with nationalities and religions 
which ended yesterday [5 March]. He said: A political 
situation of solidarity and stability in areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities has created fine conditions for stability 
and development in our province. All the previous provincial 
party committees and governments attached importance to work 
with nationalities and religions. Party committees and 
governments at all levels must carry forward this fine tradition 
of attaching importance to work with nationalities and 
religions, put it at the top of their agendas, make constant 
efforts to investigate and comprehend the situation in these 
aspects, and solve existing problems in a timely fashion. This 
should start with units at the grass-roots level. Prefectural 
and county party committees and governments must truly 
strengthen the building of party organizations at the town, 
township, and village level, as should state power organizations 
as well. They must overcome weakness and laxity. Attaching 
importance to work with nationalities and religions must become 
the general practice of the entire party and all of society. 
  Yang Zhenjie continued: It is necessary profoundly and 
consistently to provide cadres and people of various 
nationalities with education on Marxist views on nationalities 
and religions, and with propaganda on socialism and patriotism. 
In accordance with the party's policy on nationalities and 
religions, we must handle properly any problems arising among 
nationalities or religions. We must have a good grasp of the 
policy, and must make strict differentiations between, and 
correctly handle the two kinds of contradictions of different 
natures. It is necessary to truly strengthen management of 
religious activities, and to bring religious activities into the 
course of the legal system. It is necessary to continue 
consolidating and developing the patriotic united front 
involving both the party, and people in nationality and 
religious circles. 
  In conclusion, Yang Zhenjie stressed: Accelerating economic 
development and social progress in areas inhabited by minority 
nationalities is of vital importance to strengthening 
nationality solidarity, safeguarding social stability, and 
promoting the modernization of the entire province. 
Contradictions and problems arising in these areas, in the 
final analysis, must be solved through the development of the 
economy. Our provincial authorities must give more support to 
these areas in terms of funds and material resources, vigorously 
develop their cultural and educational undertakings, train more 
cadres and scientific-technical personnel of 
minority-nationality origin, and try in every possible way to 
speed up their economic development. It is necessary to 
gradually narrow the gaps between different nationalities in 
terms of development, and to achieve common prosperity for 
various nationalities. 
  Yang Huaixiao, member of the provincial party committee 
standing committee and vice governor, aired his specific views 
on implementing the spirit of the provincial meeting on work 
with nationalities and religions. Li Ziqi, Zhu Xuanren, and 
Yang Fuxing were present at yesterday's meeting.

  [Text] The year-long lawsuit of Hong Kong businessman Tsui 
Bao-jen charging the Lanzhou Qilihe District People's Government 
with violating his rights as an agent was ruled on by the 
provincial higher people's court; and the case was closed with 
the accusant's charge rejected, and Tsui Bao-jen was to pay the 
cost of some 68,000 yuan involved in the trial. 
  A year before, Hong Kong businessman Tsui Bao-jen brought a 
case to the provincial higher people's court on the grounds that 
Qilihe District Government had violated his rights as an agent 
in marketing China-grown lily bulbs in Hong Kong because he had 
discovered an advertisement of the Hong Kong Maiya Trade Company 
claiming to be an agent in marketing lily bulbs, thus he 
demanded Qilihe District Government to acertain his general 
agent rights in Hong Kong, while claiming a 12.4 million yuan 
indemnity. 
  Through hearing of the provincial higher people's court, it 
was held that the contract signed between the accusant Tsui 
Bao-jen and the relavant department in Qilihe district 
explicitly stipulated that the term of Tsui Bao-jen acting as 
agent was five years. When the term expired, the contract was 
not renewed; consequently, Tsui's status of the agent ended 
automatically.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Report: "Ningxia Will Launch and Complete 10 </F>
Major Agricultural Construction Projects"] 
  [Text] At the press conference held by the propaganda 
department of the regional party committee and the office of the 
regional leading group on rural work a few days ago, our 
reporter learned that our region will undertake and complete 10 
major agricultural construction projects over the next few years 
beginning in 1994. They include one first-phase work project, 
four foreign- aid projects, and five projects funded by our own 
region. 
  -- The Daliushu key water conservancy and hydro-electric 
project in the Huang He Valley. Last August, the State Council 
entered this project on the list of key water conservancy 
projects to be started in the 1990s. In 1994, our region will 
speed up the first-phase preparatory work for the Daliushu 
Project and draft plans for the resettlement of people and for 
rights and interests distribution so as to start constructing 
the project as soon as possible. 
  -- The Yanhuanding Water Raising Project in the 
Shaanxi-Gansu- Ningxia region. It is composed of two parts, a 
project used jointly by Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, and 
projects for their respective use. This year is crucial for the 
construction of the project for common use. The total 
investment is set at 49 million yuan, of which 22 million will 
be provided by our region. 
  -- The Ningxia Hetao project to divert water from the Huang 
He to enlarge the irrigated area south of Yinchuan. This 
project, which is funded by a loan from the World Bank, is at 
the final assessment stage prior to approval. 
  -- The Ningxia Hetao agricultural comprehensive development 
project. The establishment of this project and its 
implementation were approved by the State Leading Group for 
Comprehensive Agricultural Development. It is an important 
project for developing the Ningxia Hetao area and tackling the 
irrigation problem there, for speeding up agricultural 
development in the area irrigated with water from the Huang He, 
and for achieving a greater capacity for further agricultural 
development. This year is the final year for implementing the 
second stage of the undertaking, and over 60 million yuan will 
be injected into the project. It will primarily be used to 
complete the transformation of 170,000 mu of medium- and 
low-yield land and open up 85,000 mu of land. 
  -- The construction of high-yield, good quality, and highly 
efficient agricultural demonstrative areas. Beginning this 
year, our region will build 16 different types of demonstrative 
areas characterized by high yields, good quality, and high 
efficiency. They include demonstrative areas for quality rice, 
licorice root, barley for beer, hops, quality fruit, and 
breeding. 
  -- The Ningxia land transformation project. This project, a 
technological project being undertaken with aid from the 
European Community, began last year and will enter the stage of 
full implementation this year. 
  -- The project to assist the poor and improve the 
environment 
of three counties in the Ningxia Plateau (Project 4071). This 
is a comprehensive agricultural project made possible by aid 
from the World Food Program to harness the little valleys in 
three counties in our region, Guyuan, Pengyang and Longde. The 
35th Policy and Planning Commission of the World Food Program 
officially approved the establishment of the project in June 
last year and has informed China that an agreement will be 
signed on February 16. This project is expected to begin on 1 
April. The implementation will take five years and will involve 
a total investment of 112.6 million yuan. 
  -- The Ningxia forest protection research project. This 
project is a Sino-Japanese cooperation project focusing on 
special technological products. It will be completed through 
joint research and experiments conducted by the Japan 
International Joint Undertaking Group and our region. An 
official agreement was signed on January 24 this year and 
implementation will begin in April this year. Japan will 
provide our area with 500 million Japanese yuan (40 million 
yuan) in aid. 
  -- The second generation farmland-forest network project. 
  -- The construction of a conifer timber area in the Liupan 
Mountain Area. Based on what has been achieved in the past, a 
conifer timber area of 270,000 mu will be developed between this 
year and 1998.

  [Text] The provincial work conference on comprehensive 
agricultural development, which concluded not long ago, set out 
that the main tasks for Xining's comprehensive agricultural 
development in 1994 are: Consolidate the results of development 
in the first phase, complete the engineering of the main body in 
the second-phase projects, and do a good job of preparations for 
third-phase projects. In development, it is imperative to 
strengthen ideas to make Xining's comprehensive agricultural 
development mount a new plane. 
  Vice Governor Ma Yanbiao attended the meeting and made a 
speech. He said: In comprehensive agricultural development over 
the past few years, we paid attention to the production of 
grain, edible oil, and meat, but failed to place the issue of 
rural areas working hard to become comparatively well-off in a 
sufficiently important position. In comprehensive agricultural 
development, it is necessary to pay attention to linking 
development to local plans for agricultural development. It is 
also necessary to stabilize results in project areas, 
stabilizing the output of grains, edible oil, and meat, 
invigorating diversified management, and augmenting the overall 
effects. It is necessary to regard increasing peasants' income 
as an important goal in comprehensive agricultural development. 
Only then will it be possible for Xining's comprehensive 
agricultural development to have vitality. 
  Vice Governor Ma Yanbiao required farming areas to pay 
attention to developing herding, actively encourage the practice 
of feeding cattle with crop stalks, and regard the development 
of herding as a major affair for farming areas to get rid of 
poverty, become well- off, and improve effects. Attention 
should paid to the spread and application of science and 
technical know-how in project areas and increase input in 
science and technology. In dealing with the tasks for 
comprehensive agricultural development in 1994, Vice Governor Ma 
Yanbiao indicated that, regarding first-phase projects, it is 
necessary to grasp well some individual projects, and 
consolidation and improvement of work in general. It is 
necessary to continue to complete and perfect a whole range of 
projects in farmland construction, and work hard to fulfill the 
tasks of afforestation. First-phase project areas should further 
implement the contracted responsibility system and operational 
plans for planting so that the development of each piece of land 
will bring benefits. 
  Second-phase projects should be conducted in light of funds, 
labor, and tasks, with arrangements made rationally so that 
people will benefit immediately from every project of 
comprehensive agricultural development. 
  It is also learned from the aforesaid meeting that the 
central authorities will increase an annual investment of 10 
million yuan in the province's second-phase comprehensive 
agricultural development to support Xining transforming medium- 
and low-yield farmland and building grasslands.

  [Text] The provincial government has decided to lift 
control on grain trade and prices in Yushu and Golog prefectures 
as of 1 April. This means that all such restrictions throughout 
the province have been lifted. In view of the fact that Yushu 
and Golog prefectures are located in remote areas, and that real 
difficulties of long transport line, slow turnover, and high 
costs have existed in the grain trade, the provincial government 
has decided that while lifting restrictions over grain trade and 
prices, some preferential policies are still applied to the 
above-mentioned two prefectures. 
  These preferential policies are mainly: The provincial 
government's overall subsidies for the two prefectures' deficits 
in grain business will not be reduced, and will continue to be 
retained. These subsidies will mainly be used to establish 
grain supply funds, and to support grain enterprises to develop 
diversified business operations [words indistinct]. In 
accordance with the principle sharing transport expenses among 
the state, enterprises, and individuals, the provincial 
financial department will provide proper subsidies for grain 
freight of the two prefectures. After the lifting of control 
over grain prices, pensions of retirees in grain sector will be 
paid by the provincial financial authorities, and 70 percent of 
the wages of workers and staff members in the sector will also 
be subsidized by provincial financial authorities. In addition, 
to enhance the capacity of the two prefectural governments to 
exercise macroscopic regulation and control after the lifting of 
controls over grain prices, the amount of their provincial-level 
grain reserves will also be properly increased.

  [Text] Inflation, a worsening crime problem and disputes 
among religious sects threaten the social order of the 
impoverished western province of Shaanxi, provincial deputies to 
the NPC said yesterday. Already trailing behind other parts of 
the country in the pace of economic growth, the province has 
also complained of the dearth of financial backing from the 
central Government and increased burden under the new tax 
reforms. The grievances dominated a group discussion by Shaanxi 
deputies of the Government Work Report at the Great Hall of the 
People yesterday. 
  Speaking after hearing the complaints, Shaanxi Governor Bai 
Qingcai lent weight to the central policy, however. "We still 
support the policy of the central Government to boost its 
financial strength. It will be helpful to the less economically 
developed regions," he said. "Growth is a matter of time. The 
coastal regions have started earlier but we will be able to 
catch up. We are parts and the state is whole. We have to 
position ourself in the whole and to give a full play to our own 
potential," the Governor said. Mr Bai also stressed that the 
overall situation in the province was stable. "Some people 
might have their own grievances and take it to the 
Government.... Some also suffered from the delay of payment of 
their wages. We have already urged all localities to pay 
attention to the problem," he said. 
  The Mayor of Xian, the capital city of Shaanxi, Cui Litao, 
has warned that several factors have increased the possibility 
of social unrest in the city this year, including the prospect 
of prices going beyond levels that workers can bear. Although 
last year's annual inflation of 12.7 percent was lower than in 
the coastal regions and major cities, Mr Cui said price controls 
should be strengthened as market economic reform deepened. "If 
we can keep good control over prices there should be no major 
problems this year," he said. The mayor also pointed to factors 
such as deteriorating law and order, corruption and delays and 
failure to pay wages and pensions to workers in some 
money-losing enterprises. "Together with civil disputes, they 
are elements that might cause instability," Mr Cui said. He 
said many people had complained that the public security body 
was "in a mess". He admitted a few public security officers 
were corrupt, but said the police force was sound as a whole. 
  Pang Jiayu, head of the large city of Baoji, cast doubt on 
whether the Government would be able to keep inflation down to 
10 per cent. "We must ensure the adequate supply of 
commodities. Otherwise, it will create major conflicts," he 
said. He said conflicts among religious sects in the province 
might also create further disturbances. 
  Another delegate from Xian, Yu Xiaowen, said the province 
could not rely on its own funds entirely and needed money from 
the central Government. "If stability in Shaanxi cannot be 
maintained, it will affect the whole northwestern region," she 
said.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts of Governor Bai Qingcai's government work report </F>
to the Second Session of the Eighth Provincial People's 
Congress," from the Special Coverage of the Second Session of 
the Eighth Provincial People's Congress -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] In his government work report to the second session 
of the eighth provincial people's congress, Bai Qingcai said: 
This year, we should continue to do a good job in planned 
parenthood and environmental protection, and should augment land 
administration. Planned parenthood, environmental protection, 
and land administration are three basic national policies of 
China. It is imperative to strengthen the sense of population 
and the per capita concept, to include population control in the 
overall plan for economic and social development, and to adhere 
to grasping two categories of production simultaneously. It is 
imperative to earnestly implement the Shaanxi provincial 
regulations on planned parenthood, with the focus on doing a 
good job in rural birth control. It is necessary to 
continuously complete and perfect the responsibility system with 
population target control, which must be under the charge of the 
chief responsible leading member, who will bear the chief 
responsibility. The system of veto without a ballot in birth 
control must be implemented resolutely so as to guarantee the 
fulfillment of the province's 1994 population plan. 
  Environmental protection has a direct bearing on economic 
and 
social development, and on people's physical well-being. It is 
imperative to adopt powerful measures to cure the worsening of 
the ecology; to adhere to the principle of harmonious 
development of environmental protection and economic 
construction; and to actively promote comprehensive urban and 
rural environmental improvement, with the focus on improving 
environmental pollution in Xian, Tongchuan, Yanan and the 
Northern Shaanxi Energy Resources Development Zone, so as to 
improve the environmental quality as quickly as possible. It is 
necessary to continue to augment environmental monitoring and 
control in order to avoid the surfacing of new sources of 
environmental pollution. It is necessary to improve the rate of 
handling industrial wastes, and to do a good job in protecting 
the sources of drinking water. 
  We should further magnify control over land resources and 
property management, and promote the rational allocation of land 
resources. Farmland should be protected in a down-to-earth way; 
the use of land for other than agricultural purposes must be 
strictly controlled. It is necessary to actively promote 
institutional reform in the use of state-owned land; the state 
is to monopolize the first-grade urban land market, but will 
lift control over and standardize the second-grade land market. 
The system of assessing and making public basic land prices is 
to be established.

  [Text] A provincial armed forces work conference concluded 
in Xian yesterday morning. 
  At the closing session, Major General Wang Zhicheng, 
provincial party committee standing committee member and 
military district commander, delivered a speech in which he 
spoke of strengthening party leadership over the armed forces 
and constantly improving the people's militia reserve forces 
under the new circumstances. 
  The closing session was presided over by Cheng Andong, 
provincial party committee standing committee member, Xian City 
CPC Committee secretary, and Xian Military Subarea CPC Committee 
first secretary. 
  In his speech, Commander Wang Zhicheng stated: It is one of 
the fine traditions of the CPC and the People's Liberation Army 
to ensure strong party leadership over armed forces, this being 
also an important task assigned to the local party committees 
and people's governments by the CPC Central Committee and the 
Central Military Commission. Placing the armed forces under 
party leadership is also a fundamental guarantee of successfully 
handling new situations and new problems in the course of the 
people's militia reserve forces development and of building 
stronger national defense reserve forces under market economic 
conditions. 
  Commander Wang Zhicheng expressed the hope that leaders at 
all levels across the province will show concern for and 
effectively manage armed forces, actively support and build the 
armed forces, and make important contributions to the armed 
forces development. In the meantime, he said leading organs and 
people's armed forces departments at all levels across the 
province should organize and mobilize people's militia reserve 
forces personnel to cultivate a spirit of selfless devotion and 
actively promote two civilizations building in local areas. 
  Also attending yesterday's closing session were provincial 
and Xian City leaders, city district and county party committees 
secretaries, county magistrates, and others.

  [Text] Xian, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists say 
that northwest China's Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin, despite its 
vast area of dry land, is holding rich water resources. 
  A research team, headed by senior geologist Huang Zhongxin, 
under the Changqing oil-prospecting administration of the basin 
came to the conclusion based on a systematic study of a large 
amount of hydrogeological materials and other related 
information amassed over the past four decades. 
  According to them, the basin has a water-bearing area of 
144,000 sq [square] km, with total reserves of 11,400 billion cu 
m [cubic meters], of which, 6,960 billion cu m are fresh water. 
This is equivalent to 267 times the volume of China's largest 
freshwater lake, Poyang Lake, in east China's Jiangxi Province. 
  Most of the water-bearing strata lie 500 m to 600 m below 
the 
surface, but some of them, especially in Shaanxi Province, are 
no more than 100 m below the surface. 
  The scientists believe that the development of such rich 
water resources will not affect oil and natural gas prospecting 
work in the basin. 
  They add that the exploration of the water resources will 
play an important role in helping solve the problem of 
industrial and drinking water supply and underground flooding of 
oilfields in the area.

  [Text] Xian, March 24 (XINHUA) -- Peasants in northwest 
China's Shaanxi Province have benefited from developing a 
diversified economy. 
  Last year, the growing of economic crops, vegetables and 
fruit, and animal husbandry helped local farmers increase per 
capita income by 347 yuan, a 53 percent rise. 
  The provincial government has announced preferential 
policies 
and provided funds for farmers to develop a diversified economy. 
  More than 40 diversified economy projects in rural areas 
have 
been designated as key ones to receive favorable policies in 
funds and materials. 
  The planting area of apple trees was increased from 193,000 
ha in 1990 to 339,000 ha. Last year, with an annual output of 
300,000 tons to 1.31 million tons. 
  Vegetable areas were increased by 66,600 ha. 
  In 1993 some 15 of the key projects produced a total income 
of nearly six billion yuan (about 700 million U.S. dollars) for 
the local peasants. 
  Commodity production bases of chicken, pork, vegetables, 
pears, edible oil, apples, tobacco, mushrooms and dates have 
emerged in various localities. 
  At the same time, the province attaches importance to 
developing cold-storage, processing, packaging and 
transportation facilities.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jin Ruiyong (6855 3843 8673): "The Second </F>
Session of the Eighth Regional People's Congress Opens" ] 
  [Text] Over 500 people's deputies from the south to the 
north of Tian Shan, laden with the expectations of the people of 
all nationalities, congregated at the Xinjiang People's Hall 
yesterday morning to raise the curtains for the second session 
of the eighth regional people's congress, with reform, 
development, and stability as the theme. 
  Permanent Presidium Chairman Amudun Niyaz served as the 
executive chairman. Other permanent presidium chairmen who also 
served as executive chairmen and were seated in the front row on 
the rostrum were Song Hanliang, Tomur Dawamat, Xie Fuping, 
Herdebai, Yusufu Muhanmode, Turbayim, Xu Peng, Ma Cunliang [7456 
1317 0081], Xie Hong, Hu-ji-han Ha-ke-mo-fu [5170 0679 3352 0761 
0344 5459 1133], A-mi-na A-pa-er [7093 4717 1226 7093 1584 
1422], and Maimaiti Ismail. 
  At 0830 after the national anthem was played, Amudun Niyaz 
declared the session open. Entrusted by the regional people's 
government, Acting Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti delivered a 
report on the government's work. 
  In the report, Abulaiti Abudurexiti first reviewed the work 
in 1993. He said: Last year, Xinjiang achieved notable results 
in reform and opening up, economic construction, and work in 
other fields of endeavor. We reaped bumper harvests in 
agriculture and animal husbandry for the 16th year in a row; 
achieved sustained growth in industrial and transport 
production; made advances in capital construction, mainly in 
infrastructure and basic industries; expanded economic relations 
and trade with foreign countries; accelerated the pace of 
reforming the economic structure; developed science and 
technology, education, culture, public health, sports, and other 
social undertakings in an all-round manner; and maintained and 
safeguarded the sound social and political environment. However, 
we also saw problems in our economic development, such as the 
lack of stamina for further development of agriculture, slow 
readjustment of industrial production and product mix, failure 
to fulfill the targeted growth rate, high price rises, financial 
strains, and slow transformation of government functions. 
  In light of the problems, Abulaiti Abudurexiti set forth the 
future tasks in the following two fields: striving to develop 
the regional economy with high speed and efficiency, and 
persisting in "grasping the two links at the same time" for 
promoting all-round social progress. For the former, the tasks 
are: accelerating the development of agriculture and rural 
economy to increase incomes of peasants and herdsmen; promoting 
industrial and transport production and raising economic 
efficiency in all fields; strengthening infrastructure and the 
construction of basic industries to build up stamina for further 
development; energetically cultivating the market system; 
promoting fiscal and taxation reforms; opening up Xinjiang wider 
to the outside world; increasing foreign trade by a bigger 
margin; accelerating advances in science, technology, and 
education to promote economic development; doing everything 
possible to raise the standards of living and solve practical 
problems for the masses; and revitalizing the Xinjiang 
Production and Construction Corps by utilizing its merits. For 
the latter, the tasks are: continuing to ensure stability to 
create sound social milieus for reform and development; 
intensifying the construction of spiritual civilization and 
fostering a forward-looking mentality; actively and yet 
prudently advancing the reform of political system; further 
emancipating the minds; and striving to improve work style. 
  In the concluding part of his report, Abulaiti Abudurexiti 
said: This year will be crucial for promoting reform in all 
fields in Xinjiang, and we are facing arduous but glorious 
tasks. We must earnestly implement the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Sixth 
Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fourth Xinjiang Regional CPC 
Committee; and, based on Xinjiang's advantages, seize the 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up Xinjiang wider to the 
outside world, and develop the regional economy through 
readjusting structure and improving efficiency. Meanwhile, we 
should adhere to the party's basic line, unite and rely on the 
people of all nationalities, work with one heart and one mind to 
resolutely pioneer reforms, and strive to establish a socialist 
market economic structure and developing Xinjiang's economy with 
fast speech and high efficiency. 
  The session also heard reports by Su Yongguang, chairman of 
the regional planning commission, on the implementation of the 
1993 plan for regional economic and social plan and the 1994 
plan (draft); and by Gong Jinniu, director of the regional 
Finance Department, on the implementation of the 1993 regional 
budget and the 1994 draft budget. 
  Other officials seated on the rostrum at yesterday's opening 
were Janabil, Wang Lequan, Keyum Bawudun, Guo Gang, Zhou Guofu, 
Hailiqiemu Silamu, Li Fengzi, Abdurehim Amiti, Wang Yousan, 
Wu-fu-er A-bu-du-la [0710 3940 1422 7093 0008 6757 2139], Li 
Donghui, Aisihaiti Kelimubai, Zhang Heng, Mijiti Nasier, Feng 
Dazhen, Yiblayan Rouzi, Mao Dehua, Di-ya-er Ku-ma-shi [6611 7161 
1422 1655 7456 0087], Wen Kexiao, Wang Shizhen, Han Youwen, 
Su-lai-yi-man [5685 0171 5902 2581], Sha Ming, A-rong-han-a-ji 
[7093 2837 3063 7093 0679], Pa-xia Yi-xia [1584 1115 0181 1115], 
Rouzi Wushouer, and Ismail Mahsut. 
  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference regional 
committee members attending its second session, and some 
component members of the regional people's government observed 
the opening session.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Dehua (2621 1795 5478): "Quickening </F>
High-Efficiency Development Is Very Key to Ensuring Xinjiang's 
Long- Term Stability--An Interview With Abulaiti, the New 
Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--"Quickening 
the high-efficiency development of the economy is the very key 
to ensuring Xinjiang's long-term stability," said Abulaiti, the 
new chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region who was 
attending the second session of the Eighth NPC as a nonvoting 
member in Beijing, when he talked about the economy in an 
interview with this staff reporter. 
  Chairman Abulaiti, 51, appeared to be ebullient as he 
talked. 
He said: Xinjiang accounts for one sixth of China's total 
territory. It is approximately 16 times the size of Zhejiang or 
is the size of the other four northwestern provinces and regions 
together. It has a population of 16 million, of whom nearly 10 
million are minority nationalities. Xinjiang's poverty-stricken 
areas are mostly in the minority nationality-inhabited 
prefectures and autonomous prefectures of Kashi, Hotan, Kizil, 
and Aksu in southern Xinjiang. It is very rare across the 
country that poverty-stricken areas are as concentrated as they 
are. 
  Abulaiti clearly told this reporter: Last year, Xinjiang's 
GNP increased by 4.5 percentage points less than the national 
average and its industrial output value increased by 12 
percentage points less than the national average. In recent 
years, the gap of people's living standards between Xinjiang and 
the national average has become increasingly wide. The main 
reason is Xinjiang's poor infrastructure. 
  Despite State help to Xinjiang in various aspects over the 
past 40 years or more, Xinjiang's infrastructural development 
has long lagged behind, limited by various objective conditions. 
In light of remarks made by Deng Xiaoping during his tour of 
southern China, the State has formulated the policy of opening 
up border areas. But due to Xinjiang's poor infrastructure, 
problems regarding its development are still very prominent. On 
an inspection tour in Xinjiang last year, State Council Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji remarked: "The Lanzhou-Xinjiang double-track 
railway project, which is now being built, has come at least 
five years later than it should have." His understanding has a 
profound meaning. 
  Abulaiti said: In order to enable Xinjiang to reach a 
comparatively comfortable standard with the rest of the country 
by the end of this century, with State help Xinjiang's 
infrastructural development has already grown some. In the 
Eighth and Ninth Five- Year Plans, a number of key and 
development projects will be completed and initiated. In the 
meantime, Xinjiang also hopes that the Korla-Kashi extension 
project on the southern Xinjiang railway and the project on 
diverting water from northern Xinjiang to southern Xinjiang will 
be initiated as soon as possible to guarantee that Xinjiang 
makes headway in its national economy. 
  Abulaiti said frankly that without these infrastructural 
projects as a guarantee, Xinjiang's advantage in resources 
cannot be properly utilized nor can Xinjiang change the passive 
situation in which it has to aid poverty-stricken areas every 
year. 
  At present, Xinjiang is having increasingly closer ties with 
the country's overall development, especially in petroleum, the 
chemical industry, nonferrous metals, cotton, and other bulk 
commodities, and is playing a more important role in the 
country's economic field. As China is gaining in national 
strength, it is extremely urgent that the State's strategy for 
the development of western China be implemented as soon as 
possible and that Xinjiang's infrastructural development be 
further strengthened. 
  Abulaiti stressed that if development proceeds in this way, 
the gap between Xinjiang and the mainland proper will naturally 
narrow, and Xinjiang's contribution to the country will become 
more outstanding, people will live and work contentedly, the 
various nationalities will become much more united, and there 
will be a guarantee for the long-term stability of society.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video by station correspondents </F>
Guo Yueling and Mu Huchun; from the "Xinjiang News" program -- 
passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] On 13 March, the Xinjiang delegation to the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held a 
plenary session at the Xinjiang Room in the Great Hall of the 
People to deliberate Premier Li Peng's government work report. 
Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee; and 
Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the 
State Nationalities Affairs Commission; attended the session. 
During the deliberation, deputies from Xinjiang put forward 
many constructive opinions on the government work report. 
  Abulaiti Amururexiti, who is attending the NPC session as a 
non- voting member of the delegation, says: "I endorse the 
premier's work, which I believe is realistic and conforms with 
the facts. Since the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the 
Chinese people of all nationalities, led by the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, have 
conscientiously implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, and have comprehensively implemented the guidelines 
of the 14th CPC National Congress in seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, and accelerating development. The party 
Central Committee has adopted macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures to promptly solve problems and contradictions 
cropping up in the course of advance, thereby scoring remarkable 
achievements, facilitating a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy, and achieving heartening 
results in all fields of endeavor. 
  Discussing the rapid growth of the national economy, the 
report points out: In 1993, the gross national product grew 
13.4 percent to exceed 3,000 billion yuan; agriculture 
registered another year of bumper harvests with a 10 percent 
increase in total output value, including an all- time-high 
record in grain output; village and township enterprises 
continued to expand rapidly at a rate of 11.3 percent; gross 
industrial output value rose 21.1 percent; and new advances were 
made in reform and opening up. In line with the requirements 
for the establishment of a socialist market economy, efforts 
were made to continue to promote reform in various fields. 
  Along with the development of state and collective economic 
sectors, individual and private economic sectors and 
foreign-funded enterprises grew continuously. Commodity prices 
were further rationalized. Programs for reforming the fiscal 
and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems 
were drawn up and implemented. Foreign trade developed in an 
all-round way, and the volume of exports and imports was up 18.2 
percent from 1992. Further progress was made in all social 
undertakings; and the living standards showed continuous 
improvement. In short, we achieved remarkable successes in 
reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. Economic 
prosperity, political stability, national unity, and social 
progress prevailed in the country; and the work in all fields 
took on an entirely new look. While affirming the work of last 
year, the report also realistically and earnestly sums up 
shortcomings and defects in the work of various fields, as well 
as outstanding problems and contradictions in the course of 
advance." 
  Wang Lequan says: "The party Central Committee and the State 
Council will soon introduce a number of major reform programs. 
Last September Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, along with some senior 
officials of the relevant government departments, made a special 
trip to Xinjiang to (?explain measures) for reforming the fiscal 
and taxation system. While in Xinjiang, they inspected work and 
held office at the grass roots to listen to opinions of the 
masses and helped Xinjiang solve many problems. Following 
intensive preparations last year, the new fiscal and taxation 
system took effect on 1 January this year. Judging from the 
implementation of the new tax system in the first two months of 
this year, the situation in Xinjiang as a whole is good. The 
current tax reform is a reform of fundamental nature and 
involves complex work. However, we completed thorough 
preparations and (?coordinated all departments concerned) within 
a short period of time. Therefore, the implementation of the 
new tax system in Xinjiang in the first two months was smooth 
without any problem. Xinjiang's tax revenue in January totaled 
460 million yuan, a record figure. Last year, the financial 
revenue increased by a big margin, which mainly derived from the 
increase in tax revenue; and the highest monthly income was 430 
million yuan. This year, the January revenue was 460 million 
yuan. The financial situation [words indistinct]. Xinjiang's 
financial revenue in January increased 170 billion yuan, which 
represented a 46 percent increase from last year [word 
indistinct]. Therefore, we may as well say the implementation 
of the new tax system is smooth."

  [Text] Urumqi, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Construction for three 
main railways in Xinjiang has entered a crucial stage. The 
railways are the double-tracking of the Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway, 
the Northern Xinjiang Railway and Southern Xinjiang Railway. 
  With financial allocations from the central government, and 
investment from Gansu Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region, workers have so far completed 600 km of double-tracking 
on the Lanzhou-Urumqi line, of which 200 km has already been put 
into operation. 
  The double-track railway line, with a length of 1,622 km, is 
expected to be completed and put into use this September, said 
the officials. 
  The railway line in northern Xinjiang, as an important part 
of the second Eurasian continental bridge, has entered the final 
stage of construction and will soon be put into operation. 
  Construction of the railway line in southern Xinjiang, which 
is designed to transport oil out of the Tarim Basin and to 
promote the local economy, started late last year. It will take 
three years to complete building of this railway line, with a 
length of about 1,000 km. 
  At the same time, nine major highways, which have a total 
length of over 3,000 km and were jointly invested in by the 
central government and different localities in northwest China, 
were completed and put into operation last year. 
  Meanwhile, a border highway linking 14 outlets on the 5,400 
km border in northwest China, and 23 highways extending to 
neighboring countries for transportation of goods and passengers 
have been completed and put into use. 
  The building or rebuilding of a dozen airports in Xinjiang, 
which will require a total investment of about two billion yuan 
from the central government and different localities, have all 
started. 
  Local officials said the projects will finish construction 
and become operational over the coming two years. 
  The laying of several optical telecommunication cables in 
northwest China, with a total length of 3,200 km, has been 
speeded up. When completed, they will link up with optical 
fiber cable systems in 13 west Asian and European countries and 
other optical cable systems in China. 
  A digital hyperfrequency wave transmission line has been put 
into operation since last year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that China places great importance on the 
growth of its friendly relations and cooperation with the 
Republic of Korea (ROK). 
  Meeting with ROK President Kim Yong-sam at the Diaoyutai 
State Guest House this evening Li said that President Kim had 
come to visit China just a year after taking office, which 
demonstrated that the president highly valued the development of 
ROK-China ties. 
  He said that though the two countries established diplomatic 
ties not long ago, their relationship has developed rapidly due 
to the common efforts. Personnel exchanges have increased 
rapidly while bilateral economic cooperation has expanded 
continually, he added. 
  Developing the good-neighborly ties between the two 
countries 
will conform to the aspirations and fundamental interests of the 
two peoples, he said. 
  Kim said he was satisfied with his fruitful talks with 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and pleased to have the chance to 
meet with Premier Li. 
  Noting that the ROK and China have enjoyed long traditional 
relations, he said there is great potential for furthering 
bilateral economic ties and trade. 
  Kim said that the ROK encourages its enterprises to invest 
more in China. As long as the two sides strengthen cooperation, 
the future for such relationship will be brighter, he said. 
  Talking about the situation on the Korean peninsula, Li said 
that China pays great attention to having a good surrounding 
environment. 
  Therefore, he said, China hopes that the Korean peninsula 
will maintain a peaceful and stable situation. This, he 
continued, conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese 
people and the people of the north and the south of the Korean 
peninsula as well. 
  The Chinese premier said there had been some progress 
recently on solving the nuclear issue concerning the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea. But now there appeared difficulties 
and twists. 
  Of course, he said, it needs time to accomplish anything. As 
long as the parties concerned conduct dialogue patiently, 
finally a way to solve this issue properly can be found. 
  It was just like erecting a bridge to cross a river. One 
needs to create a good atmosphere and an environment of 
relaxation in order to resume the dialogue among the four 
parties, he said. 
  Kim said he agreed with Li Peng's view on the settlement of 
the nuclear issue through negotiations. 
  He said it is the most effective way to conduct sincere and 
direct dialogue between the parties involved in the issue. It 
is the ROK's hope that such dialogue will be resumed, so as to 
find a proper solution to the issue. 
  During the meeting, Kim invited Li to visit the ROK at a 
time 
convenient to the premier. Li expressed thanks and accepted the 
invitation with pleasure. 
  Li Peng's wife and Kim's wife attended the meeting. 
  Also participating in the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen; Wang Zhongyu, minister in 
charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission Wu Jichuan, 
chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and 
minister of posts and communications; as well as Yun Tong-yun, 
ROK minister of telecommunications and posts; Kim Chol-su, 
minister of trade, industry, and energy; Kim Si-chung, minister 
of science and techology; and others. 
  After the meeting, Li Peng and his wife gave a dinner in 
honor of Kim and his wife and their party.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Tuesday he returns home confident that peace and stability 
can be maintained on the Korean peninusla. 
  Kim made the remarks to South Korean correspondents 
stationed 
here at Diaoyutai Guest House, where he stayed in Beijing, 
before winding up his five-day visit to China. 
  He said, "I have a firm belief that we can defeat North 
Korea 
without any fighting and confidence that we can maintain peace 
and stability on the Korean peninsula." 
  He said he had told President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese 
leaders the details of his government's position on North Korea. 
  "I confirmed to the Chinese leaders that South Korea has 
never had any intention to absorb the North or isloate it. 
Rather, I told them we have a strong will to support the North 
Korean position in international society and help it." 
  "We should take the posture," he emphasized, "of playing an 
important role as a member of the international community. And 
the world is not in a position to make a decision without 
consulting South Korea." 
  Kim told the correspondents that South Korea must cooperate 
with major countries around the Korean peninsula including the 
United States, Japan, China and Russia in order to maintain 
peace and stability. 
  Foreign Minister Han will visit Russia early next month 
after 
visiting the United States and Japan to discuss security on the 
Korean peninsula, President Kim said. 
  While explaining his talks with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin, Kim said that Beijing places great weight not only on the 
North Korean nuclear problem but also on peace and stability on 
the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia. 
  Kim said he had the impression that Jiang believed 
responsible talks between the top leaders of South and North 
Korea are important for the resolution of all problems. 
  Kim thus hinted that China will play a strong role in 
efforts 
to realize an inter-Korean summit. 
  With regard to the Chinese president's visit to Korea, Kim 
said he believed Jiang will come, possibly in the second half of 
this year. 
  Commenting on economic cooperation in the Northeast Asian 
region, Kim said he thinks that South Korean-Chinese economic 
links will proceed rapidly. 
  "I was able to confirm that China has as strong a desire for 
economic cooperation as we have," Kim said. 
  Kim is to arrive in Seoul later in the day.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Hong: "Beijing, Seoul on Path to </F>
Friendship"] 
  [Text] The Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam's trip 
to China this week marks another major milestone in a 
relationship still in its infant stage, just 19 months old. 
  Although close neighbours in Asia, China and ROK remained 
distant from each other over four decades for complicated 
historical reasons. 
  When the two regional powers agreed to open diplomatic links 
in 1992, the world responded with great enthusiasm. 
  The international community believed that the establishment 
of Sino-ROK ties has closed another chapter of Cold War 
hostility and paved the way for regional prosperity. 
  World affairs observers noted that it has also had a 
positive 
impact on peace and stability in Northeast Asia. 
  On the part of China and ROK, the new relationship has 
started an era of contacts and opened wide prospects for 
co-operation between the two countries, especially in trade and 
investment. 
  Present Sino-ROK relations can be characterized by steady 
growth, frequent exchange of visits at all levels and 
substantive two-way trade. 
  Following the establishment of diplomatic ties between the 
two nations, a host of top ROK officials toured China. Only one 
month into the new era, then ROK President No Tae-u made an 
historic visit to Beijing. The latest senior ROK official in 
China was Yi Man-sop, speaker of the National Assembly, who 
visited Beijing earlier this year as the guest of China's 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. 
  In return, senior Chinese leaders also have paid official 
visits to Seoul. They included Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Tian Jiyun, 
Vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. 
  Leaders of the two countries believe that friendly Sino-ROK 
relations have suited the fundamental interests of the two 
peoples and could also help peace and stability in Northeast 
Asia and the continent at large. 
  Apparent political significance aside, China and ROK benefit 
a great deal from their fresh ties in terms of trade. 
  When Vice-Premier Li Lanqing toured Seoul last year, ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam told him that the two countries have 
complementary economies and their co-operation has great 
potential. 
  Kim's view has been shared by Li and other senior Chinese. 
leaders. Increasingly, ROK is betting its economic future on 
China's booming market as they become two of Asia's most crucial 
trading partners. 
  China has emerged as ROK's third-largest trading partner 
after the United States and Japan, with their trade doubling 
last year to $8.3 billion. 
  Analysts predict the volume will grow 33.2 percent annually, 
to $28 billion by 1997. 
  Presently, Sino-ROK co-operation is expanding from trade 
links into investment and technical fields. 
  China is the top counts for investment among many ROK firms. 
Accumulated investment in China is expected to quadruple from $1 
billion, on an approval basis, at the end of 1993 to $4 billion 
by 1997. A researcher with a top Seoul think-tank was recently 
quoted as saying that China is an opportunity for ROK, which 
faces increasing difficulties abroad, caught in between advanced 
and developing nations. 
  Kim Yong-sam's visit, which began on Saturday, is seen as an 
opportunity to invigorate industrial ties between the two 
economies. 
  Leaders of the two countries have expressed their 
satisfaction over growing relations between Beijing and Seoul. 
They agreed to build stronger links, in particular closer trade 
and economic ties. 
  When No Tae-u was in Beijing, the two governments signed a 
package of agreements on the promotion of bilateral trade and 
the protection of investment. 
  The agreements served as a solid legal foundation for 
further 
growth in bilateral co-operations. 
  When Kim is in town this time, another major investment 
protection document, on avoidance of double taxation, is 
expected to be hammered down.

<F P=106> ["Korean Ambassador Raps U.S. Over Missiles, War Games" -- </F>
XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Vienna, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Korea's top diplomat 
in Austria today criticized the United States for planning to 
deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea and reschedule the 
controversial annual "Team Spirit" military exercises with South 
Korea. 
  There is "great possibility" that a war will break out in 
the 
Korean peninsula if the U.S. deploys Patriot missiles in South 
Korea and the U.S. and South Korea resume the military 
exercises, said Kim Kwang-sop, ambassador of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to Austria. 
  In a statement published by the AUSTRIAN PRESS AGENCY, Kim 
also refuted Western allegations that the DPRK is making 
preparations for war. 
  "The threat is from the South (South Korea), not from the 
North (the DPRK)," he said. 
  The DPRK, which is strong enough to defend itself and 
advocates the settlement of conflicts through peaceful means, is 
not planning a war, he noted. 
  The ambassador said the DPRK is capable of making missiles, 
but is not engaged in the production of nuclear weapons. 
  Kim's remarks came amid mounting tension between the DPRK on 
the one hand and the U.S. and South Korea on the other over the 
issue of nuclear materials in the Korean peninsula. 
  Earlier this month, the Vienna-based International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) said it still could not prove whether the 
DPRK has fissionable nuclear materials after an IAEA team 
inspected some nuclear sites in the country. 
  The IAEA's board of directors, accusing the DPRK of barring 
the inspection team from visiting a radioactive chemical 
laboratory in Yongbyon, said the agency hopes to send experts to 
the DPRK again for further inspection of the nuclear sites. 
  The DPRK has repeatedly argued its nuclear facilities are 
for 
peaceful purposes only. 
  To apply pressure, U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered 
Patriot missiles sent to South Korea. U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher has said he would discuss with South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu the scheduling of joint U.S.-South 
Korean military exercises. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry 
said that "the door is still open" to high-level U.S.-DPRK 
talks, but only if the DPRK meets two conditions -- permitting 
the inspections and reopening discussions with South Korea about 
making the peninsula nuclear-free. 
  But the DPRK ambassador said that any further IAEA 
inspections are conditioned on resumption of high-level 
U.S.-DPRK talks. 
  Commenting on the IAEA's dissatisfaction over the 
inspections, Kim said the DPRK had given the IAEA an opportunity 
to prove that the country did not possess materials for making 
nuclear weapons and that all relevant agreements had been 
observed. 
  Thus, the issues raised by the IAEA are "unnecessary," he 
said in the statement.

"Korean Peninsula Needs Peace and Stability"] 
  [Text] The visit of ROK President Kim Yong-sam to China is 
an important event in the relations between the two countries. 
Both countries are ancient countries, and traditional relations 
go back several thousands years. After the war, for various 
reasons, the two countries discontinued exchanges for a long 
period and official diplomatic relations were only established 
recently. In recent years, with the common efforts of both 
sides, PRC-ROK relations have developed rapidly and the scope of 
exchanges and cooperation has become more and more extensive. 
China has become the third biggest trading partner of the ROK, 
and the ROK is also the sixth biggest trading partner for China. 
Last year, the volume of trade between the two countries 
amounted to $11 billion. ROK investment in China is nearly $1 
billion. China is one of the countries in which the ROK has 
made the greatest investment. All this has laid a very good 
foundation for further developing friendly relations and 
mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the two 
countries. Friendship and cooperation between China and the ROK 
are conducive to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region and to 
world peace. 
<H5>  Crisis Can Only Be Resolved Through Talks </H5>
  President Kim Yong-sam has come to China at a time when the 
situation on the Korean peninsula is extremely tense, and the 
stances of the two countries on resolving the crisis on the 
Korean peninsula has naturally attracted the world's attention. 
Chinese leaders have clearly pointed out that the Chinese 
Government sincerely hopes that the Korean peninsula can 
maintain long-term peace and stability and that they support the 
idea of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. China 
does not favor the deployment, production, or research of any 
nuclear weapons either on the northern or southern side of the 
Korean peninsula. China holds that without peace and stability 
on the Korean peninsula, there cannot be real peace and 
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The controversial nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula at present should be appropriately 
resolved through dialogue between the DPRK, the ROK, the United 
States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 
addition, this kind of dialogue requires patience. 
  For some time, many countries have issued appeals hoping 
that 
China can play a part in resolving the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula. President Kim Yong-sam has expressed the same 
hope. This is understandable because China and the DPRK are 
close neighbors and the two countries have maintained friendly 
relations of cooperation. China has indeed made energetic 
efforts to do what she can in this respect. However, China and 
the DPRK are two independent sovereign countries after all. 
China does not have any nuclear cooperation with the DPRK. How 
to deal with and handle the nuclear issue can only be analyzed, 
assessed, and decided by the DPRK herself. Therefore, China's 
role is limited. 
<H5>  Threats Are Futile </H5>
  For the sake of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula 
and to create a favorable atmosphere for dialogue and talks, 
China is opposed to displays of force and the use of threats. 
People are aware that the sudden emergence of a tense situation 
on the Korean peninsula is entirely the result of some 
countries' vain attempts to exert pressure. The United States 
has announced the dispatch of "Patriot" missiles to the ROK, 
Japan wanted to draw up "economic sanctions" against the DPRK, 
and the ROK announced a "special state of alert" for the three 
armed services of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Under 
such circumstances, threatening words from both sides have also 
gradually escalated. The DPRK side has said that if war breaks 
out, Seoul will become "a sea of fire," and the ROK side 
asserted that it would "take advantage of the opportunity of the 
north's provocation to reunify the entire peninsula." This can 
only aggravate confrontation between the two sides. 
  What is gratifying is that during recent talks with Chinese 
leaders, President Kim Yong-sam said that "the ROK also hopes to 
settle the nuclear issue through dialogue and talks and does not 
wish to exert pressure." At the same time, according to 
information from the DPRK side, "the DPRK is ready to accept a 
new round of investigations by people from abroad of her nuclear 
facilities." These are undoubtedly positive developments in the 
state of affairs and a step in the right direction.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 27 (XINHUA) -- Investment from the 
Republic of Korea (ROK) in north China's port city of Tianjin 
has kept going up in recent years. 
  Some 275 enterprises with ROK's investment have been set up 
in the city since 1992. The ROK investors have put in 260 
million U.S. dollars in these enterprises. 
  The firms are mainly engaged in industry, agriculture, 
construction, real estate, transport and services. The greatest 
number -- some 212 of them -- are in industrial production and 
have made good profits. 
  The Tianjin Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., a joint venture to 
produce video-corders, funded by Tianjin Telecommunication and 
Broadcasting Company and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd of the ROK, 
went into production in October last year. Its video-corders 
are the first from China to enter the international market, and 
the company plans to export 120,000 video-corders this year. 
  In the Tianjin economic and technological development zone, 
an 1,156,000 sq m site has been leased to ROK investors for 50 
years. Land leveling is expected to be finished next year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (CNS)--The Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China said today that a representative office 
of the bank had been established in Seoul. Now that the bank 
has offices in Singapore, Alma Ata and Seoul, it is planned to 
set up branches or representative offices in Hong Kong, New 
York, Tokyo and London within this year. 
  The bank has been dealing in foreign exchange business for 
ten years with its total foreign exchange capital being U.S.$10 
billion and savings deposits of U.S.$7.3 billion and outstanding 
loans of U.S.$5.7 billion by the end of last year. The bank 
settled international accounts of U.S.$134 billion last year. 
  The bank now has interbank relations with nearly 2,000 
branches of 260 overseas banks. According to a listing by an 
authoritative British financial magazine, of the 1,000 biggest 
banks in the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 
ranked 13th in terms of its total capital. 
  Vice President of the bank, Mr. Liu Tinghuan, said that the 
bank had place special emphasis on cooperation with the banking 
sector in South Korea by setting up representative bank 
relations with 15 banks in South Korea. In 1993 alone, the bank 
had settled international accounts with South Korean banks to 
the sum of U.S.$200 millon. The bank has also furnished loans 
to Sino-South Korean joint-funded enterprises and solely South 
Korean-funded enterprises in China.

  [Text] Washington, March 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry said here today there is no sense of 
imminent military crisis in the Korean peninsula. 
  "In my judgment," Perry said at a Pentagon news briefing, 
"there is no military crisis at this point between the United 
States and South Korea on one hand and North Korea on the other 
hand." 
  He described the political situation in the Korean peninsula 
as "a very serious problem." "But we are pursuing that not with 
military options but with diplomatic options," Perry added. 
  However, he claimed that "we will make and are making 
prudent 
and appropriate defensive precautions, but we will do them in a 
careful way." 
  The United States has decided to move forward the deployment 
date of Patriot missiles in South Korea. The Patriots will be 
in South Korea and deployed in about a month. 
  "Our rationale for moving the timing up was not because we 
thought there was an imminent danger," Perry explained, "but 
because we were concerned that with the way the political 
developments were going and that there might be a confrontation 
point or a crisis point later in the year." 
  The secretary said the United States is monitoring this 
situation very carefully and consulting extensively with South 
Korea about any defensive measures needed. 
  "If and when the United Nations decides to authorize 
sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 
Perry claimed, "at that time we will certainly want to increase 
the defensive measures." 
  Perry announced that he will travel to South Korea next 
month 
to discuss "a number of short-term measures" that are being 
taken to improve the readiness of the 34,000 U.S. forces 
stationed in South Korea.

"Kim Yong-sam Will Play `Economic Card' During China Visit"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong 25 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Just as 
the mainland market is expanding opening up and with Sino-ROK 
ties in economic relations and trade growing increasingly close 
over the past few years, ROK President Kim Yong-sam has decided 
to accept an invitation and pay an official visit to China on 26 
March. It is expected that during his current three or five-day 
visit to Mainland China, Kim Yong-sam will go all out to seek 
the expansion of ROK-PRC cooperation in economic relations and 
trade to remove the barrier of strong competition overseas and 
open up a new way to revitalize the ROK economy. 
  As one of the "four little tigers" of Asia, ROK has enjoyed 
fast development of its economy and trade in recent years, and 
its volume of foreign trade ranks 13th in the world, ahead of 
Taiwan. However, rising wages and land prices at home, and, in 
particular, strong competition from neighbouring countries and 
regions for foreign investment and trade, have already become a 
bottleneck for the ROK's economic development. This being the 
case, how to utilize the great potential of the Mainland China 
market with its rich mineral and labor resources and advanced 
scientific and technological strength and to seek cooperation 
and development is an important strategy for the ROK to develop 
its foreign economic relations and trade in the days to come. 
  On the eve of his China visit, Kim Yong-sam openly stated 
that the ROK and PRC should not become opponents to each other 
in economic competition, but partners. Should the two sides 
allow a marriage between each other's advantages, the two 
countries' international competitiveness will be further 
strengthened. Regarding his concrete concepts, according to a 
foreign report, Kim Yong-sam plans to explore and discuss the 
formation of a common market following the pattern of the 
European Free Trade Association; at the same time, he will 
propose the establishment of an ROK-PRC committee for industrial 
cooperation, with the focus on joint production and development 
in such areas as autos, telecommunications, aerospace, and 
television. 
  Obviously, the aforesaid ROK concepts has taken into 
consideration the comparatively extensive market of Mainland 
China in those fields and the related technologies and 
experience the ROK is in possession of; whereas the Chinese side 
has in urgent need of further breakthroughs and developments in 
autos, electronics, and the aerospace industry in addition to 
having rich resources and cheap labor. We believe that should 
China and the ROK be able to augment cooperation in these 
domains, not only will there be a foundation and certain 
conditions, but sound prospects for development. 
  Presently, there are some 1,000 ROK-funded enterprises in 
Mainland China, with investment approaching $1 billion. This 
year, some large firm are ready to advance toward Mainland China 
with great ambitions. Tristar Electronics plans to invest 
heavily in sophisticated technology, developing resources, and 
aviation-related industries. The Daewoo Auto Company plans to 
cooperate with Changchun No. 1 Auto Manufacturing Plant to set 
up a joint-venture with an investment of $1.5 billion to produce 
parts and small autos, and the Son Yok Group is ready to invest 
$1.5 billion to build an oil refinery in Shenzhen. It is 
expected that the volume of ROK investment in Mainland China 
will grow to some $4 billion. 
  At the same time, increasing trade between the two countries 
will be an important point on the agenda during Kim Yong-sam's 
China visit. In fact, in the 18 months since the two sides 
established diplomatic relations, bilateral trade has developed 
rapidly, and the trade volume last year was already $9.1 
billion, up 50 percent on the previous year. It is expected 
that ROK-PRC bilateral trade will grow by a wide margin. On the 
part of the ROK, it hopes that the volume of ROK-PRC trade will 
grow to $56 billion before the year 2000.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- Chairman Qiao Shi of 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) 
had a 40- minutes discussion with a group of Danish 
parliamentarians on the furtherance of Sino-Danish ties. 
  Briefing the visitors on China's foreign policy, Qiao told 
the visitors that China supports all endeavors conducive to the 
maintenance of world peace and is ready to expand contacts with 
as many countries as possible. 
  Qiao described Sino-Danish ties as "good" and reiterated 
that 
China wants to have still better relations with Denmark on the 
principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences, 
mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit. 
  Qiao also briefed the visitors on the reform and opening up 
in China, particularly the development in Tibet Autonomous 
Region. 
  Peter Duetoft, leader of the visiting group and chairman of 
the foreign policies committee of the Danish parliament, told 
Qiao that the purpose of their visit is to learn about China's 
economic development, which is of significance to Denmark. 
  Denmark wants to see more exchanges between the two 
parliaments and stronger economic ties between the two countries 
because China is a vast market, he said. 
  Earlier today, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian 
Qichen met the visitors and explained China's position on some 
international issues including China's view on the role of the 
United Nations. 
  Qian and the Danish parliamentarians agreed that the two 
sides will make joint efforts for the development of Sino-Danish 
political and economic ties, according to a Chinese official.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- Wei Jianxing, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Secretariat, and secretary of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection spoke at the work style 
rectification forum attended by some ministries and commissions 
of the State Council. He pointed out: rectifying unhealthy 
tendencies in government departments and in various professions 
and trades is one of the three tasks in combating corruption in 
an in-depth, lasting, and effective manner. As it has a direct 
bearing on the personal interests of a vast number of people, on 
the image of the party and government, and on the overall 
situation of reform, development, and stability, all government 
departments, professions, and trades are urged to attach a high 
degree of importance to work style rectification, to consolidate 
work style rectification achievements, to exert greater efforts 
to deepen the work, and to score even better results in work 
style rectification. 
  On 24 and 25 March, Comrade Wei Jianxing presided over the 
work style rectification forum attended by some ministries and 
commissions of the State Council with a view to implementing the 
CPC Central Committee's and the State Council's arrangements for 
combating corruption this year and to studying main issues, 
setting up goals, and adopting necessary measures in this year's 
work style rectification. Attending the forum were responsible 
persons from the Agriculture Ministry, Railways Ministry, Public 
Health Ministry, Construction Ministry, Public Security 
Ministry, Power Industry Ministry, Posts and Telecommunciations 
Ministry; the State Education Commission; the People's Bank of 
China; the General Administration of Customs; the State General 
Administration of Taxation; and the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce. Also attending the meeting were State 
Councillors Li Guixian and Luo Gan; and responsible persons from 
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and from the 
Ministry of Supervision. 
  At the conclusion of the forum, Comrade Wei Jianxing 
stressed: The key for carrying out in-depth work style 
rectification lies in leaders of professions and trades 
attaching importance to the work. Practice has shown that 
leading comrades in party and government departments and in 
professions and trades who personally take charge of the work 
style rectification, who are good at integrating work style 
rectification with reform and administrative tasks in their 
departments, who are skillful at integrating 
clean-administration building with honest performance of 
official duties, always produce good results with work style 
rectification in their departments and in their professions and 
trades; failing that, it will be impossible to achieve 
anticipated goals and the arrangement and the call for work 
style rectification will end up as a haphazard and uninspiring 
one. 
  Comrade Wei Jianxing stressed the need for leading cadres to 
attach importance to work style rectification and to adopt 
proper methods in profoundly carrying out work style 
rectification. He called on all to pay attention to the 
following four areas. First, stress important points and set 
clear and definite goals. He said that as work style 
rectification is a long term task, setting too many and too 
sweeping tasks to be accomplished in one stage should be 
avoided; instead, one should first select one or two important 
issues, then set clear and specific goals, and go on producing 
results in a down-to-earth manner. Second, explore a full set 
of scientific methods for verification. Comrade Wei Jianxing 
pointed out that ideological and political work, corruption 
combating work, and work style rectification are like economic 
work, scientific and technological work, and administrative 
work; they not only require quality analysis but also quantity 
verification; some of the work results may be verified; measures 
to ensure the success of the work and conditions needed to 
accomplish the task may also be verified. If we fail to explore 
a full set of scientific methods, and if we limit ourselves to 
making uninspiring calls and to presenting unimpressive reports, 
then we will be unable to provide suitable guidance in various 
areas of work. Third, show how the policy works. Units which 
do an excellent job in work style rectification must be 
commended and their experience promoted; units failing to 
perform well in work style rectification must be criticized and 
be given time for improvement. Fourth, treat the root cause and 
symptoms of the problems at the same time. To deal with 
problems which have emerged in the course of work style 
rectification, efforts should be increased to raise ideological 
level, to improve administration skills, and to constantly raise 
the working level. 
  Comrade Wei Jianxing called on leading comrades at the CPC 
Central Committee organs to do an even better anticorruption and 
clean-administration building job and to take personal charge of 
work style rectification in their own departments and in their 
professions and trades. To further deepen the nation's work 
style rectification, he also called on them to set specific 
goals; to explore scientific verification methods; to work out 
rational policies; to adopt sound systems; and to employ 
scientific methods.

  [Text] On 13 March at Liaoning hall of the Great Hall of 
the People, the delegation of Liaoning Province participating in 
the second session of the eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] held a plenary meeting to discuss Premier Li Peng's 
government work report in line with the reality of Liaoning. 
  Present at the meeting were Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the 
State Council; Chen Muhua, vice premier of the State Council, 
vice chairman of the NPC standing committee, and chairman of the 
national women's federation; Liu Qi, minister at the Ministry of 
Metallurgical Industry; and leaders of the state departments 
concerned. Quan Shuren, chairman of the provincial people's 
congress standing committee, chaired the meeting. Gu Jinchi, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech ahead 
of others. 
  He said: Premier Li Peng's report is of essential, 
comprehensive, and profound importance and embodies the ideas of 
seeking truth, dealing with concrete matters relating to work, 
doing pioneering work, and making progress. I completely agree 
to it. As for Liaoning, an urgent task for understanding the 
basic guidelines of the report and fulfilling the tasks as set 
forth in the report is to start from the change of the 
managerial mechanism to speed up the enlivening of state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises. This is the key to 
deepening reform, promoting development, and realizing the 
second pioneering work. 
  After that, Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech. He talked 
about the understanding about the report; introduced, in detail, 
to Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and NPC Vice Chairman Chen Muhua the 
province's achievements in reform and opening up made in 1993; 
and reported on the province's problems and difficulties in 
accelerating the setup of the market economy. 
  Deputies (Li Huazhong) and (Bo Xilai) set forth their 
suggestions and viewpoints on how to accelerate the development 
of large and medium-sized enterprises and to promote 
agricultural production and the opening of the province to the 
outside world. 
  Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, finally made 
a 
speech. 
  He said: Today, we mainly want to hear your opinions on the 
report and what methods you have to solve the existing problems, 
to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas, to 
make preparations for the next-step arrangements, and to ensure 
a sound and orderly development of the economy. 
  He said: Last year, Liaoning made better economic 
development and made a big headway in agriculture. Being 
self-sufficient in grain and nonstaple foods was a great 
achievement. Agriculture is the foundation of the national 
economy. Therefore, strengthening the agricultural development 
is of great strategic significance and must be persisted in. 
  He expressed his views on accelerating the transformation of 
large and medium-sized enterprises. He said: I completely 
agreed to your suggestions on conducting technological 
transformation. Liaoning's state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises have a good foundation. So, these enterprises 
should fully be transformed and utilized so as to become 
vigorous. 
  He also stressed: The products produced after technological 
transformation must be marketable. Without marketing channels, 
the products, no matter how good they are, will be of no use.

  [Text] On 12 March, in an interview with this reporter, 
Sun Weiben, head of Heilongjiang Province deputation to the 
second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], 
dwelt on his own opinions on developing the socialist commodity 
economy and building the legal system. 
  He said: The development of the market economy requires the 
strengthening of legislation work and the market economy is 
precisely the economy of the legal system. Without a perfect 
legal system as an guarantee, it is impossible for us to 
establish and develop the market economy. Although a big 
improvement has been effected in the quantity and quality of 
legislation over the past few years, many problems have cropped 
up in the linkage to law enforcement. We have seen a serious 
situation of refusing to observe laws, to enforce laws, and to 
punish law breakers. Many laws, rules, and regulations that are 
urgently needed are still missing. We still lack sufficient 
laws to control some obscene and gambling articles on the 
cultural market. We need legislation to strengthen 
macroeconomic control. Otherwise, we will be unable to ensure 
the demands of socialism and to ensure the balance between total 
supply and total demand. Then, unfair competition and operation 
will emerge. 
  With regard to the methods to resolve the above-mentioned 
problems, Sun Weiben said: We should use the reform spirit to 
strengthen legislation work and organically combine legislation 
work with the process of reform. At the same time, we should 
strengthen the drawing up of local rules and regulations. In 
this regard, we should have foresight and adopt measures in 
advance. We should strengthen the supervision over law 
enforcement. Laws are a mere scrap of paper if they are not 
supervised and enforced. Sun Weiben said: Now, supervision 
over law enforcement is a weak link. To effect a steady and 
rapid development of the socialist market economy, we must 
strengthen supervision in the following three levels: First, 
the supervision by people's congress; second, the supervision by 
media; and third, the supervision by the masses. At the same 
time, we should give full play to the role of people's deputies, 
understand the voice of the masses, pay attention to the work 
concerning the masses in electoral areas, and do tangible deeds 
for the masses.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Cao Min: "Five-Year Plan for New State </F>
Insurance"] 
  [Text] The government plans to bring in a unified social 
insurance system nationwide within the next five years, it was 
announced yesterday. 
  This means all enterprises across the country, regardless of 
ownership, will be covered by the same social insurance 
standards. 
  The move is seen as a major plank in the state's bid to form 
a modern enterprise system and develop the labour market, said 
Labour Ministry spokesman Liu Guanxue. 
  The current social insurance system covers only state-owned 
enterprises and has created a bottleneck in the drive towards a 
socialist market economy. The system is too narrow, its 
management is weak, and it places too heavy a financial burden 
on the government and enterprises, said Liu. 
  China began to set up its labour insurance system in 1951. 
It included pensions, free medical care, and benefits for 
industrial injuries and maternity, based on a planned economy. 
  Only regular workers or staff of state enterprises, units, 
and institutions received retirement pensions--75 percent of his 
or her wage. 
  But the market economy has changed social values and the way 
enterprises are run and the old insurance system is quite 
incompatible with the demands of a freemoving labour force. 
  The changes in the labour system have enabled most 
enterprises to start employing who they want without government 
involvement. 
  But firms remain unable to dismiss redundant personnel under 
the old system, said Liu. 
  The new unified one will help relieve workers' worries and 
let them look for new jobs with more confidence. 
  About 80 million people are covered by pension schemes and 
about 18 million retired workers receive the payments. 
  China first set up unemployment insurance for workers in the 
state-owned enterprises in 1986. Last year, about 900,000 
people were getting unemployment relief--three times the figure 
in 1992. 
  The Labour Ministry is also to speed up reform of wage and 
labour systems in such pilot areas as Shandong and Guangdong 
provinces and 10 major cities this year, said ministry officials.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Lin Ying (2651 7751)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Some 
time ago, the relevant authorities in the Chinese mainland 
publicly incinerated a total of 280 kg of tiger bones and 
rhinoceros horns, both precious Chinese medicinal ingredients, 
in Harbin and Zhanjiang Cities. This was a gesture to show 
China's determination to outlaw the trading in tiger bones, 
rhinoceros horns, and all products containing them, in pursuance 
of the international treaty on the preservation of endangered 
animals. But there is a high economic price to pay on the part 
of the mainland in doing this and the production of a large 
variety of Chinese medicines will be affected for the time being. 
  Tiger bones and rhinoceros horns are fine, natural medicinal 
materials used in traditional Chinese prescriptions and have 
always been expensive. This is why tigers and rhinoceros, both 
wild animals, have been hunted to the brink of extinction. Take 
tigers for example. There used to be eight types of tigers 
throughout the whole world, namely: The Manchurian tiger, the 
South China tiger, the Southeast Asian tiger, the Indian tiger, 
the Siberian tiger, the Sumatran tiger, the Javan tiger, and the 
Bali tiger. But now, three of these are extinct and the 
remaining five types are endangered. For instance, India 
recently published the results of a survey on the Indian tiger, 
which indicate that the population of this tiger species dropped 
from 4,334 in 1989 to 375 at the end of last year. Another 
example is that, according to some findings published by the 
Chinese mainland recently, there are now less than 50 South 
China tigers living in the wild. If things go on this way and 
the countries concerned fail to adopt effective preservation 
measures, it is estimated that these wild animals will be gone 
from the earth by the end of this century. 
  In order to put an end to the hunting of and trading in 
these 
protected wild animals, China has promulgated a series of laws 
and ordinances in recent years, such as the "Law on the 
Protection of Wild Animals," "Implementation of Regulations for 
the Protection of Terrestrial Wild Animals," and "List of 
Wildlife Under Special State Protection." The repeated public 
incinerations of tiger bones and rhinoceros horns in recent 
years were conducted in accordance with the "Convention on 
International Trading of Endangered Wild Life." China signed 
this convention in 1980 and has rigorously honored its 
obligations thereto. According to an estimate, the mainland has 
suffered a total economic loss of as much as 2 billion yuan 
incurred by the ban on trading in tiger bones, rhinoceros horns, 
and products containing them. 
  Because tiger bones and rhinoceros horns are frequently used 
ingredients in traditional Chinese pharmacy, they are very much 
in demand. Therefore, the relevant research institutions on the 
mainland have always devoted a lot of attention to developing 
substitutes for the two materials. They achieved initial 
results toward the end of last year. Of all the findings, the 
research on tiger bone substitutes has been quite fruitful. The 
bones of the "sailong [1049 7127]," a burrowing animal which 
inhabits the Qinghai Plateau in large quantities, are an ideal 
substitute for tiger bones. Clinical research indicates that 
sailong bones have the functions of dispersing cold and 
relieving pain; relaxing muscles and tendons and activating the 
flow of vital energy and blood in the channels and collaterals; 
strengthening the muscles and bones; and enhancing the 
resistance of the human body. They are no less effective than 
tiger bones in treating inflammation, killing pain, and healing 
fractures and bone injuries. This achievement has attracted 
much attention from pharmaceutical industries around the world. 
Besides, the mainland researchers have also successfully 
synthesized rhinoceros horns, bear gallbladders, musk, and cow 
gallstones. They have also experimented on obtaining bile from 
live bears and turned it into natural bear bile powder for 
clinical and pharmaceutical use. 
  Hosking [huo si jin 7202 2448 6855], chairman of the 
standing 
committee of the "Convention on International Trading of 
Endangered Wild Life," who recently visited mainland China, 
pointed out: China has made outstanding achievements in 
protecting endangered wildlife and developing substitutes for 
them.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- China is making good 
efforts in applying satellite technology in a bid to meet the 
needs of economic, scientific, technological and cultural 
progress. 
  Chinese scientists are stepping up research into and 
manufacturing of large-capacity and long-life telecommunications 
and broadcasting satellites, versatile meteorological satellites 
and multi-purpose satellites. 
  Among them, the "Dongfanghong No. 3" telecommunications 
satellite and "Fengyun No. 2" meteorological satellite will soon 
go into operation. 
  The "Dongfanghong No.3" is equipped with 24 transponders and 
has a designed life of eight years. That means that the 
satellite will serve beyond the year 2000. 
  The "Fengyun No. 2" is the first earth-synchronous remote 
meteorological satellite made in China. 
  Research into the technology of making navigation 
satellites, 
disaster-forecasting satellites and satellite telecommunications 
systems for the finance industry is now under way. 
  The country, now ranking among the most advanced in the 
world 
in the field, is also making efforts to improve and upgrade its 
"Long March" carrier rocket series so as to meet different needs 
of both domestic and overseas customers. 
  Its "Long March-2B" heavy-thrust cluster carrier rocket now 
has a capacity of 4.8 tons and can lift objects to an 
earth-synchronous orbit. Its low-orbit carrying capacity is 
about 12 tons. 
  The "Long March-1B" carrier rocket has raised its lift-off 
capacity greatly, and the "Long March-3A" carrier rocket has 
increased its carrying capacity for earth-synchronous orbit to 
2.5 tons. 
  The rapid progress in satellite technology has boosted the 
country's endeavors in telecommunications, broadcasting, 
education, meteorology, natural resources exploration, ocean 
utilization, map drawing, navigation, transportation, marine 
rescue and environmental supervision. 
  With the aid of satellite technology, the country will build 
a nationwide mobile telecommunications system, data information 
system, accounting and taxation system, and salary-payment 
system.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Following a Russian 
breakthrough, China has now become the second country capable of 
producing man-made polycrystal diamonds, the Ministry of Geology 
and Mineral Resources (MGMR) announced here today. 
  Thin-wall drilling bits and geological core-extracting 
drilling bits made of this material have proved more efficient 
and long- lasting than earlier types. 
  China produced monocrystal diamonds in 1963 and afterwards 
took steps toward creating polycrystal ones, the MGMR said. 
  In 1991, the project to develop polycrystal diamonds was 
listed as a major scientific project in the nation's Eighth 
Five-Year Plan. 
  Diamonds are widely used in the fields of aviation and space 
flight, machine processing, national defense science and 
geological drilling. 
  Possession of diamonds has always been considered an 
important factor in judging the industrialization of a country, 
according to an official from the MGMR. 
  Natural diamonds are rare worldwide, with an annual output 
of 
400 million carats. The natural polycrystal diamond has only 
been produced in Brazil, and it holds a value ten times that of 
the monocrystal variety.

Sheng (1776 3932): "Implementing the `Program' Is a Major 
Matter With an Overall Bearing on Army Building--A Roundup of 
the Forum on Grass-roots Political Work in the Entire Armed 
Forces"] 
  [Text] The spring month of March is full of breezes and 
vitality. With the approval of the Central Military Commission, 
a forum on grass-roots political work in the entire armed forces 
opened in Beijing. Comrades in charge of political work in 
major military units of the entire armed forces and armed police 
units as well as representatives from relevant departments 
gathered together bearing along their research achievements. To 
properly implement the new "Program on Strengthening Grass-roots 
Units in the Armed Forces," they studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thought on Army building. Guided by Chairman Jiang's five-point 
instructions of "being politically qualified, acquiring perfect 
military skills, having a fine style, abiding by strict 
discipline, and ensuring adequate maintenance and supplies," 
they analyzed the situation, exchanged experiences, discussed 
problems, and offered many good opinions and measures. The 
participants said that the topics discussed at the forum were of 
major significance; the forum was held in a timely manner; it 
was a mobilization and arrangement for the entire armed forces 
to implement the "program"; they were more firmly oriented, had 
reached unanimity of understanding, acquired a clear idea of the 
key points, and cleared up their train of thought. 
<H3>  In Implementing the "Program," There Is a Need To Hold Firm 
to the Five-Point Instructions--The Soul and Nucleus of the 
"Program" </H3>
  Using Chairman Jiang's "five-point instructions" to 
standardize and guide the work of strengthening grass-roots 
units is the soul and nucleus of the "program" and is also a 
prominent characteristic of the "program." The participants had 
complete unanimity of understanding on this point. They said: 
The "five-point instructions" give full expression to Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building in the new period, 
reflect the demand of the new situation and tasks for army 
building, conforms with objective laws governing the work of 
strengthening grass-roots units, and includes the main component 
of this work. Therefore, the higher authorities and the lower 
levels in the entire armed forces should solidly establish the 
concept of using these "five-point instructions" to standardize 
and guide the work of strengthening grass-roots units, so that 
it will take deep root in our minds. In formulating plans, 
assigning tasks, summing up experience, and making performance 
appraisals, we should carry out and give expression to the 
"five-point instructions." This is the key to implementing the 
"program." 
  Many participants said: The "five-point instructions" 
constitute an inter-related organic entity forming the basic 
factor of the armed forces' combat effectiveness; they must be 
comprehended as a whole and carried out in an overall manner. 
Leading institutions should take the overall situation into 
account and proceed with their work according to the "five-point 
instructions," instead of improperly stressing their work. 
Facts have proved that if leading institutions "concentrate on 
one thing only," the lower levels will follow suit; if leading 
institutions act recklessly, the lower levels will get into a 
muddle. Some participants said vividly that if you want to keep 
the fire burning, you must poke it from time to time, but not in 
a disorderly manner; if everyone pokes it as they like, the fire 
will be put out. This is the same with implementing the 
"program." Only when the "five-point instructions" are 
followed, party committees take charge of the overall work, and 
leading institutions and departments coordinate with each other, 
provide scientific guidance, and form a combined force, will 
companies be able to carry out self-improvement vigorously. 
  On how to comprehensively strengthen grass-roots units 
according to the "five-point instructions," the participants 
suggested properly handling these three relations: First are 
relations between immediate and long-term interests. In all 
tasks, there is a need to make persistent efforts and prevent 
eagerness for quick success and instant benefit. Second are 
relations between breaking through key points and making overall 
improvement. Namely, attention should be paid to weak links in 
grass-roots units, one or two key points should be resolved 
during a certain period, and at the same time overall 
improvement should be taken into account, to promote coordinated 
development between various tasks and prevent "concentrating on 
one thing only." Third are relations between fulfilling 
priority jobs and performing routine work; in routine work, 
attention should be paid to cultivating the ability of military 
units to fulfill priority jobs and prevent stressing one point 
to the neglect of others. 
  The participants also pointed out that the "five-point 
instructions" not only serve as guidance for strengthening 
grass-roots units in the new situation, but have also set very 
high demands on them. To meet the requirements of "being 
politically qualified, acquiring perfect military skills, having 
a fine style, abiding by strict discipline, and ensuring 
adequate maintenance and supplies," a great deal of meticulous 
work and prolonged efforts are necessary. We should acquire a 
new attitude and style, should always aim at this objective, and 
should not remain content with just being able to prevent 
incidents. 
<H3>  To Implement the "Program," It Is Necessary to Strengthen 
Party Branches </H3>
  A company's party branch is its core in exercising unified 
leadership and maintaining unity. Strengthening party branches 
is not only an important component of the "program," but also an 
important guarantee for promoting the fulfillment of other jobs 
and serves as a key link in strengthening grass-roots units. 
Before attending the forum, many participants conducted special 
surveys on the strengthening of grass-roots party branches. 
They discovered that in the last few years, with the efforts of 
leaders at various levels, grass-roots party branches had made 
new progress in strengthening themselves, party members quality 
improved, grass-roots party organizations became more perfect, 
and their meetings on criticism and self-criticism were ensured. 
But there are still many problems. Prominent ones include the 
quality of some party members being low and some party branches 
being unable to properly fulfill their role. For this reason, 
it is necessary to put into effect the 14th CPC National 
Congress instruction of "exercising strict management over the 
party," to make great efforts to "improve its quality and 
fulfill its role," and to do a good job in implementing the 
"program." 
  The participants made the following analysis: The low 
quality of party member results from many factors, but the main 
factors are that there is no guarantee for education and no 
effective enforcement of management. Sometimes, political 
education is conducted in substitution for party member 
education, during which education aimed at the actual mental 
states of party members is lacking. In some units, education is 
separate from party members organizational activities, 
management, and supervision, therefore education lacks 
principles and militant spirit. In the participants' opinion, 
to improve the quality of party members, there is a need to 
conduct education and exercise strict management simultaneously. 
In conducting education, the most important point is to arm the 
minds of party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to fundamentally 
improve their political consciousness as well as their 
determination and awareness in maintaining unanimity with the 
party Central Committee and exercising the party's basic line. 
In the meantime, in light of party members' special needs, 
intra-party education should be carried out with specific 
purposes in mind. The party study course system must be upheld 
for frequent education on the party's nature, aims, and tasks, 
as well as party members' criteria, rights, and duties, so that 
they will seriously learn from Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, 
and other fine party members, and constantly improve their party 
spirit. This year, in accordance with requirements of the 
General Political Department, education will focus on 
strengthening faith in communism, upholding the party's basic 
line, and wholeheartedly serving the people. In exercising 
management, there is a need to persist in the party's regular 
activity system so that party members can take part in such 
activities, party organizations can boldly exercise management, 
and party members are willing to accept such management. 
  How should the role of a party branch as a combat bastion be 
brought into play? Participants' opinions on this can be summed 
up in three points: First, attention should be paid to party 
branch secretaries and deputy secretaries. In implementing the 
"program," stress should be laid on party branches and 
prominence given to party branch secretaries and deputy 
secretaries so that they will improve their sense of 
responsibility for their jobs. In handling the relation between 
"being able to do something" and "wishing to do something," it 
is necessary to resolve the problem of "wishing to do 
something." If someone has a strong sense of responsibility for 
his work, he will learn how to do it and can finally do it well. 
Some participants, in light of the specific experience of their 
units, proposed bringing about three transformations, namely 
transformation from assigning adequate numbers of cadres to 
assigning good-quality and highly-capable cadres; transformation 
from fragmentary to systematic training in terms of training 
methods; and transformation from organizational perfection to 
ideological stability in terms of strengthening armed forces 
units. Second, the mood of observing principles must be 
strengthened. Great efforts must be made to remove difficulties 
in conducting criticism, to increase the ideological contents 
and principles of intraparty activities. We must be bold in 
dealing with wrong ideas and unhealthy tendencies, instead of 
tolerating them, and we must not allow fellow-villagers' 
relations, favoritism, or personal interests to replace normal 
intraparty relations. Appraising party members is a good method 
to strengthen intra-party supervision. This should be upheld as 
a system and the appraisal content and method should be 
constantly improved. Third, help should be provided for the 
less advanced. It is important to promote the advanced, but the 
less advanced should not be neglected. Less advanced party 
branches should be given assistance and guidance. If this 
proceeds in a planned way and step by step, we will be able to 
effectively overcome our weak links and raise the entire level 
of grass-roots party organizations. 
  In Implementing the "Program," the Ability of Cadres 
to Train Soldiers Should Be Improved 
  At the forum, some participants analyzed the causes of 
offenses and incidents in their units and pointed out that 
following the change in the social environment and soldiers' 
backgrounds, many new problems have cropped up in how to train 
soldiers. But a host of facts have proved that whether or not 
an armed forces unit can train soldiers well generally depends 
on the officers and not on the soldiers. There are many factors 
causing offenses and incidents, but most of them are related to 
the ineffective education and improper methods of cadres. This 
suggests that improving the ability of grass-roots cadres to 
train soldiers is a subject to be urgently studied and resolved 
in strengthening grass-roots units. 
  How should soldiers be trained well in this new situation? 
The participants pointed out that the most important point is 
to inherit and carry forward the Army's fine tradition in 
training soldiers. Despite the change in the era, the Army's 
experience in training soldiers has not changed, and this 
experience portrays the Army's fundamental characteristics. 
Regarding "separation from soldiers" of some grass-roots 
cadres, some participants said that to improve their ability to 
train soldiers, their basic attitude toward soldiers should be 
changed and they should be made to understand soldiers' feelings 
and love them. Cherishing deep feelings is in itself a coherent 
force. Present-day young people have strong concepts about 
making their own decisions and democracy; they should be 
understood and respected instead of being abused or given 
corporal punishment. Only when you have close feelings for 
soldiers, will they regard you as their brother, tell you about 
their feelings, and listen to what you say. Some participants 
cited an example of cadres unfairness in treating soldiers, to 
prove that cadres must establish an image of uprightness in 
improving their ability to train soldiers. If cadres are not 
honest or upright, soldiers will resent it. Particularly on the 
questions of joining the party, learning technology, studying 
for degrees, switching to professional noncommissioned officers, 
promotion to higher levels, and other issues involving soldiers' 
interests, cadres must treat soldiers equally without any 
discrimination and must not practice favoritism. 
  How should strict management be combined with patient 
persuasion? This is also a question to be resolved in improving 
the ability of cadres to train soldiers. Some participants said 
that another noteworthy point is that whenever soldiers have 
shortcomings, faults, or errors, they are punished instead of 
being given patient persuasion. This is an irresponsible 
attitude and is quite harmful. Strict management over soldiers 
is necessary, but there must be a limit. We should be 
reasonably and logically strict; we should follow rules and 
regulations and must not formulate local policies which are 
different from these rules and regulations. Our strictness 
should also produce results, uniformity should be achieved 
between motive and result, and patient and meticulous persuasion 
is a must. 
  The participants said that leading institutions undertake a 
heavy responsibility for improving the ability of grass-roots 
cadres to train soldiers. Some armed forces units have provided 
all kinds of training courses to help cadres master the basic 
method of training soldiers; some leaders frequently go to the 
grass roots to lecture on traditions in training soldiers; and 
some have purposely put pressure on grass-roots cadres so they 
can gain experience through practice. All these are worth 
propagating. Some participants also said that in helping 
grass-roots cadres improve their ability to train soldiers, it 
is also necessary to assist them in studying new situations and 
resolving new problems. As of 1 March, the entire armed forces 
began to introduce a five-and-a-half-day work week system. On 
the one hand, soldiers' rest time must be guaranteed and must 
not be willfully used for other purposes; on the other, 
management must be strengthened, and during their rest time, 
soldiers can be organized to study scientific and cultural 
knowledge and carry out healthy and useful recreational 
activities. 
<H3>  In Implementing the "Program," Leading Institutions Must 
Cultivate the Idea of Serving the Grass Roots </H3>
  The "program" has not only clarified the criteria and tasks 
for strengthening the grass roots, but has also set explicit 
demands on how leading institutions should make a success of 
grass-roots work. In a sense, leading institutions have heavier 
responsibilities. Reviewing the practice of improving the grass 
roots, participants pointed out that in the last few years, 
leading institutions at all levels had done a great deal and 
made achievements in improving the grass roots; but they should 
not relax their efforts. Busily engaging in courtesy activities 
with people at the higher level, some leaders cannot concentrate 
their efforts on improving the grass roots; others lack 
unremitting efforts and are unwilling to do prolonged and solid 
basic work; still others have set low requirements, concentrate 
their efforts on their work only when problems crop up, and 
relax their efforts when the situation turns for the better. 
All these suggest that these comrades do not have an adequate 
understanding of the importance of the basic position of the 
grass roots or the prolonged nature and arduousness of improving 
the grass roots and laying a foundation. Improving the grass 
roots is a process of gradual and continuous development. It 
takes prolonged and unremitting efforts to improve the grass 
roots and lay a foundation. We frequently speak of "unshakeable 
barracks with changeable soldiers." A company's personnel, 
tasks, and environment keep changing; old problems may have been 
resolved, but new contradictions will arise; some jobs are 
fulfilled today, but on other occasions some jobs are left 
unfinished. Now there are many new situations and new problems 
to study and many difficulties and weak points to resolve. 
There is a need to keep improving the grass roots all the year 
round and to consolidate the foundation all the year round. 
  The participants had this same feeling: In the final 
analysis, leading institutions should serve the grass roots. 
With service in mind, they will work out measures and methods 
and go into action. Some comrades said: "When you do something 
heart and soul, you can think out all kinds of methods." In 
serving the grass roots, one should not pay lip service only, 
the important thing is action. There have already been explicit 
regulations and requirements on reducing checking, assessments, 
and appraisals; on strictly controlling the number of meetings 
and high-level courtesy activities; on sorting out all kinds of 
registration books and statistical reports; on prohibiting the 
higher level from asking companies for written material; on 
leaving some room for work assignments; on prohibiting the 
retention of funds, equipment, books, and magazines to be 
delivered to the grass roots; on ensuring annual vacations for 
grass-roots cadres; and on prohibiting leading institutions from 
borrowing grass-roots officials and soldiers to help with their 
work. Now the most important thing is to put these into effect. 
As long as we really keep the grass roots and our soldiers in 
mind, we can think out more methods and do more for the grass 
roots. 
  Many participants said that brigade- and regimental-level 
institutions are the forefront headquarters and are the leaders 
and organizers in improving the grass roots. Divisional-level 
leaders and institutions must step up their efforts to 
strengthen brigades and regiments and bring into play the role 
of brigade and regimental party committees as well as their 
institutions. They should take this as an important link in 
implementing the "program" and improving the grass roots. Years 
of experience suggest that for brigades and regiments to display 
their role as the "forefront headquarters," they must do a good 
job in these two aspects of work: The first is to be good at 
carrying out integration. Some brigades and regiments like 
either to cram the grass roots with the higher authorities' 
instructions or return the instructions to the higher 
authorities after circulating them from one institution to 
another. This is an important reason why job fulfillment is not 
ensured and confusion occurs at the grass roots. We frequently 
say that there are several thousand threads above, but there is 
only one needle below. Brigades and regiments should be good at 
acting as go- betweens. Brigades and regiments must have 
uniformity between their responsibility to higher authorities 
and their responsibility for lower levels. They must be good at 
creatively working out methods to implement the instructions and 
requirements of higher authorities in light of their specific 
conditions. The second is to exercise face-to-face leadership, 
so that brigades and regiments can obtain information from the 
forefront, carry out inspection and supervision over the 
forefront, resolve problems in the forefront, and provide 
service and supplies to the forefront. 
  Representatives from major armed forces units and armed 
police units briefed the forum on how they implemented the 
"program" and their future plans. Huang Jianhong, Tian Shugen, 
Tang Guangcai, Yuan Shoufang, Wang Tongzhuo, Lei Mingqiu, Jiang 
Futang, Hu Yanlin, Xu Chengdong, Wang Hongfu, Xu Ruichen, Zhang 
Yuzhong, Hu Guiyou, and Yang Deqing spoke at the forum. Zhao 
Changshan and Zhou Erjun delivered written speeches. Dang 
Zhongkui, Mao Fengming, and Song Wenjiu attended the forum.

  [Text] Reportedly, the State Development Bank will issue 
65 billion yuan of monetary bonds [jin rong zhai quan 6855 5816 
0280 0457]. 
  The bonds will mainly be purchased by banking institutions 
rather than individuals and non-banking institutions. The bonds 
will include three-year and five-year bonds. The interest rates 
will be slightly lower than those of the state treasury bonds of 
the same terms. Funds raised from the issuance of the bonds 
will all be used to finance key construction projects specified 
by state policy. 
  Reportedly, the State Development Bank now only has 
headquarters and will not set up branches. Its credit business 
will be handled by the People's Construction Bank of China. Its 
funds mainly come from three sources: First, the capital and 
key construction funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance. 
Second, state-guaranteed bonds issued by the State Development 
Bank to the general public, and monetary bonds issued to banking 
institutions. Third, part of the deposits taken by the People's 
Construction Bank of China (which will be turned into a 
state-owned commercial bank).

imports by 1997, a senior government official announced in 
Beijing yesterday. 
  The plan is the latest in a series to bring China's foreign 
trade regime in line with the standards of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said the trade official who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity. 
  About 50 import items are currently subject to quotas or 
require licences, he said at the China Business Summit. Most of 
them are capital goods including 18 electronic and machinery 
products. 
  China had formerly promised it would cut the number of 
products needing import licences by at least two-thirds to pave 
the way for its reentry into GATT. 
  The pledge yesterday was another signal that the country is 
intensifying its efforts to resume its contracting party status 
in GATT. 
  China hopes to rejoin within the next two years and become a 
founding member of the World Trade Body (WTO), the international 
free trade organization that will replace GATT when the final 
package from the Uruguay Round trade talks takes effect. 
  Gu Yongjiang, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation and China's chief GATT negotiator, is to lead a 
high- level government delegation to Morocco next month to sign 
the Uruguay Round package. 
  As a full-time participant in the Uruguay talks, which 
started in 1986, China has made concessions in agriculture, 
services, and other sectors. 
  GATT demands that member nations reduce nontariff measures, 
like import licences or quotas, to the lowest possible level. 
  The government has agreed to slowly reduce its import 
restrictions during its transition from a planned to a market 
economy. 
  If China rejoins GATT it will be allowed a transition period 
to meet all the requirements. 
  In a related move, the trade official said the number of 
export items under quota control has been reduced. 
  China now requires licences for 114 export products, 
compared 
with 235 in 1992. In other words, only 30 percent of China's 
export products need licences. 
  And about 38 export items such as oil and cotton cloth face 
quota restrictions. 
  The amount of these products companies could export was 
decided by administrative orders until this year when an open 
bidding system started. 
  The first bidding for 13 export items was held on March 18. 
  And the trade official said the government plans to allow 
more companies to bid for exports. 
  But he said the move would "take time," noting that certain 
export products like grain and oil are still under tight control. 
  Chinese economists have said reduction of quotas and 
re-entry 
into GATT will cause Chinese imports to rise. 
  On the one hand this will stimulate the country's foreign 
trade. But on the other it will increase the pressure on Chinese 
enterprises as the market will be flooded with foreign-made 
goods. 
  Imports last year rose 29 percent to $103.9 billion. And it 
is estimated that they will increase to $402 billion by 2004. 
  China has also promised to cut its tariffs by 40 percent in 
the near future. 
  The country has already reduced tariffs by 19 percent since 
1986 when it first applied to rejoin GATT. 
  The China Business Summit was organized by the Institute of 
International Trade Research under the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Singapore's Institute for International Research.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- A national meeting 
was held here today to further crack down this year on fake 
goods and imitations. 
  Xu Penghang, vice minister in charge of the State Economic 
and Trade Commission, presided over the meeting and urged the 
administrative bodies to pay major attention to cracking down on 
phony medicines, foodstuff, export goods, agricultural 
production materials and building materials and trade marks, and 
to deal with ten major cases already under investigation. 
  He pointed out that a safeguarding system should be 
established, adding that more cases of fake goods had been 
exposed with the joint efforts of procuratorates and local 
governments. 
  Last year the procuratorates of China dealt with 3,436 
cases, 
recovering a sum of 72.34 million yuan.

  [Text] Chinese companies which seek overseas listings will 
no longer get preferential tax treatment, Liu Hongru, the head 
of China's securities watchdog, said yesterday. 
  The preferential tax rate of 15 percent will be replaced by 
a 
single national corporate-tax rate of 33 percent, a move Hong 
Kong analysts say will have an adverse effect on China's 
ambitious drive to tap international capital markets. 
  The first batch of nine Chinese companies granted a listing 
on the Hong Kong stock market would, however, continue to enjoy 
the privilege as they had negotiated the deal before the 
decision was made, Liu, the chairman of the China Securities 
Regulatory Commission, said. 
  Hong Kong analysts said the higher rate would pull down the 
attributable earnings of companies seeking overseas listings by 
about 20 percent, while they questioned how long the 15 percent 
and 33 percent rates could co-exist. 
  However, there was, they said, a logical motive behind the 
move as a clear and unified tax rate was one of the conditions 
China must fulfil before it was eligible for full membership of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  China hopes to join GATT this year. 
  Liu did not say whether the new rate would apply to foreign- 
invested ventures which still enjoy corporate tax rates of 
between 15 percent to 24 percent. 
  He did say, though, that the 33 percent rate would apply to 
the 22 Chinese firms which have been approved for listing in New 
York and Hong Kong by next year. 
  Liu brushed aside arguments that the new rate would be 
unfair 
to the 22, saying the decision was part of the mainland's 
ongoing tax reforms. 
  Under China's new tax regime, which came into effect in 
January, all Chinese enterprises are subject to the unified 33 
percent tax rate. 
  Previously, state-owned firms had to fork out 55 percent, 
while foreign ventures in special economic zones and coastal 
cities paid the 15 percent to 24 percent rate. The tax rate for 
foreign companies elsewhere in China was 30 percent. 
  However, confusion still remains. Despite the new tax 
regime, local authorities in special economic zones and coastal 
cities, where most of the country's joint ventures are 
concentrated, have said that joint ventures will continue to 
enjoy the same tax rates as before. 
  Beijing tax authorities decided to maintain the 15 percent 
rate for the first nine Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong. 
  This move was apparently because of concern among overseas 
investors that the new rate would make public offerings less 
attractive. 
  To date, seven of the nine firms have listed, while the 
other 
two are slated for flotation in the first half of the year.

<F P=106> [Special article by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--At 
present, there are more than 150,000 foreign-invested 
enterprises on the mainland with total contracted investments of 
$200 billion and actual investments exceeding $60 billion. The 
large gap between the above two amounts is mainly because quite 
a few projects are divided into initial and succeeding stages or 
scheduled for first, second, and third phases, so that funds are 
made available in different lots. There are also some 
foreign-invested companies which exist in name only but do 
nothing except have their companies registered and false 
investment amounts reported. These are virtually "shell 
companies." Recently, action has been taken in several mainland 
cities to screen and reorganize these "shell companies." 
  It has been reported that business licenses for 26 false 
foreign-invested enterprises have been withdrawn in Wuhan 
recently, and a short time ago, licenses of 55 foreign-invested 
enterprises with only empty titles were also withdrawn in 
Guangzhou. In several cities and towns in Guangdong, many 
foreign-invested commercial housing construction projects have 
been suspended after starting for a short period owing to the 
unavailability of funds, or have gone bankrupt after receiving 
deposits from property buyers. These companies are also being 
screened now. 
  Some mainland enterprises wanted to set up joint ventures 
with foreign investors and made unilateral concessions in rights 
and benefits to them. Taking advantage of their aspirations and 
the loopholes in management, some foreign businessmen only 
signed contracts with mainland counterparts and provided some of 
the equipment as shares on their part, while delaying making 
funds available for a long time. As a result, abnormal 
phenomena have emerged in which foreign investors made profits, 
Chinese partners suffered losses, and enterprises operated in 
the red. 
  A survey conducted by the Beijing Institute of Planning and 
Economics pointed out: The increasingly serious problem of 
losses in foreign-invested enterprises has aroused attention 
from pertinent departments. It has been learned that the 
foreign-invested enterprises in Beijing recorded a total deficit 
of approximately 660 million yuan in 1992, with 50 percent, and 
more than 60 percent in individual trades, of enterprises 
suffering losses. Although the accumulated losses showed a 
slight decline in the first half of last year, the deficit 
amount still increased by 26 percent as compared with the 
corresponding period in 1992. 
  The survey also pointed out: Foreign investors have 
transferred profits through various channels, which has given 
rise to losses and tax evasion in a number of enterprises. By 
and large, foreign investors employed the following four methods 
to transfer profits: 1) They set high prices for the equipment 
they imported, passed inferior equipment off as superior, took 
away part of the profits in advance, and earned money by 
magnifying the ratio of investment and returns. For example, a 
foreign investor negotiated with several provinces and cities on 
the mainland to set up joint ventures for the development of 
five similar projects, for which he imported five sets of 
equipment at the price of $2.4 million each. In fact, all the 
equipment was assemblies of worn parts from abroad with a total 
value of less than $900,000. 2) By controlling import and 
export channels, they quote high prices for imported materials 
while reducing prices for exported goods, and then they transfer 
the profits to companies outside the territory. 3) By 
employing such means as irrational apportionment of charges, 
cost calculation, and so on, they transfer profits, increase 
losses, and evade taxes. 4) They avail themselves of the 
loopholes in policies to falsely report losses, purposely 
delaying the fiscal year showing a surplus, and effecting tax 
evasion. For example, a total of 4,838 foreign- invested 
enterprises reported losses in Guangdong in 1991, which 
accounted for 53 percent of enterprises having submitted their 
final settlement, and the amount of their losses totalled 3.66 
billion yuan. However, the so-called losing enterprises are 
constantly expanding their production scale and increasing their 
profits year after year, and have become "enterprises which see 
endless deficits but never tumble." 
  In addition, there are also foreign investors who work hand 
in glove with the Chinese personnel to swell their personal 
fortunes while causing losses to enterprises. Others take 
advantage of the weakness of the Chinese personnel, who lack 
accounting and legal knowledge, to control operational and 
management power and play tricks in import and export trade, so 
that they make profits at the expense of the losses incurred by 
enterprises. 
  A mainland expert maintains that to put an end once and for 
all to the loss of national capital in the joint-venture 
enterprises, apart from plugging the loopholes in the 
regulations on joint ventures, Chinese personnel in joint 
ventures must enhance their understanding of cost accounting and 
law. This should be taken as an essential qualification to work 
in a joint venture.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Liu 
Jinbao, a deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC] and 
acting president of the Bank of China Shanghai Branch, said that 
China's policy on using foreign capital should be appropriately 
readjusted in light of the changes in the environment of raising 
foreign capital. At present, it is necessary to vigorously open 
new channels for capital accommodation and boldly adopt the new 
means of funds, B shares, and B bonds to attract foreign 
investment. 
  To this end, Liu Jinbao submitted a motion to the congress. 
He said that use of foreign capital is a major policy for 
accelerating China's economic development. With the major 
readjustment of the international economic structure since the 
1990's, marked changes have taken place in the demand-supply 
structure of international capital, which has the following new 
trend: The flow of international capital has markedly decreased 
and there is an increasing demand; many developed countries have 
become the focus of international capital; and accommodation of 
international capital through securities has become the main 
form of international capital flow. 
  In view of the above new circumstances, Liu Jinbao said, 
China should diversify its use of foreign capital based on 
strengthening macroeconomic management in this field. Besides 
taking foreign loans and running three kinds of foreign-funded 
enterprises, three new forms of funds, B shares, and B bonds 
should also be adopted. Funds have the characteristics of low 
risks and high earnings and are welcome by medium and small 
international investors. As for the fundraisers, funds are 
different from bank loans, which do not increase the state's 
debt burden and can also reduce the cost of fundraising and 
increase efficiency. 
  Liu Jinbao said that B shares can be expanded from the 
following four aspects: The B shares issuers should be extended 
from enterprises obtaining foreign exchange through exports to 
efficient ordinary domestic enterprises to attract more foreign 
investment; the scope of trade of B shares issuers should be 
further expanded; the markets and prices for A and B shares 
should be unified; and a number of well-known foreign securities 
companies should be selected to set up exchanges in Shanghai. 
This can reduce the intermediate links and and increase market 
operation efficiency. While issuing B bonds, the scale should 
not be too big in the early stages and the capacity of foreign 
exchange and bearing capacity of the inhabitants and units 
should be taken into full consideration. It is necessary to 
gradually establish the second tier market for B bonds and 
strengthen their circulation. 
  Liu Jinbao said that operation of the abovementioned new 
forms of capital accommodation can further broaden the channel 
of the use of foreign capital and also improve China's 
securities market and create conditions for it to converge with 
the international market at an early date.

(0491 0344 6197): "State Bonds in 1994: The `Gilt Edge' Will 
Shine Again"] 
  [Text] State bonds, which were eulogized as gilt-edged 
bonds" in 1992, were cold-shouldered in the securities market in 
1993. Now that a new year has been ushered in, what fate lies 
in store for the state bonds market? Securities dealers hold 
that this market is likely to take off from its present trough 
and become brisk again as a result of the enactment and 
promulgation of certain laws, such as the "Law on the People's 
Bank of China," the "Law on Securities," and the "Law on State 
Bonds," along with the progress in reform of the monetary and 
financial systems. 
<H5>  "Gilt-Edged Bonds" Should Be Favored </H5>
  Nowadays the Chinese people have a better understanding of 
monetary affairs, as they are earning more and more money. They 
want to put their spare money to work and are seeking the most 
profitable channels for investment. Despite the numerous other 
ways to make investments, there are at present three major ones: 
Bank deposits, stocks, and bonds. To make the right choice, 
people have to take three factors into consideration: security, 
mobility, and return on investment. 
  In terms of security, state bonds are guaranteed by the 
credit of the government. No matter how the market trend 
changes, the investors will not suffer risks -- such as those 
caused by poor management and bankruptcy of enterprises, as well 
as by bad debts -- and their principal and interest are assured. 
The risks on the stock market are much greater. On 10 October 
1987, which was called Black Monday," the Dow-Jones Index fell 
508 points in a single day, or a slump of 23 percent. Within 
only a few hours, more than US$500 billion-worth of stocks 
became worthless. Two big slumps in the stock markets in 
Shenzhen and Shanghai also gave Chinese stockholders their first 
taste of the risks in investing in stocks. 
  In terms of gains, the interest rate of state bonds is 
1.72-2 
percentage points higher than that of bank deposits. If one is 
shrewd and buys state bonds on the securities market, one 
normally can reap an even greater profit of 14-17 percent. Some 
experts hold that judging by the experience in the development 
of securities markets both at home and abroad, the rate of gains 
from investment in stocks is roughly 10 percent, while that from 
investment in bonds is about eight percent. The current 
situation in China is that gains from investment in stocks are 
several times or even a few dozen times higher than the gains 
from investment in bonds. This is an infantile disorder of the 
stock market, but it certainly cannot last for long, as the 
stock market is becoming more mature. 
  In terms of mobility, a market for the circulation of state 
bonds is taking shape in China. Along with the progress of 
reform in the monetary and financial systems, a much improved 
and unified national bond market develop rapidly. The mobility 
of state bonds then will be greatly improved. 
  Compared with stocks and other securities, state bonds are 
less risky, and they yield more lucrative gains than bank 
deposits. Having the advantages of being risk-free, of being 
cashable, and of being circulated throughout the country, state 
bonds are the best thing for people to invest in: saving much 
time, eliminating a lot of worry, and reaping steady profits. 
If speculation in stocks and real estate is considered the 
prerogative of the wealthy, investment in state bonds should be 
regarded as the "territory" for wage earners. There is no 
reason why state bonds should not be favored by the broad masses. 
<H5>  Why Does the State Bond Market Fluctuate? </H5>
  When the state first issued national treasury bonds to 
citizens in 1982, it set the interest rate at 10 percent, which 
was fairly high considering the actual situation at the time. 
The bonds did not receive much response because the people did 
not have as much money as they do now. At that time, the 
issuance of state treasury bonds was treated as a political 
task, and the overwhelming majority of people bought the bonds 
merely to show their patriotism. Even then, however, a tiny 
number of people saw that the value of the bonds could be 
increased in circulation, and they secretly engaged in buying 
and selling the bonds. After only a few years, some of these 
people had become very wealthy. In legal terms, they were 
"speculators" on the "black market." Objectively, however, they 
played the role of promoting the circulation of state bonds. 
  The state treasury bonds issued in 1988 fared even worse. 
Owing to the high inflation rate, those who bought the bonds 
immediately dumped them on the market, causing a big slump in 
the prices of state bonds and a rather long-term depression in 
the state bond market. In 1990, the interest rate was raised to 
14 percent. When people cashed the bonds three years later, 
they found that gains from investment in the bonds were very 
lucrative. When the bonds were put up for sale, they did not 
neet with an enthusiastic response, probably because people had 
not yet emerged from the shadow of inflation. The bonds were 
neglected for a long time. Things began to turn for the better 
in 1991. When the first batch of state treasury bonds was 
issued in 1992, people rushed to purchase them, and in many 
major cities people stood in line all night. By the end of May, 
when the sales ended, many people -- especially those in the 
smaller cities and rural counties -- complained that they had 
been robbed of the opportunity. Nevertheless, the exciting 
situation did not last long. When the second batch was issued 
in June and July, the trend took a dramatic turn, and sales in 
major cities were sluggish. When the first batch of bonds began 
to enter the market for circulation in June, the prices nosed 
down continuously. Later, the pirces of the first and second 
batches of bonds even dropped below face value. The major 
reasons for this situation were: First, most of the first batch 
of bonds were held by institutional investors, and as the state 
adopted measures to limit the hoarding of securities and the 
re-loaning of funds, a large number of these investors had to 
dump the bonds, to their own loss. Second, the overheated craze 
in stocks and the pooling of funds siphoned off large amounts of 
funds, which adversely affected the people's enthusiasm for 
state treasury bonds. Third, the state bonds were not put on 
sale in vast areas, and sales were not promoted vigorously. 
  People who bought the three-year state treasury bonds 
suffered losses in 1992 owing to devaluation of the bonds. They 
were scared away when the bonds were issued again in 1993, even 
though the interest rate for three-year bonds was raised to 
13.96 percent and that for five-year bonds was raised to 15.86 
percent, in addition to government-approved measures to 
guarantee their value. Only 15 percent of the bonds were sold on 
schedule. In view of this situation, the sales period had to be 
extended and administrative measures had to be taken. The task 
was not completed until 15 July. 
  Despite the setbacks in the issuance of state treasury 
bonds, 
great achievements were made in 1993 in the development of the 
state bond market. For instance, in conjunction with the 
introduction of contracted buying and selling of some 
no-certificate state treasury bonds in 1993, China successfully 
established a system of self-management in dealing with state 
bonds. This indicated that China's state bond market had taken 
a satisfactory step toward standardization and operation in 
accordance with international conventions. The introduction of 
state bonds futures trading and the mechanism for buying back 
the bonds also greatly spurred the development of the spot 
market for state bonds. In mid-December 1993, the spot prices 
of various types of state bonds all witnessed hikes to different 
degrees, and began to emerge from the long-term trough. Since 
the beginning of this year, the price hikes have become even 
greater. The major reason for this situation is that the state, 
be means of macroregulation and control, has curbed the the 
overheated development of the real estate industry and the 
pooling of private funds. Moreover, the introduction of major 
measures for reform of the monetary and financial systems has 
further demonstrated a brighter future for the state bond 
market, thus enhancing investor confidence in these bonds. 
<H5>  State Bonds Hopefully Will Be in Demand Again </H5>
  Judging from the problems arising in the issuance and 
circulation of state bonds in recent years, there are many 
setbacks in the operational mechanism. The major ones are: The 
circulation of state bonds has not been linked with the 
circulation of bank credits, conspicuously narrowing the room 
for development of the circulation market for such bonds; the 
periods and varieties of state bonds are too restricted, making 
them unable to meet the varied demands of investors in different 
social strata; state bonds are issued in only a few months of 
the year, which upsets the balance between supply and demand; 
the interest rates of the bonds cannot change in line with 
changes in the market, so China cannot establish a regulatory 
fund to enforce effective regulation and control according to 
changes in the market; and there are too many organizations in 
charge of the issuance of state bonds, and they are inefficient. 
  In view of the problems in the operational mechanism, a 
series of reform measures will be taken in the issuance of state 
bonds this year. Securities dealers hold that the market for 
these bonds this year enjoys promising prospects. Their major 
arguments are: The establishment and development of a unified 
national money market system, including state bonds, has been 
listed as a major item on the reform agenda this year; the State 
Council has decided that, starting from this year, the central 
financial departments will no longer be allowed to overdraw from 
the central bank to offset deficits, which can only be balanced 
through issuing state bonds, and this means that both the amount 
and varieties of bonds will be increased; on the basis ofthe 
current medium- and long-term bonds, 8 to 10-year long-term 
bonds and one-year short-term ones will be issued to meet the 
varied demands of investors in different strata of society; this 
year the central bank will try out the method of open market 
operation, that is, using the purchase and sales of government 
bonds and other monetary commodities to regulate the money 
market, money supply, and interest rates. The issuance of state 
securities will be contracted to a group of monetary 
organizations that have the ability to undertake wholesale 
business in these bonds, so as to replace the former practice of 
apportioning, and the interest rates will be decided through 
price competition on the market -- this, no doubt, will greatly 
promote the circulation in the state bond market; the marketing 
time for various bonds will be adjusted to give priority to the 
issuance of state bonds, and bonds with different terms also 
will be issued at different times so as to balance supply and 
demand; work will begin to establish a unified national account 
transfer and settlement system to provide investors with a 
complete range of services in the purchase and transfer of state 
bonds, as well as the payment of principal and interest, and to 
introduce and expand the circulation of no-certificate state 
bonds, improve the efficiency of market operation, and establish 
a fund to regulate the operations of second-class markets and 
improve the environment for first-class markets. In addition, 
public fear of inflation will last for some time, and it 
inevitably will drive many people to invest their money in 
securities to prevent devaluation -- this will cause large sums 
of money to flow into the state bond market. 
  Although state bond will be issued mainly to organizations 
this year, this does not mean that ordinary citizens will not be 
able to buy them, as it is reported that the Ministry of Finance 
will issue savings bonds to individual investors in the form of 
selling the bonds over special counters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Fang Sheng, of the Chinese </F>
People's University, by staff reporter Gao Lu (7559 6424): 
"Market Economy and Opening to the Outside World" -- first 
paragraph is JINGJI RIBAO introduction] 
  [Text] Fang Sheng, whose original name was Chen Shi, was 
born on 9 October 1925. His native place is Lianjiang County, 
Fujian Province. In 1946, he entered the Taiwan University to 
study agroeconomy. After graduating from the first political 
economy graduate class of the Chinese People's University in 
1952, he took up teaching work in that university. He was 
transferred to Shenzhen University to become a vice president of 
the university from 1983 to 1986. At present, he is a professor 
of economy of the Chinese People's University and concurrently a 
member of the university committee, a part-time professor of the 
teaching team of Zhongshan University and the China Association 
for Science and Technology, an executive director of the China 
Taiwan Studies Society, the president of the Beijing Taiwan 
Economic Studies Center, an executive director of the China 
Market Economy Studies Society, and a director of the China 
Comprehensive Development Academy. His studies on economic 
theories involve the commodity economy, the market economy, the 
individual economy, the special economic zone economy, Taiwan's 
economy, and opening to the outside world, and he has put 
forward distinctive ideas. He has published more than 100 
academic theses. Major works published by him (including works 
for which he acted as the chief editor and works he wrote 
together with others) include: Economic Reform in China 
(published in 1980, and translated and published in the United 
States), The Issue of Socialist Economy in China, Studies on the 
Economy of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Issues of the 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Opening Up Economy in China, and 
so on. 
<H3>  Opening Up to the Outside World Is Liberating and Developing 
the Productive Forces </H3>
  [Gao] Comrade Deng Xiaoping made some important remarks in 
the south from 18 January to 21 February 1992. On 23 February, 
you published in RENMIN RIBAO a long article, "Opening to the 
Outside World and Utilizing Capitalism," which attracted 
extensive attention at home and abroad. You were really beating 
the drum of the times! 
  [Fang] That article had been written two to three years 
before it was published. That it was able to be published at 
that time was related to the publication of the important 
remarks in the south by Comrade Xiaoping. Opening up to the 
outside world began after the Third Plenary Session of the 11 
CPC Central Committee. With regard to the past practice of 
closing the country to international intercourse, opening up to 
the outside world is undoubtedly a reform and an even more 
profound reform at that. Like other reforms, it is to liberate 
and develop the productive forces. 
  [Gao] This important role of opening up to the outside world 
is related to its content. Therefore, there is a question of 
understanding and knowledge, and explanation and interpretation 
are needed. 
  [Fang] The first is to introduce funds and develop the 
productive forces. Shortage of funds is an important factor 
restraining socialist modernization in our country. In the 
past, we thought of solving this problem by relying on ourselves 
alone. As a matter of fact, having no domestic or foreign debts 
was not an expression of superiority, but only tied us up. It 
was not conducive to developing the productive forces. Since 
the beginning of reform and opening up, we have made use of more 
than 100 billion yuan of foreign funds, most of which have been 
used for key construction projects in agriculture, 
communications, telecommunications, and the energy and raw 
materials industries, and for strengthening some weak links in 
the national economy. To develop foreign-invested enterprises 
is an important way to introduce advanced foreign technology, to 
use foreign scientific management methods for reference, and to 
develop the market abroad. 
  The second is the introduction of advanced foreign 
technology. Science and technology are the first productive 
force. Much of the science and technology of our country is 
already in a leading position in the world, but on the whole, 
there is still a certain gap with the developed countries. 
Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the introduction 
of technology has been carried out on a large scale in our 
country. By the end of 1992, we had introduced more than 18,400 
technical transformation projects, which increased the output 
value by 874.2 billion yuan, and increased profits and taxes 
handed over to the state by 103.5 billion yuan. The 
introduction of technology also has laid a foundation for new 
industries and has promoted the development of high- and new- 
technology industries so that many traditional products have 
caught up with those at the international level. 
  Then comes the introduction of modern economic management 
methods and the use of such methods for reference. In our 
country, economic management is backward and is a far cry from 
the demands of large-scale social production and modernization. 
Without changing the backward situation in management and 
without modernizing economic management, the entire national 
economy will be seriously impeded. An important task in opening 
up to the outside world is to introduce and use for reference 
the management methods and ways of operation of developed 
foreign countries. In the past dozen years and more, we have 
learned from the experience of foreign countries in scientific 
management, effectively improved the management system of our 
country, and promoted the development of social production 
through channels, including sending personnel abroad, inviting 
personnel to come, and setting up foreign-invested enterprises. 
<H5>  The Market Economy Demands Opening Wider to the Outside World </H5>
  [Gao] Opening up to the outside world is an important means 
to promote rapid economic development. Today, when we are 
determined to establish the socialist market structure and 
practice the market economy, the importance and practical 
significance of opening up to the outside world are even more 
prominent. 
  [Fang] We still lack experience in practicing the market 
economy. We have to learn the practice of other countries 
through opening up to the outside world and in exchanges and 
contacts with countries all over the world, particularly with 
modern capitalist countries. We should explicitly put forward 
the necessity of learning from, making use of, and using for 
reference, the useful market-economy knowledge and experience of 
capitalist countries that have practiced the market economy for 
several hundred years. Capitalist countries have accumulated 
rich experience in their economic activities over a long period. 
Acute competition demands that they concern themselves with 
changes in the supply and demand relationship and in commodity 
prices in the market all the time, and that they readjust their 
own production and operation activities in good time; the threat 
of bankruptcy compels them to try a hundred and one ways to tap 
potential, lower production costs, and improve quality so that 
they may defeat their rivals in the market -- a merciless 
battlefield; and the pursuit of profit urges them to constantly 
improve management and operation, carry out careful calculation 
and strict budgeting, and pay attention to economic results. In 
a word, their immediate interests make them work hard to enable 
their enterprises to meet the needs of the market. Only in this 
way can their enterprises have vitality and attain the goal of 
making profits. In this respect, some of their practices are 
quite worthy of learning. 
  [Gao] The market economy itself is of an open type. If we 
say it is still possible to close the door of our country to 
practice the traditional planned economy for a period of time, 
it seems totally impossible to close the door to practice the 
market economy. 
  [Fang] I think so. We should not and cannot close the door 
in developing the socialist market economy and in establishing 
and perfecting the socialist market economy structure, but must 
open the door of our country, establish closer ties with the 
world economy, and further develop economic relations and trade 
with various countries of the world. The world today is an open 
one, and it is also a large unified international market. No 
country can isolate itself from the world economy and the 
international market. With the in-depth development of the 
world's new technology revolution, the international division of 
work is being carried out at a deeper level, the international 
market is constantly expanding, and the economic ties between 
countries are becoming closer and closer. To enable our 
country's market economy to keep abreast of this new historical 
tide of the world, we must energetically take part in the 
international division of work, and plunge ourselves into the 
competition in the international market. While formulating the 
strategy for developing the domestic market economy, we must 
take into consideration the trends of development in the world 
economy, understand the laws of change in the international 
market, and seize and make timely use of international 
opportunities that are conducive to us. 
  [Gao] In the world today, the modern market economy seems to 
have become a world system. 
  [Fang] A world market economy system has been formed. The 
economies of various countries have been brought into this 
system to varying degrees, and cannot be independent of this 
system. Likewise, China's socialist market economy has to be 
geared to the world and become a part of the world's market 
economy system. Therefore, we must respect international norms 
and act in accordance with them. However, it is also necessary 
to gradually understand and master ways of using international 
norms in the practice of opening up to the outside world. 
International norms mean customary practices accepted by the 
majority of countries and regions in international exchanges. 
Although they are not in a written form, they have a binding 
legal force. Viewed from the angle of developing our country's 
market economy and of promoting economic exchanges between our 
country and various countries of the world, the study and use of 
international norms in economy and trade have even greater 
significance. 
<H3>  Re-Entry Into the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) Requires the Establishment of a Market Economy Structure </H3>
  [Gao] China's application for the restoration of its status 
as a GATT signatory state, that is, what people usually call 
re-entry into GATT, is undoubtedly an important move to open 
wider to the outside world, to enable China's economy to move 
toward the outside world, and to join the great international 
market. 
  [Fang] The purpose of applying for re-entry into GATT is to 
promote the development of China's foreign trade, close economic 
ties with various countries of the world, a better grasp of 
international economic information, and more rapid development 
of the export-oriented economy. Since the beginning of reform 
and opening up, the Chinese economy's moving toward the outside 
world has become a trend. For various reasons, however, trade 
conflicts often have occurred. This requires the coordination 
of world- acknowledged principles, and each country should 
undertake responsibility while enjoying rights. This is the 
only way conducive to further expanding China's economic 
relations with foreign countries and to the Chinese economy's 
really moving toward the outside world. 
  [Gao] Seven years has passed since 1986, when China applied 
for re-entry into GATT, and talks concerning the matter are 
still being held. The factors affecting China's re-entry into 
GATT are very complicated. In addition to political factors, 
obstacles in the economic aspect are also worthy of examination. 
  [Fang] One of the fundamental issues is that GATT is based 
on 
the market economy, but China has practiced a highly 
centralized, unified planned economy for a long time. The two 
are incompatible as far as the economic structure is concerned, 
and it is difficult for the two to be in tune. This cannot but 
become a serious obstacle affecting China's re-entry into GATT. 
This issue once more shows that if we still do not change the 
old traditional economic structure and establish a new market 
economy structure, how much we will be out of step with the 
times; and if some people still have doubts and worries about 
China's practicing the market economy, and even take a negative 
attitude toward this, how greatly they have gone against the 
tide of historical development. Following the reform of the 
economic structure for many years, we have greatly reduced the 
scope of mandatory planning and gradually have expanded the role 
of market regulation. To date, we have explicitly put forward 
the necessity of developing the socialist market economy and of 
establishing the socialist market economy structure. This will 
make it easier for China's market economy to converge with the 
world's market economy, to meet the requirements of GATT, and to 
create very favorable conditions for re-entry into GATT. 
Following the reform and opening over the past 10 years and 
more, China's economy has now developed the strength to 
participate in international economic activities. A relatively 
stable international trade environment is needed for speeding up 
the socialist modernization of China and for developing the 
socialist market economy. 
<H5>  Do Not Copy Mechanically </H5>
  [Gao] It is an unavoidable task to study the experience of 
foreign countries and use it for reference, including experience 
in practicing the market economy. In recent years, you have 
stressed somewhat the "opening wider to the outside world and 
correctly making use of capitalism." What is "correctly making 
use of capitalism" in your view? 
  [Fang] First of all, we must study and understand foreign 
experience and capitalism. Without understanding them, we 
cannot learn well. For example, a traditional view holds that 
in capitalist countries, where the market economy is practiced, 
it is possible to manage individual enterprises in a planned and 
organized manner, while the entire social production is in a 
state of anarchy and the state can accomplish nothing. 
  [Gao] A conclusion opposing the market economy or a 
conclusion opposing macroregulation and control can be deduced 
from this view. Please tell me something about the actual 
situation in this respect. 
  [Fang] This common failing of capitalist countries did exist 
in history and it remains serious in some countries today. 
Since World War II, however, relatively great changes have 
taken place. The state has strengthened intervention in the 
economy and has done something to deal with the problems brought 
about by the market economy. To restore their war-damaged 
economies, some capitalist countries even once put the economy 
under very strict control. Countries practicing the five-year or 
ten-year plans, which are regarded as the patent of the planned 
economy, are not rare. Is this not macroregulation and control 
of the market economy, if it is put in our way of saying things? 
Of course, their control of this kind is not usually carried 
out by means of administrative orders, but by economic and legal 
means. In particular, such control is guaranteed by 
legislation. In fact, the market economy of Western countries 
today is not a totally free market economy without any restraint 
or planning. 
  [Gao] All this is worthy of our attention. In the course of 
establishing the market economy structure, the government should 
change and improve the means for carrying out macroregulation 
and control, and also should strengthen its functions in 
macroregulation and control. 
  [Fang] Moreover, it should proceed from China's realities, 
and should not copy mechanically. This is not just because the 
socialist market economy is essentially different from the 
capitalist market economy in terms of social nature, but also 
because we are still in the initial stage of socialism, and 
although many measures adopted by economically developed 
capitalist countries in developing the market economy are 
neutral in nature and without class character, they are 
implemented in a specific social system and are bound to have 
the characteristics of their respective societies. We cannot 
copy mechanically, even what is effective in the capitalist 
system, and we should integrate such measures within China's 
realities. 
  [Gao] We are practicing the market economy under socialist 
conditions. This is the most important reality. 
  [Fang] Therefore, the most important thing is that we must 
uphold socialism and must guard against and overcome rightist or 
"leftist" deviations. In addition, I think that Shenzhen's 
experience in studying foreign experience and using it for 
reference should be properly studied and made use of.
