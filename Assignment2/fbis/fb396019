<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Must Not Say Only No"] </F>
  [Text] Insensitive to how other nations feel its actions, 
Japan aimlessly wastes time without taking necessary steps. 
Japan's trade partners then take action out of irritation, and 
Japan reacts in excessive surprise. This is a repeat of 
Japanese history. 
  In the 1930's and 1940's, the United States and Europe 
frequently issued warnings against Japanese attempts to expand 
its influence to the Chinese mainland and Southeast Asia. The 
United States frequently sent signals to Japan warning that if 
Tokyo sent troops to Indochina, it would cut oil exports to 
Japan. For Japan at the time, the United States was its 
greatest source of oil. 
  When the United States decided to ban oil exports to Japan, 
the decision took the Foreign Ministry, the Army, and the Navy 
by surprise. This is a good example of how Japan was 
insensitive to the reactions of foreign nations. 
  The Nikkei average stock price plunged following the 
breakdown of the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks. U.S. sanctions 
against Japan are supposed to weaken the yen, but speculation 
that the Clinton administration hopes for a strong yen resulted 
in a sharp rise in the yen's exchange rate against the dollar, 
disrupting the foreign exchange market. This year the United 
States will hold an off-year election, and the U.S. Congress is 
deluged with bills for retaliation against Japan. President 
Clinton, who prefers reality to ideology, is about to lean 
toward a policy favored by Congress. Claiming the Japanese 
mobile phone market is closed, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor 
has already made clear the United States will impose high 
tariffs on Japanese manufactured goods. 
<H5>  Excessive Reaction Prohibited </H5>
  Looking back, there was a time considered to be a watershed 
in Japanese history. Japan, which said "no" to U.S. demands for 
opening the Japanese market through numerical targets, now 
stands at another watershed. 
  Japan, which said "no" to demands by Europe and the United 
States to open China's northeast region (Manchuria), began 
following a path of isolation after withdrawing from the League 
of Nations. Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the Japanese 
delegation which defiantly walked out of the conference room of 
the League of Nations received thunderous applause in 
nationalism-ridden Japan. 
  There is no need to take seriously the current trouble 
between Japan and the United States because it is within the 
framework of security arrangements. But there are fears that 
the trouble, though small in stature, will repeat the pattern of 
excessive reaction. The fear cannot be ruled out that the 
economic friction between the two countries will develop into 
political distrust, thus hollowing our alliance. 
  Japan follows the path of self-reform based on its own 
yardstick. At a meeting with President Clinton, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa viewed numerical targets as managed trade and rejected 
them. He made a correct decision at the meeting. If Japan 
accepts numerical targets, it is tantamount to acknowledging 
Japan is a special nation where the bureaucracy reigns. 
  However, the question concerns the course which led up to 
the 
breakdown of Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
  First, we believe policymakers and ordinary people were too 
insensitive to the existence of $130 billion in Japanese 
surplus. The surplus is a transfer of purchasing power. If one 
is indifferent to the continuation of the surplus for many 
years, he is not believed to have a normal nerve. Ministry of 
Finance and other Japanese Government officials who stick to the 
"logic of finance" have missed a chance to expand Japan's 
domestic demand. Their attitude reminds us of the behavior of 
the Japanese Army which stuck to the "defense of Manchuria to 
the last." 
  Second, we wonder whether Japan is qualified to openly 
assert 
the market economy while opposing managed trade. The number of 
bureaucratic regulations shows no signs of shrinking despite 
administrative reform. The administration abuses the authority 
to issue certifications, licenses, and subsidies to intervene 
and threaten local governments as well as the private sector. 
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is in a 
situation where it asks economic organizations to comment on 
this and that. 
  In the eyes of Americans, Japan is a nation where mammoths 
live that cannot be tamed by ordinary rules. The only way to 
have the mammoth buy goods is for foreign exporters to become 
ordinary animals or use the purchasing power of the mammoth. 
The U.S. Government probably feels it has chosen the latter. 
  The U.S. Government distrusts Japan, saying the mammoth 
cannot easily become an ordinary animal and has no intention of 
becoming one. 
  Unfortunately, we feel there is no strong leadership in the 
White House nor in Japan. The shortsightedness of staffers 
assisting the President is conspicuous. They seek only quick 
credit and show no willingness to objectively appraise the 
15-trillion-yen stimulus package--the largest ever--on which 
Japan has belatedly decided. 
<H5>  Stand on Market Mechanism </H5>
  To break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. relations, Japan should 
endure some pain, establish its own yardstick, and achieve 
self-reliance. 
  Japan can attack other nations with its yardstick because it 
is a double-edged sword, and thus can also cut itself in 
reaction. If Japan does not accept the U.S. demand for settling 
numerical targets, it should make transparent its market 
activities at home and abroad, and the bureaucracy's 
intervention should be excluded. 
  If the United States continues to demand managed trade and 
imposes a series of sanctions on Japan, we believe Japan needs 
to have a firm resolve to counter them. If the United States 
imposes sanctions on Japan, Japan should take its case to GATT 
and wait for the judgment of international opinion. 
  In that incidence, the United States would lose the status 
of 
free trade champion, and Japan may become the champion of free 
trade in place of the United States. U.S. sanctions against 
Japan could deal a blow to Japanese enterprises, but those who 
would ultimately pay the price would be American consumers who 
are forced to buy high-priced goods and suffer from a shortage 
of goods. A weak dollar would be responsible for increasing the 
prices of imported goods and fueling inflation in the United 
States. 
  In the United States, a substantial number of Americans have 
criticized the Clinton government for taking a tough trade 
stance toward Japan. There is no doubt the more Japan deals 
calmly with U.S. trade demands without displaying emotional 
reaction, the more the criticism will grow.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japanese and U.S. Negotiators Need to Stop </F>
Thinking Like Bureaucrats and Lawyers"] 
  [Text] The new economic framework talks between Japan and 
the United States looked like a dispute between a group of 
lawyers and the bureaucracy. 
  The main posts in the Clinton administration are occupied by 
lawyers, including President Clinton and U.S. Trade 
Representative Kantor, who is in charge of negotiations with 
Japan. American lawyers make free use of various logical 
arguments to achieve their goals. Sometimes, therefore, they 
are unable to see the whole situation. 
  In the Japan-U.S. consultations, such thinking had it that 
because Japan was a peculiar nation, the only way to open its 
markets was to set numerical targets. Some of their arguments 
completely ignored the reality of Japan's economic position. 
  Those who faced the U.S. lawyers were Japanese bureaucrats. 
The Ministry of Finance, which puts a premium on financial 
logic, is at the center of the bureaucratic system. 
  Japan delayed compiling economic pump-priming measures. 
Moreover, the Economic Reform Study Council, which was set up to 
tackle issues likely to be raised at the Japan-U.S. economic 
talks, failed to spell out the drastic measures Japan should 
adopt to reduce its trade surplus because of interruptions by 
bureaucrats. 
  If the two countries do not take a new approach different in 
the future, they will be unable to find a solution to their 
unresolved bilateral trade problems. 
  Since the summit talks, the United States has begun to adopt 
a policy of shaking Japan into action. U.S. officials made 
comments approving the yen's appreciation. The country is 
preparing to impose sanctions, asserting that Japan is not being 
fair over the issue of mobile phones. The president himself 
criticized Japanese bureaucrats. 
  It seems the United States is trying to get compromises from 
Japan by making it feel uneasy. The reason why the United 
States has delayed announcing an expected revival of the Super 
301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act may 
be that it is now watching to see what moves Japan will take. 
  The Japanese Government, which was upset by the U.S. 
strategy, has moved to work out new market-opening measures. It 
is beginning to look as though, as far as relations with the 
United States are concerned, Japan does not act without pressure 
from Washington, and is inviting strong arm tactics from the 
United States. However, the U.S. strategy is a "dangerous game." 
  There is fear that Japan-U.S. relations will fatally worsen 
as long as the United States continues to demonstrate such an 
aggressive attitude. The way in which the United States takes 
lightly multilateral trade rules will only lead to it falling in 
the estimation of the international community. We would like to 
earnestly ask the U.S. administration to show self-restraint. 
  As for the mobile phone issue, it is not clear which part of 
the Japan-U.S. accord Japan is violating. There is a strong 
impression that the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 
which was trying to find fault with Japan, and Motorola, Inc., 
which wants to reduce its stocks, cooperated in coercively 
raising the issue. The two countries should move to make 
concessions before sanctions are exercised. 
  The Japanese Government will start a full study of new 
market- opening measures next week. We would like to make two 
requests, and urge the government to come up with fruitful 
measures. 
  First, new market-opening action should help cut the trade 
surplus. The reason why the U.S. administration is hastily 
demanding results on trade issues is that it is irritated at 
Japan's trade surplus, which has not decreased at all. The 
Japanese Government must steadily implement measures to expand 
domestic demand and approve the yen's appreciation to its 
current level. 
  The second request is that the government implement drastic 
deregulation to sweep away the Japan revisionism [nihon 
ishitsuron] which has deeply infiltrated the Clinton 
administration. 
  It has been revealed that the Ministry of International 
Trade 
and Industry instructed economic organizations to support the 
economic pump-priming package recently announced by the 
government. The U.S. negotiators must have questioned whether 
"the Japanese Government, which controls domestic industries in 
this way, is qualified to oppose managed trade." The collusion 
between government and industry has grown worse. 
  Although there are problems with the way the U.S. has dealt 
with the mobile phone issue, some people have pointed out the 
lack of clarity in the way the Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications administers such issues and its excessive 
regulations on and intervention in industry. 
  The government regards the promotion of deregulation as the 
main plank of its new market-opening measures. However, we 
question to what extent deregulation will be implemented. 
Unless the prime minister gives a shock to bureaucrats by 
showing his readiness to replace all officials higher than 
bureau chiefs at each ministry, the nature of the bureaucracy 
will probably not change.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hurry Up and Make a Political Decision on </F>
Daring Market Liberalization"] 
  [Text] How deeply is Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
aware of the fact that the international community is now 
watching what Japan does next -- after he said "no" to U.S. 
demands at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting? 
  To our regret, judging by remarks he made at the House of 
Representatives' Budget Committee session on 18 February, it is 
difficult to see how he plans to use his leadership to ease the 
economic dispute with the United States. 
  To find a way out, it is urgent that Japan, having said 
"no," 
now says "yes" and declares that "without delay, it will do what 
it can." It should then move into action voluntarily. 
  The government will hold a meeting of concerned ministers 
early next week to discuss how to correct the trade imbalance. 
It is important that the prime minister not rely solely on 
scenarios written by bureaucrats. 
  In the current times of great change, ideas from 
bureaucrats, 
who tend to cling to the same old framework of thinking, often 
have limitations. It can be said that the government's slowness 
to act, which was caused by bureaucrats, is also to blame for 
the breakdown of the summit talks and the prolonged economic 
recession. 
  The major points in the plan to correct the trade imbalance 
are expected to be the promotion of deregulation, the expansion 
of import and investment, the development of positive policies 
to promote competition, and the improvement of government 
procurement procedures. 
  We have no objection to any of this. However, the most 
serious question is whether or not the prime minister can quell 
resistance from the bureaucracy and industry, and take a step 
toward further drastic market liberalization. Japan ought also 
to think about the possibility of setting endeavor goals 
voluntarily to reduce its current-account surplus. 
  There are risks involved in making such political decisions. 
To bear the responsibility for such risks should be a problem 
for the prime minister who has touted the start of "a mature 
Japan-U.S. relationship." 
  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who fears the failure of 
the Japan-U.S. summit could intensify trade friction between the 
two countries, contributed an article to the U.S. newspaper NEW 
YORK TIMES with the suggestion that a wisemen's meeting of 
intellectuals from both nations be held. This is worth 
considering. 
  Might we suggest the prime minister also call on people such 
as former prime ministers, who themselves experienced tough 
times dealing with the United States over trade frictions, and 
business executives, to canvass other than bureaucratic views. 
A meeting of businessmen from the two countries was held in 
Washington immediately after the summit talks. We would like to 
suggest the prime minister pay heed to and make the most of the 
views expressed at that time formulating future policies. 
  President Bill Clinton barely managed to restore the 
Democratic Party to power after a 12-year Republican reign by 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush. With a bye-election coming in 
November, Clinton is no doubt fighting against the trade deficit 
with Japan, using retaliation as a threat, to solidify his 
political base at home. 
  Meanwhile, in Japan, the rule of the Liberal Democratic 
Party 
ended with the start of the coalition administration. But the 
coalition has not been able to free itself of the old framework 
of bureaucracy, which means the strategy has not changed from 
that used in 12 years of contact with Republican governments, 
and it appears to be perplexed by the new negotiating style of 
the U.S. Democrat administration. 
  Japan and the United States must soon establish relations of 
mutual trust appropriate to this era of change. It will only 
harm and not help bilateral relations if the United States 
increases pressure on Japan by reviving the Super 301 provision 
of the Trade Act. 
  It would be regrettable if President Clinton really meant 
what he said at the summit about past Japan-U.S. trade accords 
having been almost useless in opening up the Japanese market. 
Japan bears a grave responsibility for letting him believe that. 
  Japan's failure to spell out its market-opening efforts to 
other countries is just as harmful as its awkward negotiation 
strategy.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- North Korea will 
have to resume dialogue with South Korea on the nuclear issue 
through the exchange of special envoys if it wants to hold a 
third round of talks with the United States, the U.S. State 
Department says. 
  Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of State for Asian 
and Pacific Affairs, said Monday that North Korea will also have 
to fully implement International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections of its nuclear facilities in order to realize the 
third round of talks. Hubbard, who has represented the United 
States at working-level contacts with North Korea in New York, 
clarified the U.S. position at a regular weekly briefing on 
Monday. 
  "The undertakings of Team Spirit '94 and a third round of 
U.S.-North Korea talks are based on the premise that the IAEA 
inspections will be fully implemented and that the South-North 
nuclear dialogue will resume through the exchange of special 
envoys," Hubbard said. 
  Hubbard's comment came as a team of seven IAEA inspectors, 
which arrived in Beijing Monday night, is expected to leave for 
Pyongyang aboard a North Korean plane at 3 P.M. Tuesday. 
  "They (IAEA inspectors) will complete their inspections 
and...there will be a number of tests based on the inspections 
that take place," Hubbard said. He said if the IAEA inspectors 
find that continuity in nuclear safeguards has been broken, then 
the United States will have to reconsider whether dialogue is 
the appropriate way of dealing with this issue. 
  Hubbard said the IAEA team will not inspect two suspected 
nuclear sites this time. 
  "Our basic position remains that we're seeking a full 
resolution of the nuclear issue," Hubbard said. "(and) full 
resolution of this issue entails full North Korean membership in 
the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty), full North Korean 
acceptance of their safeguards obligations with the IAEA." 
  Finally, North Korea will have to implement the South-North 
Korean denuclarization declaration, which provides for 
inspections in a regime between North and South, Hubbard said. 
  Asked whether the North Koreans accepted more than one 
inspection of their seven declared sites or only one inspection, 
Hubbard said that the number of inspections have never really 
been an issue. 
  "North Korean representatives (to the working-level 
contacts) 
have acknowledged the need for periodic inspections," he said. 
"They have simply challenged the scope of those inspections." 
  "Obviously, continuity of safeguards is an ongoing concept," 
he said. 
  Hubbard was asked if the United States has made any 
agreement 
as to what is going to be the objective for the March 21 
high-level talks between North Korea and the United States. 
  "We haven't worked out any specific agenda," Hubbard said. 
"As I have said earlier, our principal objective is a resolution 
of the nuclear issue." 
  "We will adopt a thorough and broad approach to the 
problems," he added. 
  Hubbard said the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks will 
be held between Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of State 
for political and military affairs, and his North Korean 
counterpart Kang Sok-chu.

  [Text] Thailand and the United States last week failed to 
bring to a conclusion talks on extending the bilateral agreement 
on export quotas for Thai garments and textiles. However, 
Foreign Trade Department director-general Oranut Osathanon said 
she believed that the prospects looked bright for the next round 
of talks. 
  Ms Oranut last week led the Thai delegation for the second 
round of negotiations with the US textiles negotiating team in 
an attempt to extend the bilateral agreement that expired in 
December last year. 
  The first round of talks, last December, failed because the 
US placed very tough punishment conditions in cases where the US 
found trans-shipment or re-routing of Thai products to third 
countries before entering the US, a method designed to get 
around quotas known as "circumvention". Ms Oranut said last week 
that the US had relaxed its condition on the "circumvention" 
clause, saying that it would cut quotas only once in the case of 
products found to be shipped to the US illegally. And if the 
Thai side was able to prove its innocence in the case, the US 
must compensate for all quotas cut. 
  She said the US had relaxed its earlier stance insisting on 
investigations, without advance warning to the Thai side, of 
factories suspected to have conducted "circumvention". Both 
sides last week agreed that the US must inform the Thai 
Government and investigate the factories accompanied by Thai 
officials. 
  However, neither side discussed the amount of quotas or the 
growth rate of quotas for which the US will allow imports from 
Thailand each year. Hence the need for another round of 
negotiations. Ms Oranut said the Foreign Trade Department will 
today call a meeting of private-sector representatives to 
determine what the country's position should be.

  [Text] Pak Yong-su, head of our side's delegation to the 
contact of working-level delegates for the exchange of special 
envoys of the North and South, today sent the following 
telephone message to Song Yong-tae, the South side's senior 
delegate: 
  Four months have passed since the contact of working-level 
delegates for exchange of top-level special envoys 
[choegowigubui tuksa] of the North and South, which had taken 
place amid attention at home and abroad, was suspended. 
  As is well known, our side proposed an exchange of top-level 
special envoys of the two sides last May out of an earnest 
desire to reach a new turning point in North-South relations and 
the resolution of the reunification issue, and made every effort 
to implement this proposal at the earliest possible date. And, 
finally, the two sides had three working-level contacts. 
However, contrary to what we did, your side constantly pursued 
nuclear war exercises and an international cooperation system, 
which negate dialogue. Moreover, at a time the fourth contact 
was imminent, your side made the violent remarks [pogon] that it 
would be ready to take military countermeasures [kunsajok 
taeungdo pulsahal] against the dialogue partner. In this way, 
your side committed an unreasonable [ondangchimothan] act that 
discontinued [tujol] the working-level talks. 
  Our side duly sounded an alarm [ungdanghan kyongjongul 
ulligo] concerning this act by your side and repeatedly called 
on your side to assume an attitude befitting dialogue [taehwaui 
ipchang]. However, your side continued the Hwarang, Foal 
Eagle-93, and other adventurous nuclear war exercises and built 
an artificial barrier to our working-level contact. 
  If your side had sincerely dealt with [songuirul kajigo 
taehada] the exchange of special envoys, our working-level 
contact would have already been concluded [kyolsok] long ago, 
special envoys would have visited Pyongyang and Seoul, and 
pending issues acutely raised between the North and South would 
have been resolved. 
  I think it is very regrettable that our working-level 
contact 
has so far not been on the right track [orun kwedoeso] and has 
not been able to duly contribute to developing North-South 
relations. 
  A North-South exchange of special envoys is an urgent task 
[cholpakhan kwaje] that cannot be delayed even for a moment. 
  Therefore, I think it is fortunate that your side has 
proposed resuming the working-level contact for the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  Our side consents to [tongui] your side's proposal to resume 
the working-level contact, acknowledging [injonghamyonso] that 
your side assumed the position to resume the working-level 
contact for the exchange of special envoys because your side 
accepted our demand that your side discontinue all large-scale 
nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner and abandon 
the international cooperation system concerning the nuclear 
issue. 
  Therefore, we will go to your side's area in Panmunjom at 
1000 on 3 March, Thursday, according to pertinent visit 
procedures to hold the fourth working-level contact.

message to the chief delegate of the South side today notified 
that the North will go to the South side's portion of Panmunjom 
at 10:00 [0100 GMT] March 3, following appropriate procedures of 
travel, to have the fourth working contact. 
  "We consider that the South side's stand for the resumption 
of the working contact for the exchange of special envoys is 
motivated by its acceptance of our demand for a stop to all the 
large-scale nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner 
and renunciation of 'an international cooperation system' over 
the nuclear issue," the message said. 
  Recalling that the South side had created artificial 
obstacles to the working contact, continuing adventurous nuclear 
war manoeuvres, it said: "If the South side approached the 
exchange of special envoys between the two sides with sincerity, 
the working contact would have been concluded long ago and 
special envoys would have traveled to Pyongyang and Seoul, and 
the urgent pending questions raised between the North and the 
South would have been solved."

  [Text] Tapos (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--President Suharto 
expects ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] to be constantly alert to 
efforts by certain groups who want to replace Pancasila 
[ideology of the Indonesian state] as the foundation of the 
state and the philosophy of life of the Indonesian people. 
  The president expressed this expectation Sunday [23 January] 
at the Tapos Livestock Center at Bogor, West Java, as he 
received about 200 TNI-AL [Indonesian Navy] officers attending 
the "Back to Basics" Program led by KASAL [Navy Chief of Staff] 
Vice Admiral Tanto Koeswanto. ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] 
Commander General Feisal Tanjung was also present. 
  "ABRI has never wavered regarding Pancasila and the 1945 
Constitution as the foundation of the state and the philosophy 
of life of the Indonesian people. Pancasila and the 1945 
Constitution as the ideology of the Indonesian people are not 
negotiable. The Sapta Marga [Armed Forces oath], too, says that 
Pancasila is the principle of the life of the state," Pak Harto 
[President Suharto] declared. 
  According to the president, this needs to be remembered 
always, because in the framework of democracy there are groups 
that use the issue to dismantle the national consensus that has 
been achieved, although this consensus has been tested in five 
general elections. 
  "Some people are still looking for ways to use other 
principles that were previously shown to bring no improvements 
for the people. It is not possible for us to reconstruct those 
things from the past. Therefore, we must be alert." 
  The president noted that the people have accepted Pancasila 
as the sole principle of the life of society, the nation, and 
the state. This acceptance was made through a long and difficult 
process, because initially there were many groups in society who 
rejected it. 
  The only objective of development based on Pancasila and the 
1945 Constitution is the achievement of material and spiritual 
prosperity, prosperity in this world and the next. 
  How can we provide for life in this world and the next? 
There 
are only two things: material needs and spiritual needs. "Thus, 
through this state ideology, we establish programs so that we 
will live in happiness and prosperity in this world and in the 
next. People should not think about material things alone, 
forgetting the spiritual. Neither should people think about 
spiritual things alone, forgetting the material. Neither is 
complete. The two things cannot be separated. There will then be 
those who emphasize the material, while not forgetting spiritual 
life. There will be those who emphasize the spiritual, but they 
should not forget the material," Pak Harto declared. 
  The president also explained the effort through which 10 
parties were simplified into only three sociopolitical forces; 
why ABRI as a sociopolitical force sits in legislative and 
deliberative bodies; the need for the three political parties; 
and the fact that the PPP [Development Unity Party], GOLKAR 
[Functional Group], and the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party] 
use Pancasila as their sole basis. 
  "At that time, I asked whether ABRI was recognized as a 
sociopolitical force. The reply was that they continued to be 
recognized as such because of their history. Therefore, I said 
they must have the same rights as other political forces." 
  According to the chief of state, the appointment of ABRI 
members to legislative bodies is not to control votes in those 
bodies but to act as a provider of dynamics and as stabilizer. 
  "We do not want to change the 1945 Constitution, although 
changes are made possible through Article 37 of the 
Constitution. To make sure that no change takes place in the 
1945 Constitution, a third of the MPR [People's Consultative 
Council] comes from ABRI." 
  The president said that history shows that the appointment 
of 
ABRI as a political force was actually by national consensus. 
"It was not I who originated it," he said. 
  According to the president, none of these achievements are 
the results of an instantaneous act but are products of gradual 
action. 
  The president also guaranteed that ABRI will not make 
Pancasila into a religion or make religion into Pancasila. ABRI 
will not do such things. It has now been demonstrated that ABRI 
will not make Pancasila into a religion or make religion into 
Pancasila. Pancasila is a philosophy of life and is the ideology 
of the Indonesian people as a pluralistic nation in their life 
as a state. 
  The president also warned of efforts to distort the facts of 
history by claiming that it was Pak Harto who orchestrated the 
G-30-S/PKI [30 September Movement/Indonesian Communist Party], 
remembering that Lieutenant Colonel Untung used to be one of his 
men. 
  "I have received a book, intended for distribution, entitled 
Prima Dosa, which accuses the present government, 
saying that I am the one who created the G-30-S/PKI, since Lt. 
Col. Untung used to be one of my men. They have distorted 
things," said Pak Harto, laughing. 
  The book was published by a person who says he has suffered 
constantly under the New Order, being shoved from place to 
place. Pak Harto asked that everyone, especially ABRI, be alert 
to this, since such things continue to go on. 
  Pak Harto stressed that as a soldier and an ABRI fighter he 
holds firmly to Sapta Marga and that Sapta Marga will remain the 
ideology of generations of ABRI who are devoted to the nation 
and the state. 
  "I have one ideology as a Sapta Marga soldier. Therefore, I 
faced everything connected with the beginning of the New Order 
myself without any exposure to the outside," Pak Harto said 
firmly. 
  The president also denied that the Tapos Livestock Center is 
equipped with all kinds of facilities, such as helipad, golf 
course, and swimming pool. "It is a fact that there are people 
who are vigorously discrediting me," the president said. He 
added that what they call a swimming pool is a storage tank for 
water for cattle. There is also no palace, and what they call a 
helipad is not that at all but is only a place for drying coffee. 
  "Such criticism does not matter, however, for it is merely a 
challenge to me," Pak Harto said.

  [Text] Most big businesses in South Kalimantan are not 
allowing the SPSI (All-Indonesia Labor Union) into their 
companies. In fact, some think that the presence of that 
organization in their company is a thorn in their side, a BISNIS 
source reported here. 
  One businessman said that his company rejected an SPSI PUK 
(Shop Steward) even though two years ago he stated before the 
MUSPIDA [Congress of Provincial Heads] that he would help form 
that labor organization. "The important thing is that we have 
fulfilled all our obligations and that we have complied with all 
labor regulations in a proper way," said that businessman, who 
asked that his name not be mentioned. 
  According to the latest figures from the South Kalimantan 
Department of Manpower only 81 of 462 companies in that province 
have allowed their workers to join that labor organization. "We 
have repeatedly told them how important it is to have a PUK from 
the SPSI in a company, but the companies just pay no attention 
to that suggestion," said one official of the agency. 
  Syakhrian Sulaiman, Deputy Chairman of the DPD (Provincial 
Executive Board) of the SPSI verified those statements and 
expressed his regrets that the business community in this 
province still does not regard the SPSI as a business partner 
but rather as a 'bogey-man'. 
  He said that for no obvious reason 28 large companies have 
disallowed SPSI PUKs in their companies. In addition, there are 
also about 30 companies which are not registered with SPSI's 
DPD. Not having an SPSI PUK in a company can invite labor 
disputes to surface in the form of strikes or demonstrations 
which are damaging to both parties. "If there is an SPSI PUK in 
the company, at the very least the problem can be overcome or it 
might never occur," affirmed South Kalimantan's SPSI Deputy 
Chairman. 
  He said that Law Number 21 of 1954 is not going as well as 
expected due to the absence of a labor organization in a 
company. A KKB (Joint Labor Agreement) between employers and 
employees is there to prevent possible disputes from arising. 
"That's why HIPs (PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation] 
Industrial Relations), such as those proposed by the government, 
are not going as well as expected in companies which have no 
SPSI PUK," said Syakhrian. 
  Based on figures taken from the Banjarmasin branch of Astek 
[Workmen's Insurance] Inc, there were 1,010 occupational 
accidents in 1993 and 951 in the previous year. BUMNs 
[State-Owned Corporations] under the Department of Manpower paid 
out 842 million rupiahs in compensation. 
  The amounts of compensation were: 762 JKK (Occupational 
Accident Insurance) cases; 179 JHT (Old-age Insurance) cases; 
and 77 JK (Life Insurance) cases. The main cause of occupational 
accidents was negligence.

  [Text] The Muria I Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator will 
continue to be built even though the government has given 
nuclear energy the lowest priority in national energy planning. 
Based on studies carried out since the 1970s the Minister of 
Research and Technology/Chairman of the BPPT [Research and 
Technology Development Agency] B. J. Habibie stated that it will 
be difficult for Indonesia to overcome its electricity crisis 
without incorporating nuclear power. 
  "Whether we want to or not, it will be difficult for 
Indonesia to overcome its energy problems without nuclear power. 
Up to now we haven't known how to do it. But we must be aware 
that nuclear power has the lowest priority. If there is no other 
way, we will take that path," he said here yesterday after 
giving a speech during the program of Choosing National Figures 
1993 in the FORUM KEADILAN magazine version. Habibie said this 
in response to various policy statements made by a number of 
national figures about the development of the Muria I 
Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator. 
  Habibie said that even though nuclear power has been given 
the lowest priority, construction will continue on the Muria I 
Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator project. This will be done, 
he continued, to get ready to face an electric energy crisis. 
Preliminary feasibility studies carried out by Newjec Inc 
(Japan) were completed in December 1993; they concluded that 
constructing the PLTN in Muria is quite feasible. Further 
feasibility studies will not be completed until 1997. However, 
projections are that it will be opened to construction tenders 
in 1995. 
  The Muria I Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator will be the 
first nuclear-based electric generator built in Indonesia; it 
will have a capacity of 2,600 MW. The results of site studies 
show that Ujung Lemahabang is in first place, followed by Ujung 
Grengengan and then by Ujung Watu. These three sites are located 
on the north shore of the Muria peninsula in Central Java. 
  Is it necessary to hold a referendum to obtain the agreement 
of the populace? Habibie said that he is only helping the 
MPR's [Parliament] mandate by gathering scientific and 
technological information. His strategic goal is to create job 
opportunities. "The GBHN [Broad Outlines of the Nation's 
Direction] demands these job opportunities. But job 
opportunities need factories and factories need electricity. 
Some people say no, just build up the tourist industry, build 
hotels. But hotels also need electricity, you know. So we can't 
build without electricity," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
plan to hold a high-level meeting in Tokyo next week on foreign 
affairs and defense, Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi 
said Tuesday. 
  The meeting will take place when U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher visits Japan from March 9 to 11, Aichi said. 
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will not join the 
mission but Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner will 
accompany Christopher and attend the meeting, he said. 
  Japan will be represented by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and Aichi, Japanese officials said. 
  The planned gathering aims to promote communication and 
understanding between the foreign and defense chiefs to prevent 
the bilateral trade friction from affecting security affairs, 
Aichi said. 
  Christopher will visit Japan as part of a three-nation tour 
of the Asia-Pacific region. While in Tokyo, he will attend an 
international conference on reconstruction of Cambodia on March 
10 and 11 and meet Japanese leaders to discuss a broad range of 
bilateral issues.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Washington appears to be 
more concerned with prying open Japan's auto market than with 
Japan's macroeconomic policy, the trade minister said Tuesday [1 
March]. 
  Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister, 
disclosed that he had talks with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter 
Mondale last weekend. 
  Mondale said Japan has more to do to open its auto market 
than addressing macroeconomic issues, Kumagai told a regular 
press conference. 
  Mondale spoke "very harshly" on Japan's trade stance, said 
Kumagai. 
  Kumagai's remarks indicate Tokyo's understanding that the 
United States places highest priority on auto and auto parts 
issues under the bilateral trade "framework" talks. 
  Kumagai said the Japanese auto industry should "listen 
earnestly" to U.S. discontent over slow access to the Japanese 
auto market, which is to suggest the industry should push ahead 
with a voluntary plan to expand purchases of U.S.-made 
automobiles and auto components. 
  On the state of the nation's economy, Kumagai said there are 
signs of an increase in activity, citing the latest improvement 
in employment and manufacturing statistics. 
  It is still unclear if the recession has bottomed out or not 
but overall sentiment has turned upward, he noted. 
  It is unlikely that Japan's economy alone would stay in the 
doldrums, Kumagai said.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 28 KYODO -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor indicated Monday [28 February] the 
U.S. Government is firming up its Japan trade policy after 
reviewing policy options and recommendations over the past two 
weeks. "We have made a number of decisions," Kantor said. 
  He would not disclose what action, if any, the United States 
might take but U.S. officials have said one policy option is to 
resurrect the so-called "Super 301" provision, which would allow 
Washington to retaliate against countries deemed to be engaging 
in unfair trade practices. 
  President Bill Clinton and other senior U.S. officials have 
repeatedly said the U.S. is reviewing actions on Japan following 
the collapse of trade talks between the two countries February 
11. 
  Kantor told reporters after making a speech on trade policy 
that the Clinton administration has reached a number of 
decisions on Japan but the process of policy review has yet to 
be completed. 
  "We still have a number of other options and we continue to 
make decisions as we proceed," he said. 
  Kantor would give little information when pressed by 
reporters about the options and policy recommendations under 
consideration. 
  Asked whether the emerging U.S. trade policy on Japan will 
include revival of Super 301, he replied, "we will announce it 
when we are ready."

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan urged the United 
States on Monday [28 February] to further rationalize the use of 
military facilities in Okinawa Prefecture, Japanese officials 
said. 
  Ichiro Yoneyama, head of the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency, made the request in meetings with Winston 
Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific 
affairs, and Stanley Roth, deputy assistant secretary of defense 
for East Asia and the Pacific. 
  Yoneyama particularly raised the issue of port facilities in 
Naha where the U.S. military faces continuing pressure from 
local authorities to hand over the naval base in the provincial 
capital. 
  Both Lord and Roth expressed their understanding of the 
Okinawan people's feelings and pledged their efforts to resolve 
the base issue through cooperation with Japanese authorities, 
the Japanese officials said.

  [Text] Takamatsu, March 1 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji visited western Japan on Tuesday [1 March] to inspect 
the Seto Ohashi bridge linking the islands of Honshu and Shikoku. 
  Zhu, who arrived in Japan last Wednesday for a nine-day 
visit, was briefed by administrative officials on the 
construction of the 13.1-kilometer structure, which is actually 
a string of bridges across five islets in the inland sea. 
  A number of Chinese dignitaries have visited the site since 
it was opened to automobile and rail traffic in April 1988. 
  The bridges link Kojima in Okayama Prefecture on Honshu with 
Sakaide in Kagawa Prefecture on Shikoku. 
  The same construction technology is being used for a 1.4- 
kilometer suspension bridge over the Ma Wan channel that will 
link mainland Hong Kong with Lantau Island. 
  The bridge will be open to vehicles and rail traffic after 
its completion, expected in mid-1997.

office of the Food Agency has halted consignments of its entire 
stock of imported Chinese rice after a Fukuoka rice wholesaler 
reported finding some of it was discolored, officials said 
Tuesday [1 March]. 
  The officials said they had stopped distribution of the rice 
because they have not yet finished inspecting it. 
  As a result, wholesalers in the area have suffered a 
shortage 
of Chinese rice to include in a special standard-priced blend 
that was to be made available Tuesday. 
  Some wholesalers have begun including the higher-priced 
United States rice in the blend, bearing the additional cost 
themselves. 
  The Chinese rice was imported in January and forms part of 
the 700 tons allotted to Fukuoka Prefecture in western Japan. 
The discoloring was found in mid-February. 
  The standard-priced rice in Fukuoka was to have contained 60 
percent U.S. rice, 20 percent Chinese rice and 20 percent Thai 
rice, and sell at 3,191 yen per 10 kilograms.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Canada expects its tight 
fiscal 1994 budget to keep Japanese financial institutions prime 
investors in Canadian debt instruments, Doug Peters, secretary 
of state for international financial institutions, said Tuesday 
[1 March]. 
  In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Peters said that 
while Canada's budget process "is not directed specifically to 
Japanese or any other foreign investors," the fact that the 
country has tackled its federal deficit will keep investors 
confident in Canada. 
  A former chief economist with one of his country's largest 
banks, Peters perhaps knows international financial markets 
better than many cabinet ministers. 
  He said the Japanese bank, brokerage and insurance company 
executives he met in Tokyo have all been encouraged by Canada's 
commitment to fiscal stability. 
  "We have been very pleased with the reception (to the 
budget) 
here," Peters said. 
  And it is no coincidence that Canada's junior finance 
minister is in Japan only days after Finance Minister Paul 
Martin brought down the budget February 22. 
  Japanese institutional investors hold more than 40 billion 
dollars in Canadian Government and private debt instruments, 
including federal and provincial bonds. 
  A loss of confidence in Canada, where the government of 
Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien took office only last autumn, could mean 
a massive sale of Canadian debt on international and domestic 
markets and a major headache for the new government. 
  Peters, who met with Japanese Government officials as well 
as 
financial executives, said he now has little fear of any heavy 
selling by Japanese investors. 
  "The Japanese are long term investors in Canada and I fully 
expect them to remain so," he said. 
  On other investment fronts, Peters said he also gained a 
"sense" that Japanese direct investment in Canadian business 
could increase. 
  Trade trouble with the United States "is very much on 
people's minds (in Japan)," and Canada could see increased 
direct investment because of worries about the U.S., Peters 
suggested. 
  "The other side of the question, however, is that saber 
rattling by the United States could make the Japanese very aware 
of importing from American companies. Canadians must make very 
sure that does not hurt their markets in Japan." 
  He also suggested that Canadians are "very interested" in 
U.S. attempts to open Japanese markets, particularly in 
financial services where he believes Canadian financial 
institutions have expertise. 
  "We are concerned about transparency in some rules that may 
shut us out of areas such as financial derivatives and other new 
financing methods where Canadians have a deservedly high 
reputation," he said. 
  Peters will visit investment institutions in Hong Kong on 
Wednesday before returning to Canada on Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria Trujillo said Tuesday [1 March] he is looking for a loan 
from the Export-Import Bank of Japan for development of 
Colombia's largest oil field. 
  Speaking at a news conference here, Gaviria said he asked 
for 
the loan earlier in the day when he met with Mitsuhide 
Yamaguchi, governor of the government-financed bank. 
  Gaviria quoted Yamaguchi as expressing interest in 
cooperating with Colombia in promoting a 6 billion dollar 
project to develop the Cusiana oil field, believed to have oil 
deposits of some 1.5 billion barrels. 
  Gaviria, who arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a five-day visit, 
said he expects an Ex-Im Bank loan to help encourage Japanese 
banks and companies to join the project. 
  On other topics, Gaviria said his country will make a formal 
application soon for membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Japan considers the shooting 
down of four warplanes over Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday is in 
line with a U.N. resolution imposing a no-fly zone over the 
country, top government spokesman Masayoshi Takemura said 
Tuesday. 
  "Japan understands that it was done based on Resolution 
816," 
which was passed in October 1992, Takemura said of the shooting 
down by U.S. F-16 fighters of four military aircraft in central 
Bosnia. 
  The chief cabinet secretary reiterated Japan's hope for the 
former Yugoslavia to achieve peace. 
  The F-16s under the command of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) shot down the planes that allegedly violated 
the U.N. no-fly zone over Bosnia. 
  It was the first time that NATO warplanes have fired on 
alleged violators since the no-fly zone was declared.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- The Export-Import Bank of 
Japan awarded an untied loan of up to 4.29 billion yen to 
Slovakia's central bank Monday [28 February], the 
government-financed bank said. 
  The loan to the National Bank of Slovakia is the first by 
the 
bank since the separation of the Czech and Slovak Federal 
Republic in January 1993. 
  The loan will be extended under a Japanese program launched 
in June 1993 designed to help developing countries, the bank 
said. 
  The financing is also in line with a pledge made by the 
Japanese Government in May 1992 to provide countries in central 
and eastern Europe with up to 300 million dollars to promote 
Japan-U.S. cooperation in these countries, it said. 
  The bank said the loan is intended to support development of 
the private sector in Slovakia, particularly small and midsize 
enterprises, in collaboration with a U.S. fund called the 
American Enterprise Fund. 
  An untied loan does not require its recipient to use the 
fund 
for purchases of goods and services from the lender.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange 
reserves jumped 2.46 billion dollars in February to 98.43 
billion dollars, posting the fourth consecutive month-to-month 
increase, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday [1 March]. 
  Market dealers said they had anticipated the surge as the 
Bank of Japan was seen buying the dollar actively to stem its 
plunge against the yen in the reporting month. 
  The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, 
gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights. 
  The official, as usual, declined to comment on details and 
reasons for the change in the foreign reserves. 
  Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign 
reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan. 
Dealers said the central bank bought billions of dollars in 
February to stop the yen's rise, boosted by speculation over 
U.S. comments tolerating a stronger yen after the February 11 
failure of the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks. 
  The ministry official said the dollar started the month at 
108.00 yen and ended at 104.30 yen, ranging from 101.90 yen 
posted on February 15 to 109.16 yen marked on February 7. 
  Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign 
reserves 
for the fourth month in a row, amassing 95.6 billion dollars as 
of December, the most recent comparable figures with other 
nations. 
  Taiwan came in second with 84.5 billion dollars as of 
November. 
  In December, Germany posted 82.5 billion dollars, the United 
States 74.9 billion dollars and Spain 41.8 billion dollars, the 
official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- The government will 
establish a scholarship scheme for overseas students to study at 
Japanese universities on a short-term basis in fiscal 1994 
beginning in April, government sources said Saturday [26 
February]. 
  The sources said that in its first year of operation, the 
scholarship program will pay 100,000 yen a month to 100 South 
Korean students each for up to one year of study at universities 
in Japan. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will officially announce 
the 
program in talks with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam who is 
scheduled to arrive in Japan for an official visit on March 24. 
  Japan's public and private universities have some 2,700 
exchange agreements with foreign universities. 
  One source at the Education Ministry's student exchange 
division said that of these, 142 are with universities in South 
Korea, but because of the high cost of living in Japan, only 20 
or 30 South Korean students a year study in Japan under existing 
scholarship programs. 
  As a result, many universities have appealed to the ministry 
to introduce some form of support for overseas students. 
  During a visit to South Korea in November, Hosokawa promised 
Kim to expand the Japanese Government's intake of students. 
  The sources said the number of students covered by the 
scholarships and the countries they come from will be increased 
from fiscal 1995. 
  Applicants for the scholarships should apply through the 
university of their choice from July.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Tuesday that he will make a decision Wednesday on 
whether to immediately reshuffle his nearly seven-month-old 
cabinet. Hosokawa made the remark to reporters following a 
series of separate meetings with coalition party leaders to seek 
agreement on his plan to shake up the cabinet. 
  The prime minister also hinted at pushing for the reshuffle 
even if coalition partners remain divided over the matter, 
saying "it is very difficult for all the coalition parties to 
see eye-to-eye (on the issue)." Hosokawa said a cabinet 
shake-up without receiving full consent from each of the 
coalition partners is "theoretically possible." 
  The primary purpose of the cabinet reorganization is widely 
believed to be the replacement of Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, top governmental spokesman and chief of 
staff, who has been at odds with Hosokawa over several of the 
government's important policy themes. 
  Takemura told Hosokawa in a meeting that a cabinet reshuffle 
could lead to the collapse of the coalition government, sources 
said. Takemura maintains he will not take another cabinet post 
if Hosokawa changes his cabinet, the sources said. 
  The sources said the two men also have not seen eye-to-eye 
over the course of the seven-party coalition, with Hosokawa 
favoring closer ties with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
Komeito and Takemura against it. 
  Among the seven coalition parties, the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the 
Sakigake (Harbinger) headed by Takemura are opposed to an early 
cabinet reshuffle, while Shinseito and Komeito are endorsing the 
premier's plan. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama asked Hosokawa to drop his 
intention for an early shake-up, saying he spoke of the need for 
the cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues and expressed 
his objection to Hosokawa's plan. 
  Hosokawa explained he wanted to focus on pressing economic 
issues such as strained trade ties with the U.S. and economic 
deregulation and sought the SDP's cooperation, Murayama said. 
  Murayama reiterated that the government must concentrate on 
passing the fiscal 1994 state budget as early as possible as a 
way to breathe life into the ailing Japanese economy. 
  DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi also expressed his opposition to a 
hasty cabinet reshuffle at a meeting with Hosokawa. 
  Ouchi told reporters he called on Hosokawa to discuss the 
fate of Takemura. 
  Hosokawa also cited as a major reason for the plan growing 
complaints within the ruling coalition and from bureaucrats 
about Takemura's work as the top government spokesman and chief 
policy coordinator, said Ouchi who serves as health and welfare 
minister. 
  Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, meanwhile, told Hosokawa that 
the party will suport the scheme to reshape the cabinet. 
  Hata, who serves as foreign minster and deputy prime 
minister, said he notified Hosokawa of his backing in a meeting 
at the premier's official residence. 
  "Behind the premier's plan is his desire to run the cabinet 
more smoothly." We support that kind of notion," said Hata who 
heads the core party in the alliance along with Ichiro Ozawa, a 
chief coalition strategist.

  Ouchi, who serves as health and welfare minister, was the

cabinet, following Takemura and Social Democratic Party Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Tuesday started holding separate talks with other 
party leaders in the ruling coalition to seek agreement on 
reshuffling his cabinet, possibly on Thursday. 
  Hosokawa has been trying to get rid of Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the top government spokesman and 
leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), for openly challenging his plans 
to introduce a national welfare tax, political sources said. 
  "The prime minister said he would like to carry out a 
cabinet 
reshuffle if conditions permit," Takemura said at an afternoon 
press conference, adding he reiterated his opposition to a 
cabinet change. 
  The sources said the two men also have been at odds over the 
course of the seven-party coalition, with Hosokawa favoring 
closer ties with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito and 
Takemura against it. [passage omitted containing previously 
filed material] 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama restated his opposition to an 
immediate reshuffle, saying Diet passage of the national budget 
for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1 should be the top priority. 
  "It is necessary to have the budget passed through the Diet 
as quickly as possible," he told a news conference. He said 
Hosokawa "should restrain himself and avoid a cabinet shake-up 
at this time." 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to deliver his policy speech to the 
Diet on Friday, and sources close to the 56-year-old premier 
said he hopes to reshuffle his near seven-month-old cabinet by 
then. 
  Hosokawa and his supporters in the coalition reportedly 
favor 
replacing Takemura in addition to Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii due to a money scandal and International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai because of a dispute with 
bureaucrats over the firing of Masahisa Naito, chief of the 
ministry's industrial policy bureau. 
  Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency, is also likely to be relieved of her duties, sources 
said. 
  Murayama of the SDP, the largest force in the coalition, 
said 
he will reiterate his opposition to an early cabinet reshuffle 
when he meets with Hosokawa later Tuesday. He said it should 
wait until after the budget program wins Diet approval. 
  The SDP chief predicted Hosokawa will eventually have to 
give 
up his plan for an immediate changeover. 
  Asked what he would do if asked to join a new cabinet, 
Murayama replied that he has not given serious thought to such a 
possibility, saying, "I haven't heard any such proposal at all." 
  Hosokawa told a House of Representatives panel on political 
reform that the government has time to change the cabinet 
because it has overcome its most difficult tasks -- political 
reform and completing the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 
  Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party's Diet 
affairs committee, told a news conference the SDP opposes a 
reshuffle. "We believe now is not an appropriate time," he said. 
  He also said it is better to wait until after the Diet 
approves the fiscal 1994 state budget, expected in early May. 
  Hosokawa formed the cabinet last August to carry out 
political reforms, and apparently thinks the cabinet will have 
accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political reform 
legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or Friday, the 
sources said. The legislation was enacted in January. 
  Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata said he understands moves to 
remove Takemura from his present post, adding that a party head 
assuming the post of chief cabinet secretary has a difficulty in 
helping a prime minister as a close aide in the coalition 
government. 
  Hata, who is also deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, 
said party leaders do not necessarily share the prime minister's 
views, as they belong to different parties. 
  For his part, Hata flatly denied he will assume the post of 
chief cabinet secretary.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa is to hold separate talks with other party leaders in 
the ruling coalition to seek agreement on reshuffling his 
cabinet, political sources said Tuesday. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference, however, that it is unclear whether Hosokawa will 
have talks with the coalition leaders. 
  Hosokawa reiterated his hope for an early cabinet reshuffle, 
saying he will make up his mind in a day or two on whether to 
make changes. 
  He told a House of Representatives panel on political 
reform, 
that the government has time to change the nearly 
seven-month-old cabinet as it has overcome its most difficult 
tasks -- political reform and completing the Uruguay Round of 
world trade talks. 
  Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party's 
[SDP] 
Diet Affairs Committee, told a news conference his party is 
opposed to an immediate cabinet shake-up. "We believe now is 
not an appropriate time," he said. He also said it is better to 
wait until after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994 state budget, 
expected in early may. 
  Hosokawa is considering drastically shaking up the cabinet 
and his planned reshuffle is expected to center on removing 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from that key post. 
  Hosokawa formed the cabinet last August to carry out 
political reforms, and he apparently thinks the cabinet will 
have accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political 
reform legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or 
Friday, the sources said. The legislation was enacted in 
January. 
  Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, who is also director 
general of the Management and Coordination Agency, said he is 
opposed to the meetings between Hosokawa and the other coalition 
leaders, which the sources said could take place as early as 
Tuesday. 
  Ishida said the prime minister has the right under the 
Constitution to make changes in his cabinet. 
  Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito, one of the seven coalition 
parties, said in a lecture to a group of SDP Diet members that 
he opposes a "drastic cabinet reshuffle," which he said would 
trigger political confusion. Despite his opposition to a 
large-scale shake- up, he backs the removal of Takemura from his 
post. 
  Hata said he understands moves to remove Takemura from his 
present post, adding that a party head assuming the post of 
chief cabinet secretary has a difficulty in helping a prime 
minister as a close aide in the coalition government. Takemura 
heads Sakigake, a coalition party with close ties with 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party. 
  Hata, who is also deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, said party leaders do not necessarily share the prime 
minister's views, as they belong to different parties. 
  For his part, Hata flatly denied he will assume the post of 
chief cabinet secretary. 
  The coalition parties have split over Hosokawa's reshuffle 
plan, with SDP, the Democratic Socialist Party and Sakigake 
opposed to dumping Takemura, while Shinseito and Komeito support 
the plan. 
  Meanwhile, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama reiterated his 
opposition to an immediate cabinet reshuffle, saying Diet 
passage of the national budget for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1 
should be the top priority. 
  "It is necessary to have the budget passed through the Diet 
as quickly as possible,'' he told a news conference. He said 
Hosokawa ''should restrain himself and avoid a cabinet shake-up 
at this time." 
  Murayama said he will reiterate his opposition to an early 
cabinet reshuffle when he meets with Hosokawa later Tuesday. 
The premier has yet to ask for a meeting, he added. 
  The SDP chief predicted Hosokawa will eventually have to 
give 
up his plan for an immediate reshuffle. 
  He said a cabinet shake-up should wait until after the 
budget 
program wins Diet approval. 
  Asked what he would do if asked to join a new cabinet, 
Murayama said he has not given serious thought to such a 
possibility, and that "I haven't heard any such proposal at all."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Ryutaro Hashimoto, 
chairman of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] 
Policy Affairs Research council, said Monday [28 February] that 
political parties should be accorded the status of nonprofit 
organizations when it comes to accepting donations. 
  Hashimoto said at the Foreign Corrrespondents' Club of Japan 
that the ruling coalition has not demonstrated support for the 
idea, which has been pressed by the LDP. 
  He also said it would take considerable time for the next 
general election to be held if it is conditioned on firm 
establishment of the new electoral system and sufficient 
promotional activities targeting public opinion. 
  He said no one should completely rule out the possibility of 
the House of Representatives being dissolved and new elections 
being held under the current electoral system. 
  Asked about Japan's chronic and mounting trade surpluses, 
Hashimoto suggested it could be ameliorated somewhat if Japan 
were to procure materials from Europe and North America to use 
as aid for particular regions of the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives approved a revised package of political reform 
measures on Tuesday [1 March], hours after approval by a 
political reform panel. 
  The package was sent to the House of Councillors. 
  The revised package, jointly submitted to the Diet by the 
governing coalition and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), features changes in the districts of proportional 
representation for lower house elections and in corporate 
donations to political fund-raising organizations. 
  The original government package banned corporate donations 
to 
politicians and their fund-raising organizations, but the 
revised bills will allow firms to donate up to 500,000 yen per 
year during the next five years as a temporary provision. 
  The package maintains that 300 seats in the lower house will 
be elected through a single-seat constituency system and the 
remaining 200 by a system of proportional representation. 
Current lower house members are elected from constituencies 
with two to six seats. 
  The package was passed on January 29 at the last 
extraordinary session of the Diet shortly after Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed that the 
amendments and date of enforcement would be discussed during the 
current ordinary session. 
  On February 24, the ruling coalition and the LDP agreed on 
the revisions weeks after discussions of the package began. 
  Lower house elections based on the political reform 
legislation will be able to commence after a bill on the 
locations of the 300 single-seat constituencies clears the 
parliament.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- A private panel on defense 
set up by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to review Japan's 
two-decade old basic defense outline held its inaugural meeting 
Monday [28 February]. 
  "As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of 
the Cold War structure, our country's handling of defense and 
security must change as well," Hosokawa said in welcoming the 
nine panel members. 
  He called on the group to discuss new defense policies "from 
a stance that takes into account the changed international 
situation, technological progress and economic and human 
resources." 
  The panel is expected to put forward recommendations until 
July for a revision of the national defense program outline, 
which has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976. 
  The program calls for the government to maintain security 
arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up 
Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasion. 
  Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, 
including Japan's future role in United Nations-led peacekeeping 
operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the 
defense agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995. 
  The panel groups Kuniko Inoguchi, a Sophia University 
professor, Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador to the United 
States, Bank of Tokyo Chairman Toyoo Gyohten, and Makoto Sakuma, 
former chairman of the Joint Staff Council. 
  The other members are Seiki Nishihiro, former vice minister 
for the Defense Agency, Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of ASAHI 
Breweries Ltd., Shinji Fukukawa, vice president of Kobe Steel 
Ltd., Ken Moroi, chairman of Chichibu Cement Co., and Akio 
Watanabe, an Aoyama Gakuin University professor.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- A private panel on defense 
created by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa kicked off 
discussion Monday with an eye toward reviewing Japan's 
two-decade-old defense policies. 
  "As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of 
the Cold War structure, our country's handling of defense and 
security must change as well," Hosokawa said at the outset of 
the inaugural meeting of the panel. 
  The premier called on the forum to debate new defense 
policies "from a stance that takes into account the changed 
international situation, technological progress and economic and 
human resources." 
  Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of ASAHI Breweries Ltd., was 
elected as chairman of the nine-member group, with Ken Moroi, 
chairman of Chichibu Cement Co., as acting chairman. 
  Higuchi later told reporters the panel will discuss the 
background and the underlying philosophy of the national defense 
program outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense 
policy since 1976, as well as the current international 
situation. 
  The next meeting of the panel is scheduled for March 9. 
  The group will offer recommendations to Hosokawa by around 
summer for a revision of the national defense program outline 
after debating overall defense matters once a week, Higuchi said. 
  The program calls for the government to maintain security 
arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up 
Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasion. 
  Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, 
including Japan's future role in United Nations-led peacekeeping 
operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the 
Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995. 
  The nine members include Kuniko Inoguchi, a Sophia 
University 
professor, Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador to the United 
States and currently special adviser to the Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Bank of Tokyo Chairman Toyoo 
Gyohten, and Makoto Sakuma, former Joint Staff Council chairman 
and currently special consultant for Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. 
  The other members are Seiki Nishihiro, former vice minister 
for the Defense Agency and currently adviser to Tokyo Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co., Shinji Fukukawa, vice president of Kobe 
Steel Ltd., and Akio Watanabe, an Aoyama Gakuin University 
professor.

  [Text] Shizuoka, March. 1 KYODO -- Participants in a 
rally appealed Tuesday [1 March] to rid the world of nuclear 
weaponry as they gathered to commemorate the 40th anniversary of 
a nuclear mishap involving a Japanese fishing vessel in the 
Pacific Ocean. 
  Some 1,600 members of peace organizations and religious 
groups across the country took part in the rally held in Yaizu, 
Shizuoka Prefecture, to commemorate the nuclear incident, which 
occurred off the Bikini atoll in the South Pacific on March 1, 
1954. 
  In the so-called lucky dragon incident, the Japanese fishing 
boat No. 5 Fukuryu Maru ("Lucky Dragon V"), which was based in 
Yaizu, was showered by a cloud of radioactive ash after the 
United States conducted a thermonuclear bomb test some 135 
kilometers to the west of where the ship was conducting fishing 
operations. 
  Most of the 23 crew members suffered nausea, pain and skin 
inflammation and one of the crew later died. 
  The incident sparked outcries in Japan against the U.S. 
testing of nuclear weapons and attracted worldwide interest in 
the influence of radioactivity on the human body. 
  At the rally, the participants adopted a resolution calling 
for the dismantling of all nuclear arms while the radiation 
victims or their bereaved families are still alive. 
  Among the participants was John Anjani, who was then mayor 
of 
a village near the atoll and was also exposed to radioactive 
ash, and Anthony Guarisco, chairman of an association of U.S. 
veterans who fell victim to radioactivity from atomic testing.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's overall wholesale 
prices fell 0.3 percent in the second 10 days of February from 
the previous 10 days, while showing a 3.2 percent dip from a 
year earlier, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] reported Monday [28 
February]. 
  The changes were measured on the central bank's wholesale 
price index, which stood at 93.5 against the base of 100 for 
1990. 
  Domestic wholesale prices alone were unchanged from the 
previous 10 days because higher prices for oil, coal and 
textiles were offset by lower prices for steel. 
  Compared with year-earlier levels, domestic wholesale prices 
were down 1.9 percent. 
  Export prices were unchanged from the previous 10 days in 
terms of currencies in which they were contracted, but up 4.7 
percent from a year earlier. 
  In yen terms, export prices were down 2.5 percent from the 
previous 10 days and down 6.2 percent from a year earlier. 
  Import prices were down 1.6 percent in yen terms from the 
previous 10 days and down 12.9 percent from a year earlier. 
  In terms of currencies used for signing contracts, import 
prices were up 0.1 percent from the preceding 10 days but down 
2.9 percent from a year earlier.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- A government panel on 
Monday [28 February] called for Japan to establish a stable and 
efficient method of ensuring oil supplies. 
  The Petroleum Council, an advisory body to the trade 
minister, held the first meeting of its subcommittee in charge 
of studying basic problems in the nation's oil policy. 
  The meeting is designed to infuse efficiency and 
competitiveness into the oil industry amid a growing call for 
deregulation in the industry and a shrinkage in a petroleum 
product price gap between Japan and overseas, said an official 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  The panel will map out an interim report in the middle of 
June in line with recommendations in a report prepared last year 
by the Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring, an advisory 
organ to the prime minister, the official said. 
  The report said rules and regulations in the oil industry 
should be reduced to "the minimum level necessary."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Japan's jobless rate inched 
down 0.1 percentage point to a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent 
in January from December, the first fall in four months, the 
Management and Coordination Agency reported Tuesday [1 March]. 
  The January jobless rate remained at a high level, following 
an identical 2.7 percent in October and November and a revised 
2.8 percent in December, the agency said in a preliminary report. 
  The December jobless rate was first reported as 2.9 percent, 
the highest since June 1987 when it stood at 3.0 percent to 
close in on the postwar high of 3.1 percent posted in may 1987. 
  The January jobless rate represents a decline of 0.4 
percentage point from a year earlier. 
  In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of 
job offers to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, 
rose to 0.67 in January from 0.65 in December, meaning that 
there were 67 jobs for every 100 people looking for work. 
  The dismal job reports come as many Japanese corporations 
are 
grappling with excessive labor forces in the wake of the 
prolonged recession. 
  According to the agency's report, the number of jobholders 
edged up 0.5 percent or 300,000 from a year earlier to 63.26 
million in January, a bigger increase than December's 100,000. 
  The number of people out of work jumped 21.1 percent or 
320,000 to 1.84 million as the manufacturing sector continues to 
fall victim to corporate moves to trim work forces. 
  In the manufacturing sector alone, the number of jobholders 
fell 2.7 percent or 410,000 to 14.84 million for the 15th 
consecutive monthly dip. 
  The long stretch of decline apparently reflects a growing 
trend among manufacturers toward shifting production abroad in a 
bid to cope with the negative effects of the stronger yen. 
  Employment in the agriculture sector also fell but that in 
the construction, wholesale, retail and food sectors increased 
from year-earlier levels. 
  Japan's unemployment rate would be higher if tallied by U.S. 
or European methods as members of the Self-Defense Forces and 
people working more than one hour in the last week of the month 
are counted as employed.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Millions of ordinary people the world over have 
reacted with approval towards the NATO response to the latest 
Serbian attacks. It had become only too obvious that Serbia had 
become both arrogant and complacent. Months of a varied conduct 
perpetrated against Bosnian Muslims had gone unchecked. In 
fact, many were becoming quite cynical of the U.S. because of 
its slow reactions to Serbian aggressions. 
  Malaysia was among the first group of nations that broke off 
diplomatic links with Serbia. At the same time, the Malaysian 
community has been providing both moral and material support for 
the harassed Bosnians. Now a unit of the Malaysian armed forces 
is with the UN Protection Force in Bosnia. It is, therefore, 
not surprising that all factions of the Malaysian community have 
voiced full support for the action taken by the Atlantic 
alliance. 
  If anything, the feeling is that this type of retaliation 
with military force should have been launched much earlier. The 
Serbs have only themselves to blame if the fighting escalates. 
Their horrendous ethnic-cleansing policy is nothing less than 
genocide. It is totally unprecedented in modern times. A small 
religious minority was singled out. The Bosnian Muslims have 
had to cope with the trauma of homelessness, starvation, and 
mass rape. The situation has been so bad that a special 
tribunal was set up to try the war crimes. A Malaysian judge is 
a member of the tribunal. 
  The NATO shooting of the Serbs' planes represents a new 
stage 
in the Bosnian crisis. It should cause the Serbs in Belgrade 
and outside it to face reality. To try to force a solution 
through military means is going to be counter-productive. 
Everyone knows that the political situation in the former 
Yugoslavia is very messy and complicated. There are various 
issues to be settled. They are not unique to Yugoslavia. 
  Many multi-ethnic nations have been able to work out 
reasonable solutions for their internal governments. Wherever 
the give-and- take spirit has been prominent, a stable order has 
emerged. What the Serb leaders did was to grab as much 
territory as possible forcibly. They have so far only paid lip 
service to negotiations. Serbian propaganda has not hesitated to 
claim that the planes shot down by the NATO aircraft were 
somebody else's. The world will know how much credibility to 
attach to this story. 
  The UN troops serving under difficult conditions in Bosnia 
will be greatly encouraged by the use of air power. For 
thousands of Bosnian Muslims, too, this action will be a great 
morale booster. Everyone hopes that the Serb leadership will 
draw the obvious conclusion. No one wants to see an escalation 
of the fighting. The Serbs must accept peaceful solutions for 
all problems.

  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Sat. [26 February] -- Malaysia 
today condemned the massacre of Palestinians at the al-Haram 
al-Ibrahim mosque in Hebron yesterday in which dozens were 
killed after a Jewish gunman opened fire on worshippers 
performing prayers. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi 
said Malaysia was deeply saddened by the incident which occurred 
in a holy place while Muslims were observing the fasting month. 
  He said Israel could not escape responsibility for the dawn 
attack which was the biggest single killing of Arabs since 
Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. The 
massacre reflected the gravity of the situation in the occupied 
territories and the urgent need for Israel to change its 
policies and practices for the areas. Israeli authorities had to 
adhere to international obligations by respecting the rights of 
the Palestinians and its holy place, he said. 
  "Those responsible for the massacre must be made accountable 
and the entire incident should not be dismissed as the action of 
an alleged mad man," he said in a statement. He said Malaysia 
wanted the international community, in particular the United 
Nations to provide effective protection to the Palestinians in 
the occupied territories. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 28 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
will spend RM [Malaysian ringgit] 16.2 billion (RM2.7 is 
equivalent to U.S.$1) in the next five years to develop its 
telecommunications industry to make it not only the hub of 
telecommunication activities in the region but also a strong 
telecommunication equipment exporter in the international 
market. Energy, Telecommunications and Post Minister S. Samy 
Vellu said Monday that as an emerging economy, the Malaysian 
telecommunication industry offers huge potential of investments, 
especially for highly sophisticated and imported equipment. 
  Malaysia's national telecommunication carrier, Telekom 
Malaysia Berhad [Limited], he said, would invest RM670 million 
for its local network and RM160 million for its international 
network. It would also fork out RM500 million for switching 
equipment, RM550 million for transmission and RM1.7 billion for 
rural telecommunications he added. [passage omitted] 
  The minister said private telecommunication companies like 
the ART 900 operator would invest RM800 million to provide high 
quality services while Time Telecom is expected to spend RM2 
billion to build its Telecommunications network. Malaysia 
currently has two major local manufacturers of telecommunication 
equipment, he said. 
  In view of strong growth in demand for telecommunication 
services, we are encouraging joint-venture projects with 
multinational manufacturers to produce or assemble 
telecommunication equipment locally. Malaysia is strategically 
placed to play this role, he said. 
  On the telecommunication networks and services in Malaysia, 
Samy Vellu said that for the period 1991 to 1995, the government 
had targetted more than 100 per cent increase in the number of 
telephone subscribers to about 3.4 million. 
  In the subsequent five-year period (1995-2000), we hope to 
push our basic telephone to 7.8 million (subscribers), an 
increase by more than 4.4 million over the Sixth Malaysia Plan 
period, he added. 
  Samy Vellu also offered the use of Malaysia's first 
satellite, Measet I, to other Asia-Pacific countries on a 
mutually beneficial commercial basis once it is launched into 
orbit in 1995. He said Measat would provide economic and 
commercial benefits to users for both fixed and mobile 
telecommunication services such as telephone, telex, facsimile, 
data, video conferencing and television broadcasting.

  [Excerpts] Kota Kinabalu, Wed. -- Former Sabah Affairs 
Minister Tun Datuk Mustapha Datuk Harun today joined the Parti 
Bersatu Sabah [PBS or Sabah United Party] and declared that 
efforts to pursue the registration of USNO Baru [New United 
Sabah National Organization] would be abandoned. 
  Mustapha's son, Datuk Amirkahar, who is former president of 
USNO, Datuk Salim Bacho (former deputy president), Pitting Ali, 
and Said Senang (former vice presidents), who had joined PBS 
"temporarily" to contest in the recent state election, confirmed 
they are staying on in the party. Another USNO vice-president 
Ramli Wen and five former Supreme Council members also joined 
the PBS with Mustapha. 
  Mustapha was welcomed into the PBS by its president Datuk 
Sri 
Joseph Pairin Kitingan, his once bitter political rival, at a 
simple ceremony at Sri Gaya, Pairin's official residence. The 
74-year-old founder of the deregistered USNO said he decided to 
join the PBS because he was now convinced that only the PBS 
could protect the interests and rights of the people in the 
state. [passage omitted] 
  In January this year, Mustapha resigned from his federal 
cabinet post and as an UMNO member, citing his deteriorating 
health and failure to unite the people under UMNO. The veteran 
politician's decision to join the PBS did not come as a surprise 
as he had thrown his weight behind the party in the recently 
concluded State election. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Singapore -- The Singapore government has assured 
foreign companies wishing to invest in the Singapore-styled 
Suzhou township that the rules which have been agreed upon with 
the Chinese will not change. "We can guarantee that the 
agreement we have reached with China about Suzhou, and about 
projects in Shandong (province), will be honoured. That 
includes projects like the revitalising of state-owned 
factories," said Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew in an interview 
with the Beijing-based correspondent of the German financial and 
business daily, Handelsblatt. 
  A transcript of the interview, conducted on Feb 19 at the 
Istana [State Palace] here, was made available to BT [BUSINESS 
TIMES] yesterday. Safeguarding the interests of foreign 
companies which ride on the Singapore connection is one of the 
ways whereby third parties may benefit from the guanxi [personal 
connections] which Singapore's business community has built up 
in China. "Singapore will provide the means to a relationship, 
help in negotiations to reach agreement and to make the 
agreement work," he said. 
  Singapore has a role to play to help foreign companies move 
into China, because China needs investors from the whole world, 
not just from Hong Kong, Taiwan or the overseas Chinese, said Mr 
Lee. Unfamiliarity with Chinese culture and language, coupled 
with the lack of legality in China, has made some investors 
uncomfortable, which is where Singapore companies with guanxi 
come in. 
  Mr Lee admitted that although Singapore's agreements with 
China are on paper, they "are never as clear-cut as we would 
have with Western countries". Only the broad outlines are laid 
down, while much is unwritten, unspoken and depends on good 
faith. 
  Mr Lee arrived yesterday in Tianjin, only a 
one-and-a-half-hour drive from Beijing where he will be signing 
an agreement tomorrow for the so-called "software transfer" from 
Singapore to China. The government-to-government agreement will 
allow Singapore to pass on its experience in running a modern 
city through the development of a 70 sq km township in Suzhou, 
which is some 90 km from Shanghai. 
  Mr Lee said one of the changes to the centralised system 
which today's China has to make, is to unify its tax system. 
This will address the dichotomy which arises from the fact that 
while everything is centralised, the provinces collect their own 
taxes and therefore begin to act independently. China has to 
change its regulations, and which is more difficult, its 
mindsets. 
  Mr Lee said the transformation will take over 20 to 30 
years, 
and will involve some dislocation. By then, growth rates would 
be between six and eight percent, and between 50 percent and 60 
percent of Chinese will live in towns. "That's a different 
China. The majority of the population will be together, with 
quick and easy access to real time information. They will have 
to evolve a system to govern this different China," said Mr Lee.

  [Text] A Singapore-registered company will launch a new 
airline this year to operate mainly within Myanmar [Burma], 
according to industry sources. Air Mandalay will have its 
headquarters in Mandalay, operating domestically to Yangon 
[Rangoon], Pagan and Heho. International sectors Phuket and 
Chiang Mai in Thailand are also being considered. Air Mandalay 
will operate two Avions de Transport Regional (ATR) 72-210's. 
The Franco-Italian twin turboprops capable of carrying up to 72 
passengers is also in service with other airlines in Indochina. 
  The service will be well timed to coincide with the Myanmar 
government's declared "Year of Tourism" in 1995. 
  Pilots and technical staff are expected to be expatriates, 
however cabin crew will be recruited locally. The airline is a 
subsidiary of Techmat Holdings Pte Ltd which was registered on 
Nov 6, 1991. 
  The group has an authorised and paid-up capital of $30 
million [Singapore currency] and $3.05 million respectively. 
Turnover for the financial year ended December 1992 was 
$614,133, while pre-tax profit was $1,730. The group's 
shareholders and directors are Thai, French and Singapore 
nationals.

  [Text] Government-linked Chartered Semiconductor 
Manufacturing [CSM], which today breaks ground on a US$660 
million (S$1.05 billion) [Singapore currency] plant at 
Woodlands, said yesterday it had signed up four joint venture 
partners. It also said it would spend U.S.$100 million expanding 
its existing plant, called Fab 1, at the Science Park. 
  For the Woodlands factory, the Economic Development Board 
[EDB] is believed to be one of the partners which will fork out 
part of U.S.$200 million which CSM expects to raise for phase 
one of the project. This will be EDB's second major commitment 
in the semiconductor business -- it has a 26 percent stake in 
the U.S. $330 million Tech Semiconductor project, which is next 
to the CSM site at Woodlands. 
  The other three partners in the CSM venture are U.S.-based 
listed firms -- Rockwell International, Brooktree Corp and Actel 
Corp. CSM, which is part of the Singapore Technologies Ventures 
stable, will start negotiations with three other partners next 
month. It expects to rope in up to six partners for the 
project, called Fab 2. Plans for the plant -- which will be 
Singapore's largest high-tech investment -- were announced three 
months ago. 
  The Government, having made Singapore the world's largest 
producer of disk drives, wants semiconductor technology to be 
the country's strength in the next decade and is leading the way 
with these projects. 
  Rockwell, which has been a good customer of Fab 1, designs 
chips for use in aerospace, missiles and defence-electronics 
systems. The company, which had 1993 sales of about U.S.$ 10.8 
billion, gets most of its orders from the U.S. government. 
  Brooktree Corp, which grossed sales of U.S.$ 111.3 million 
last year, is involved in Very Large Scale Integrated circuits 
that solve complex technical problems. It also develops chips 
for the multimedia industry. 
  Actel, with 1993 sales of about U.S.$59.6 million, designs 
circuits for computers, telecom products and military equipment. 
  CSM's facility systems director Ang Tang Yong said yesterday 
that the three partners will be "guaranteed manufacturing 
capacity based on equity participation. They will also be given 
preferential pricing."

<F P=106> [From the "International report" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] In Fiji, one-time coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka has 
been sworn in as prime minister for second term as the country's 
elected leader. He survived the leadership challenge which led 
to a snap election just 20 months into his first term in office. 
Fiji votes under a racial system guaranteeing indigenous Fijian 
dominance in the Parliament. However, Mr. Rabuka now has a 
stronger mandate and says he can work with the country's other 
major race, the Indians. Erina Reddan reports from Fiji: 
  [Begin recording] [Reddan] (?Several observers said) Fiji 
has 
voted along racial lines. The smaller multiracial parties were 
the big losers as Fiji went for the more established Fijian and 
Indian parties. 
  Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka's SPT [Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa 
ni Taukei] Party won most of the Fijian seats -- 31 of the 37 -- 
which successfully fought off the challenge by the new 
one-month-old Fijian Association. Its leader and long-time 
Rabuka rival, Josevata Kamikamica, who launched the leadership 
challenge last November which led to the snap poll, has lost his 
seat. Mr. Rabuka can now lead the government apparently 
unhampered by internal strife. On the Indian side, the 
electorate also returned to its party of tradition, the National 
Federation Party. It won 20 of the 27 seats at the expense of 
the Labor Party, which lost heavily -- down from 13 to six seats. 
  Despite the strong race vote, there is more chance now 
healing the bitter rift between Indians and Fijians at any time 
since the 1987 military coups which overthrew an 
Indian-dominated government and led to systematic discrimination 
against Indians. The extremist anti-Indian Nationalists lost 
their five seats, while the Fijian SPT Party and the Indian 
National Federation Party are both talking about understanding 
each other. After swearing in Prime Minister Rabuka, President 
Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara called for a Fiji free of racial conflict. 
  [Mara] People of Fiji: The world is watching us closely, and 
there are some who still believe our nation of many races, 
cultures, and faiths is doomed to failure. As your chosen 
government takes office, let us once more show the naysayers the 
depth and strength of this country and our determination to find 
common ground for a common future. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Suva, March 2 (AFP) -- Fiji's newly re-elected 
Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka demanded complete honesty from 
his streamlined cabinet of 12 ministers at their first meeting 
here Wednesday. [passage omitted] 
  Rabuka also stressed that his ministers must discharge their 
duties impartially and serve the government and the people of 
Fiji to the best of their ability. The prime minister also 
requested the ministers disclose in confidence a full list of 
their holdings of stocks in companies and shares they have 
acquired after taking office. 
  His moves followed reports last year that Rabuka's wife and 
one of his cabinet ministers had shares in a construction 
company which had won a five million Fiji dollar (3.2 million US 
dollar) contract to upgrade Fiji's international airport at 
Nadi, on the western edge of the main island. At the time Rabuka 
denied he had anything to do with the awarding of the contract 
to the company, whose bid was the lowest, and later his wife and 
the cabinet minister sold their shares.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who is on an 
official visit in New Zealand, has concluded his contacts in 
Wellington. Yasar Kefeli from the Turkish Radio and Television 
team in Wellington reports the following: 
  [Begin Kefeli recording] The significant role New Zealand, a 
UN Security Council member, can play in the solution of regional 
issues such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Karabakh was discussed at 
the talks Cetin held in Wellington. The restructuring of the UN 
Security Council and how it can become more effective were also 
discussed at the talks. Cetin was also received by New Zealand 
Prime Minister Jim Bolger. He also met with Donald Charles 
McKinnon, New Zealand deputy prime minister and minister of 
external relations and trade. 
  Later official talks were held between the two delegations 
headed Cetin and McKinnon. The two ministers held a joint news 
conference after the talks. Cetin said that bilateral and 
regional relations were discussed at the talks and that the 
situation in Middle East, Iraq, the Balkans and the Caucasus 
were discussed within this framework. Cetin stated that if the 
tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina does not end then similar 
incidents might occur in other regions in the world as well, 
adding that the Armenian occupation of part of Azerbaijani 
territory constitutes such an example. [end recording]

  [Text] Vanuatu has a new president. Jean Marie Leye was 
sworn in today as the country's third president after two 
previous attempts to elect a national leader failed. South 
Pacific correspondent Erina Reddan reports one opposition group 
crossed the floor to support the government's candidate, paving 
the way for a future coalition between the two groups. 
  [Begin Reddan recording] In the third attempt to elect a 
president, the political deadlock was broken when one opposition 
group, the Vanuaaku Pati [VP], voted with the government to 
achieve the required two-thirds majority. 
  Leader of the VP and of the opposition, Donald Kalpokas, is 
confident that within a few days his party will have formally 
joined the government. The VP's nine seats in Parliament will 
bolster Prime Minister Maxine Carlot Korman's slim majority. 
  President Leye, 61 years old, formerly the vice president of 
the ruling Union of Moderate Parties, was elected with 41 votes. 
Five went to Father John Bani, and nine were spoiled or left 
blank. After being sworn in, the president said today's 
consensus was only the start of greater harmony and unity in 
Vanuatu. [end recording]

  [Text] Hanoi, March 2 (AFP) -- The first round of 
discussions between Vietnam and the United States on recovering 
seized property at the end of the Vietnam War ended here "with 
positive results," the foreign ministry said Wednesday. 
  "There are still some concrete problems that will be 
discussed at the next meeting at the working level," a foreign 
ministry spokesman told AFP without specifying when or where the 
next round of discussions would take place. 
  U.S. State Department officials refused to comment on the 
talks. 
  The bilateral meeting, the first since Washington lifted an 
economic embargo on Vietnam on February 4, lasted two days and 
brought together State Department, Treasury and Justice 
Department officials with their Vietnamese counterparts. 
  Claims by the two sides are estimated to total more than 500 
million dollars in assets seized or frozen following the fall of 
Saigon in 1975. 
  The opening of reciprocal representative offices in Hanoi 
and 
Washington, proposed by US President Bill Clinton, has already 
been accepted in principle by Vietnam. 
  U.S. delegation leader, James Hall, at his own request 
visited sites of searches for American servicemen missing in 
action, said the Vietnamese spokesman.

  [Text] Hanoi, March 2 (AFP) -- Vietnamese Premier Vo Van 
Kiet has ruled out a compromise with the Vatican in a dispute on 
the appointments of priests, saying that his government must be 
consulted in the selection of clergy, according to an interview 
seen here Wednesday. 
  Kiet told the weekly newspaper Cong Giao va Dan Toc 
(Catholicism and the Nation) that the issue was one of "national 
sovereignty," as Vietnam had not signed any agreements with the 
Vatican allowing them to make unfettered decisions in their 
appointments. Each country had the right to ensure stability and 
order through its own rules, Kiet said, but adding that he 
believed the Vatican "would not create a tense situation and 
push the local church to violations of national laws." 
  After a brief thaw, when Vietnam relaxed some religious 
restrictions, relations between Hanoi and the Vatican worsened 
in September when authorities in Ho Chi Minh City rejected the 
appointment of Bishop Huynh Van Nghi as a "supervisor" of the 
church instead of deputy archbishop. 
  City officials denounced the move as a "Vatican plot" to 
install an exiled nephew of former South Vietnamese President 
Ngo Dinh Diem as successor to the current archbishop, who is 
more than 80 years old and ailing. Vietnamese officials said 
they had agreed that Nghi would be named deputy to replace 
Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh and accused the Vatican of 
manoeuvring to position Diem's nephew Nguyen Van Thuan in the 
job. Thuan was appointed deputy archbishop in 1975, but the 
communists took power in the then Saigon soon afterwards and 
refused to let him take up his post. He left Vietnam for Rome in 
1992 and has not been allowed to return. 
  Kiet praised Archbishop Binh in the interview, saying he had 
not failed in his duties to the nation, although "unfortunately, 
not all Vietnam's bishops have adopted this positive line." Some 
seven million people, or around 10 percent of Vietnam's 
population, are Catholic, making it the second largest church 
community in Asia after the Philippines. 
  But the problems between Hanoi and the Vatican have left the 
country without a cardinal, as no successor has yet been named 
to replace Trinh Van Canh, the archbishop of Hanoi who died in 
1990. Hanoi has also been irritated by a Vatican ruling that 
priests should not join any political organisations in Vietnam, 
including the Solidarity Committee of Patriotic Catholics, which 
comes under the Communist Party's Fatherland Front. Vietnam 
insists that Catholics belong to the committee but has denied 
accusations from the Vatican that it is trying to form a 
state-controlled church.

<F P=106> [NHAN DAN 2 March Editorial: "Strengthen the </F>
Vietnam-Singapore Relations of Friendship and Cooperation"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is paying an 
official friendship visit to Vietnam today. Following the 
official friendship visit to Singapore by party General 
Secretary Do Muoi and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, the official 
visit to Vietnam by the Singaporean Prime Minister is a new, 
important event asserting the common aspiration of the two 
countries' leaders in strengthening the bilateral relations of 
friendship and cooperation, thereby contributing to restoring 
peace and stability and promoting cooperation and development in 
the Southeast Asian region. 
  We share Singapore's pleasure with its great achievements in 
national construction. During the past 30 years, through 
various creative development programs, the Singaporean 
Government and people have led the small country, with a sparse 
population and minimal natural resources, to advance to a 
developmental peak and become a world renowned economic, trade, 
and financial center. 
  In 1993, Singapore attained 9.8 percent economic growth 
compared with 5.6 percent in 1992. The electronic industries 
increased by 25 percent and the vessel building industry by 18.8 
percent; about 6.4 million tourists visited the country last 
year, increasing national income by 6.9 percent. Singapore's 
per capita income now reaches $18,000 [as heard]. 
  Vietnam and Singapore are close friends who have maintained 
diplomatic relations since 1973. Since Singapore lifted its 
trade embargo on Vietnam in 1991, Vietnam-Singapore economic 
and trade cooperation has developed vigorously. Today, 
Singapore is one of Vietnam's biggest trade partners. The 
two-way trade value in 1993 reached $1.4 billion compared with 
$110 million in 1980. Up to January this year, Singapore has 54 
projects in Vietnam with an investment capital of $431 million. 
In this, it leads the ASEAN countries and is ranked sixth among 
foreign investors in Vietnam. Various bilateral agreements on 
civil aviation, shipping, sea transportation, trade, investment 
insurance, and protection of the environment are being 
satisfactorily implemented. 
  We sincerely thank the Singaporean Government for attaching 
importance to promoting relations with Vietnam, especially in 
the trade and economic domains. We appreciate Singapore's 
efforts in sharing with Vietnam its rich experiences in economic 
management and national development. 
  During his official visit to Singapore in October last year, 
General Secretary Do Muoi asserted that Vietnam and Singapore 
have many firm bases for strengthening bilateral relations. The 
Vietnamese and Singaporean peoples share the same spirit of 
maintaining national independence, promoting self-reliance, and 
upholding the national characteristics. They also share a 
common wish to develop the general trend of peace, stability, 
and development in the region and the world. 
  We are confident that the official friendship visit to 
Vietnam by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will significantly 
contribute to promoting mutual understanding and trust and 
expanding the multifaceted cooperation between Vietnam and 
Singapore.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, March 2 (AFP) -- Cambodian troops, 
ousted by Khmer Rouge [KR] guerrillas from a rebel base they 
captured in early February, are re-grouping and planning to 
counter-attack within the next 10 days, a regional military 
commander said Wednesday. Government forces have withdrawn to 
positions about 10 kilometers (six miles) south and west of the 
base at Anlung Veng -- the radical faction's headquarters for 
all guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia -- to 
positions they held six months ago. 
  Toan Chhay, commander of the 4th Military Region and 
governor 
of Siem Reap province where the base is situated, told AFP by 
telephone that his 1,200 government troops were re-grouping. 
"Now we gather our forces to attack again and we will re-capture 
Anlung Veng within 10 days at the most," he said. He said the 
decision to withdraw came because "our soldiers lacked food and 
supplies. The KR have captured the base itself but we are still 
in the Anlung Veng area," he said. Cambodian armed forces 
control most of the surrounding area, he said. [passage omitted] 
  Co-premier Hun Sen said the guerrilla shelling had forced 
the 
government to make a tactical retreat from the centre of Anlung 
Veng. But he emphasised that Anlung Veng was more than just the 
base and it covered a very big area. The government has 
persistently described the loss of the base, which it captured 
after a six-month struggle against the guerrillas, as a tactical 
withdrawal and not a military defeat. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Information 
Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse claimed government troops were 
engaged in pitched battles with the guerrillas. "Sometimes they 
(the KR) get in our frontline and three or fours hours later we 
recapture it, so that's the battle," he said. When asked about 
the military commander's admission that troops had withdrawn 
from the centre of the base, the exasperated spokesman replied: 
"Don't believe me because I know the situation changes fast. 
If you pick up this story and write it, before the ink dries it 
changes." Sieng Lapresse went on to say that commercial rather 
then military reasons may have been the motivation for the rebel 
counter- attack. 
  The KR finance their guerrilla operations by selling logging 
and [words indistinct] to primarily Thai business interests, 
many of which are controlled by the Thai military. Anlung Veng 
was a major centre for logging activities. When the government 
forces captured the base, "a great number of logs" were left 
behind by the retreating guerrillas, he said. "One of the 
primary goals of the KR was to try and get these logs out 
through Thailand," the spokesman said. 
  Government officials said part of the estimated 600-strong 
guerrilla force attacked from Thai territory, and that once the 
guerrillas pushed the government troops back, trucks followed in 
their tracks to pick up logs. "I don't know if they were Thai 
trucks but trucks came and picked up logs and went back in that 
direction which is north of Cambodia," the spokesman said 
without referring to Thailand by name. 
  The guerrillas also had a lot of weapons caches in the area, 
he said. "When we attacked they were unable to get them out on 
time so they try to come and get their weapons and ammunition 
back," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Forget About </F>
Compensation Claims"] 
  [Excerpts] It was like dry-season lightning when the 
foreign press began reporting that the United States began talks 
with Cambodia on 24 February on compensation claims arising from 
the takeover of Cambodia by the communists in 1975. The claims 
also encompass all private debts. 
  The claims by the United States are correct based on the 
view 
that the new government should inherit all the legacies from old 
governments. Logically, however, the United States' demands 
appear to be totally unreasonable. 
  It is widely known that the Polpotists seized all private 
assets, whether or not they were owned by U.S. or Cambodian 
individuals or any other countries. It is widely agreed that 
the current government cannot be accountable for what the Khmer 
Rouge clique seized. The Khmer Rouge pulled themselves out of 
the UN-organized peace process. They should be asked to pay for 
private property they destroyed. If Washington is determined to 
claim compensation, it would only be diplomatic excess. 
Moreover, it is worth noting that what happened in Saigon and 
what happened in Phnom Penh after 1975 were completely different 
-- the communists who confiscated private assets in Cambodia 
have already been outlawed, a situation completely different 
from that in Vietnam. [passage omitted] 
  The United States should forget about compensation claims 
from Cambodia as it has done with other Third World countries. 
What the Cambodian people want to see from the United States is 
its determination to make a success of the international 
conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia to be held in 
Tokyo, Japan, on 10 and 11 March 1994, according to the wish of 
Cambodia, one of the poorest countries of the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's possible move to revive the Super 301 trade 
retaliation mechanism through an executive order would be 
"unproductive" for Japan-U.S. trade relations, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Wednesday [2 March]. 
  "I cannot help describing such a decision to resuscitate the 
Super 301 as unproductive," the top government spokesman told a 
news conference. 
  Noting Tokyo has decided to voluntarily devise a package of 
possible measures to further open its markets by the end of 
March, Takemura said, "we strongly urge the U.S. Government to 
take sensible action." 
  The chief cabinet secretary made the comments after THE NEW 
YORK TIMES reported Clinton is scrambling to reinstate his legal 
authority to impose early sanctions on Japan. 
  Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the 
President the right to retaliate against countries which the 
United States deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- U.S. Undersecretary of 
State Joan Spero will visit Japan next week for talks with 
Japanese officials on bilateral trade affairs, a senior Foreign 
Ministry official said Wednesday [2 March]. 
  Spero, a top State Department official in charge of economic 
affairs, is likely to arrive in Japan before or around March 9, 
when U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher is also due in 
Japan, the official said. 
  She is likely to hold talks with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Koichiro Matsuura, a top negotiator in the bilateral trade 
"framework" talks, he said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton 
met on February 11 in Washington but failed to reach accord on 
the framework talks. 
  Christopher is scheduled to visit Japan between March 9 and 
11 on his three-nation Asia-Pacific trip. 
  It is not yet clear whether Spero will accompany Christopher 
to Japan or will make the trip separately, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
may reach a compromise soon on opening the Japanese cellular 
phone market, negotiating sources said Wednesday [2 March]. 
  As soon as a compromise is reached, the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry will start negotiations with the 
U.S. to avert possible U.S. trade sanctions, the sources said. 
  The U.S. has said it will retaliate against Japan if Japan 
fails to open the cellular phone market to the products of 
Motorola Inc. 
  Japanese cellular phone company Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. 
(IDO) has indicated readiness to make further concessions on 
Motorola's demand for more purchases of its systems and 
equipment. 
  Motorola has said it will urge the U.S. Government not to 
impose sanctions if it reaches a settlement with IDO, according 
to the sources. 
  IDO in January came up with a plan for installation of more 
Motorola-type cellular phone stations, but that failed to 
satisfy the U.S. 
  Under that plan, 134 such stations were to have been 
established by March 1997. 
  But Motorola asked, among other things, that IDO implement 
the plan two years earlier. 
  IDO and Motorola are continuing negotiations on the plan, 
the 
sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- A jump in U.S. economic 
growth in the last three months of 1993 was mainly due to a 
steady recovery in U.S. competitiveness in the world market, a 
Bank of Japan [BOJ] source said late Tuesday [1 March]. 
  The source made the remarks shortly after the U.S. Commerce 
Department announced that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.5 
percent in annualized terms in the October-December quarter. 
  "Expansion in exports contributed chiefly to the 
improvements," the source said. 
  Touching on the yen-dollar rate, the BOJ source said, "Forex 
players will now shift their attention to economic conditions of 
both countries -- away from Japan's domestic political 
uncertainty -- with mounting expectations that a gap in their 
economic fundamentals will not shrink further for a while."

negatively affect the industry's earnings. 
  The call came from Tsunesaburo Nishimura, president of the 
Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers, in a 
meeting of industry leaders with International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. 
  Nishimura said the industry is concerned about the yen's 
renewed surge against the dollar following the breakdown in 
February of the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks. 
  The Japanese currency's excessive strength may undermine the 
industry's cost-cutting and other restructuring efforts, he said. 
  Nishimura and nine other industrial leaders, each 
representing machinery manufacturing for such sectors as 
engineering, construction, textiles and robots, jointly made the 
request to Kumagai during consultations over breakfast. 
  The machinery industry hopes the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI) will ensure the trade dispute does not 
deal a blow to its earnings, which are just recovering in some 
sectors from the long recession, said Nishimura, who is also an 
adviser to Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. 
  Kumagai said MITI will do its best to have the request 
reflected in its policy. 
  Nishimura said some bright spots are being seen in such 
sectors as semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, machines for 
making housing materials and waste disposal machinery. 
  But construction machinery, a major leading indicator for 
Japan's economy, is still in the doldrums, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Parliamentary vice 
ministers Wednesday [2 March] called for the need to slash 
Japan's huge trade surplus in an effort to seek sound bilateral 
ties with the United States, a government spokesman said. 
  At a meeting of parliamentary vice ministers, Yuriko Koike 
of 
the Management and Coordination Agency said that behind strained 
ties between the two nations is Japan's massive trade surplus, 
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama told a news 
conference. 
  Koike reportedly spoke of the need to take necessary surplus 
cutting measures to put Tokyo-Washington ties back on the right 
track. 
  Japan's global trade surplus soared to some 130 billion 
dollars last year, of which about 60 billion dollars was with 
the U.S. 
  Washington has been increasing pressure on Tokyo to whittle 
down its lopsided trade surplus since the collapse of talks on a 
bilateral trade framework in mid-February. 
  Aogu Matsumae, parliamentary vice minister for the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry, echoed Koike's view and also called 
for steps to rectify the trade imbalance with the U.S. as 
quickly as possible, Hatoyama said. 
  Noting relations with the U.S. are the most important 
bilateral ties for Japan, Morio Kimura of the Agricultural, 
Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Tokyo must strive to 
maintain positive relations.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan should maximize its 
efforts to prevent the unfolding trade squabble with the United 
States from undermining the basic foundation of the bilateral 
ties, trade minister Hiroshi Kumagai said Wednesday [2 March]. 
  Tokyo has no time to waste in settling growing economic 
frictions with the U.S., International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said in an interview with KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE. 
  Kumagai said the basic framework of the Japan-U.S. ties as 
"a 
mutually important partner" remains unchanged. 
  The only change is that the alliance has become 
"symmetrical" 
after the end of the Cold War structure, the trade minister said. 
  The two countries have come to regard each other as "a 
competitor" as economic issues were brought under a spotlight in 
the absence of military and political issues as seen during the 
Cold War era, he explained. 
  Under this relationship, "adjustment of economic interests" 
by both parties naturally gets "more conflicting and intense," 
Kumagai said. 
  Kumagai confirmed that Japan-U.S. economic ties have become 
worst amid slow progress in opening Japan's markets and the 
unabated trade imbalance lopsidedly in favor of Tokyo. 
  In order to mend the soured ties that got more conspicuous 
following the aborted trade "framework" talks in February, Tokyo 
should urgently devise a way to "assuage the U.S. frustration 
and the uneasiness," Kumagai said. 
  But he said Japan should not seek a breakthrough via such 
ways as accepting a numerical target to gauge imports, noting 
the step is unacceptable in terms of principle. 
  Kumagai said that for Japan to leave unattended its 
"strikingly big" current account surplus would not be in the 
interest of the U.S. and the global economy. 
  He said the situation cannot be explained just by the widely 
used argument that the U.S. trade imbalance was attributed more 
to problems involved in its investment and savings balance. 
  The biggest task facing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
after its first cabinet shakeup expected shortly is to formulate 
viable and effective plans both in macroeconomic and 
microeconomic fields, Kumagai said. 
  Tokyo, if it fails to handle the trade issue with the U.S. 
properly, would most likely face "a barrage of sanctions," 
undermining the basic framework of the bilateral ties, Kumagai 
said. 
  But he added Tokyo should not accept numerical targets by 
succumbing to "threat of sanctions" used by some advisers within 
the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton who believe 
in the "heterogeneity" of Japan from other major countries. 
  "Both parties have already confirmed where the summit of the 
mountain is," he said. "Where to start climbing is what Japan 
and the U.S. are groping for at present." 
  As one approach to break through what he terms "the 
deadlocked ties," the trade minister endorsed the recent 
proposal by the Foreign Ministry for setting nonbinding "effort 
goals" in macroeconomic fields. 
  The proposal calls for reducing the ratio of Japan's current 
account surplus against gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.8 
percent for fiscal 1994 from 3.1 percent estimated in the 
previous year. 
  Kumagai said Tokyo should clarify its stance that the 2.8 
percent figure is not anything like ones subject to sanctions in 
the event of the goal's failure to meet. 
  On auto trade issues, one of the most contentious and 
thorniest points under the framework talks, Kumagai renewed a 
call for the Japanese auto industry to compile a voluntary plan 
to expand purchases of U.S.-made auto components and automobiles. 
  The trade minister said he understands that the auto 
industry 
has reasons to reject unreasonable requests from U.S. and other 
foreign countries. But this does not mean the industry should 
always keep a posture of not listening to them from the 
beginning, he said. 
  The private sector "grows old enough" to work out ways to 
settle trade problems on their own, he said. 
  The positive stance shown on this point by the auto industry 
last week represents "a step forward" toward the ideal 
situation, he said. 
  Kumagai said the trade ministry will also step up efforts to 
improve a situation in government procurement, citing the area 
as where the government has reach. 
  On possible U.S. sanctions against Tokyo over cellular phone 
trade, Kumagai said Washington must be receiving "some signals" 
from Japan indicating its willingness to solve the problem. 
  But he declined to comment on what kind of reaction the U.S. 
is showing to Japan in response to its signals ahead of the 
March 17 deadline for listing sanctions. 
  Kumagai said the Hosokawa administration was able to "honor 
three of four bills" drawn by the previous government of Kiichi 
Miyazawa--the Uruguay Round, rice market opening and political 
reforms. 
  The other issue of ways to spur the economy is what Hosokawa 
should do urgently now, he said. 
  Formulation of economy-boosting measures containing the 
politically sensitive tax cuts and hikes is beyond control of 
bureaucrats, the trade minister said. 
  These issues are exactly what would require a political 
decision, he added, indicating the government should map out a 
comprehensive tax reform within this year in line with the 
coalition accord.

  [Text] Washington, March 1 KYODO -- The U.S. microchips 
industry accused Japan on Tuesday [1 March] of violating a 1991 
accord on semiconductor trade and sought an "immediate" remedy 
from the U.S. and Japanese Governments. 
  The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said Japan has 
violated the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, because 
the foreign share of the Japanese microchips market suffered a 
"steady decline" last year. 
  "Consequently, the U.S. Government and the Government of 
Japan must immediately consider all actions needed to ensure 
compliance," the trade group said in a review of the trade pact. 
  The report said the 1991 accord calls for a "gradual, 
steady" 
growth of foreign sales in Japan over a five-year period but the 
foreign share dropped 2.1 percentage points in the first three 
quarters of last year after hitting 20.2 percent of the Japanese 
market in the last quarter of 1992. 
  "The steady decline in the foreign share of the Japanese 
semiconductor market in 1993 violates the 1991 U.S.-Japan 
semiconductor and the 1993 U.S.-Japan framework agreement, which 
requires full implementation of all existing bilateral trade 
agreements," it said. 
  The association, which represents all U.S. semiconductor 
makers, did not say what remedy it seeks from the U.S. 
Government. 
  U.S. charges that Japan violated an earlier version of the 
semiconductor pact concluded in 1986 prompted the U.S. 
Government to levy trade sanctions against Japan in April 1987. 
  The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market 
should 
reach at least 25 to 28 percent by 1996 if the trend of growth 
in the foreign share that has taken place since 1986 is 
maintained over the next four years, the association said. 
  Despite the 2.1 percentage point fall in the foreign share 
of 
the Japanese market last year, the association nevertheless 
acknowledged that the foreign share showed "significant 
progress" in 1993 as a whole over the previous year. 
  If the foreign share for the fourth quarter of 
1993--expected 
to be known in mid-March--maintains the average level of the 
first three quarters, the foreign share will have averaged about 
2.3 percentage points higher in 1993 than in 1992, the report 
said.

  [Text] Washington, March 1 KYODO -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major expressed concern 
Tuesday [1 March] about Japan's trade policy and urged Japan to 
further open up its markets to foreign products. 
  The United States and Britain will also support advancing 
the 
implementation date of the new General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) trade accord to January 1 next year, Major said. 
  Major, who met with Clinton over breakfast Tuesday, told 
reporters that he and Clinton spent "some time" discussing 
Japan's markets for foreign products. 
  "We both share a wish to support the growing measure of 
opinion that exists in Japan, for example, for the further 
opening of Japanese markets," Major said after emerging from the 
White House session with Clinton. 
  "This is a matter of concern to the United States. It's a 
matter of concern throughout the European Union as well," Major 
said, with Clinton looking on by his side. 
  Japan runs big trade surpluses both with the United States 
and the European Union. Trade talks between Tokyo and 
Washington collapsed last month on ways to whittle down Japan's 
trade surplus with the U.S. 
  On another trade matter, Major said he and Clinton agreed 
that "it would be desirable" to move up the starting date of the 
so-called "Uruguay Round" accord concluded last December under 
GATT auspices. 
  "The sooner that agreement can be implemented, the better it 
will be," Major said. 
  Under the terms worked out by 117 GATT member countries last 
December, the trade pact is tentatively scheduled to go into 
force on July 1, 1995.

  [Text] New York, March 1 KYODO -- The United States and 
Britain expressed support for making Germany and Japan permanent 
members of the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] as talks 
resumed Tuesday [1 March] on reform of the world body, 
diplomatic sources said. 
  The support came at a meeting of a U.N. working group 
deliberating the reforms, including the question of expansion of 
Security Council permanent membership. 
  It is believed to be the first time that Britain has cited 
Germany and Japan by name in supporting an expansion of 
permanent members beyond the current five -- Britain, China, 
France, Russia and the U.S. 
  The sources said France also indicated support for Germany 
and Japan by saying permanent membership should be offered to 
countries that have considerable influence globally and a will 
to maintain international security. 
  Aside from the five permanent members, representatives of 
some 10 other countries made statements on the question of 
restructuring the Security Council. 
  The working group, which held its first meeting last month, 
is scheduled to submit an interim report on its deliberations to 
the General Assembly's regular session beginning in the third 
week of September.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan and Ukraine signed an 
agreement in Kiev on Wednesday [2 March] to cooperate on 
dismantling nuclear weapons in Ukraine and to set up a committee 
for effectively carrying out the work, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Japanese Ambassador to Ukraine Shoji Suezawa signed the 
agreement with Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, the 
ministry said. 
  The committee will include representatives of the 
Governments 
of Japan and Ukraine, it said. 
  The accord follows Japan's announcement in April last year 
at 
a ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations that 
it would extend a grant-in-aid of 100 million dollars for the 
promotion of nuclear weapons destruction in the former Soviet 
Union. 
  Ukraine is one of the four former Soviet republics that 
inherited nuclear weapons when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. 
  Japan signed a similar accord on cooperation on nuclear 
nonproliferation with Belarus in November. Japan has yet to 
sign an agreement with Kazakhstan. 
  In January, U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to 
scrap Ukraine's 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 
1,800 warheads.

  [Text] Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Pref., March 2 KYODO -- A Thai 
commerce official Wednesday [2 March] expressed confidence in 
the quality of rice from Thailand, saying it is strictly 
regulated by Bangkok. 
  Churin Laksanawisit, vice minister of commerce, told 
reporters at a Thai products fair here that there are a number 
of domestic quality inspections of rice before it is exported 
and inspected in Japan. 
  The vice minister said Bangkok recognizes the importance of 
value and quality. 
  Japan recently began importing rice on an emergency basis to 
cover shortfalls caused by harvest shortages last year due to an 
unusually cool summer. 
  The rice imports have been met with opposition by Japanese 
farmers and consumer groups, along with reports that some of the 
rice coming into Japan has been discolored by mold. 
  As for the flavor of Thai rice, Laksanawisit began by noting 
that the method of preparing the rice in Japan and Thailand is 
different but added that if Japanese consumers get used to the 
way of cooking Thai rice they would find it delicious.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan is considering 
dispatching peacekeeping troops to the Golan Heights, a Tokyo 
daily reported Wednesday [2 March]. 
  But top government spokesman Masayoshi Takemura denied the 
TOKYO SHIMBUN report, saying, "It is not true that the 
government is weighing the possibility of sending Self-Defense 
Forces (SDF) units to the Golan Heights." 
  In the frontpage story in its Wednesday morning edition, the 
TOKYO SHIMBUN reported Japan may dispatch around 50 members of 
the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) to the Golan Heights, an 
area occupied by Israel since it seized the territory from Syria 
in 1967. 
  A total of 1,120 troops of the UN Disengagement Observer 
Force (UNDOF) monitor the cease-fire between Israel and Syria in 
an area determined by a May 1974 agreement on disengagement. 
  The report, quoting government sources, said the government 
of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is seeking another 
destination for Japanese peacekeepers after the current mission 
in Mozambique finishes its duties following July elections there. 
  Takemura told a morning news conference that Tokyo has 
received no request from the United Nations to join peacekeeping 
operations in the Middle East. 
  The report quoted the sources as saying Japan is eyeing the 
Middle East for its third peacekeeping mission, following SDF 
dispatches to Cambodia and Mozambique. 
  Japan joined UN peacekeeping operations for the first time 
in 
1992 when it sent an engineer corps to Cambodia to help build 
roads and bridges. It was the first time for Japanese troops to 
go abroad for such duties since World War II. 
  The sources also favored the Middle East in light of 
criticism of Japan's decision not to put its own citizens at 
risk in the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, the daily said. 
  At the time, Japan made a 13 billion dollar financial 
contribution to the U.S.-led multinational forces arrayed 
against Iraq and also to three affected states of Egypt, Jordan 
and Turkey, but after heated domestic debate decided against 
sending military personnel. 
  The daily suggested that Japanese peacekeepers could be sent 
to the Golan Heights to replace some of the logistics personnel 
from Canada, but this would require arrangements with the UN and 
Canada. 
  The UNDOF, which includes troops from Austria and Poland, 
and 
logistics personnel from Canada, has seen 31 fatalities but 
there have been virtually no cease-fire violations since 1977.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry is to 
give permits to nine major commercial banks including Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo Bank to set up brokerage subsidiaries as early as this 
week, ministry officials said Tuesday [1 March]. 
  The so-called city banks are expected to begin brokering 
businesses such as underwriting corporate bonds this summer, the 
officials said. 
  The move will accelerate reforms of the financial system, 
calling for the breaking down of a "fire wall" separating 
banking and brokerage businesses, a ministry official said. 
  Under the reforms, subsidiaries for brokering businesses 
were 
launched last year by the Industrial Bank of Japan, the 
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Norinchukin Bank and two trust 
banks. 
  The other eight city banks to be given permits are Sakura, 
Fuji, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Tokai, Sanwa, Asahi and Hokkaido 
Takushoku Banks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Retail prices of imported 
goods sold in Tokyo dropped in February, reflecting the 
appreciation of the Japanese yen, the Economic Planning Agency 
[EPA] reported Monday [28 February]. 
  The agency, citing its survey in Tokyo's 23 wards, said 
prices declined from the year before for 16 of 20 items examined. 
  Perishables such as beef and bananas were sold at prices 
lower than those at customs clearance but retail prices of 
clothes such as shirts and brassieres were higher than customs 
clearance prices, the agency said. 
  Retail prices of beef and bananas dropped 17.5 percent and 
12.8 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier level and 
their customs clearance prices were down 7.3 percent and 13.7 
percent, respectively. 
  Prices of shirts and brassieres declined only 4.9 percent 
and 
5.6 percent from the previous year against price falls of 22.1 
percent and 15.3 percent at customs clearance, the agency said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
on Tuesday [1 March] recommended raising the age at which 
retired corporate employees can draw state-managed retirement 
pensions to 65 from the current 60 in an effort to cope with the 
rapid aging of society, officials said. 
  The National Pension Council made the recommendations in a 
report to Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, the officials 
said. 
  The council suggested that the age at which employees 
qualify 
for the welfare pension be gradually raised to 65 from the year 
2001. 
  The ministry plans to submit bills on revision of the 
pension 
system to the current regular Diet session in mid-March for 
approval, they said. 
  One in four people in Japan will be 65 or over by early next 
century. A government survey found that nearly 70 percent of 
people want to work beyond the age of 60.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan's tax revenues in 
January have indicated some bright signs for the economy, with 
proceeds from items related to goods movements poised to 
recover, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday [2 March]. 
  January tax revenues edged down 1.0 percent from a year 
earlier to 4.89 trillion yen, resulting in cumulative revenues 
of 35.60 billion yen for the April-January period of the current 
fiscal year, up just 0.1 percent. 
  But a ministry official said, "We have a particular interest 
in stamp revenues," which he said have moved higher for the past 
two to three months. 
  Revenue and other stamps are required for big-ticket 
purchases such as receipts, housing contracts and registrations, 
and reflects goods movements, the official said. 
  January stamp revenues rose 0.1 percent from a year earlier 
to 105.76 billion yen. 
  After only two or three months "it's still too early to 
judge," the official said, "but this is certainly a good trend." 
  Proceeds from consumption tax also rose 6.7 percent to 
253.00 
billion yen, with revenues from domestic products performing 
"fairly well" although those on imports remained sluggish, he 
said. 
  But he maintained a cautious stance in referring the trend 
to 
buoyant consumption. 
  Also showing signs of recovery are liquor tax revenues, 
totaling 158.40 billion yen in January, down a low 0.7 percent. 
  The official said beer sales picked up from the sustained 
sluggish performance since the unusually cool summer but poor 
whisky sales offset the tax revenues in January. 
  Proceeds from securities transactions remained brisk in 
reaction to low trading volume last year, rising 28.2 percent to 
33.20 billion yen. 
  The overall tax revenues, however, remained lackluster 
because of mixed factors, the official said, citing relatively 
low proceeds from income, corporate and inheritance taxes. 
  Revenues from withholding income tax stayed unchanged at 
3,310.09 billion yen, mirroring the lower winter bonuses for 
December on which the revenues are based, the official said. 
  He noted the unchanged figure came primarily on higher 
interest income. 
  Corporate tax revenues fell 8.1 percent to 386.87 billion 
yen 
due to poor earnings at smaller firms. Inheritance tax proceeds 
dropped 12.3 percent to 191.80 billion yen in reaction to a 
sharp rise a year before. 
  The April-January progress rate against estimated fiscal 
1993 
tax revenues of 55.68 trillion yen came to 63.9 percent, down 
from 65.3 percent a year earlier. 
  The official said the major reason was the lower bonus 
capping increase in income taxes that account for some 70 
percent of the overall revenues, and stressed that the overall 
trend "remains the same." 
  He said the key to this fiscal year's tax revenues "is on 
declared income and corporate book-closing" both made in March.

  [Text] Hiroshima, March 2 KYODO -- A prominent business 
leader said Wednesday [2 March] that the business community is 
not in a position to comment on a proposed cabinet reshuffle. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), said a reorganization of the cabinet 
and a Diet dissolution "are the rights given to the prime 
minister," and any move is up to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  "We are not in a position to comment on it," Hiraiwa said at 
a press conference in Hiroshima in western Japan. 
  As for the state of the economy, Hiraiwa said he has an 
impression that the economic situation has been changing a bit 
since the start of this year. He noted that he expects the 
economy to improve following progress in corporate restructuring. 
  Hiraiwa was asked for his comment on the Bank of Japan's 
latest quarterly survey of business sentiment released Tuesday 
that indicated a halt in the nine-month deterioration in the 
business outlook. 
  Hiraiwa said, however, that a stronger yen could be a drag 
on 
economic recovery and warned that Japanese companies would be in 
trouble if the yen strengthens any further.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- The chief of a Japanese 
construction industry group Wednesday [2 March] criticized 
another construction industry group's request that member 
companies refrain from "dumping" in their bids for public works 
contracts. 
  Taira Shibata, chairman of the Japan Civil Engineering 
Contractors Association and president of Nishimatsu Construction 
Co., told reporters the proposal to curb bids of less than fair 
value could restrict bid value and contravene the Antimonopoly 
Law. 
  His comments were made in response to the request by Kenji 
Maeda, chairman of the Japan Federation of Construction 
Contractors and president of Maeda Corp., on February 21. 
  Shibata said fair value is difficult to define, since 
contractors sometimes cut their bids through active 
cost-reduction efforts. 
  Low bids also mean more competitive bidding through measures 
to restrict the practice of bid rigging, Shibata said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Earnings at small and 
medium-sized firms are poised to hit bottom although labor and 
production facilities remain excessive, Small Business Finance 
Corp. said Wednesday [2 March] in its monthly survey. 
  The government-backed institution said in the February 
survey 
that the diffusion index of profits came to a seasonally 
adjusted minus 26.4 from January's minus 30.7, with the sales 
index improving to minus 14.7 from minus 18.9. 
  Looking three months ahead, the sales index came to minus 
4.4 
from the previous month's minus 6.9, with signs for recovery 
seen particularly in the consumer electronics and public-works 
related construction fields. 
  But the institutions noted "concerns over adverse effects, 
again primarily on subcontractors related to exporters from the 
yen's recent further advance." 
  The index represents the percentage of those answering "an 
increase" minus those saying "a decline." 
  The survey covered 900 smaller firms, with responses 
obtained 
from 662 firms, or 73.6 percent. 
  The product inventory index, or the net saying shortage, 
deteriorated to minus 23.5 from minus 22.1, with stockpiles 
considered excessive on a broad front. 
  The labor shortage index waned to minus 13.9 from minus 
15.5, 
with an excessive labor force continuing in precision equipment, 
steel and auto parts firms although some improvements are seen 
at electric machinery and chemical manufacturers.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Takeshi Nagano, one of 
Japan's leading business executives, Wednesday [2 March] 
cautioned against premature optimism over the state of the 
Japanese economy. 
  Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers 
Association [Nikkeiren], told a press conference that the 
"tankan" business survey by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), published 
the previous day, cannot be considered an exact reflection of 
reality. 
  He said the report is "based on figures taken before the 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting" February 11, since when U.S. 
pressure has been mounting on Japan to cut its huge current 
account surplus. 
  "So it is premature to say the economy has bottomed out. 
Last year, signs of recovery were immediately followed by 
worsening of the situation. I cannot be pleased with the report 
without reserve," Nagano said. 
  The tankan report indicated that pessimism among businesses 
has hit bottom, with the BOJ index for business confidence among 
major manufacturers surveyed in February at minus 56, unchanged 
from the previous survey taken in November last year. 
  Nagano also reiterated his proposal for no wage increases in 
the coming fiscal year, starting in April. 
  "Further hikes in wages will encourage hollowing of the 
industry. Japan's wages are already the world's highest in 
nominal terms," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan's superconductivity 
research laboratory has developed a superconductor with the 
world's largest conductivity rate, laboratory officials said 
Wednesday [2 March]. 
  The superconductor has a current density of 15,000 amperes 
per square centimeter at 77 kelvin and 3 tesla. 
  The previous highest conductivity rate was at 5,000 amperes 
per square centimeter in superconductors made from yttrium, 
which was also developed by the laboratory. 
  The laboratory is affiliated with the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry and receives half of its funds 
from private firms. 
  Superconductivity occurs when electrical resistance in a 
metal completely disappears at temperatures near absolute zero. 
  The researchers found a new method of increasing the rate by 
controlling the oxygen around the substances when they are 
melted down for processing. 
  This method, dubbed the oxygen controlled melt growth 
process, gives birth to numerous pinning centers. Pinning 
centers have the effect of stabilizing magnetic flux, and the 
more that exist, the larger the current density. 
  The new superconductor can be applied for such uses as 
superconducting magnets that lift linear motor cars, and also 
for energy storage, the officials said. 
  There are two types of the new superconductor, one made from 
a blend of neodymium, copper oxide and barium, and the other 
from samarium, copper oxide and barium.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0054 GMT on 27 February in its weekly 75-minute 
"Discussion" program, which begins at 0000 GMT, carries a 
17-minute live interview with Kozo Watanabe, deputy general 
secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], on the current 
domestic political issues, mostly regarding Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's reported plan to reshuffle his cabinet. The 
interviewers are NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and Tsukuba 
University professor Ikuo Kawashima. 
  Yamamoto notes that the coalition is about equally divided 
over the issue of the cabinet reshuffle, with Shinseito and 
Komeito supporting it and the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] and two other parties disapproving it. Yamamoto then 
asks Watanabe for comment. Watanabe says that Prime Minister 
Hosokawa thinks it is time to realign the cabinet into one 
appropriate for long-term rule now that he has surmounted the 
major hurdle of political reform issues, while people not in 
favor of the cabinet reshuffle think the present cabinet should 
be maintained at least until the Diet deliberations on the 1994 
budget are over. Watanabe expresses support for the cabinet 
reshuffle, saying: "If the prime minister makes a decision, 
everyone should cooperate with him." 
  At 0057 GMT, the topic turns to the widely circulated 
reports 
that the true intention of the cabinet reshuffle is to remove 
Masayoshi Takemura from the post of chief cabinet secretary, and 
Professor Kawashima asks for Watanabe's view on that. Watanabe 
says, "Even though the newspapers are stirring up the matter, 
what is important is for the coalition parties--particularly the 
five parties--to cooperate in turning this government into a 
long-reigning one." But Watanabe is also critical of 
Takemura's attitude towards the prime minister, saying "The 
chief cabinet secretary is a person who must support the prime 
minister," and questioning the advisability of a chief cabinet 
secretary "standing out too much." 
  Yamamoto asks Watanabe whether someone from Shinseito will 
take over the post of chief cabinet secretary in case a cabinet 
reshuffle does come, Watanabe replies, "No. At least Shinseito 
is not asking for it." 
  At 0059 GMT, Yamamoto brings up the reports that the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist 
Party, and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger Party] are trying to 
create a new political group in an alliance separate from 
Shinseito and Komeito. Asked to comment on the reports, Watanabe 
says, "Even that is mostly the creation of the mass media." He 
says the coalition must win in the House of Councillors election 
next year if it wants to realize further political reforms and 
to foster political stability in the aftermath of the reforms. 
He says all the parties in the coalition must remain united in 
order to win in the election. Watanabe also says Shinseito 
wants to solidify ties with the Japan New Party first of all, 
and then with other member parties in the coalition.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0028 GMT on 27 February in its weekly 75-minute 
"Discussion" program, which begins at 0000 GMT, carries a 
25-minute live interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], on current political 
issues, including the cabinet reshuffle and political reform. 
The interview is conducted by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto 
and Tsukuba University Professor Ikuo Kawashima. 
  Asked to give his view on why Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa wants to reshuffle the cabinet, Murayama says he does 
not know the prime minister's true intention. Murayama notes he 
is against the idea of a cabinet reshuffle, saying the coalition 
government has many other important things to do now. He adds: 
"The prime minister never personally told me he would reshuffle 
the cabinet." Asked what he thinks of the view that the prime 
minister has a vested right to reshuffle his cabinet whenever he 
deems it necessary, Murayama says: "Legally speaking, it is 
indeed a vested right of the prime minister. According to 
political practice in the past, however, even when the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] was in power, prime ministers consulted 
with faction leaders before deciding on cabinet reshuffles. I 
think this is not a matter which the price minister should 
decide by dint of his vested right only. Besides, what we have 
now is a coalition government. I think it is a matter of course 
for the prime minister to have thorough discussions with other 
coalition party leaders and to seek a consensus, while 
maintaining harmony among the coalition parties." 
  Yamamoto asks Murayama if the SDPJ will ask cabinet 
ministers 
from its party to resign should the prime minister decide to 
reshuffle the cabinet. Murayama replies: "No, I do not think 
it will be necessary. I am sure we can talk." Asked if Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, although there is discord between them, can remain as 
a team and smoothly steer the political situation, Murayama 
says: "I think stories on the discord are exaggerated. The 
coalition government was formed with Sakigake as an integral 
part." He also says: "I think it is natural that the prime 
minister and the chief cabinet secretary sometimes have slightly 
different opinions. The coalition administration will not last 
long if we have to do everything as the prime minister says. I 
think the chief cabinet secretary is responsible for keeping the 
coalition intact. He has done well in the job of giving 
consideration to other parties. I am sure the issue can be 
settled if the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary 
have heart-to-heart discussions. Therefore, I am not taking the 
issue so seriously." 
  Noting there are reports that Hosokawa has asked Murayama to 
join the cabinet, Yamamoto asks if he would accept such an 
offer. Murayama replies: "Judging from the SDPJ's 
circumstances, it is not easy for me to accept such an offer." 
  At 0041 GMT, the topic turns to the question of general 
political matters. Asked how the SDPJ will face elections under 
the single- seat electoral system, Murayama says: "We no longer 
can do in the same manner as we did before under the medium-size 
electoral system. Therefore, we will cooperate with other 
coalition parties as much as possible in areas where we can 
cooperate." He adds: "We have to do our best to prevent the 
LDP from regaining power." Kawashima then points out that the 
LDP may regain power if the SDPJ fails to cooperate with other 
coalition parties in elections. Murayama says he understands it 
very well and says: "We need to be flexible in dealing with the 
situation. As I said earlier, it is impossible for the SDPJ to 
win elections single-handedly."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Tuesday [1 March] that he will make a final 
decision Wednesday whether to immediately reshuffle his nearly 
seven-month-old cabinet. 
  Hosokawa expressed his intention to reporters following a 
series of separate meetings with coalition party leaders to seek 
agreement on his plan to shake up the cabinet. 
  However, an increasing number of the coalition parties 
believe that Hosokawa may have to give up the plan because of a 
tight Diet business schedule and strong opposition from the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), Sakigake (Harbinger) and the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), coalition members said. 
  During a series of separate talks, the prime minister said 
he 
wants to tackle economic reform issues, including trade friction 
between the U.S. and Japan and deregulation, with a second 
Hosokawa Cabinet, political sources said. 
  But the SDP, the DSP and Sakigake, which is headed by Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, are opposed to an early 
cabinet reshuffle, while Shinseito and Komeito are endorsing the 
premier's plan. 
  The primary purpose of the cabinet reorganization is widely 
believed to be the replacement of Takemura, top government 
spokesman and chief of staff, who has been at odds with Hosokawa 
over several of the government's important policy themes. 
  Takemura told Hosokawa in a meeting that a cabinet reshuffle 
could lead to the collapse of the coalition government, the 
sources said. 
  Takemura maintains he will not take another cabinet post if 
Hosokawa changes his cabinet, they said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama asked Hosokawa to drop his 
intention for an early shake-up, stressing the need for the 
cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues, they said. 
  Murayama and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi told Hosokawa that 
they 
oppose the replacement of Takemura, warning such action will 
damage the coalition foundation, the sources said. 
  Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, meanwhile, told Hosokawa that 
the party will support the scheme to reshape the cabinet. 
  Hata, who serves as foreign minister and deputy prime 
minister, said he notified Hosokawa of his backing in a meeting 
at the premier's official residence, they said. 
  A top government official, who did not want to be 
identified, 
said Hosokawa still plans to reshuffle the cabinet Wednesday. 
He said Hosokawa is ready to accept some negative impact 
following the planned cabinet reshuffle.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Popular support for Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition cabinet has fallen below 
the 60 percent mark for the first time since its August 
inauguration, according to opinion polls released Wednesday [2 
March] by two leading dailies. 
  A YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey showed that support fell sharply in 
February to 58 percent, down 14.4 percentage points from the 
previous month. 
  Meanwhile, the disapproval rate increased 11.6 points to 
29.5 
percent. Pollsters surveyed 3,000 eligible voters nationwide 
from February 26 to 27 and got responses from 2,081, or 69 
percent. 
  According to a separate nationwide survey carried out by the 
ASAHI SHIMBUN, support fell to 57 percent from 60 percent 
recorded in a December survey. 
  The paper got responses from 2,318 eligible voters out of a 
sample of 3,000 surveyed from February 27 to 28. 
  It said strong support for Hosokawa personally appeared to 
be 
putting a brake on the slide in his cabinet's popularity, with 
66 percent of respondents expressing confidence in the prime 
minister's leadership abilities. 
  Both dailies noted that the Hosokawa cabinet remains 
significantly more popular than previous Liberal Democratic 
Party administrations. 
  But the YOMIURI said the plunge in support will come as a 
heavy blow to a government that has relied on strong popular 
approval ratings to compensate for its weak base in the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- The chance of an immediate 
cabinet reshuffle planned by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is 
getting slim because of tight political schedules and opposition 
from some coalition parties, coalition sources said Wednesday [2 
March]. 
  Hosokawa said he will make up his mind Wednesday on whether 
to push for shaking up his nearly seven-month-old cabinet after 
hearing final responses from leaders of the seven coalition 
parties to his scheme, the sources said. 
  "I'd like to make a final decision (on the matter) during 
Wednesday after judging the situation as a whole," he said at a 
session of the House of Councillors' panel on political reform, 
which started deliberations on amendments to a package of 
political reform legislation. 
  Hosokawa is eyeing the cabinet reshuffle possibly Thursday 
after the upper house panel has approved the amendments, the 
sources said. 
  The primary purpose, it is widely believed, is to replace 
top 
government spokesman and chief of staff Masayoshi Takemura, who 
has been in discord with Hosokawa since late December over such 
important government political themes as the partial opening of 
the rice market and the abortive imposition of a "national 
welfare tax," the sources said. 
  Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, told Hosokawa in a 
meeting Tuesday that a cabinet reshuffle could lead to the 
collapse of the coalition government, other coalition sources 
said. 
  Takemura maintains that he will not take another cabinet 
post 
if the premier reshapes his cabinet, they said. 
  Among the coalition partners, a pessimistic view has begun 
to 
prevail that Hosokawa may have to give up the plan because of a 
tight Diet business schedule and strong opposition from three 
coalition blocs. 
  Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers will make major policy 
speeches to both houses of the legislature after the cabinet 
submits to the Diet the 73.08 trillion yen state budget for 
fiscal 1994. 
  The full upper house is expected to endorse the amendments 
to 
the political reform package designed to help clean up Japan's 
politics Thursday or Friday. The more powerful House of 
Representatives approved them Tuesday. 
  Among the seven coalition parties, the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), Sakigake (Harbinger), headed by Takemura, and the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) are opposed to a hasty cabinet 
reshuffle, while Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito are 
endorsing the plan. 
  In a series of talks with Hosokawa on Tuesday, SDP chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama asked the premier to drop his intention for an 
early shake-up, pointing to the need for the cabinet to be 
united to tackle economic issues such as strained economic ties 
with the United States and the enactment of the fiscal 1994 
budget. 
  Murayama, head of the largest coalition component, told 
Hosokawa that the party opposes the replacement of Takemura, 
warning that such action will damage the coalition foundation, 
the sources said. 
  DSP chairman Keigo Ouchi, who serves as health and welfare 
minister, also expressed objection to a hasty cabinet reshuffle. 
  Ouchi told reporters that the premier cited as a major 
reason 
for the plan growing complaints within the ruling coalition and 
from bureaucrats about Takemura's work as the top government 
spokesman and chief policy coordinator. 
  Shinseito leader and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
meanwhile, told Hosokawa that the party will support the plan to 
reshape the cabinet. 
  Hata told reporters he has notified Hosokawa of his backing 
in a meeting at the premier's official residence. 
  "Behind the premier's plan is his desire to run the cabinet 
more smoothly. We support that kind of notion," said Hata, who 
is leading Shinseito along with Ichiro Ozawa. 
  Ozawa, who is regarded as the coalition's chief strategist, 
has expressed support for Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle the 
cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- The head of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) criticized the 
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 
Wednesday [2 March] for its disarray over Hosokawa's plan to 
reshape the cabinet, saying what is imperative now is the 
economic recovery. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the largest opposition party, told 
reporters that the government should commit itself to work on 
bringing the sluggish economy back on track and thus now is not 
the time to reshuffle the cabinet. 
  The LDP has insisted on immediately pushing ahead with 
economic stimulus measures since last year but the Hosokawa 
administration has no idea for shoring up the economy nor 
interest in doing so, Kono said. 
  Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP's Diet Affairs 
Committee, also criticized the ruling coalition, telling 
reporters the government has lost its function due to a discord 
between Hosokawa, and his spokesman and Chief of Staff Masayoshi 
Takemura. 
  Ozato urged Hosokawa to bring an immediate end to the 
political turmoil, saying the Diet cannot set up the timetable 
for deliberations of the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 
1994, which the cabinet will submit to the Diet on Friday. 
  Ruling coalition parties have remained divided over 
Hosokawa's scheme to make changes to his nearly seven-month-old 
cabinet, expected for Thursday. 
  The primary target of the reshuffle is apparently to 
Tamekura, the chief cabinet secretary, who has been reportedly 
at odds with Hosokawa since late December.

  [Excerpt] Ujungpandang, South Sulawesi (JP) -- Indonesian 
Democratic Party (PDI) Chairperson Megawati Sukarnoputri has 
said the people should be given complete freedom to elect their 
leaders, including the future president. 
  Megawati, joining in the debate about who should succeed 
President Suharto if he steps down in 1998, stressed that the 
succession should proceed constitutionally. "I know President 
Suharto is a wise man who knows very well that everything should 
be in line with the 1945 Constitution," she said as she wound up 
her tour of the province on Sunday. 
  The succession debate resurfaced last week with a statement 
from Donald Wilson, an American author who has written about 
President Suharto's leadership, that the incumbent leader "knows 
when to step down" and that he would not be president for life. 
  Suharto, now 72 years old, was reelected for his sixth 
five-year term in office last year. There is now growing 
speculation that he will step down in 1998, if not before 
because of his age. The president however has not publicly 
disclosed his intentions. 
  Megawati, who was elected by popular vote in an 
unprecedented 
party congress in December declined to go into detail when 
pressed if she would consider running for the presidency. "I'd 
rather keep the answer to myself," she said, but stressed that 
the political elite should heed what the people have to say 
about the next leader. 
  She warned that the more the Indonesian people are educated, 
the more they will understand their political rights and that 
only leaders with broad horizons will be elected. 
  PDI, the smallest of the three organizations sanctioned by 
the government to contest the general election, also urged the 
abolishment of the controversial "floating mass" system, which 
bars the rural masses from politics except during elections. 
  Under this policy, political organizations are barred from 
setting up branch offices below regency or mayoralty levels. 
  PDI and the United Development Party (PPP) say the system 
benefits their rival, the government-backed Golkar [Functional 
Group] because all village heads who can mobilize the masses, 
are effectively Golkar cadres. 
  Both PDI and PPP have been demanding that they be allowed 
equal access to reach the grassroots supporters in villages so 
that they can compete on equal footing. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "President Suharto's Wish"] </F>
  [Text] Although President Suharto has more than once 
expressed his wish to retire and has as many times failed to 
translate this into reality, his statements on his political 
future are always intriguing. It is fresh in our minds that in 
his autobiography entitled Suharto: Pikiran, Ucapan dan 
Tindakan Saya (Suharto: My Thoughts, Sayings and Deeds), 
published in 1988, the then 67-year-old President said that he 
believed he was in his final term as President. 
  He said that by the time he accomplished his term in 1993 he 
would be 72 and "more than old enough" for the job. He said 
that his children shared the same opinion. In the same context, 
Suharto was clearly free from any feelings of hurt or affront 
when he said, "it is not exaggerating when one says that my 
installation as president on March 11, 1988, was the last one 
for me." 
  To many people here -- or perhaps abroad as well -- the 
statement was more convincing than surprising. They became even 
more convinced of the President's intentions when, three years 
later, Suharto, who was then in his fifth term, said that he 
would not try to persuade the People's Consultative Assembly 
(MPR) to elect him for another term. 
  Speaking in a meeting with a delegation of the KNPI National 
Youth Committee, the President then mirthfully introduced his 
own acronym, in saying that "It is true I am becoming a `top' 
man." But he said the meaning of `top' here was the Indonesian 
acronym TOPP -- T for tua (old), O for ompong (toothless), P for 
peot (hollow cheeked) and P for pikun (senile). 
  However, aside from those humble remarks, the President has 
always also said that he would be ready to serve another term if 
the people asked him to do so. 
  Then, for quite a long time we did not hear such remarks 
from 
the head of state, who is now serving his sixth five-year term. 
But suddenly, last week, Suharto's American biographer, Donald 
W. Wilson, quoted him as saying that he would step down in due 
time. What made the statement different from the previous ones 
was that this time he added that "I am not a president for life." 
  The statement is noteworthy because in so saying the 
President seemed to have in mind President Sukarno's failure to 
reject his nomination as "president for life" by the Provisional 
MPR, whose members were handpicked by him. History has taught 
us that in accepting the nomination, Sukarno led the nation 
towards bankruptcy, both political and economic. 
  President Suharto's statement to Dr. Wilson could also mean 
that some day he may feel the need to decline the people's 
request for him to accept another term in office. 
  However, the question of when that time will come still 
constitutes a national puzzle that the current ongoing public 
debate prompted by the statement has failed to address 
satisfactorily. This situation is quite understandable because 
it concerns the right time for Suharto to decide to retire, so 
that he will not enter history as the country's second president 
for life. 
  Alamsyah Ratuperwiranegara, the former coordinating minister 
of social welfare and a staunch Suharto supporter, said recently 
that he took the President's statement, as quoted by the 
biographer, as a strong indication that Suharto would not be 
willing to be nominated for another term in office. 
  The view aired by Alamsyah, a shrewd politician who played 
an 
important role in the birth of the New Order government almost 
three decades ago, is apparently based not only on the 
conviction that the President was sincere in his remark, but 
also that Suharto will be 77 years old when his current term 
ends in 1998. Although Suharto's health has been better than 
that of the average Indonesian during the last 30 years, at 77 
he might well feel that he is too old for the job of leading a 
nation of almost 200 million people. 
  A wise leader is one who knows when he has to step down. If 
Suharto makes the right decision, he will no doubt be remembered 
as a great leader who has always had at heart the interests of 
all of his people, the poor included. In fact, nothing is 
certain in politics but the good judgment of a wise leader.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Excerpts] The private sector must bear a heavy burden in 
the Second Long-Term Development Plan (PJP II). Greater 
confidence has been placed in the private sector in this second 
25-year development period than in the previous PJP. 
  During PJP I the government gave the private sector a 
60-percent role in total national investment; in the upcoming 
25-year period the private sector will be given an even greater 
role, i.e., about 73 percent and the remaining 27 percent will 
remain the responsibility of the government. 
  This means that during PJP II the private sector, including 
the State-Owned Corporations (BUMN) and cooperatives, must be 
able to provide 660 trillion rupiahs of total national 
development, a very large figure. How will the private sector 
furnish or try to find such a large amount? The only way is for 
it to work harder than it has to date. In addition, the 
government must create a climate conducive to its development 
and determine which part of the private sector must be given the 
highest priority in playing a role and developing. 
  The government has said that in developing the private 
sector 
small and medium businesses have been given the highest 
priority. This is in line with trends found in other countries, 
in which the role of large businesses (conglomerates) will shift 
more and more to small and medium businesses. 
  Nevertheless, the government warns that private 
participation 
in national development should not depend on foreign loans. It 
cannot be denied that foreign loans are needed for development 
but if the amount is too great, it will harm Indonesia. 
  In that connection, it is hoped that the private sector will 
no longer dream of glory by continuing to force the construction 
of megaprojects. These require large amounts of money. Where is 
the money to come from if not from abroad? Also, the failure to 
build megaprojects due to the inability to pay off the foreign 
loans can prove fatal. It might increase Indonesia's "country 
risk" for foreign investors. It would be quite different if 
these megaprojects were 100 percent Foreign Capital Investments 
(PMA) because this would mean the introduction of foreign 
exchange into Indonesia, especially if the PMA is a state 
investment. However, we must also be careful with these 
100-percent PMAs because a megaproject based on a 100-percent 
PMA might in fact use investment funds originating within the 
country. 
  At the present time, Indonesia's "country risk," according 
to 
an evaluation made by an international institution, is triple B 
minus, not such a bad category. But if this is not watched or 
run carefully, it is quite possible that Indonesia will get a 
worse "country risk" rating. For example, the recent problems 
that the Bentoel cigarette factory in East Java experienced in 
paying off its foreign loans had serious consequences. A lack 
of trust in the Indonesian private sector developed abroad at 
that time. 
  Nevertheless, that does not mean that foreign loans are 
unnecessary. They continue to be needed even though they are not 
without risk, especially if they are in foreign currency, for 
example Japanese yen or American dollars. 
  Foreign loans can result in an increase in the Debt Service 
Ratio (DSR/ratio of installment debt to total value of exports) 
for which the government must assume responsibility. At the 
present time Indonesia's DSR is 32 percent, 21 percent of which 
is government debt and 11 percent is private-sector debt. Since 
foreign debt is not a government monopoly, in all honesty it is 
very difficult to detect private-sector foreign debt. "There is 
no monetary authority in the world which can control the traffic 
in private loans," said the Minister of Finance. 
  The Bank of Indonesia (BI) itself, as a monetary authority, 
may not be able to find out whether someone in the private 
sector has obtained a secret loan from abroad. It is possible 
that many private companies do not register the foreign loans 
which they have obtained. [passage omitted] 
  The private sector's role in national development will be 
challenged even more by the signing of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT is a big opportunity for the 
domestic private sector to prove whether it can compete in 
international trade. Given our current work ethic, it is certain 
that we will not seize this opportunity. The Indonesian private 
sector, whether it wants to or not, must be able to produce 
goods which are more competitive in quality or in price than 
those produced by other countries. But it cannot just rely on 
itself. The various institutions closely connected with the 
private sector must provide support, especially capitalization, 
to allow it to compete in international trade. 
  At the present time domestic bank interest rates do not 
support the development of the private sector very well. 
Interest rates of about 18 percent, which are relatively high 
compared with those in other countries, make it hard for 
domestic firms to compete in this era of globalization. 
  Actually, in order to make the private sector a moving force 
in the next 25 years, the government must also pay close 
attention to the role of the capital market as a source of 
funding. The market had not yet played much of a role in PJP I, 
but PJP II is the time for the government to entrust the it with 
this vital role. No less a person than Minister of Finance 
Mar'ie Muhammad would like the capital market to play a greater 
role, parallel to that of the money market, in funding national 
development. So, in order to make that market parallel to the 
money market the government has issued a policy allowing the use 
of stocks as additional collateral when submitting an 
application for credit. This policy would seem to be very 
simple, but since it is accompanied by certain conditions 
stating that not all stocks can be used as collateral for credit 
its effect has been to churn transactions on the capital market. 
Under these regulations, non-liquid stocks (sleeping stocks) to 
be used as collateral in applying for credit must be transacted 
first. 
  Unwritten government stipulations concerning the Price 
Earnings Ratio (PER) have also supported this feverish activity. 
At first, on grounds of watching out for investor interests, 
especially small investors, the government set a maximum PER of 
13 for a single issue of new stocks because a low PER means that 
initial offerings are within the reach of investors and will 
also give investors the opportunity for capital gains on the 
secondary market. However, the Minister admitted, prospective 
issuers (companies that go public) do not like a low PER because 
with a maximum PER of only 13 the hopes that issuers have of 
obtaining more funds by going public are only a dream. 
  Not long afterwards, however, the government, in this 
instance the Capital Market Oversight Board (BAPEPAM), changed 
the maximum PER standard from 13 to 15. BAPEPAM's policy differs 
from the Minister of Finance's more conservative policy of 
wanting a maximum PER of 13. Irrespective of that difference, 
BAPEPAM has strong reasons for raising the maximum PER limit to 
15. It is hoped that a PER of 15 will continue to protect 
investor interests while not harming the interests of issuers. 
Conditions very beneficial to both parties might provide an 
impetus for issuers to speed up the process of going public, 
which in turn might brighten the Indonesian stock market. Hopes 
are particularly high for State-Owned Corporations, which on 
average have performed better than companies going public at the 
present time. According to figures issued by the Indonesian 
Business Data Center (PDBI), there are about 24 BUMNs suitable 
for entering the capital market. Up to now, unfortunately, only 
Gresik Cement Inc has started to do so.

  [Excerpts] In 1994 the government is determined to hold 
fast to its cautious policy of controlling the fiscal and 
monetary sectors in order to place our economy in a safe 
position. J. Soedradjad Djiwandono, governor of the Bank of 
Indonesia (BI), made this statement at the Annual Banking 
Meeting held last Friday (14 January) in Jakarta. [passage 
omitted] 
  The government's cautious approach to banking could have 
been 
anticipated at the beginning of January when it lowered credit 
expansion objectives from about 20 percent in the second half of 
1993 to about 17 percent in 1994. 
  The governor of the Bank of Indonesia's statements in his 
welcoming remarks can be made into a touchstone and a direction 
for the Indonesian business community. The governor of the Bank 
of Indonesia reminded the audience of the fiscal-monetary steps 
taken to safeguard the macroeconomic balance, in particular to 
prevent unnecessary pressures on the balance of payments. 
However, we must watch out for two areas: first, the uncertain 
price of oil on the world market; and second, an excessive 
increase in imports due to an increase in domestic economic 
activity. [passage omitted] 
  Based on the latest figures, the overall minimal capital 
adequacy ratio (CAR) has reached more than eight percent. The 
governor admitted, however, that not all individual banks have 
reached this eight-percent figure. [passage omitted] If national 
banking has succeeded in meeting this eight-percent CAR 
requirement, as stated by the governor, it shows that the health 
of our banking system has made significant progress. However, it 
is not easy to meet this eight-percent CAR provision because, 
roughly speaking, for each 100-billion-rupiah increase in bank 
assets eight billion rupiahs in additional capital must be set 
aside from what is left of net profits after deducting taxes and 
dividends distributed to shareholders. 
  From 1991 to 1993 the average CAR of the seven government 
banks, except for the BTN [Bank Tabungan Negara], which is still 
around 5.35 percent, was raised to eight percent. This is 
certainly an achievement, considering that the additional 
capital needed to meet the provisions of the February Policy 
Package was provided under conditions of tight money when bank 
interest rates, for both deposits and loans, jumped up, 
accompanied by a high percentage of nonperforming loans. 
  Other developments in banking which are showing bright 
prospects according to the governor's report include the rapid 
increase in the number of banks which have succeeded in meeting 
the loan to deposit ratio (LDR) provisions. Banks with lending 
limits of 10 percent above deposits or with a ratio below 110 
percent are considered healthy. It is ideal if the LDR does not 
exceed 100 percent, meaning that the bank lending limit does not 
exceed deposits. According to the governor's report, only 15 
banks have LDRs above 110 percent. 
  As for the problem of the legal lending limit (3L), or the 
Maximal Limit for Granting Credit (BMPK)-- a recent subject of 
discussion -- Soedradjad warned banks to reduce their 3L 
violations by forming credit syndicates with other banks. 
  Section 11 Paragraph 2 of Banking Law Number 7 of 1992, 
states that the BMPK (3L) for groups of clients or individuals 
may not exceed 30 percent of the bank's capital. The objective 
of this tightening of credit is to minimize the risks and to 
equalize credit allocation because too much credit granted to a 
group of clients or to an individual can topple the bank if the 
loans cannot be paid back. Bank Summa is a recent example. 
  We agree with the governor when he suggests that the 
strategy 
of our national banking system should be to increase our 
qualitative ability to channel funds so that these mediating 
institutions can guarantee the safety of people's savings. 
Greater efforts should be made to uphold, for example, the 
provisions of the regulations in Law Number 7 of 1992, including 
criminal provisions. 
  The effects of globalization, the consequences of the 
speed-up in innovations and of recent structural changes which 
have changed the international financial system, must also be 
taken into account. Risks have been increasing and this has 
forced the monetary authorities, especially the central bank, to 
adjust its approach to monetary problems and to its 
macropolicies.

<F P=106> [Article by Kyoto University Associate Professor Hiroshi </F>
Nakanishi: "The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in the Post-Cold War 
Period: The Cornerstone of Regional Security"] 
  [Text] The U.S.-Japan relationship is one of the most 
important bilateral relationships in the world, and the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is the cornerstone of this 
relationship. In this thesis, I will use the general term 
"U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" for the cooperative relationship 
concerning the security of the United States and Japan, which is 
based upon the so-called old security treaty and the current 
security treaty. This has not changed even following the end of 
the Cold War. But the environment surrounding the 
cornerstone--the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty--has greatly changed 
in the post-Cold War era. Responding to this change, the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty should change its nature. Compared 
to the Cold War era when security was a global concern, regional 
security issues are gaining importance in the post-Cold War 
world. Therefore, determining what part it should play in 
relation to regional security problems will be an important key 
for the future of the U.S.-Japanese Security Treaty. I want to 
analyze the functions of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in the 
Cold War era and to discuss the role the U.S.-Japan Security 
Treaty should fulfill for the security of the Asia-Pacific 
region in the future. 
<H5>  Four Functions of U.S.-Japan Security Treaty </H5>
  When we hear the term U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, we tend to 
think of defense cooperation issues between the United States 
and Japan. Certainly that is the core of the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty. But security matters today should be 
understood to include the economic prosperity of the people. 
Also, because the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has made bilateral 
cooperation possible in a wide area, including the political and 
economic spheres, it is significant for these two countries. I 
will divide the functions of the treaty into four groups, 
analyze each function during the Cold War era, and discuss the 
role each should fulfill in terms of regional security. 
<H5>  (1) Maintenance of Economic Cooperation Relationship </H5>
  For the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, cooperation in economics 
is an important pillar. Article 2 of the current security 
treaty provides that "the parties will contribute toward the 
further development of peaceful and friendly international 
relations by strengthening their free institutions.... They 
will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic 
policies, and will encourage economic collaboration between 
them." Also, in the old security treaty, although there was no 
prescribed article, policies the United States adopted to 
promote Japanese economic self-sufficiency--such as market 
opening for Japan, support for Japanese entrance into GATT, 
support for economic exchange between Southeast Asia and Japan, 
and so on--reflected the fundamental policy of economic 
cooperation between the United States and Japan. Japan had also 
chosen the West's free economic system to bring about the 
recovery of the Japanese standard of living after the war. When 
the old security treaty was concluded, the basis of Prime 
Minister Yoshida's judgment was his conviction that Japan's 
recovery was possible only within a Western framework, mainly of 
the United States and Great Britain. Even after Japanese export 
competitiveness became strong, and economic friction between 
Japan and other advanced capitalist countries had begun, the 
common objective of the "solidarity of the West" contained this 
friction within a controlled framework during the Cold War. 
After the "oil shock," platforms such as summits were erected, 
and a posture of solving economic issues by cooperation was 
adopted. This resulted from the recognition of the necessity 
for Western unity against the East. 
  Today the combined U.S.-Japan GNP accounts for about 40 
percent of the world's total GNP, so continued economic 
cooperation by these two countries is indispensable for world 
stability. But in international politics, it is not easy for 
two strong counties to cooperate. Since the fall of the Soviet 
Union and East European communism, the importance of economic 
strength in international politics is recognized. It is 
possible that economically strong countries will become more 
conscious of each other as rivals. We cannot be too optimistic 
about future economic cooperation between the United States and 
Japan. This tendency will become more pronounced since the goal 
of "Western unity" disappeared when the Cold War ended. The 
argument that "Japan is different"--which was popular a while 
ago--may be seen as one of the indications of such a trend. 
  But when sights are shifted from the Cold War context of 
the "West" to the context of the Asia-Pacific region, economic 
cooperation between the United States and Japan has new 
significance. The ministers conference/unofficial leadership 
conference by APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) held in 
Seattle last November revealed how importantly economic 
prosperity is viewed in the Asia-Pacific region. There were 
certainly some differences of view about the way in which 
concrete economic cooperation should be achieved, as seen in the 
absence from the leadership conference of Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahatir. But recognition that each country's own 
economic development is vital, and as a precondition that an 
open economic system is necessary, are becoming common ideas in 
each country within the region. Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
attended the leadership conference, along with representatives 
from Taiwan and Hong Kong. This symbolizes how much importance 
the Asia-Pacific countries place on economics. Such 
strengthened recognition that a peaceful international 
environment is necessary for each country's own economic 
development could become a useful tool in securing future peace 
in the Asia-Pacific region. In such a case, it will also be 
indispensable for regional security that the two economic 
powers--the United States and Japan-- maintain a relationship of 
economic cooperation. 
  Looking at it in another way, we can point out that an 
expanded Asia-Pacific economy will make U.S.-Japan economic 
cooperation easier. First, by the expanded economy in this 
region, the two countries' economic relationship will shift from 
a "zero-sum" to a "plus-sum" situation. Both countries need 
markets to maintain employment and capital investment to 
maintain competitiveness. Under such circumstances, the most 
promising way to benefit the two countries today would be to 
expand their market in the Asia-Pacific region, and at the same 
time transfer funds and technology through investment and 
assistance. Second, it is possible the different economic 
structures within the United States and Japan could be 
reinterpreted as representing "diversity" for the region. This 
contains a more positive connotation. Post-war economic 
development was based on a horizontal trade structure among 
developed countries. But for the economic development of the 
Asia-Pacific countries, differences of contributing 
conditions--such as natural resources, technology, population, 
and so on--are providing the dynamism. In such circumstances, 
it may be rather desirable for the region if there are two 
different approaches, namely that of the United States which 
values the open market and investment opportunities, and that of 
Japan which values social stability. 
  In essence, to maintain U.S.-Japan economic cooperation by 
its becoming a precondition for regional economic prosperity 
will result in fulfilling its role of promoting regional 
security. It also has the reciprocal benefit that regional 
prosperity will make U.S.-Japan cooperation easier. 
<H5>  (2) Offering a Political Framework </H5>
  One of the pillars of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was to 
oppose the Communist political structure, to point the direction 
of liberal democratic political structures, and to cooperate for 
strengthening such efforts. The characteristics of this 
security treaty meant the Japanese political direction was kept 
within the "Western" framework, which was formed during the Cold 
War with the United States as the leader. To be in this 
framework brought Japan a number of benefits. First, by leaving 
the political leadership of international society to Europe and 
the United States, and by concentrating on economic prosperity, 
it was possible to avoid domestic political confrontation. 
Prime Minister Ikeda's policy of doubling income is one good 
example. Second, Japanese participation in the Western 
framework also made Japan's return into international society 
easier. For instance, the ANZUS [Australia-New Zealand- United 
States] Treaty concluded in 1951 was the price the United States 
paid to gain support from Australia and New Zealand for a U.S. 
peace treaty with Japan. As a matter of fact, in the preamble 
of this treaty it was mentioned that U.S. forces would be 
stationed in and around Japan, as well as in the Philippines and 
the Ryukyus (as they were referred to at that time). In other 
words, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was a kind of guarantee 
the United States gave to other Asia-Pacific countries that 
Japan would not depart from the Western framework, and was a 
part of the framework which permitted the post-war Japanese 
return to the international scene. 
  Of course we cannot deny there was another aspect. That was 
the feeling that, in exchange for a peace treaty, Japan was 
brought into the order of the "West," of which the United States 
was the leader. This created dissatisfaction in the Japanese 
psyche of self-pride. The revision of the treaty carried out 
under the Kishi Cabinet aimed at satisfying the Japanese sense 
of independence by using the term "U.S.-Japan on an equal 
footing." The reversion of Okinawa, achieved by the Sato 
Cabinet, was done to satisfy the self-pride of the Japanese 
people. Also, the negative reaction Japanese displayed a few 
years ago when the U.S. Marine Corps commander in Okinawa 
reportedly described the significance of the U.S. forces in 
Japan as a "cap on the bottle" which prevented Japanese 
remilitarization, seemed from a Japanese perspective to be 
another confirmation that the United States still maintained the 
leadership. 
  In fact, when we analyze the history of the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty, there are more than a few occasions when the 
United States made concessions to Japan. Despite the fact that 
the size of the Japanese Self-Defense Force in the 1950's was 
far smaller than what was required by the United States, Japan 
was able to receive American aid. As for Okinawa, Japan's 
"residual sovereignty" was recognized at the time of the peace 
treaty. At the time of Okinawa's reversion, Japan maintained 
its condition of "no nuclear weapons, the same as on the 
Japanese mainland." But because the stationing of U.S. forces 
has continued since the occupation, the original image the 
Japanese had of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty does not seem to 
have changed much. 
  Moreover, when the relative economic strength of the United 
States and Japan approached parity, unhappiness both inside and 
outside the country increased because Japan would not seek to 
make politically oriented statements. When Japan was expected 
to shoulder burdens in the security field corresponding to its 
economic strength, domestic political decisions also became 
necessary. Other countries have also come to feel uneasy 
because Japan, which has a large economy, does not clarify its 
political positions. The system of dividing the work--politics 
by the United States and economics by Japan--lacks rationality, 
and the political role which Japan should play is beginning to 
become an issue. Since the end of the Cold War, the "Western" 
framework is losing its significance, so it is possible this 
trend may be further strengthened. 
  Naturally, it is desirable that Japan actively express its 
political position. But it should not be regarded as a 
bilateral issue between the United States and Japan--i.e., the 
recovery of self-rule from the United States. As stated 
earlier, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty contained another side 
to begin with. This treaty was in a sense a tacit multinational 
treaty. To let Japan return to the international community, the 
United States indirectly acted as proxy for demands made by 
other countries toward Japan, Asia-Pacific countries in 
particular. The structure in which the United States acted as 
the coordinator among the countries in the region was rational 
because of the Cold War context and the scale of the hegemony 
the United States held in the Pacific Ocean area. But today the 
Asia-Pacific countries have the ability to speak out 
internationally for themselves, so the Japanese political role 
should be discussed in the context of a regional multinational 
framework which includes both the United States and Japan. For 
instance, the "ASEAN Regional Forum," the establishment of which 
was agreed on at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers Conference 
held last July, would be an appropriate place for dialogue. In 
such a place, the presence of the special cooperative 
relationship between the United States and Japan would 
strengthen Japan's voice. Albeit desiring an American presence 
in the Pacific, many Asian nations resist any special 
relationships as regards security. Their ideas are also 
different from American ideas on human rights and political 
systems. While guaranteeing to these countries that it would 
not go back to the prewar structure by maintaining its bilateral 
relationship with the United States, Japan can help convey Asian 
thinking to the United States. Japan should work to create the 
concept of a new political framework which would replace the 
"West" through a multinational dialogue of Asia-Pacific 
countries. 
<H5>  (3) Preservation of a Secure International Environment </H5>
  For the stability of international society, the maintenance 
of minimum order is necessary to guarantee the security of 
transactions/negotiations among nations. During the Cold War, 
the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty provided a certain order in the 
region in the form of ensuring American presence in the 
Asia-Pacific. Especially for a maritime nation such as Japan, 
it was significant that security of the seas where national 
jurisdiction did not extend was guaranteed by the United States. 
U.S. bases in Japan and the Japanese Government's support for 
them made the U.S. presence in the Pacific easier; that in turn 
guaranteed Japan's security for its international traffic, from 
the Pacific-Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. Of course it 
was a policy based upon America's own interests to secure 
control of the sea in the Pacific since, an interest dating back 
to the days of Admiral Mahan. But the maritime peace secured by 
the United States meant that Japan, which had chosen the road 
which led to economic prosperity through international trade, 
could enjoy a favorable environment. 
  As the Soviet Union strengthened its Far East Fleet 
beginning 
in the latter half of the 1970's, Japan took charge of the 
defense of the sea lanes extending 1000 nautical mile from 
Japanese coastal waters. This took the form of defense sharing 
with the United States. 
  This sharing by geographic division was made in response 
to the Cold War. The reason was at that time Soviet naval 
forces were the only possible potential threat to the sea lanes 
in the Asia-Pacific region. It was believed the Soviet Union 
would attack the sea lanes in Japanese coastal waters should it 
decide on a world war, and would attempt a naval blockade 
against the entire West, including the United States and Japan, 
as Germany did during the First and Second World Wars. 
Therefore it was believed there was a strong possibility an 
attack against U.S. and Japanese vessels would occur 
simultaneously. In such a case, the defensive action Japan 
would take within 1000 nautical miles of Japanese coastal 
waters, by asserting its right of self-defense, would connect 
with America's securing the sea lanes beyond 1000 nautical miles. 
  Now that the Cold War has ceased and Soviet naval power has 
been drastically reduced, there is no longer any nation which 
could conduct a naval blockade in opposition to U.S. maritime 
domination. But in addition to the decline of Soviet naval 
forces, there is an important factor which changed the 
environment surrounding the waters of the Asia-Pacific. First, 
many countries in this region started strengthening their sea 
and air defenses because of their increased dependency on 
international trade. Second, with the end of the Cold War, the 
arms market has become a buyers' market. For countries with 
smaller economies, it has become easier to improve their naval 
and air forces with equipment which had been difficult to 
purchase earlier. Recently, the Chinese are reported to be 
strengthening their naval power. Not only China, but Taiwan and 
other Southeast Asian countries attach importance to 
strengthening naval and air power. Third, the United Nations 
Treaty on Law of the Sea was concluded in 1982. As a 
consequence, each nation's maritime jurisdiction has expanded 
beyond the previous three-nautical-mile limit. To protect these 
maritime rights and interests, the improvement of naval and air 
power has become necessary. The confrontation surrounding the 
Spratley Islands in the South China Sea is one issue which has 
been increasing in importance. In other words, while the 
possibility of a total maritime war between the United States 
and the Soviet Union has disappeared, the number of countries 
which possess small to medium maritime and air power is 
increasing. This situation itself is not necessarily dangerous, 
but neither can we positively say the Pacific Ocean has become a 
"peaceful body of water." 
  In the Pentagon report to Congress entitled "Strategic 
Framework in the Asia-Pacific Rim," which was submitted during 
the Bush administration, it is stated the United States would 
expect in the post-Cold War era that Japan would continue its 
commitment of defending sea lanes for 1000 nautical mile. But 
will coordination of roles in maritime security, rather than 
geographic divisions, become more important? As I mentioned 
earlier, considering the overwhelming nature of America's 
current maritime supremacy, staving off regional strife and 
avoiding danger to ships and aircraft resulting from strife, 
rather than securing sea lanes, will become the issue. To 
handle this issue, the overwhelming American naval power 
maintains its presence as the power ultimately responsible for 
preserving maritime order and also as balance for the region. 
At the same time, it is conceivable that in the realm of 
patrol/maritime surveillance, the purpose of which is primarily 
to maintain maritime safety in peacetime, countries such as 
Japan and Australia could share the task while fulfilling their 
international roles. Naturally, issues such as the maintenance 
of maritime safety in peacetime need to be dealt with through 
multinational cooperation and understanding. Moreover, in 
important regions for international sea routes--such as the 
South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca--Japan should make 
diplomatic efforts so adjacent countries can make progress on 
confidence building and on arms control concerning maritime and 
air power. To produce multinational security cooperation in the 
Asia-Pacific region where the consciousness of independence and 
national defense is strong, all sorts of difficulties must be 
overcome. But the maintenance of maritime traffic safety must 
be a common interest for the region, so efforts should be made 
to accumulate cooperation wherever possible. 
  To build up the regional security framework described above, 
support for U.S. forces stationed in Japan should continue in 
the future. But as for its significance, a new way of looking 
at it will be necessary. In the past, the thinking was strong 
in Japan that "in return for letting Americans use the bases we 
will have them protect Japan." But we should rather take the 
position of supporting U.S. forces stationed here as a 
contribution to the security of the Asia-Pacific region. 
<H5>  (4) Defense of Japanese Territory </H5>
  The core role of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is that the 
United States and Japan are to jointly defend Japanese territory. 
  The characteristic point of the defense of Japan during the 
Cold War was that it became part of the greatest bipolar 
military structure in the world intended to deter an offense by 
the East against the West. In other words, fundamentally it can 
be said that deterring an attack on Japan was important for the 
defense of the entire Western world, and the degree of Japanese 
defensive strength was regarded in the context of how it would 
strengthen the deterrent power of the West as a whole. 
  According to the "DEFENSE PLAN OUTLINE" produced in 1976, 
the 
objective of Japanese defensive strength was to independently 
eliminate a "limited and small" aggression. This was based on 
an analysis of the situation that "due to the balance in 
military strength, which includes mutual deterrence of nuclear 
arms and various efforts for stabilization of international 
relations, there is little possibility for a comprehensive 
military clash or major armed struggle which could trigger such 
clashes." Naturally, the actual defense against a minor 
aggression in case deterrence failed was also an objective of 
the outline. It seems that in the basic position of the 
Japanese defense policy, the emphasis was placed on deterring 
aggression against Japan by contributing to an increase in the 
West's deterrent ability--with American strategic nuclear power 
at its core--rather than on defending against aggression. 
  Since the Cold War has ended, the nature of the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty concerning the defense of Japanese territory 
will undergo change. First, the significance of the American 
nuclear restraint is gradually changing. In the past, the 
American position on nuclear deterrence was such that it did not 
exclude nuclear retaliation against large, regular military 
forces. Now it seems it is moving in a direction where its 
significance is limited to deterrence against proliferation and 
use of weapons of mass destruction. In that case, a fundamental 
posture will be necessary in which conventional weapons should 
be used against an attack launched with conventional weapons. 
  Second, by the end of the Cold War, the relative importance 
of the regional context of Northeast Asia--comprised of the PRC, 
the Korean peninsula, Russia, and so on--has increased. 
Security issues in Northeast Asia also have an aspect that they 
have been traditional issues for Japan since the Meiji period. 
But when such important factors as changes in an individual 
country's political system and technological advances are 
considered, we should regard them as new issues. 
  Keeping these changes in mind, when we think about Japanese 
defense we realize there are short- and long-term problems. The 
focus of the short-term problem is the handling of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development. As for long-term problems, it is 
to create a stable Northeast Asian regional security order and 
examine the Japanese defense policy which would conform to it. 
The importance the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has in relation 
to both of these problems is clear. First, it is indispensable 
that the American deterrent against a nuclear attack on Japan be 
confirmed. A fully functioning American nuclear deterrent would 
not only directly contribute to Japanese security, it would not 
permit excuses by neighboring countries for engaging in nuclear 
proliferation on the pretext they suspect Japan possesses 
nuclear arms. Naturally, in the more distant future cooperation 
in the development of a theater missile defense (TMD) is also 
significant in the sense of reducing not only Japanese defenses, 
but also the incentive for possession of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  Moreover, what is important for dealing with the long-term 
problems is to have continued American participation in 
maintaining the peace in Northeast Asia, especially concerning 
security on the Korean peninsula. Because of the historical 
background, Japan should not directly participate in security 
matters involving the Korean peninsula. But if by any chance 
some disturbance would occur on the peninsula, Japan would be in 
a position in which it could not avoid being affected. It is 
also vital for Japanese security, in terms of the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty, that the United States carries responsibility 
for stability on the Korean peninsula. 
  Japan should be resolved to provide support--economic 
support 
in particular--toward unity and prosperity on the Korean 
peninsula. We should not repeat the history of intervention in 
domestic disorders by Japan, China, and Russia on the Korean 
peninsula. At the same time, Japan should advance security 
dialogues with China and Russia. Considering the situation in 
Northeast Asia in which territorial issues and differet 
political systems exist, multination-based discussions will not 
achieve many results. Thus, we should accumulate bilateral 
security dialogue and confidence-building measures, and should 
work so that the countries will come to an understanding about a 
secure order in Northeast Asia. A multinational framework from 
which no successful outcome can be expected would be harmful. 
  It is reported that a revision responding to the 
post-Cold War situation is being made in the "DEFENSE PLAN 
OUTLINE." But the past method for determining defensive 
strength levels took Western deterrence as a major premise, so 
this method is not necessarily the best for the future. Of 
course, the method for maintaining its defensive strength should 
be determined by Japan itself. But in the post-Cold War era, it 
should be conceived in conjunction with improved efforts in the 
international environment such as diplomatic activities, 
security dialogues, confidence-building measures, and so forth 
in the region. The objective of defense is securing the safety 
of Japanese territory, and defensive power is the means, along 
with alliances and diplomatic efforts. For the defense of Japan, 
the choice Japan should make under these circumstances is to 
secure fundamental security for Japan through the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty and Japanese defense efforts, while 
simultaneously forming a new regional order. 
<H5>  The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in the Region </H5>
  As seen above, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty functioned in 
the past with the objectives of strengthening the West 
economically, uniting it politically, and deterring the East 
from aggression. Because the security treaty fulfilled its 
functions well, it has lasted over forty years. But in the 
post-Cold War environment, the comprehensive notion of the 
"West" will gradually lose significance, and it is natural the 
significance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty should again be 
questioned. But as we have so far analyzed, the security treaty 
has a valid meaning for regional security, the importance of 
which will increase in the future. As for the security of the 
Asia-Pacific region, a comprehensive idea which would be 
equivalent to the "West" in the Cold War will not emerge, at 
least for some time. 
  As is often said, the Asia-Pacific region is complex; it is 
natural in the multinational framework that things should be 
multilayered and diverse. As seen above in the economic area, a 
loose organization such as APEC can work well, and in the 
political area it would be easier to gain consensus in a context 
for dialogue where Asian countries take the initiative. As 
regards maintaining maritime order, which means the common 
security of the region, it will be necessary to accumulate 
agreements layer by layer among the multiple countries as it is 
possible. In Northeast Asia, a bilateral approach seems to be 
more effective than a multinational framework. 
  All such approaches should be subject to change, responding 
to the fluid situation. In any case, a regional order in the 
Asia-Pacific area is just coming into being, so flexibility 
rather than adherence to a certain plan will be important. 
  But in order to be flexible, some fulcrum is necessary. For 
Japan, it will be the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. As previously 
stated, as a regional security pact becomes necessary, the 
framework of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is most stable. But 
our consciousness of the current U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is 
still largely regulated by the Cold War. It is necessary that 
we review the significance and role of the U.S.-Japan Security 
Treaty from a new perspective. When the first U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty was concluded in 1951, the Cold War had already 
begun. For those Japanese who had been under occupation until 
then, they were hardly conscious of participating in an 
international order which was in the background of the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Japanese tend to view the world 
through the filter of their relationship with the United States. 
Looking at it from such an aspect, the drastic change in the 
international order may provide an excellent opportunity for the 
Japanese. Through the process of creating order in the 
Asia-Pacific region, both the United States and Japan may be 
able to reconfirm the significance of the U.S.-Japan Security 
Treaty. 
  Of course, the future U.S.-Japan relationship will be 
important not only in the Asia-Pacific region, but also at the 
world level-- for example, in the United Nations and the G-7. 
There may also be efforts which have to be coordinated by each 
country, or which must be bilaterally promoted. Such problems 
could not be touched upon in this article. But in the current 
situation, the adjustment of policies at various levels is a 
matter of priority, and they should not be mutually 
contradictory. In order to develop the formation of a future 
international order--which includes a regional order--the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty will continue to persist as the 
cornerstone. (This is a shortened and revised thesis originally 
written in English and submitted as the product of an academic 
program at the Research Institute for Peace and Security.)

<F P=106> [Article by industrial reporter Ichiro Kuwada: "Demands on </F>
Too Many Numbers in Automobiles and Auto Parts -- Breakthrough 
Not in Sight Because of Poor Demand"; first in a series entitled 
"Review of the Four Areas of Japan-U.S. Friction"; first 
paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] After the Japan-U.S. summit ended in failure, the 
United States began to signal the possibility of invoking 
sanctions against Japan. We have undertaken a study on the 
current conditions and problems within the industry in the four 
areas of recent friction--automobiles and auto parts, 
communications equipment, semiconductors, and 
supercomputers--and on the possibility of resolving these 
problems. 
<H5>  Growing Uneasiness About the Future </H5>
  On the evening of 18 February, the Japan Automobile Dealers 
Association threw a party in Tokyo. The topic naturally turned 
to Japan-U.S. issues. Tatsuro Toyota, president of Toyota Motor 
Corporation, remarked: "Japan needs to make efforts to open up 
its market, but what about the high yen that has gone far too 
high?" Hiroyuki Yoshino, vice president of Honda Motor Company, 
said: "We must not become emotional. We must deal with this 
situation in a calm manner." The auto industry praises the 
Japanese Government for rejecting numerical targets, but without 
a lead to resolving the friction, there are growing voices of 
uneasiness about the future as well. 
  The areas in which the United States demands to have 
numerical targets set on automobiles and auto parts are the 
purchase of auto parts and the expanded sale of U.S.-made 
vehicles in the Japanese market. Both entail the basic problem 
of "being linked to managed trade." Besides, the given 
situation of the industry is that existing business conditions 
being so bad, it is simply "impossible to expand the quantity of 
imports," according to an officer from Nissan Motor Company. 
Another major auto company officer asked: "The Japanese 
companies put in so much effort and went through unspeakable 
tribulations when they first began operating in the United 
States. Are U.S. manufacturers serious about developing markets 
in Japan?" 
<H5>  U.S. Mistrust in Keiretsu </H5>
  What the United States wants for auto part procurements is 
for Japan's voluntary plan to "buy $19 billion worth of 
U.S.-made goods in 1994" as announced in January 1992 to be 
extended in duration and expanded in quantity. The $19 billion 
comprises $15 billion in local procurements by 
Japanese-affiliated plants in the United States, and $4 billion 
in imports to Japan. Purchases in 1990 which were used as the 
basis of calculation were $9.1 billion. The growth since then 
has been 16 percent in 1991, 29 percent in 1992, and 11 percent 
in the first half of 1993. The United States demands growth be 
raised by 10 to 30 percent in 1995, and then retain that rate 
thereafter. 
  Toyoshi Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, while speaking in a meeting of the Joint Steering 
Committee of the Japanese-U.S. Businessmen's Conference held 
shortly after the Japan-U.S. summit stated: "In view of the 
current conditions of the Japanese economy, it will be difficult 
to fulfill the targets." Tazo Yokoyama, executive director of 
Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, noted: "The economic conditions 
are different from those when (then) President Bush was in Japan 
in January 1992." 
  Japan's automobile production dropped from 13.50 million 
units in 1990 to 10.22 million units in 1993. Given such 
conditions, a staff official of the Japanese Automobile 
Manufacturers Association said: "Importing auto parts can mean 
life or death for Japanese parts manufacturers." Total sales 
for the parts industry are said to total about 18 trillion yen a 
year. The $4 billion (about 400 billion yen) asked to be 
imported into Japan comes to 2 percent of total domestic sales, 
and is comparable to the annual sales of Aishin Precision 
Machinery Company, Japan's second largest manufacturer (whose 
yearly sales up to the first quarter of 1994 are expected to 
total 465 billion yen). 
  Concerning local procurements, the views of the U.S. 
private sector are somewhat different from those shown by the 
U.S. Government. Joseph Gorman, chairman of the major U.S. 
parts manufacturer TRW, declared: "Our company has no complaints 
about Japan with respect to business. Over the past two to 
three years, U.S. parts manufacturers have gone into a 
relationship of cooperating with Japanese auto manufacturers 
from the design stage on, and sales of parts for use in local 
production of automobiles have risen sharply since last year." 
Nonetheless, within the United States there remains a feeling 
of mistrust. A top executive of a U.S. parts manufacturer said: 
"Japanese auto manufacturers might return to the practice of 
buying parts primarily from keiretsu companies once the 
numerical targets are removed." 
<H5>  Voices Urge "Buying 100,000 Units a Year" </H5>
  Regarding imports of finished vehicles, the United States 
has 
not officially presented any numbers in the negotiation, but in 
the U.S. industry there are voices saying Japan should buy at 
least 100,000 units a year. According to a survey done by the 
Japan Automobile Importers Association, total sales for all U.S. 
Big Three vehicles sold in Japan in 1993 totaled only 19,300 
units. 
  Toyota has announced a plan to sell 20,000 units of General 
Motors compact cars beginning in 1996. Nissan-affiliated 
dealers are due to finish by year's end the groundwork to be 
able to sell 3,000 to 4,500 units of Ford passenger cars. The 
Big Three themselves are beginning to take the Japanese market 
seriously, for instance by announcing plans to introduce 
right-hand drive cars. But as one influential Toyota-affiliated 
dealer said, there are persistent complaints of "their service 
system being inadequate." It will not be easy to accomplish the 
target of 100,000 units. 
  In a news conference on 21 February Keishin Kato, chairman 
of 
the Automobile Dealers Association, said: "It would be wrong 
for the association to advise member dealers to accept U.S.-made 
automobiles." He thus declared the association will allow 
dealers to decide on whether to handle U.S.-made vehicles. The 
association is determined to firmly reject any numerical targets. 
  But Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and 
industry, is himself hopeful the industry will make efforts 
toward importation, stating: "I welcome the private sector 
taking measures voluntarily to expand imports." More or less in 
response to this, and while the government was in process of 
negotiating, the auto industry studied formulating the 
industry's own programs for international cooperation. Now it 
has become difficult for the industry to come up with any 
measures. A Toyota official said: "It is meaningless to adopt 
such measures now when government-to-government negotiations 
have broken down." The industry's own voluntary cooperation 
plan, which accepts no administrative guidance, and hence no 
numerical targets, remains a subject to be studied. But the 
industry insists "the study should be done on a business basis 
by all means," and it is unclear whether a compromise can be 
reached with the United States.

<F P=106> [By Hiroshi Komatsu] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 24 Feb -- Shoichi Kuriyama, Japanese 
ambassador to the United States, held a luncheon meeting on 22 
February with members of the bipartisan "Study Group on Japan" 
from the Capitol Hill (chaired by Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chairman Hamilton). They exchanged views on Japan-U.S. 
relations following the breakdown of the economic framework 
talks. 
  At the meeting, Ambassador Kuriyama pointed out that the 
economic talks were broken off because both Japan and the United 
States distrusted each other. With regard to the large tax 
reductions with which President Clinton professed 
dissatisfaction during the recent Japan-U.S. summit, the 
ambassador stated in an effort to dispel U.S. misunderstandings: 
"The tax cuts are not limited to one year." Moreover, 
Ambassador Kuriyama briefed them about Japan's voluntary 
market-opening measures centering on deregulation--which the 
Hosokawa cabinet is currently promoting--and sought U.S. 
understanding. 
  On the other hand, U.S. Congressmen who attended the meeting 
professed dissatisfaction with the closed nature of the Japanese 
market and stated their opinions regarding the lack of mutual 
trust between the two countries as well as other issues. They 
expressed concern that if the Japanese and U.S. Governments do 
not mend the current rift between them at an early date, the 
atmosphere in Congress against Japan will grow worse.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Japan-U.S. Economic Consultations </F>
Break Down -- Fooled by `Phantom U.S. Compromise Plan'" ] 
  [Text] Confrontation continued in the Japan-U.S. economic 
consultations over the question of setting numerical targets to 
measure the degree of the openness of the Japanese market. 
Contrary to the U.S. expectations that Japan would eventually 
back down, the summit meeting 10 days ago ended in failure -- 
the first occurrence in the history of such meetings between 
Japan and the United States. But according to several Japanese 
Government officials who participated in the negotiations, at 
least where the areas of medical technology, telecommunications, 
and insurance were concerned, they were supposed to be "close to 
reaching agreements." The breakdown of the talks was due to 
misunderstandings by both Japan and the United States on a 
"phantom compromise proposal" suggested by the United States. 
<H5>  Acceptable Plan </H5>
  On the afternoon of 8 February, U.S. Trade Representative 
[USTR] Mickey Kantor, who was exasperated by the stubborn 
resistance of Japanese bureaucrats, announced a unilateral 
suspension of negotiations, saying: "No progress can be expected 
through further talks among the bureaucrats. We will wait for 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who leads the negotiations, to 
arrive in the United States." 
  The following evening, on 9 February, when Koichiro 
Matsuura, 
deputy-vice minister for foreign affairs, was about to leave the 
conference room after a day of talks, Bowman Cutter, deputy 
assistant to the President, stopped him, and asked, "Does Japan 
want to finalize these consultations?" 
  "Of course," Matsuura responded. 
  Saying "If that is the case," Cutter orally informed 
Matsuura 
of a U.S. compromise proposal. His words were: "Let us finalize 
the talks on macroeconomic issues and government procurement and 
insurance sectors without including numerical targets, and then 
round up the talks on the automobiles and auto parts within one 
month after the summit meeting is held." 
  Matsuura believed the compromise proposal had the final 
approval of the U.S. Government, and thought, "that should be 
acceptable." Subsequently, he notified Zosaburo Okamatsu, deputy 
vice-minister of international trade and industry, and Kosuke 
Nakahira, deputy vice-minister for financial affairs, that "the 
United States has backed down." 
  For a moment, however, a puzzling thought entered Okamatsu's 
mind -- this position seemed so different from the rigid stance 
taken by the USTR. 
<H5>  Clash in the Second Meeting </H5>
  The first meeting of Hata and Kantor opened at 0730 on 10 
February. Kantor said: "Let us aim for the goal of reaching 
agreements." To this, Hata, who had been apprised of the 
Matsuura-Cutter meeting, responded, "I understand what you mean. 
(These things can be taken care of at the working-level talks.) 
That is about it, right?" 
  Therein occurred a misunderstanding. Kantor interpreted 
Hata's response as a concession by Japan. But what Hata really 
meant was to aim for the goal of reaching agreements by allowing 
working-level officials to resume their talks. He proposed 
reopening working-level talks, and Kantor accepted. 
  This meeting [between Hata and Kantor] was attended by 
Matsuura and Cutter as well. But Matsuura could not at all 
detect in Kantor's remarks any sign that the United States was 
making concessions, as suggested by Cutter's proposal. The 
harried Matsuura contacted Deputy USTR Charlene Barshevsky, but 
her reply was heartless: "the USTR's position has not changed." 
  In a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) on the 
morning of 10 February, Kantor reported that there was a feeling 
that "Japan is backing down." President Clinton instructed him 
"to proceed with the negotiations according to the policy of the 
past." 
  Later that afternoon, Matsuura, Okamatsu, and Nakahira 
resumed vice-ministerial-level talks in their respective fields. 
The compromise proposal received the day before was still in 
the back of their minds. But the atmosphere of the meetings was 
unusual. The United States once again came out pushing for 
numerical targets. 
  At 1600 on 10 February, a second meeting between Hata and 
Kantor began. Hata charged: "Discussions are on a completely 
different track from our meeting this morning. Why has wrong 
information been provided at the beginning of the 
vice-ministerial-level talks?" 
  Kantor glared back at him, saying, "When I said we should 
aim for the goal of reaching agreements, did you not say `I 
understand'?" Hata did not yield, retorting, "I did not say 
anything to the effect you imply." 
  Hata had an appointment with Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen 
at 1700, but Kantor phoned the latter to have the appointment 
cancelled. According to Kantor, "such a meeting was not 
needed." Fierce arguments [between Hata and Kantor] went on for 
more than two hours. 
  The United States did not bend from its rigid stance. The 
Hata-Bentsen meeting eventually started at 1900, with Bentsen 
assailing Japan's overall economic measures. He insisted that 
the joint statement issued by the summit should include an 
expression saying "macroeconomic measures [taken by Japan] are 
inadequate." Hata rejected this, saying, "If that happens, the 
cabinet will collapse." It was decided that no joint statement 
would be issued. 
<H3>  `I Am Tough, But...' </H3>
A third meeting between Hata and Kantor was held at 0100 on 11 
February. Hata spoke to reporters hopefully, saying, "I do not 
see why we cannot reach a compromise," but Kantor remained 
stiff. This did not mean that Hata thought there were chances 
for a compromise. After the meeting, Kantor consoled Hata, 
saying, "I am tough, but I cannot beat you." But overnight 
talks did not bear fruit, and the failure of the economic 
consultations became a certainty. 
  "The 10th [of February] was really a devil-haunted day. We 
do not know who crushed the phantom compromise proposal. Maybe 
the dovish group has been overridden by the hawkish group." 
This was stated by a member of the Japanese negotiating team. 
The best guess is that during the half day which elapsed from 
the time Cutter offered the compromise proposal to the time the 
Hata-Kantor conference began, there was a power struggle within 
the U.S. Administration between Cutter and Kantor, with Clinton 
choosing Kantor's approach.

  [Text] Washington, 24 Feb -- Hiroshi Saito, Japan Iron and 
Steel Federation chairman (and chairman of the Nippon Steel 
Corporation) held a news conference on 24 February after 
attending an international steel trade conference held in 
Washington. At the news conference, Chairman Saito expressed a 
sense of crisis about the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks 
which resulted in a rupture during the recent Japanese-U.S. 
summit and said, "I, as a businessman, cannot leave the matter 
as it is." He stated this was his personal opinion. He said 
that the Japanese Government "should present numerical targets 
concerning the macroeconomy" in future negotiations. 
  Moreover, he called for the Japanese Government's positive 
action, saying that "because the ball is now in Japan's court, 
Japan has to throw the ball back to the United States." And, he 
added, "We want to make efforts so that (the Japanese 
Government) can throw the ball back as soon as possible." The 
conference was held on 23 and 24 February. Chairman Saito gave 
a speech on 24 February and stated that antidumping lawsuits by 
the United States and other countries have created distortions 
in the market. He then reiterated the need for an early 
conclusion of the multilateral steel agreement (MSA) which 
regulates trade conditions among various countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Actions Are Needed To Break the Impasse In </F>
Japan-U.S. Relations?] 
  [Text] During a 26 February meeting of cabinet ministers 
concerned with external economic affairs, the government decided 
to announce a package of voluntary market-opening measures by 
the end of March. It is irritating to see the government act 
slowly. 
  After the Japan-U.S. framework trade negotiations and talks 
between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. President Clinton broke 
down, there have been fears about the future of Japan-U.S. 
relations, calls for early resumption of the trade talks and 
proposals to lessen the friction between the two countries. 
  While there has been sharp criticism of each other, Japan 
and 
the United States agree on the basic principle that bilateral 
relations must not be damaged. 
  Therefore, swift action by Japan is the key to breaking the 
deadlock. 
  Hosokawa must have had a plan ready when he said "no" to the 
U.S. Government's demands. How is Japan going to change and 
become a more open nation? We would like to hear Hosokawa's 
specific plan as soon as possible. 
  At the same time, Japan must keep up a constant dialogue 
with 
the United States not only at a government level but also at the 
private sector level. 
  During an upcoming meeting of finance ministers and central 
bank heads from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations 
in Germany, a finance ministerial meeting between Japan and the 
United States is also expected to be held. We urge Finance 
Minister Fujii to make sure that the United States will 
correctly understand Japan's measures for boosting domestic 
demand, including the implementation of a tax cut far ahead of a 
tax increase. 
  In the first half of March, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher is scheduled to visit Japan. Since the U.S. 
Congress supports the Clinton administration's negotiating 
stance toward Japan -- including the submission of a bill 
demanding that Japan open its markets or face sanctions -- 
Christopher will likely come to Japan with some very strong 
words. 
  But the Japanese government should not map out a package of 
market-opening measures because of such pressure from the United 
States. It should do so on its own and announce it to the 
world. Under the circumstances, Hosokawa is now required to make 
a political decision. 
  For help on his decision, the prime minister can look to 
Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives [Keizai Doyukai], who has proposed that a goal be 
voluntarily set for reduction of Japan's current account 
surplus, that tariffs on manufactured products be reduced to 
nearly zero, and that foreigners' direct investment in Japan be 
completely liberalized. Such market-opening measures, which are 
easy to understand, are worth considering. 
  However, while Japan's bureaucrats are certain to oppose all 
of these measures, we are tired of listening to explanations 
emphasizing only what cannot be done, instead of what can be 
done. There will be no way out from this impasse unless a new 
way of thinking is instituted. 
  Japan can increase its imports much more if it uses the 
strength of the high yen. It can also reduce the current 
account surplus. 
  According to a survey conducted by the Management and 
Coordination Agency and released on 24 February, there are quite 
a few factors within the administration to arrest the growth of 
imports. 
  There are still many unnecessary restrictions on importers, 
and the import promotion tax system has not been fully utilized. 
In addition, about 70 percent of importers surveyed did not 
know there was an Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman (OTO) 
that had been set up within the government to deal with 
complaints about problems related to opening Japan's markets. 
  The survey also showed that nearly 40 percent of the 
importers failed to bring up complaints, even though they had 
some. One reason was that they were afraid that if they made a 
complaint against a government office, their relations with the 
office would suffer. If such a climate is not changed, no 
revisions of a system and no calls to increase imports will 
prove effective. 
  We urge that relevant government offices thoroughly examine 
what is going on and improve the situation quickly. We also 
would like to see private companies gather enough courage to 
cooperate in implementing a reform to promote imports.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Koichiro </F>
Matsuura by reporter Masami Kagei of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Tokyo 
Economic News Department; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Since the breakup of the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks at the Hosokawa-Clinton summit on 11 February, 
the United States is urging Japan's market liberalization 
measures by threat of economic sanctions. Why were economic 
frictions intensified so badly between Japan and the United 
States? What should the two nations do for relaxing the 
friction? We interviewed Japanese and U.S. negotiators, 
business leaders, and intellectuals. 
<H5>  Japan Offered a Concession Plan </H5>
  [Kagei] The economic framework talks showed very delicate 
development in the final stage, and the United States reportedly 
offered a concession plan for reaching an agreement on 
microeconomic subjects. Could you describe a little bit about 
that? 
  [Matsuura] On the evening of 9 February, Assistant to the 
U.S. President Bowman Cutter verbally conveyed to us an informal 
concession plan. We thought "the two nations may be able to 
reach an agreement," but that offer did not come up in formal 
conversations. I guess there were various opinions even in the 
U.S. Government. 
  [Kagei] Did not Japan make any drastic proposal? 
  [Matsuura] In the final stage of the negotiations, we 
offered a plan to use figures in objective criteria for 
government procurement. That was a drastic proposal which 
contained something more than the number and the amount of 
biddings to be opened -- but I cannot disclose the proposal now 
since development of the negotiations is still uncertain. In 
addition, we were ready to comply with a U.S. demand for a 
commitment on "maintaining past trends of import growth." 
However, we would not have a chance to convey this since the 
United States made no proposal. 
  [Kagei] In short, what is the reason for the breakup of the 
framework talks? 
  [Matsuura] The primary reason is that we could not reach an 
accord on what should be used for objective criteria to measure 
the degree of market liberalization. But this was caused by 
lack of mutual understanding. We were supposed to agree on why 
the trade imbalance is growing between the two nations. 
Nevertheless, we started negotiations without such common 
ground. 
<H5>  Discord on Agreement </H5>
  [Kagei] What was the conflicting point between the two 
nations? 
  [Matsuura] U.S. negotiators said "over 30 bilateral 
agreements concluded between Japan and the United States are not 
working well with a few exceptions, and this is why the trade 
imbalance is getting bigger." But the opinion stands on two 
false premises. First, most bilateral agreements, including 
procurements by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company (NTT), 
beef, and oranges, are working quite well. Second, the trade 
imbalance is primarily caused by macroeconomic factors -- 
Japan's oversaving and U.S. overconsumption -- rather than 
market policies in individual fields. Even American economists 
say so. Unfortunately, however, the two governments could not 
agree on the two points. 
  [Kagei] If you say macroeconomic policies are more important 
for redressing the trade imbalance, the government's 
announcement of a 6-trillion-yen [Y] income tax reduction 
effective for one year is probably inadequate. What is your 
comment on that? 
  [Matsuura] Please let me make one thing clear. In the 
macroeconomic negotiations last July, both Japan and the United 
States made commitments. Japan promised highly significant 
reduction of its trade surplus in a mid-term period, but the 
United States also said it would cut fiscal deficits in a 
mid-term period. We must not forget about the U.S. promise. 
  Unfortunately, the United States did not show understanding 
of our tax reduction plan, but it is inappropriate to discuss 
further measures right now. At present, Japan should think 
about how it can steadily implement the Y15-trillion 
pump-priming package. The United States would understand 
Japan's efforts when the package brings about a recovery of the 
Japanese economy. 
  [Kagei] Are you really taking things so easy? 
  [Matsuura] The results cannot be obtained in a couple of 
months, but Japan's commitment is to reduce the trade surplus 
"in a mid-term period." In my understanding, a mid-term period 
normally means four to five years. Even U.S. Ambassador to 
Japan Walter Mondale said, in a 24 February interview with NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN, it is important for Japan to cut the trade 
surplus in a mid-term period. 
<H5>  2.8 Percent -- It Is Not an Objective </H5>
  [Kagei] In a recent speech, you said "Japan's task" is to 
realize the government's estimate that Japan's trade surplus 
will become 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) within 
fiscal 1994.... 
  [Matsuura] What I meant is Japan should steadily go ahead to 
fulfill the commitment to reduce the trade surplus in a mid-term 
period. The figure, 2.8 percent, itself is not a goal, but an 
estimate. 
  [Kagei] What are Japan's future tasks in the microeconomic 
field? 
  [Matsuura] The cabinet held a meeting on international 
economic issues on 25 February. Since Prime Minister Hosokawa 
is emphasizing the deregulation policy, the government must 
promote the policy as soon as possible. Regarding macroeconomic 
policy, we should implement the pump-priming package, and, in 
microeconomic policy, we must open markets through deregulation 
measures. Japan's task is to promote the two policies at the 
same time. 
  [Kagei] What is your comment on U.S. moves to seek economic 
sanctions against Japan? 
  [Matsuura] I have no comment right now because it depends on 
the future development of the issue. Generally speaking, it is 
logically funny to discuss counteractions before settling 
negotiations.

  [Text] An auto industry source says the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association, headed by Yutaka Kume, has firmed up 
plans to propose to the U.S. automobile industry that a venue be 
agreed at which both automakers from both countries can discuss 
Japanese purchases of American-made auto parts and moves to 
increase sales of American-built cars in Japan. Both issues 
have become the focus of a Japan-U.S. trade row in economic 
framework talks. 
  Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company have begun 
to study plans to purchase American-made auto parts. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and major 
automakers plan to finalize details of plans to purchase 
American-made auto parts in mid-March, at the earliest, in line 
with government plans to open the Japanese market. 
  Strained Japan-U.S. economic relations following the 
breakdown of economic framework talks over the issue of 
numerical targets have prompted the automobile industry, which 
has insisted that Japanese purchases of American-made auto parts 
are not the province of government negotiation, to judge that 
the industry now needs to announce measures to resolve the issue.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] "Japan said no" at the Japanese-U.S. framework 
talks, and that has become sensational. The Japanese-U.S. 
framework talks have another major feature. The Japanese 
Government and the U.S. Government attempted to swing public 
opinion in the two countries to them by aggressively using the 
news media publicly and privately to stress the correctness of 
their assertions at the talks. They spoke ill of each other and 
slandered each other. They also engaged in a "media war," which 
was unprecedented. 
  This article examines the advantages and disadvantages 
resulting from "making public" in this way the trade 
negotiations, which have so far on many occasions been held 
secretly. 
  Anyway, the Japanese-U.S. framework talks were mysterious. 
In news conferences right after the vice-ministerial 
negotiations and working-level negotiations attended by 
division-chief officials from the two countries, the standard 
official explanation of both sides was that "both sides cannot 
speak of any specific matters in accordance with their mutual 
promise." Both the Japanese and U.S. sides, however, were 
incredibly responsive to individual news coverage and fully 
explained what was discussed in the negotiations. 
  The feature of the Japanese-U.S. framework talks was that 
both sides spoke ill of each other. To cite an example, the 
U.S. side criticized the Japanese bureaucracy, and the Japanese 
side criticized the U.S. proposal for objective criteria as 
"numerical targets." As Japan publicly criticized the United 
States, the U.S. criticism of Japan was conspicuous. Both sides 
repeatedly made slanderous comments about each other in front of 
many reporters. 
  As a result, although the negotiations were held behind 
closed doors over the past six months, the details of what was 
discussed in the negotiations were fully reported, and the 
negotiations under the Japanese-U.S. framework talks were 
unprecedented bilateral negotiations between the two countries. 
  As their slander competition began to give them trouble, 
some 
negotiators accused reporters of creating the problem, saying, 
"the news media are hampering our negotiations." Many reporters 
certainly felt that the negotiations would hammer out no 
agreements if they were held that way. 
  Now, looking back at the Japanese-U.S. framework talks, 
which 
ended in a breakdown, it can be said that their criticism 
competition itself ended in victory by Japan, which waged an 
anti- U.S. campaign after labeling the U.S. demand for objective 
criteria as "numerical targets." Japan succeed in nudging 
European and Asian nations and even Americans to criticize the 
Clinton administration. 
  U.S. negotiators said, "We had a harvest of transparency." 
It was said that "both Japan and the United States kept 
themselves from making behind-closed-door deals, at which Japan 
is good, by opening their discussions to the news media." 
  Neither Japan nor the United States reached any easy 
compromises at the negotiations, and this was a painful option 
for the United States. A U.S. negotiator said while the U.S. 
criticism of Japan stirred up anti-U.S. sentiments among the 
Japanese, "what was a plus for us was that we made the Japanese 
not leave the negotiations in the hands of bureaucrats, and that 
we made the Japanese pay attention to the negotiations." 
  Criticism of the government is growing for rejecting the 
"U.S. demand for setting numerical targets," and the sentiment 
is growing for opening Japan's market voluntarily following the 
breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. framework talks. Perhaps these 
were the goal of President Clinton, who criticized the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry and the Finance Ministry by 
name, and the goal of the U.S. Government, which meddled in 
Japan's domestic affairs. 
  Regrettably, a media war between Japan and the United States 
to gather information on each other's real intentions was an 
incredibly poor idea, perhaps because of each side's excessive 
use of energy in competing to use the news media to swing the 
public opinion of the two countries to its side. 
  Based on information supplied by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, 
the United States continued to have high hopes that "Prime 
Minister Hosokawa will make statement going beyond [fumikonda] 
the views of the bureaucrats." Japan failed to fathom the 
president's real intentions to the last. It still says, "We do 
not know whether the President is taking a tough stand toward 
Japan on trade." 
  While both Japan and the United States are calling their 
relations the "most important bilateral relations," Japanese and 
U.S. negotiators distrusted each other and wrangled with each 
other in the negotiations, without there existing a channel to 
fathom the intentions of their leaders. This is the current 
state of Japanese- U.S. relations. The Japanese-U.S. framework 
talks were meaningful in disclosing the actual state of 
"relations between the Japanese and U.S. Governments."

  [Text] Combat aircraft of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) shot down four military aircraft believed to 
be piloted by Serbs over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked by reporters 
in the Diet building on the morning of 1 March to comment on the 
incident, Prime Minister Hosokawa said: "NATO combat aircraft 
shot down the four military aircraft within the framework of the 
United Nations." In this way, the prime minister expressed his 
view that there was no problem with the action taken by NATO. 
  Commenting on the incident at a news conference on 1 March 
after a cabinet session, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said, 
"I understand the action was taken in accordance with a 
resolution adopted by the UN Security Council." At the news 
conference, the government spokesman issued a statement saying: 
"Although it is not known to which side the downed military 
aircraft belonged, we hope that parties to the conflict will 
comply with the resolution adopted by the UN Security Council 
and work to end the conflict."

  [Text] The government will resume official development 
assistance (ODA) to Burma where there currently are moves toward 
democratization. This will be the first ODA given to the 
country since 1988. The Japanese Government recently exchanged 
correspondence with the Burmese Government. As a first step, 
Japan will provide the country with approximately 15 million yen 
in March in the form of financial grant. Financial cooperation 
will center on humanitarian aid such as medical equipment via 
nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). The government has not 
yet decided to start full-scale aid such as yen loans, but will 
make a decision after watching the progress of the country's 
democratization efforts. Japan's action is in contrast to that 
of American and European nations, which are being cautious about 
resuming aid to Burma.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Nationwide Debates Needed for Defense Policy </F>
Review"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's advisory 
"Defense Policy Council" will hold its first meeting on 28 
February. The council's main objective is to review the 1976 
"National Defense Program Outline [NDPO]," Japan's defense 
policy guideline, for the first time in 18 years. To compile a 
new guideline of national defense in the post-Cold War period, 
it is necessary to promote nationwide debates. The council may 
become the starting point of public debates. 
  To say nothing of the international situation, the Hosokawa 
administration's future is becoming uncertain. Under such 
circumstances, it is questionable if the prime minister can 
afford to really devote himself to this issue. 
  Yet, review of the NDPO has been a major pending issue since 
the conclusion of the Cold War five years ago. However, the 
issue has been left untouched by two Liberal Democratic Party 
prime ministers -- Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa. So, we 
would like to frankly welcome Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
initiative. 
  Nine council members, led by Asahi Breweries Chairman Kotaro 
Higuchi, are expected to promote wide-ranging discussions. They 
should provide answers on questions on such subjects as Japan's 
perception of the post-Cold War period, a new direction for 
security policy and the Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] position, and 
roles in UN peace activities as well as the defense alliance 
with the United States. 
  The council should deal with varied and deep questions. If 
the final report should be prepared "by summer," as Prime 
Minister Hosokawa once noted, the members would have to carry on 
very intensive debates. 
  Meanwhile, we are anxious about the Defense Agency's [DA] 
attitude on this issue. From the beginning, the agency has been 
voicing its frustration with Prime Minister's decision to 
advance the review of the NDPO by a year. Also, the agency is 
wary of the prime minister's remarks on possibilities of arms 
reduction. To reflect its opinions in the council, the DA has 
established a special study group. Also, the agency reportedly 
has great expectations for former Joint Staff Council Chairman 
Hajime Sakuma's participation in the Defense Policy Council. 
  It is natural that the defense authorities have an interest 
in debates on the foundation of the nation's defense policy, and 
it is necessary for them to offer opinions as experts. However, 
the policy review would lose its significance if they take 
actions to prevent any scaledown of the SDF. Therefore, the 
council must promote discussions from a free standpoint. 
  Another concern is the fact that some defense officials 
still 
say the policy review is unnecessary. They say that the NDPO is 
appropriate even in the post-Cold War period because it was 
compiled during detente between the United States and the Soviet 
Union, and that it is unnecessary to revise its basic concept of 
"the minimum defense force in peace." 
  The NDPO's basic concept is also called "basic defense 
concept." This aims at maintaining the capability to conduct 
adequate security missions and cope with limited and small-scale 
invasion without support from foreign forces. However, we 
should not forget the "basic" defense force is designed to 
prepare for "smooth expansion" in case of emergency. 
  In other words, the basic concept has no consideration for 
the limitation of defense buildup or rationalization of 
effective strength. In quantity, Japan's defense force has 
already reached the level advocated in the NDPO. Defense 
expenditures are currently emphasizing improvement of the SDF's 
equipment quality. 
  Why do we have to keep building up defense forces for 
"exclusively defense only" while possibilities of direct 
invasion against Japan have become much lower? The defense 
policy review should start with this question. 
  There are great gaps among coalition parties concerning the 
concept of national defense, the SDF's legal position, and the 
Japan-U.S. alliance. The Defense Policy Council must not be 
used as a tool for a power struggle among them.

  [Text] To get to the bottom of the issue concerning Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's borrowing 100 million yen [Y] from Tokyo 
Sagawa Kyubin Co., the House of Representatives Budget Committee 
has recently decided that, in accordance with Article 104 of the 
Diet law, it will exercise the right of investigation in 
relation to government to call on such organs as the Tokyo 
District Public Prosecutors Office to submit documents retained 
from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. However, the government has 
indicated it will reject the call. In response, the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] has strongly reacted to the government's 
attitude. Regarding the government's attitude as "a serious 
infringement on the right of investigation and an act of 
overriding the Diet's authority," the LDP plans to persistently 
call on the government to turn in documents. At the same time, 
if the government rejects the call, the LDP plans to increase 
its call for summoning Mr. Masatoshi Fukayama, former official 
secretary of the prime minister, to appear in the Diet. Since 
the Diet adopted the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, 
which the government believes will contribute to boosting the 
domestic economy, the LDP intends to demand a thorough 
investigation of suspicion attached to the prime minister during 
the course of Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget bill. 
  In addition, with regard to the issue concerning the 
father-in- law of the prime minister's suspected dealings in a 
large quantity of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT] Corp 
stocks, the LDP thinks that "one person who greatly profited 
from NTT stocks transactions might have been the prime minister 
himself." For that reason, the LDP plans to take up this issue 
and call for summoning an investment consultant allegedly 
involved in the transactions in addition to Mr. Fukayama, the 
prime minister's former secretary. 
  On the issue of the prime minister's pecuniary relation with 
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., attention has been focused on whether 
the prime minister really returned Y100 million to Sagawa 
Kyubin. In this connection, at the last extraordinary Diet 
session, the prime minister submitted to a board of directors of 
the Budget Committees of both the House of Representative and 
the House of Councillors six "related documents proving that the 
money was all returned." However, the LDP said that "it is hard 
to believe that the submitted documents are real documents," and 
called on the government to submit the originals, which the 
Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office confiscated from Tokyo 
Sagawa Kyubin Co., in accordance with Article 104 of the Diet 
law which allows the Diet to "demand the government and public 
agencies submit reports or documents." Although the ruling 
parties first indicated it would reject the LDP's demand, an 
agreement was eventually reached via mediation of Yamaguchi, 
House of Representatives Budget Committee chairman (who belongs 
to the Social Democratic Party of Japan), between the ruling 
parties and the opposition camp at the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee session held on 22 February on exercising the 
right of investigation in relation to government. 
  In response, however, the Justice Ministry has shown its 
intention not to accept the Budget Committee's demand on the 
grounds that "since the case involving Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. 
is under trial, submission of documents will impede further 
investigations." Justice Minister Mikazuki told a news 
conference held after a 25 February Cabinet meeting that 
"documents have been gathered in accordance with the Criminal 
Procedures Act, and submitting them may impede further 
investigations, affect trials, or disturb the privacy of people 
concerned," thus indicating a stand of rejecting the demand. 
  Such a reaction of the Justice Ministry has invited the 
LDP's 
objection. The LDP stresses that "we cannot accept such a 
manner which infringes the Diet's right of investigation in 
relation to the government." The LDP views that "the ruling 
parties must have known that the government would reject the 
call, and with this in mind, they have agreed on exercising 
Article 104 of the Diet law." In this way, the LDP is 
increasingly dissatisfied with the ruling parties' manner. For 
that reason, within the LDP, there has emerged a hardline view 
saying that "at Diet sessions on the fiscal 1994 budget bill, 
the LDP should not cooperate in promoting deliberations on the 
bill until the Diet summoning of Mr. Fukayama is held" 
(according to a senior Diet Affairs Committee member).

  [Text] It was learned on 27 February that the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] plans to inaugurate in 
fiscal year 1994 a "digital broadcasting technology development 
office" under the Broadcasting Bureau's Engineering Division. 
In a recent news conference, Broadcasting Bureau Director 
General Akimasa Egawa said that the MOPT would not develop a 
digital high-definition television (HDTV) system to replace an 
analog system for the time being. Nevertheless, with the 
setting up of the digital technology development office, the 
ministry will become fully prepared for developing a digital 
system. 
  During a news conference on 22 February, Egawa said: "Most 
countries in the world are pursuing the research and development 
of digital HDTV systems." He stressed the need for MOPT's 
policy switch and called for replacing NHK's analog multiple 
sub-Nyquist sampling encoding system with a digital system. His 
remarks, however, created a great stir. 
  Because his comments brought protests from NHK and the 
Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), which is 
selling analog TV sets, Egawa called another news conference the 
next day and said: "Because of my lack of explanations, I have 
caused a misunderstanding. For the time being, the MOPT will 
continue supporting the NHK system." With this, the confusion 
was unsnarled. 
  However, Egawa also said in the news conference that 
"digital 
technology directed toward the 21st century is necessary," thus 
not denying the development of a digital system in the future. 
  According to the MOPT, the plan to set up the digital 
technology development office was actively promoted by Egawa, 
and the setting up of the office was decided on after a request 
for changing the formation of the MOPT, which the ministry had 
submitted together with a fiscal year 1994 budget request, was 
approved.

  [Text] Yesterday evening, His Excellency [H.E.] Nouhak 
Phoumsavan, president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR], and wife organized a dinner at the National Assembly 
hall in Vientiane in honor of H.E. President Punsalmaagiyn 
Ochirbat, his wife, and a top-level delegation of Mongolia that 
is currently on an official friendship visit to the LPDR. 
  Attending the banquet on the Lao side were H.E. Saman 
Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly; H.E. Khamphoui 
Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister and chairman of the Planning 
and Cooperation Committee; H.E. Boun-gnang Volachit, governor of 
Vientiane municipality; H.E. Phao Bounnaphon, minister attached 
to the Prime Minister's Office; H.E. Thongdam Chanthaphon, 
minister attached to the Presidential Office; H.E. Sompadit 
Volasan, minister of trade; H.E. Phongsavat Bouppha, deputy 
minister of foreign affairs; H.E. Dr. Khamphai Latsami, deputy 
minister of public health; and H.E. Chaleun Valinthalasak, 
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the LPDR to 
Mongolia; along with other ministers, deputy ministers, and a 
number of dignitaries. 
  Attending on the Mongolian side were H.E. Tserenpilyn 
Gombosuren, minister of foreign affairs; H.E. Tumengiyn Albati, 
chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee attached to the People's 
Great Hural; H.E. Tsebegmidiin Tsogt, minister of trade and 
industry; and H.E. Toytigiyn Tomorhuleg, ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Mongolia to the LPDR; along 
with other members of the delegation, which comprises 18 persons. 
  At the banquet, H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of our 
country, delivered a speech. He said: Laos and Mongolia are 
situated in the same region. The peoples of the two countries 
have maintained similar specific characteristics in terms of 
customs, culture, and languages. The similarity in these 
specific points has served as the basis for the establishment of 
the long-standing, profound relations between the two countries. 
Through the process of the said relations, the two peoples have 
all along been friendly to each other. Noteworthy is that 
leaders at various levels of our two countries have regularly 
exchanged visits that have thus brought about mutual 
understanding and firm friendship with each other. 
  This official friendship visit to Laos by your excellency is 
considered a significant event in the relations between our two 
countries in the new stage. It has created a new step of the 
strengthening of friendship between the peoples of the two 
countries. It has also resulted in further broadening the 
cooperation between our two countries. I maintain that all 
these have served the interest and aspirations of the Lao and 
Mongolian peoples. They have also significantly contributed to 
the common trend of the establishment and promotion of peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among the countries in 
the region. As a friendly country, we have closely followed up 
the steps of development of Mongolia. We are glad to see that 
with the patriotic tradition, together with their 
industriousness and persistence in engaging in labor, the 
Mongolian people have successfully overcome the economic (?and 
social) difficulties step by step. As a result, the material 
and cultural life of the Mongolian people have been improved and 
the situation in the country has now been stabilized. We believe 
that with your excellency's efficient execution of the state 
affairs, the potential in various fields will be exploited and 
vigorously promoted and expanded, and Mongolia will then be 
further developed and will prosper. 
  H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan continued: 
  [Begin Nouhak Phoumsavan recording] After the establishment 
of the LPDR, our entire Lao people have positively implemented 
the tasks of defending and building the country. We have now 
carried out the renovation work in many fields. We have built 
the new, market-oriented economy along with the broadening of 
the relations and cooperation with foreign countries to draw 
foreign investments. Simultaneously, we have paid attention to 
gradually perfecting the political system to make it conform to 
the renovation in other fields. Through this process, we see 
that our country has basically achieved stability and 
tranquillity while the people have maintained solidarity and 
harmony. The people's rights of being owners of the country 
have also been promoted and expanded as their living conditions 
have been evidently improved. [words indistinct] our entire Lao 
people have always wished to live in (?peace) and to be friends 
with (?peoples of other countries). For this reason, the LPDR 
Government has pursued and will consistently continue to pursue 
the policy of building the country to achieve peace, 
independence, friendship, and cooperation with various 
countries, regardless of the differences in the political and 
social systems on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence. We support the creative activities of Mongolia in 
the international arena. We particularly support the 
announcement on the turning of Mongolia into a nuclear-free 
country, an act that has contributed to promoting and 
establishing stability and security in the region and the rest 
of the world. I would like to take this occasion to express 
gratitude to the Mongolian people for the precious support and 
assistance that they have rendered to our Lao people in the 
recent past. 
  Ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished guests: Laos and 
Mongolia have maintained a similar starting point in the 
socioeconomic field. (?Presently), the two countries are 
carrying out the restructuring [words indistinct] in accordance 
with their respective specific points and conditions. Both 
countries have wanted [words indistinct] through the 
implementation of similar economic mechanism and policy of 
broadening the relations with various countries. I am of the 
view that Laos and Mongolia have maintained the potential to 
increase cooperation in many fields in accordance with the 
interest and [words indistinct] (?of the peoples of the two 
countries). I am convinced that this visit to our country by 
H.E. President Ochirbat (?will create a positive step for our 
two countries) to promote, expand, and strengthen the friendly 
relations. It will also bring about the broadening of the 
cooperation between the two countries in accordance with the 
aspirations and interests of the two peoples of Laos and 
Mongolia. [end recording] 
  Later, H.E. President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat of Mongolia 
delivered a reply speech. He said: 
  [Begin Ochirbat recording, in Mongol fading into Lao 
translation] I am very pleased to note that our two countries 
and two peoples of Mongolia and Laos have together promoted and 
expanded the friendly relations since ancient times. The two 
sides have always made efforts and cooperated in overcoming 
various trials to enhance the said relations. I would like to 
reiterate here that increasing development and strengthening of 
the relations and cooperation between our two countries have 
resulted from the spirit of mutual respect and support. In 
recent years, [passage indistinct] though there was no 
development in the relations between our two countries due to 
(?the difficulties in switching to the market economy, which is 
our common objective), following the trend of friendship and 
cooperation that has covered the relations among various 
countries in the region and other favorable factors, our two 
countries have now maintained new conditions, and there is a 
potential to enhance the cooperation along a new path and under 
a new form. Besides, our two countries are situated in the same 
continent and have shared many common specific points, such as 
the states of being landlocked countries, having small 
populations, and maintaining almost the same level of 
development. With the efforts to fulfill similar objectives and 
with the spirit of respecting each other, our two peoples are 
marching forward along the same road on the friendly spirit of 
helping each other and cooperating with each other. 
  I also reiterate here that Mongolia has respected and 
attached importance to the traditional relations with the LPDR. 
I pledge to strengthen, promote, and expand the said relations 
to make them ever more prosperous on the basis of equality, 
mutual benefit, and with new contents and forms. [passage 
indistinct] The Mongolian government has always supported and 
will continue to support the foreign policy of cherishing peace 
and the efforts of the LPDR, which are aimed at turning 
Southeast Asia into a region of peace, stability, and 
cooperation. The Mongolian people are sincerely pleased to see 
the Lao people, who have maintained a long history [words 
indistinct], patriotic tradition, and heroic spirit of struggle, 
have achieved success in implementing the policy of broadening 
the economy in advance to the marketing system. [end recording]

  [Text] Thai and Cambodian authorities eventually settled 
the dispute over the boundary of the two countries's territorial 
waters, which broke out 10 days ago when a Thai navy patrol boat 
sunk a Cambodian ship and arrested 14 Cambodian crewmen. 
  A high-level source in Trat Province informed PHUCHATKAN 
that 
a third round of talks between the Thai and Cambodian sides was 
held at the Trat provincial seat at 1430 on 1 March. The 
Cambodian side was represented during the meeting by Prasoet 
Siri, the kamnan of Tambon Hat Lek of Muang District, while the 
Thai side included Phairot Priyarat, provincial governor of 
Trat; Phairot Khaokhom, owner of the two ill-fated fishing 
trawlers -- Chok Prinya 1 and Chok Prinya 2; and Major General 
Rattanachaloem Saenyakon, deputy director of the Army Operation 
Department. 
  No reporters or officials from any other agencies were 
allowed to attend the closed-door meeting which lasted over one 
hour. As a result of the meeting, the Cambodian side agreed to 
pay 1.5 million baht as compensation to the owner of the two 
fishing trawlers. Earlier, compensation for the two fishing 
vessels was estimated at 5 million baht. At 1600 the military 
handed over 14 Cambodian crewmen, who were detained in Trat 
Province after the incident. The crewmen were handed over to 
Cambodian Navy Commander Vice Admiral Tea Vinh [name and title 
as published] and Rung Phlamkesan, governor of Cambodia's Kho 
Kong Province, at the border crossing at Ban Hat Lek Village. 
  Phrairot Khaokhom told PHUCHATKAN that he agreed to take the 
amount as compensation for his two fishing trawlers because he 
was concerned about good relations between the two countries and 
wanted to see the problem settled as quickly as possible. He 
said he will not get involved in the fishing business as long as 
there is no clear demarcation line of the territorial waters of 
the two countries. He anticipatated that more problems of this 
nature will arise in the future. 
  Somchai Chairatchanukun, chairman of the Fishery Association 
of Khlong Yai District, Trat Province, disclosed that the 
problem has been settled only to a certain extent. The two 
countries should expedite the drawing of the clear demarcation 
line to avoid the recurrence of the problem and prevent the 
situation from worsening beyond control. However, the 
province's sluggish fishing industry and related businesses are 
expected to pick up soon.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday played 
down Taiwan's threat to halt importing Thai labour, saying 
Thailand has been seriously tackling the problems of illegal 
Thai workers in that country. 
  On Sunday the Taiwanese Council of Labour Affairs chairman 
accused Bangkok of being insincere on solving the problem of 
Thai workers in Taiwan and warned that his country would halt 
the labour import from Thailand. 
  Prasong said the Foreign Ministry was ready to help deal 
with 
the council's complaints but insisted that the Thai Public and 
Social Welfare Ministry was the responsible agency. "I don't 
know why it [the issue] has been brought up just now. The 
problem has long existed. Why are they talking about it now?'' 
he said. 
  Chao Shou-po, chairman of the Council of Labour Affairs, 
warned Thailand that Taipei might have to suspend the import of 
Thai workers unless Bangkok tackles problems such as exorbitant 
commissions charged by Thai job placement agencies. Chao blamed 
the Thai government for "lacking application" in curbing such 
unfair practices. His attack was released just over a week 
after a three day-to Thailand trip by Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui. 
  Prasong said if Thai workers illegally entered Taiwan they 
have broken the law and should be penalized accordingly. "We 
cannot blame a country which takes legal action against those 
who illegally enter its territory," Prasong said. 
  Job Replacement Department Director Sinchai Riantrakul, 
meanwhile, said that Thailand had done its best to solve the 
problem. He said the department had issued warnings in early 
February to at least 47 employment agencies to strictly comply 
wlth Thai law. He added that the department would take legal 
action against any company known to have collected exorbitant 
fees from Thai workers. "Yesterday was the deadline for job 
recruitment agencies to abide by the laws," he said. 
  Thai workers have to pay Bt80,000 to a job replacement 
agency 
before they are able to work in Taiwan. 
  Sinchai denied a report that there were 2,500 Thai workers 
illegally working in Taiwan, adding that he thought the flow of 
illegal workers to the island state was decreasing. He also said 
he did not how many job placement firms had contravened the law. 
Commenting on exorbitant fees, he said Taiwanese employment 
agencies were also to blame over the practice and Taiwan should 
help tackle the problem. "They [Taiwanese brokers] demand 
Bt20,000-Bt30,000 for each worker," he said.

  [Text] Sony Magnetic Products (Thailand) will use Thailand 
as a production base for Southeast Asia for its video and audio 
compact cassettes. Hiroshi Takauchi, president, said the 
company's plant currently has an annual production capacity of 
49 million audio and 13.4 million video cassettes. The plant 
occupies 52,000 square metres of land at Ladkrabang industrial 
estate. Its registered capital is Bt272 million and it employs 
540 staff. 
  He said the company has invested [yen] Y400 million to 
increase capacity to 107 million audio and 20 million video 
cassettes. The firm is in the process of installing machines 
and expects to begin production in October this year. 
  He said the company currently exports 98 per cent of output 
to Europe, Japan, the US and Southeast Asia. Europe is the 
biggest market for exports, accounting for more than 50 per cent 
of the total volume, followed by Southeast Asia with 30 per 
cent, Japan with 10 per cent and the US, 10 per cent. 
  The company plans to increase domestic sales to 20 per cent 
of total sales. Audio cassettes will be the major products, 
which should account for 70 per cent of the domestic sales. He 
said the domestic market is affected by "dumped" products from 
Korea and Taiwan. For Sony, several components and raw 
materials have to be imported from Japan resulting in higher 
costs. 
  For fiscal 1993 which will end next month, the company 
expected exports of Bt1 billion. It hopes to increase sales 150 
per cent by the end of 1994. He said the company also suffered 
from the strengthening of the yen which raised costs by 5 per 
cent. 
  The company plans to invest Y50 million to shift production 
of small parts of audio and video cassettes to Thailand. Three 
or four items will be produced here this year. Local production 
will reduce costs by 3 per cent. Some components such as 
punching dies and mold dies cannot be produced domestically. 
The company is looking for supporting industries to supply 
these components to the plant. Thailand will be a production 
base for Sony in Southeast Asia. He said Thai staff can meet 
Sony's standards but a shortage of infrastructure such as roads 
and communications is still a problem.

  [Text] Deputy Communications Minister Phinit Charusombat 
has reported on the outcome of his meeting with Japan's deputy 
international trade and industry minister in Tokyo yesterday. 
  The Thai deputy minister informed his Japanese counterpart 
of 
the latest progress and developments in telecommunications in 
Thailand and told him of the government's policy of allowing the 
private sector to invest more in the telecommunications field. 
As a result, the government has promoted free trade competition 
in line with Thailand's commitment to GATT. 
  Phinit said that Japan and Thailand have cooperated with 
each 
other in developing telecommunications activities in both the 
government and private sectors. Japanese companies have invested 
several billion baht in the communications field in Thailand. 
Given that Thailand is currently more prepared for foreign 
investors, Japan's international trade and industry ministry is 
therefore asked to encourage Japanese investors to invest more 
in Thailand, especially in the telecommunications field, so that 
the telecommunications services in Thailand and Japan will 
develop on an equal basis.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign 
Ministry denied Wednesday that the United States has formally 
raised the issue of Seoul abolishing its National Security Law, 
but was looking into the exact nature of comments made by a U.S. 
official last week. 
  "The issue was never officially raised," said one ministry 
official, reacting to remarks attributed to Tom Hubbard, U.S. 
deputy assistant secretary of State, who said Washington wants 
to see democracy take firm root in South Korea and the National 
Security Law repealed. The remarks drew a sensitive reaction 
because Hubbard is the top U.S. working-level representative at 
nuclear talks with North Korea. South Korea's National Security 
Law prohibits any unauthorized contact with North Korea. 
  "We don't believe that Hubbard's statement reflects the 
formal U.S. position, but we are looking into what the exact 
quotes were," said the ministry official.

  [Excerpts] Concerning the recent public remarks made by 
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard, the U.S. side's 
delegate to U.S.-North Korea New York working-level contact, on 
the abolition of the National Security Law in our country, a 
Foreign Ministry official said this issue was never officially 
raised between the ROK and U.S. Governments. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Ha Sun-pong, a spokesman of the ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party, today made a statement pertaining to the remarks 
of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard, who suggested the 
abolition of the National Security Law. In the statement, he 
said that logically his remarks are not appropriate, and if the 
report on his remarks is true, it is regretful. Spokesman Ha 
Sun-pong noted that he will further inquire into the truth of 
the remarks. 
  Pak Chi-won, spokesman of the opposition Democratic Party, 
in 
a commentary pertaining to Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard's 
remarks, said he agrees with the remarks in principle. He 
maintained that Hubbard's remarks should be considered from the 
standpoint of the promotion of human rights and not of 
interference in our domestic affairs. 
  Spokesman Pak Chi-won said that he understood that Deputy 
Assistant Secretary Hubbard also conveyed his position to our 
government, and urged the government to expedite reviewing 
whether the Security Law should be revised or abolished.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry is 
ready to contact U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom 
Hubbard about his recent remark that the United States wants to 
see South Korea repeal its National Security Law, officials said 
Wednesday. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told a National Assembly 
Committee that he would look into the matter, adding that the 
Ministry's director-general of the American Affairs Bureau was 
planning to call Hubbard, officials said. 
  During a seminar held Feb. 25 at American University, 
Hubbard 
said South Korea and the United States differ on "how to respond 
on some regional and global issues." 
  "And despite heartwarming success in establishing democracy 
and marked improvement on the human rights front--or perhaps 
because of them--the United States still wishes the Republic of 
Korea would repeal the National Security Law," Hubbard said. 
  The remarks were deemed sensitive because Hubbard is the top 
U.S. representative at working-level talks with North Korea. 
  Ministry officials were busy denying speculation that the 
remarks were somehow related to discussions between North Korea 
and the United States at their recent nuclear negotiations. 
  The U.S. report on global human rights issued last Feb. 1 
also cites South Korea's National Security Law, basically 
anti-communist in nature, for undermining personal freedoms. 
  Ministry officials claim that the U.S. State Department must 
address the issue "off and on" to placate American human rights 
lobbyists, who reportedly receive "quite a few" petitions about 
the South Korean security law. 
  "The matter has never been raised bilaterally by a 
diplomatic 
agency," one ranking official said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, speaking at a 
Foreign Affairs-Unification Committee meeting today, said that 
the remark by Thomas Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of 
State for East Asian Affairs, urging the ROK to abolish the 
National Security Law does not represent an authoritative view 
of the U.S. Government, but was merely a presentation of his 
personal opinion. 
  Minister Han Sung-chu said that the government is planning 
to 
make an official inquiry to the U.S. State Department through 
diplomatic channels about the background and intent of Deputy 
Assistant Secretary Hubbard's remark. 
  Minister Han said that although the U.S. side referred to 
the 
National Security Law in connection with the human rights issue 
in the ROK before the civilian government was launched, no such 
reference has been made since the start of the civilian 
government. Moreover, the U.S. State Department's human rights 
report notes drastic improvement in the ROK's human rights 
situation.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
suspend this year's "Team Spirit," the annual South Korean-U.S. 
joint military exercise, as soon as the two Koreas meet on 
exchanging special envoys at 10 AM Thursday (KST), officials 
said. The inter-Korean contact is one of two preconditions for 
the announcement on Team Spirit's suspension. The second is the 
arrival in Pyongyang of International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) inspectors. 
  Last Saturday, Pyongyang agreed with Washington to allow 
unrestricted IAEA access to its seven declared facilities and to 
accept Seoul's proposal to hold working-level talks on an 
exchange of presidential envoys. In return, Washington was to 
suspend this year's Team Spirit and conduct high-level talks 
with North Korea later this month. 
  The South Korean Government was to announce the suspension 
of 
the military exercise Tuesday afternoon on condition that North 
Korea cooperated with the IAEA's nuclear inspections and agreed 
to hold the working-level contact on envoy exchanges Tuesday. 
But since North Korea postponed the contact until Thursday, 
Seoul also delayed announcement of the military maneuvers' 
suspension.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry 
denied press reports Wednesday that South Korea handed over its 
Uruguay Round country schedule to the United States before even 
submitting it to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). 
  "We are not obligated to show the country schedule to the 
U.S. side, and we have not done so," a ministry official said. 
The vernacular daily KUNGMIN ILBO quoted Economic Planning Board 
and Agriculture Ministry officials as saying that the country 
schedule was given to the United States even before it was 
revealed domestically. Seoul had waited to reveal the schedule 
to GATT headquarters until after the major trade negotiators -- 
the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union -- 
handed in their plans. 
  Officials here were analyzing the U.S. country schedule and 
initially agreed that revision of the original draft was 
unnecessary. They said Seoul may present its schedule as early 
as Thursday.

  [Text] Seoul, Mar 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has begun to 
revise the market opening schedule under the Uruguay Round 
agreement after learning that the United States has 
substantially changed its schedule. 
  "We have found out that the United States has made a 
substantial change in their schedule," an official at the 
Economic Planning Board said on Wednesday. 
  For instance, he said, Washington now decided to lower 
semiconductor tariff by only 0.7 percentage points from the 
existing 3.7 percent to 3 percent whereas it earlier said they 
would completely lift tariff on semiconductor. 
  About 110 items in the categories of electronics and 
non-ferrous metal would be re-examined by the Korean Government 
for possible change before its final schedule would be forwarded 
to the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Secretariat 
early next week, the official said. 
  During its recent trade talks with Japan, the United States 
declared they would withdraw the planned removal of tariffs in 
the areas of electronics, non-ferrous metal, lumber and 
distilled liquor. 
  The declaration came after Japan said they would lower 
tariff 
on lumber by 5 percentage points from the present 8 percent to 3 
percent instead of lifting tariff on lumber altogether. 
  "Now that the United States has revised its market opening 
schedule, we intend to make a corresponding change," the 
official said. 
  He added that so far 38 countries including the United 
States, Japan and the European Union (EC) have submitted their 
final schedules to the GATT.

  [Text] In addition to the Tumen River and Najin-Sonbong 
economic zones, North Korea has worked out a plan to set up four 
special economic zones--Chongjin, Nampo, Sinuiju, and 
Wonsan--and a free tourist spot at Mt. Kumgang. North Korea is 
currently reviewing the project in detail to attract foreign 
capital, according to a well-informed source in Tokyo. 
  The source said: "North Korea has already started 
consultations with the U.S. State Department on receiving 
capital, technology, and experience necessary for the 
introduction of the market economic system into the economic 
zones by joining the Asian Development Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund." 
  The source also disclosed that North Korea's former Vice 
Premier Kim Tal-hyon (currently a manager of the Sunchon Vinalon 
plant), who was previously removed from North Korea's power 
circle, is in charge of the project and is secretly serving as a 
dialogue channel with the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Cha-su: "Inspection of Nuclear </F>
Facilities in North Korea and Types of Inspections"] 
  [Excerpt] The ordinary [tongsang] inspection of nuclear 
facilities in North Korea by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] will begin on a full scale on 2 March. A 
seven-member inspection team arrived in Pyongyang on 1 March 
afternoon. 
  The targets of its inspection are 16 nuclear facilities, 
including an experimental atomic reactor and critical facilities 
[imgye sisol], a nuclear fuel rod manufacturing plant and 
storage facilities, a uranium mine and uranium smelting plant, 
and two atomic power stations. 
  However, North Korea refused an ad hoc ordinary [imsi 
tongsang] inspection by putting forward its specific position in 
which its withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
[NPT] is being withheld. As a result, the IAEA team's inspection 
will be conducted in such a manner as to only confirm whether 
the nuclear material is diverted for military purpose. 
  Therefore, during the forthcoming inspections, examination 
of 
the equipment and work log, and confirmation of the status of 
the seals will be conducted in seven major facilities out of 16 
declared facilities, including an experimental atomic reactor, 
critical and semi-critical facilities, a nuclear fuel rod 
manufacturing plant, a nuclear fuel storage facility, a 
5-megawatt atomic reactor, and a radiochemical laboratory. 
  North Korea ratified the Nuclear Safeguards Accord in April 
1992, and following this, it forwarded for the first time a list 
of 16 nuclear facilities to the IAEA on 4 May. North Korea then 
reported to IAEA in 1992 that it extracted 90 grams of 
plutonium. However, the result of the inspection revealed that 
North Korea seemed to have extracted more, possibly several 
kilograms, thus showing a discrepancy. 
  In a bid to inquire into this discrepancy, the IAEA demanded 
a special inspection of two sites in Yongbyon, which have been 
suspected of being nuclear waste storage facilities. However, 
North Korea rejected the demand, and declared its withdrawal 
from the NPT in 1993. Thus, the North Korean nuclear issue 
became an international problem. [passage omitted on types of 
inspections stipulated in international laws]

  [Text] Considering the operation of the North-South Joint 
Nuclear Control Committee [JNCC] a must to resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue by the North and South, the 
government has decided to officially propose resuming the 
committee's operation to North Korea when special envoys are 
exchanged between the North and South sometime this month. 
  A government official on 2 March said: "It is very important 
to operate the JNCC at a present stage to independently resolve 
North Korea's nuclear issue and to realize the denuclearization 
on the Korean peninsula," and added "the government intends to 
suggest this matter to the North side when special envoys are 
exchanged." 
  He also disclosed that: "As soon as a working-level contact 
for the exchange of special envoys is over, the steps for the 
resumption of the JNCC will be extensively discussed," and 
concluded "however, it is not clear whether North Korea will 
accept our proposal."

  [Text] The U.S. Government had originally planned to 
announce the U.S.-DPRK agreement [habuimun] reached in their New 
York contact and to take simultaneous measures [tongsi chochi] 
according to it. However, it decided to delay the announcement 
on the simultaneous measures as North Korea proposed the 
South-North working-level contact to be held on 3 March, 
rescheduling the date we proposed earlier. 
  A high-level diplomatic source in Washington said: The U.S. 
Government planned to announce on 2 March -- as soon as the 
International Atomic Energy Agency inspection team arrived in 
Pyongyang, and South-North working-level contacts were resumed 
-- a statement on the ROK Government's consent [chiji] to 
suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and on the decision to 
hold the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks on 21 March. However, 
it has decided to postpone the announcement of all simultaneous 
measures until tomorrow [3 March] because North Korea delayed 
the South-North dialogue, breaking its promise. 
  It has been learned that the U.S. Government made this 
decision after consulting with the ROK as a result of North 
Korea breaking its promise and the United States took 
countermeasures [taeung pangan] on this. 
  Sources said: All U.S.-DPRK agreements are linked with one 
another. If, either side, the United States or North Korea does 
not implement one of the simultaneous measures, all other 
agreements will automatically be invalidated. 
  Regarding this, a senior officer of the U.S. State 
Department 
stressed again that the resumption of South-North dialogue on 
the nuclear issue by exchanging envoys of South and North Korea 
is one of the preconditions [chonje chogon] of the third round 
of U.S.-DPRK talks.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government sent a telephone message to North Korea Wednesday 
accepting the North Korean counterproposal to hold a 
working-level contact in Panmunjom at 10 a.m. Thursday to 
discuss problems related to the proposed exchanges of special 
envoys. The message was sent in the name of Song Yong-tae, chief 
South Korean delegate to the inter-Korean contact. Thursday's 
meeting is to be held at "Peace House" on the southern side of 
the border at the truce village. It has been four months since 
South and North Korea last held the working-level contact on 
Oct. 25 last year. 
  "We will go to the Peace House at 10 a.m. Thursday, as you 
have proposed, hoping a successful outcome of the working-level 
contact," Song said. "It is regrettable, however, that you have 
placed responsibility on our side for the suspension of the 
contact and failure to make any progress in the meantime," Song 
said. 
  The exchanges of special envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang 
have to be realized as soon as possible because they were agreed 
upon by both sides for the resolution of the nuclear issue and 
other pending inter-Korean problems, Song told North Korea. 
  "It is important for you (North Korea) to make a sincere and 
productive approach to discussions for the exchanges of special 
envoys, and respect and fulfill commitments you made," Song said. 
  After sending the message, Song told reporters that 
Thursday's meeting could make progress if North Korea does not 
offer preconditions and repeat its past demands that South Korea 
suspend "a nuclear war exercise" and stop participating in "an 
international campaign" against North Korea. Song also said that 
he does not detect any signs of North Korea rejecting further 
working-level contact blaming a delay by South Korea on the 
announcement of the suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean 
military exercise Team Spirit. But Song said whether or not 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors who went 
into North Korea on Tuesday have actually began their work has 
not been confirmed. 
  In any event, if the inter-Korean contact is carried out on 
Thursday, South Korea is expected to announce a conditional 
suspension of the Team Spirit exercise while the U.S. Government 
will make its announcement on a third round of the U.S.-North 
Korean high-level talks tentatively slated for March 21 in 
Geneva.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea are 
to hold their fourth working-level contact after a four-month 
break on Thursday [3 March], and Seoul is expected to show 
flexibility in discussing North Korea's demand, informed sources 
said Wednesday. 
  Earlier Wednesday, Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean 
delegate 
to the inter-Korean working-level contact, sent a telephone 
message to his North Korean counterpart, Pak Yong-su, accepting 
a North Korean counterproposal to hold the meeting Thursday. 
  With the meeting, Seoul plans to announce the suspension of 
the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise "Team Spirit," on 
condition that an International Atomic Energy Agency team starts 
inspecting North Korean nuclear facilities and a special envoy 
exchange between the Koreas takes place. 
  The South Korean side is also expected to convey President 
Kim Yong-sam's desire to hold a summit with President Kim 
Il-song as soon as possible and Seoul's willingness to send its 
special envoy to Pyongyang first, the sources said. 
  Song will be accompanied by Chang Chae-yong, director 
general 
of the American Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, and Kim 
Il-mu, a councilor at the prime minister's office, as members of 
the Southern delegation to Thursday's contact, the sources said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials on the resumption of North-South 
dialogue carried by Seoul vernacular newspapers on 1 and 2 March. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 1 March carries on 
page 3 an 800-word editorial urging the ROK Government to be 
prudent in enforcing its policy toward North Korea. The 
editorial reports that the North-South working-level contact for 
the exchange of special envoys will encounter many difficulties, 
noting the fact that North Korea failed to respond immediately 
to our side's proposal to hold the contact and that it has 
bitterly denounced President Kim Yong-sam's 25 February new 
conference. The editorial notes that "such an attitude by North 
Korea, though an hackneyed one, may be a tactical trick designed 
to lead the contact favorably." The editorial continues that, 
nevertheless, our government's attitude toward the upcoming 
North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special 
envoys gives the impression that it has forgotten such a 
hackneyed attitude of North Korea. The editorial stresses that 
"negotiations require strategies and tactics," and advises that 
the government use adequate negotiating cards in the upcoming 
working- level contact. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 2 March carries on 
page 3 a 700-word editorial entitled "We Should Be Hasty in 
Dealing With the North-South Issue." Noting that North Korea is 
actually interested mainly in talks with the United States, not 
in North-South dialogue, the editorial urges the government to 
be prudent and not to show the North Korean side a hasty 
attitude in the course of the upcoming North-South working-level 
contact. Citing the difficulties in dealing with the North-South 
issue and North Korea's cunning tactics, the editorial 
concludes: "We should not repeat our past mistakes in the 
upcoming North-South dialogue. We need to learn from past 
lessons with modesty." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 2 March carries on 
page 
3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Oppose Unsubstantial 
Exchange of Special Envoys." Stressing that the realization of 
the exchange of special envoys depends entirely on North Korea's 
sincerity, the editorial reports that the prospect of the 
exchange of special envoys is not so bright because North Korea 
has reluctantly accepted the North-South working-level contact 
with the aim of suspending the Team Spirit military exercise and 
holding a third round of U.S.- North Korean talks. The editorial 
continues that if the exchange of special envoys is realized 
without producing substantial agreements, it will be meaningless 
and will not be conducive to easing tension on the Korean 
peninsula. In this connection, the editorial stresses that our 
government should adhere to and achieve the precondition it has 
put forth, that is, the realization of simultaneous inspections 
in the North and the South. In conclusion, the editorial 
stresses that the government should cancel its plan to announce 
the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise at an early date and, 
at the same time, should make efforts so that the United States 
refuses to hold a third round of talks with North Korea in case 
North Korea shows an insincere attitude at the upcoming 
North-South working-level contact. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries 
on page 3 a 700-word editorial entitled "There is No Short Cut 
to the Settlement of the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The 
editorial welcomes North Korea's acceptance of International 
Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, nuclear inspection. The editorial 
stresses that if North Korea's nuclear transparency is to be 
firmly guaranteed and the upcoming North-South contact is to 
start off on the right foot, there will be many barriers to 
overcome. The editorial, however, warns that the IAEA 
inspection is just the beginning and that we should not expect 
much. The editorial urges the government to act prudently in the 
negotiations with North Korea and not to tread upon thin air -- 
believing that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspection is 
the realization of the normalization of North-South relations. 
In conclusion the editorial emphasizes that we should clearly 
present our demands to North Korea and keenly grasp North 
Korea's strategies toward South Korea in order to avoid becoming 
entangled in them. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries 
on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Expecting Productive 
North-South Dialogue." The editorial analyzes that the delay in 
the North-South working-level contact for the exchange of 
special envoys is due to North Korea's indifference to dialogue 
with the South. 
  The editorial stresses that "ROK is the only country in the 
world that can quickly and accurately provide North Korea with 
what it needs desperately, including food, energy, economic aid, 
and even active support in the improvement of relations with the 
United States and Japan." 
  The editorial reports our side's delegate to the contact 
should convey this point to North Korea because past dialogues 
were only superficial and each side had different objectives. 
  The editorial hopes such mistakes will not be repeated so 
that the exchange of special envoys will be realized soon for a 
more productive dialogue in the consequent North-South summit 
talks. 
  SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 2 March carries on page 4 a 
1,000-word article by Yang Sung-hyon summarizing the advantages 
and disadvantages of the 25 February agreement. The editorial 
reports the game cannot be won one-sidedly as Foreign Minister 
Han said: "It is not a zero-sum game but a nonzero-sum game." 
  The article explains that "the two sides' goals of the 
nuclear negotiations are not necessarily conflicting but 
complementary." The editorial continues that North Korea did not 
"win" the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, which the ROK 
and the United States had little intention to continue as they 
did not include it in their budgets for this year, but used the 
suspension to convince North Korea to accept the inspections. 
The article contends that all sides desired the third-round 
talks. 
  The article reports, however, North Korea did not lose 
everything because it has succeeded in obtaining written 
promises to suspend the Team Spirit exercise and to resume the 
third-round talks in return for North-South working-level 
contacts, which it can suspend anytime with trifle excuses. The 
article adds that the exchange of special envoys was not 
mentioned in the agreement and nuclear inspections were defined 
to only provide assurance of the continuity of safeguards, thus 
North Korea still has the initiative on this subject. The 
article concludes the score is ROK and the United States, 55; 
North Korea, 45. 
  The pro-government HANGYORE SINMUN on 2 March carries on 
page 
2 a 1,400-word article by Kang Tae-ho and Yi Sang-ki on the 
delay of the North-South working-level contact. 
  The article analyzes there are two reasons for the delay: 
one, because the ROK Ministry of National Defense postponed the 
announcement to suspend the Team Spirit exercise to the 
afternoon of 1 March to coincide with the arrival of the IAEA 
inspection team in North Korea; second, because North Korea 
misinterpreted "the resumption of working-level contact" as 
"agreement on the resumption," not "actual holding of 
working-level contact." 
  The article expresses optimism because North Korea showed a 
different attitude by saying "the exchange of special envoys is 
an urgent task that cannot be delayed" in its telephone message. 
Therefore, the article expects it will not be very difficult to 
reach a compromise on the follow-up steps, including the methods 
of the exchange and the duties of special envoys. 
  The article concludes that the government should be prepared 
for North Korea's additional demands to suspend other military 
exercises, including the Ulchi exercise.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna -- live] </F>
  [Text] The nuclear inspection by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], which was supposed to begin in a 
full-fledged manner in Yongbyon, North Korea today, has not been 
conducted due to North Korea's lack of cooperation. 
Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: 
  [Cha Man-sun] The full-fledged nuclear inspection of the 
seven nuclear sites has not been conducted as scheduled due to 
North Korea's lack of cooperation. The inspection team arrived 
in Pyongyang on 1 March and coordinated its inspection schedule 
in order to begin a full-fledged inspection activity in Yongbyon 
today, but due to the North Korean side's lack of cooperation, 
such as the delay in the inter-Korean working contact for the 
exchange of special envoys, the inspection team has not been 
able to begin the inspection activities, it has been learned 
today. 
  David Kyd, IAEA public information officer, disclosed this 
and said that the seven-man inspection team is now standing by, 
preparing for a full-fledged inspection. Mr. Kyd said that 
although the inspection team has not been able to conduct a 
full-fledged inspection activity today, he hopes that the 
inspection team will begin the inspection activities on 3 March 
and that in view of the fact that the IAEA cannot contact the 
inspection team at present, the inspectors may be standing by at 
the Yongbingwan [guest house] in Yongbyon. 
  In connection with this, the IAEA today held an emergency ad 
hoc meeting and decided to take follow-up measures after 
watching developments for a day or two. Meanwhile, an IAEA 
official said that the inspection team in North Korea was 
scheduled to conduct inspection activities for at least 10 days 
and was to inspect the nuclear fission reaction laboratory 
facilities of Kim Il-song University in Pyongyang for a few days.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and Washington are 
determined that a third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level 
talks can be held only after special envoys are exchanged 
between South and North Korea, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
said Wednesday. 
  Han, responding to lawmakers' questions at the National 
Assembly's Committee on Foreign Affairs and National 
Unification, said the exchange of special envoys is a clear 
precondition for the third round of Pyongyang-Washington 
high-level talks. 
  According to an agreement between North Korea and the United 
States reached last Saturday, the two nations are scheduled to 
hold the third round of high-level talks late this month. 
  Han said, "Pyongyang and Washington can discuss the 
possibility of improving their bilateral relations at the third 
round of high-level talks, but now is not the time to discuss 
setting up diplomatic relations. It is not an issue that can be 
realized in the near future, either." 
  He also commented on the alleged construction of a North 
Korean-Iranian plant to jointly produce North Korea's Nodong-1 
missile. 
  "The government conveyed its concern to the Iranian 
Government through direct and indirect channels. Cooperation 
between North Korea and Iran has not been realized yet. It has 
not been decided on yet." 
  Han denied remarks made by Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister 
of the Economic Planning Board Chong Chae-sok, who said on 
Monday that the government will announce an important plan on 
inter-Korean economic cooperation soon. 
  "There is no plan for the government to make any important 
announcement related to inter-Korean economic cooperation," he 
said. 
  Meanwhile Paek Nak-hwan, director-general of the Foreign 
Ministry's European Affairs Bureau, said revision of government 
guidelines on handling asylum seekers is under study to deal 
with North Korean loggers who have escaped from logging yards in 
Siberia to come to South Korea. 
  "The government is also studying various international laws 
and will revise domestic laws if necessary. The Russian 
Government admitted that there are problems including 
infringement of human rights in North Korea's logging yards (in 
Siberia), and is studying ways to revise the forestry agreement 
it concluded with North Korea to insert a provision on 
protection of human rights," Paek said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The Japanese Government 
is expected to present measures aimed at helping ethnic Koreans 
in Sakhalin return to their motherland permanently when South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam visits Tokyo for a summit late 
this month. 
  At the upcoming Seoul-Tokyo summit, Japan is expected to 
explain its efforts to settle past issues between the two 
nations, Yu Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs 
Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, told the National Assembly's 
Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee Wednesday. 
  He strongly hinted that the matter of arranging repatriation 
of Koreans on the Russian island would top the summit's agenda, 
along with the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  Tokyo mobilized around 150,000 Koreans for forced labor on 
Sakhalin in the 1940s when Korea was under Japanese colonial 
rule. About 42,000 first-generation Koreans and their 
descendants still live on the island, with an estimated 13,000 
saying they want to spend the rest of their lives in Korea. 
  Seoul holds Japan legally responsible for their repatriation 
and insists that it should bear the cost of their return and 
settlement and living expenses. 
  Repatriation of Koreans on Sakhalin could symbolize 
Seoul-Tokyo attempts to finally put their past behind them, and 
the two governments have already made such diplomatic efforts as 
sending a joint study team in January, Yu said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea posted a 
trade deficit for the second consecutive month in February, 
officials from the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said 
Wednesday. 
  Exports totaled 6.23 billion U.S. dollars in February, up 
4.8 
percent from the same month last year, while imports hit 6.7 
billion dollars, up 3.3 percent. 
  The figures showed a February trade deficit of 478 million 
dollars and an accumulated trade deficit of 1.91 billion dollars 
for the first two months of this year, up 389 million dollars 
from the same period a year earlier. 
  During the two months, exports rose 9.3 percent from 1993, 
while imports soared 11.2 percent. 
  Even though light industry exports rose 3 percent and 
exports 
to advanced countries increased 5 percent in February, the trade 
deficit widened because imports of capital goods jumped 15 
percent. 
  The yen's strength boosted exports to Japan for most items. 
Exports to the United States and the European Union rose around 
10 percent thanks to brisk sales of heavy and chemical products 
such as electronics, electric goods and automobiles. 
  Meanwhile, imports of general machinery, precision machinery 
and electric/electronics also jumped 25 percent, 35 percent and 
20 percent, respectively, reflecting rising business activity at 
home. 
  Textile imports surged 70 percent and imports of sea 
products 
and daily commodities climbed 20 percent. 
  Ministry officials predicted imports will continue to rise 
because the domestic economy is on the mend. 
  In February, arrivals of Letters of Credit (L/C) reached 
3.71 
billion dollars, off 0.5 percent from the same month in 1993, 
and import licenses came to 5.53 billion dollars, up 17.8 
percent.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- Primary and secondary 
school teachers expelled for joining a teachers' trade union 
four years ago returned to their classrooms on Wednesday. 
  The Education Ministry said 1,135 of the 1,330 teachers 
reinstated in their former profession had reported to new 
assignments across the country. 
  Of the rest, 159 will be assigned to schools during the 
current semester and the remaining 36, who are either members of 
city or county education boards or involved in lawsuits, will be 
given jobs when their board tenure expires or when their cases 
are cleared up. 
  Among the 1,419 teachers expelled for union activities, 89 
were not reinstated for refusing to grant government officials 
an interview, for not taking a refresher course or for vowing to 
continue in the union, the Ministry said. 
  In Seoul, 454 of 508 sacked teachers have been reinstated 
and 
reported to some 340 schools in the capital area. 
  But most schools are expected to avoid placing these 
teachers 
in charge of a class for fear of the influence they, as former 
unionists, may have over students.

  [Text] Chongju, South Korea, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The South 
Korean Air Force Academy has admitted the first foreign cadet in 
its 46-year history. 
  A 22-year-old Thai, Natachai Jencharoenwatama, stood proudly 
next to Korean cadets on the campus of the Air Force Academy in 
Chongwon, North Chungchong Province, Tuesday as a member of the 
46th class. 
  Natachai, born in Kanchanaburi, was selected as one of 14 
cadets given the privilege of studying abroad while a freshman 
at the Thai Air Force academy in 1992. 
  He arrived in March last year and took a one-year Korean 
language course at the Seoul National University Language 
Institute before moving on to the North Chungchong campus in 
January. 
  He underwent five weeks of basic military training and tried 
to get used to the unfamiliar language and environment. 
  "I like chicken and pork, but I don't know about kimchi 
yet," 
he said in broken Korean. 
  Natachai has four years of regular courses still ahead and 
will most likely get used to kimchi and many other things Korean 
by then. 
  "I'm prepared to learn the advanced studies and skills of 
the 
Korean Air Force to be an excellent Thai hawk," he said. 
  The Korean Air Force Academy said it will continue to open 
its doors to foreigners as well as recruit female cadets from 
next year.

<F P=106> [By Suwon-based correspondent Im Ku-pin: "Warning of </F>
Emergency Guard Against Rabies in Kyonggi and Kangwon Area"] 
  [Text] Residents and domestic animals infected with rabies 
have been discovered in Yonchon in Kangwon Province and Chorwon 
and Hwachon in Kangwon Province, as well as in the area near the 
Demilitarized Zone where the entry of civilians is restricted, 
thus indicating an outbreak of rabies. Therefore, the Kyonggi 
Provincial government plans to inoculate 22,000 cows and dogs in 
northern Kyonggi Province. On 25 February, a neighborhood 
meeting was held in 553 places to discuss measures against 
rabies and a propaganda campaign on the prevention of rabies was 
conducted. 
  Meanwhile, the Domestic Animal Sanitation Research Institute 
in the Agricultural Promotion Agency recommended to the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Fisheries that the northern district in 
Kyonggi Province be designated as the first district for the 
prevention of rabies. 
  It was learned that rabies broke out in the Chorwon and 
Hwachon area last year, too, and that raccoons and wild cats 
that came to the villages to find food infected the dogs and 
cows by biting them in a fight. 
  The provincial government also requested the military units 
to shoot these animals to death as soon as they are found, and 
handed down a directive to each county and city to slaughter the 
infected cows and dogs.

  [Text] Suwon, March 2 (YONHAP) -- Amid a dry weather alert, 
three mountain fires broke out in Kyonggi Province on Monday [28 
February], destroying an area covering 264 hectares. 
  A blaze that started on a mountain in the demilitarized zone 
in Torasan-ri, Changso-myon, Paju-kun at 4:00 PM engulfed a 
260-hectare area in 20 hours before dying out at 11:30 PM. 
  During the fire, some 50 mines buried in the DMZ exploded, 
witnesses said. 
  When the fire became stronger around noon, army posts to the 
south of the Military Demarcation Line started a counter blaze 
to keep the flames from spreading further. 
  In Towon-ri, Chongun-myon, Yangpyong-kun, the province's 
second mountain fire of the day broke out at 2:25 PM, destroying 
an area of 3.5 hectares. The blaze was brought under control in 
three hours, thanks to a Forestry Administration helicopter and 
100 villagers. 
  The third fire started on a mountain in Chinjung-ri, 
Choan-myon, Nam Yangju-kun at 6:00 PM and destroyed 0.5 hectares 
in about an hour.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets on February 28 committed a provocative gunfiring in an 
area near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the frontline area, 
getting on the nerves of the North, according to military 
sources. 
  They fired rifle bullets and shells into areas adjacent to 
the DMZ from Chorwon county, South Korean Kangwon Province and 
Paju and Yonchon counties, Kyonggi Province. 
  In another development, they staged ground strike, ground 
attack support and airlifting exercises against the northern 
half of Korea in the skies above Kosong County, South Korean 
Kangwon Province, and Yonchon, Paju and Hwachon of Kyonggi 
Province with the mobilisation of formations of fighter planes,

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- The Council of Lawyers 
for Democratic Society in South Korea recently held a forum on 
human rights and unanimously contended that nothing has been 
improved in the situation of human rights since the appearance 
of the Kim Yong- sam regime. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this is only too natural a 
condemnation of the traitor Kim Yong-sam's "civilian" fascist 
rule. 
  Though the traitor has advertised "reforms" as if he would 
bring some "changes" to South Korea, and made brag of his 
administrative "achievements" after his assumption of office, 
the reality shows that the "civilian" regime is violating human 
rights more harshly than the preceding military dictatorial 
regimes, the analyst says, and goes on: 
  The traitor has refused to abolish the notorious "National 
Security Law," a legacy of the military dictatorship, and 
expanded and strengthened such repressive tools as the 
"security planning board" and the "secret affairs command." 
  After rising to power, the Kim Yong-sam group began brutally 
suppressing the righteous desire of the students and people for 
independence, democracy and reunification and mercilessly 
cracking down on the struggle of the workers and peasants for 
their vital rights, branding it as "collective egoism" and 
"illegal riot." It has also put down the struggle of workers for 
a wage hike by setting in-motion even the "emergency arbitration 
power," which the preceding military dictators had not dared to 
employ. 
  Noting that the South Korean people have keenly felt that 
with the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique as sly as fox left in 
power, they cannot feel ease even a moment but will undergo 
greater misfortunes and sufferings, the analyst says they will 
bring him to justice without fail.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- The test explosion of a 
newly-made U.S. H-bomb on the Bikini forty years ago on March 1 
has left the lesson that nuclear holocaust must not be inflicted 
upon humanity again and a powerful struggle must be waged to get 
rid of the constant nuclear threat, says MINJU CHOSON in a 
by-lined article today dedicated to day of Bikini. 
  Pointing out that the imperialist reactionary forces are 
still threatening mankind with nuclear weapons going against the 
trend of the present times, the article says: 
  The United States continues the test and production of 
nuclear weapons and is bringing dark clouds of nuclear war, 
having deployed nuclear weapons and their means of delivery in 
many parts of the world. 
  Nuclear threat is coming from Japan, too. It is no secret 
that Japan, the only nuclear victim in the world, is now working 
with extra zeal to become a nuclear power. Japan which has 
stockpiled large quantities of plutonium can turn into a nuclear 
power any moment. The outcries of the Japanese ruling quarters 
over the DPRK's "nuclear issue" are intended to justify their 
moves to be a nuclear power. 
  It is a common task of the world people to build a peaceful 
new world free from nuclear weapons by smashing the nuclear war 
moves of the imperialist reactionary forces. 
  The world peaceloving people should build a peaceful world 
without nuclear weapons with a united struggle.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- The political and 
public circles of the world express positive support to the 
statement of a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry on the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Council of the Union of Communist Parties-the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union adopted a statement at its plenary 
meeting held on February 12 and 13. 
  The statement expressed support and solidarity for the 
principled stand made clear by a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry in a statement and the sincere efforts of the DPRK 
Government for the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula. The statement vehemently condemned the U.S. 
Administration and reactionaries for creating tensions in the 
Korean peninsula and the world. 
  Chairman of the National Liberation War Veterans Committee 
of 
Zimbabwe Charles Hongwe said in a statement on February 12 that 
the United States must take a sincere stance for a solution to 
the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula through negotiation 
and immediately stop scheming to isolate and stifle the DPRK. 
  The Political Department of the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation in a statement on February 14 said that the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula is not a matter to be solved by 
force. "If the United States is really willing to resolve the 
nuclear issue, it should show a right position toward dialogue 
first of all," it said. 
  Chairman of the Butwal Peace Action Committee Soorya Laleit 
in a statement demand that the United States immediately drop 
its provocative scheme to deploy Patriot missiles and withdraw 
its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea without delay. 
  Members of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and the 
"Labouring Russia" Movement and Moscow citizens held a 
demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on February 
6. The protesters staged a sit-down against the U.S. 
interference and aggressive moves in Korea in front of the U.S. 
Embassy, holding slogan boards reading "United States, take 
hands off socialist Korea", "Glory to the heroic Korean people" 
and so on. 
  They handed over to the U.S. Embassy a "letter of protest 
against the U.S. moves of aggression against the DPRK" in the 
name of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and the "Labouring 
Russia" Movement.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- Delegates of different 
countries denounced the crimes of the Japanese imperialists at 
an international hearing on the sexual enslavement of women by 
the Japanese Army held in Switzerland on February 21 under the 
cosponsorship of the International Association of Democratic 
Lawyers, the World Council of Churches and the International 
Fellowship of Reconciliation. 
  The delegate of the measure committee for compensations to 
the "comfort women for the army" and victims of the Pacific war 
said that all documents and materials concerning the "comfort 
women for the army" were carried to Japan at the time of its 
defeat. "The attempt of the present Japanese Government to keep 
its past crimes in darkness, while concealing all the materials 
in its possession, is a mockery of human conscience and an 
insult to the victims," he said. 
  The delegate demanded that Japan open all the materials on 
the crimes to the public, punish the criminals by law and make 
sincere compensations to the human rights victims. 
  The delegate of the World Council of Churches said that 
sexual enslavement by the Japanese Army, an encroachment upon 
human conscience and morality, can never be overlooked. 
  He demanded that Japan sternly punish those responsible for 
the issue of "comfort women for the army" and make proper 
compensations to the victims. He called upon all the 
non-governmental organisations to join in the cause of defending 
human morality and conscience with a united action. 
  The delegate of the International Fellowship of 
Reconciliation demanded that the Japanese Government bear 
responsibility for the grave crimes against mankind and take 
practical measures for a fair solution of the problem. 
  Kim Won-ung, democratic member of the South Korean "National 
Assembly," charged that the South Korean authorities and the 
Japanese Government were taking an insincere and deceptive stand 
toward the settlement of the problem of "comfort women for the 
army". 
  He said the "comfort women" issue denotes a heinous and 
inhumane war crime and criticized the attempt of the Japanese 
Government to hush it up.

<F P=106> ["Green Light for War of Aggression" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
brands the "Recommendation on International Security" (draft) 
providing for the overseas dispatch of the "Self-Defence Forces" 
(SDF) for military operations, worked out by Japan's influential 
think-tank, the strategic study centre, as designed to give the 
green light to the Japanese reactionaries in overseas aggression. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The "recommendation" reveals the true color of Japan as a 
bellicose state, not a "peaceful state." The document is very 
dangerous because it is highly probable that Japan will take the 
afore-said course guided by it in shaping state policies. 
  The document recommends that "to preserve the international 
order through its participation in the operations for 
international security" in the form of "U.N. forces" or 
"multinational forces" should be defined as one of the "main 
tasks" of the Japan "SDF"; military preparations should be made 
for dispatching a combat unit to any part of the world; the 
constitution banning war should be revised; and the domestic 
system should be readjusted so as to mobilize everything in war 
institutionally. 
  This reveals the wild ambition of the Japanese reactionaries 
to play the part of Interpol through military intervention in 
war and disputes, big and small, in the world and join in the 
scrambles for world supremacy. 
  Japan takes the DPRK as a major target of its attack in 
order 
to begin with the Korean peninsula in its Asian reinvasion. 
  The "recommendation" lays special emphasis on an armed 
conflict in the surroundings of Japan, which implies a war in 
Korea. 
  The Japanese bellicose elements' hysteric military exercises 
simulating a Korean war and their outcries for "special 
inspection" and "sanctions" against the DPRK are all intended to 
find a pretext for reinvasion. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful 
that aggression and war will lead them to self-destruction.

  The two peoples of Korea and Libya established and have 
favourably developed their friendly relations. Their mutual 
support and cooperation have been conducive to the building of a

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- Famous works of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il have been disseminated and 
studied in different countries. 
  A seminar on his work "Abuses of Socialism are Intolerable" 
was held by the British group for the study of the revolutionary 
activities and works of Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  Chief of the group Dermot Hudson in his report stressed: 
  This work of Comrade Kim Chong-il is a militant banner for 
frustrating the anti-socialist strategy of the imperialists and 
defending and advancing the cause of socialism. He in his work 
lays bare the falsehood and reactionary nature of the 
anti-socialist vile propaganda made by the imperialists and 
reactionaries. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and enriched the idea and 
theory on socialism and brought the essential superiority of 
socialism to capitalism into full play in Korea, so that mankind 
may confidently advance along the road of socialism with a 
beacon of hope. 
  Under his wise leadership the cause of socialism will make a 
long drive. 
  Seminars on the same work were held by the group for the

  [Text] Pyongyang, march 1 (KCNA) -- Many poems praising the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il have been created in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  From February last year to the end of January this year, the 
literary and art press group and the Kumsong Youth Publishing 
House carried more than 200 of poems written by poets and 
working people of different strata in various publications. 
  In this period, poets of the Korean writing group created 
"Son of the People", "Pride of Korea", "One Big Family" and many 
other poems of high ideological and artistic value. 
  A lyric "Son of Paektu" tell about the Korean people's great 
pride and honor of having the iron-willed brilliant commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, a peerless great man and great son of the

the Old Home at Mt. Paektu Secret Camp", "May the Chong-il Peak 
Shine Through Generations", "Strides of Great Man" and other

soldiers.

and 
will, composed poems "Bout my Destiny", "Thinking About Love" 
and "Laudatory Song of Faith and Will" and presented them to the 
dear leader. 
  In the poems, Yi In-mo tells about his strong ideological 
feeling that Korea's cause of socialism, the revolutionary 
cause of chuche, is invincible as long as there is the wise 
guidance of dear Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Rim Chang-su in Jongpmhong County, South Hamgyong Province, 
and Kim Chae-song in Unjon County, North Phyongan Province, 
wrote lyrics "The Sun of the Nation, The Heaven of Mankind" and 
"Let us Sing of Our Mother Party" which tell about the unanimous 
resolution and will of the Korean people to hold in high esteem 
as the great sun Comrade Kim Chong-il who looks after and 
protects the destiny, future and hope of the Korean nation and 
to remain loyal and filial to him. 
  Poems created among People's Army soldiers sing of their 
great pride and honor of having their supreme commander in the 
person of Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of rare 
intelligence and outstanding strategy, ever-victorious 
commandership iron will and matchless grit and warm love of 
soldiers, and reflect their unshakable faith and will to

<F P=106> [Congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the </F>
Workers' Party of Korea to the National Agriculture Meeting at 
Pyongyang Gymnasium on 25 February, read by Vice President Yi 
Chong-ok -- recorded] 
  [Text] The National Agricultural Conference has opened at 
a time when all the party members and working people are 
vigorously accelerating the general march of socialism with the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude through 
single-hearted unity around the party and the leader amid the 
great expectation and interest of the people and agricultural 
working people across the country. 
  The meeting, which is being held in the significant year 
marking the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist 
rural theses, is a historic meeting that proudly sums up the 
great victory in brilliantly implementing the tasks presented by 
rural theses and demonstrates the correctness of the theses and 
the vitality of our country's socialist rural economic system. 
It is also a glorious meeting that demonstrates the heroic 
spirit of our people and agricultural working people, who are 
vigorously advancing with the revolutionary banner of chuche, 
and the invincibility of socialism of our own style. [applause] 
  The Central Committee [CC] of the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] extends ardent congratulations to all working people and 
members of three-revolutions teams movement of the agricultural 
sector, and all participants who are present at the meeting with 
the pride of accomplishing great feats in the struggle to 
implement the socialist rural theses with ardent loyalty to the 
party and the leader. [applause] 
  To properly solve socialist rural problems is an important 
issue concerning the destiny of the socialist cause. The great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song has for the first time in history set 
forth all theoretical and practical problems arising from 
solving the socialist rural problems and vigorously inspired the 
entire party, the entire country, and all the people to the 
implementation of the rural theses by presenting the theses on 
our country's socialist rural problems. He wisely led the 
struggle to accelerate socialist rural construction and develop 
agricultural production by personally creating the chuche-based 
farming method and continuing on-the-spot guidance. 
  With a firm chuche-based position, our party set forth new 
theory and policy to better solve rural problems in conformity 
with the demand of the reality to deepen and develop socialist 
construction; had the entire country seethe with the struggle to 
implement the theses; vigorously carried out three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in rural 
areas; and energetically led agricultural workers to achieve 
ceaseless innovations in rural works by demonstrating the spirit 
as masters. 
  Because the chuche-oriented socialist rural theses were 
implemented in practice under the wise leadership of the party 
and the leader [suryong], a brilliant example has been created 
in solving the rural problems, and a change of the century has 
been brought about in the rural areas in our country. [applause] 
  An ideological revolution has been vigorously carried out in 
the rural areas, and, as a result, a great change has taken 
place in the agricultural workers' ideological and spiritual 
state and the way they work and live. Our agricultural workers 
have considered loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] to 
be the most valuable thing and are preparing themselves as 
chuche-type revolutionary warriors who breathe and wage 
struggles by following the party's intentions. Highly aware 
that they are masters in the rural areas, they have been 
sincerely working for their fatherland, people, society, and 
group under the slogan "One for all, all for one." 
  The party's plan to carry out a technological revolution in 
the rural areas has been carried out successfully, and, as a 
result, the task to build irrigation systems in the rural areas 
has been completed on a high level and the task to use electric 
equipment in farming has been realized brilliantly. Great 
progress has been made in mechanizing farm work and using 
chemical fertilizers in farming, and, as a result, our peasants 
who had to transplant rice seedlings and weed rice paddies by 
hand and do toilsome work are now doing farm work easily and 
efficiently. 
  Because the chuche-oriented farming method was implemented, 
agricultural production has rapidly developed based on modern 
science and technology. Because a cultural revolution was 
carried out in the rural areas, agricultural workers' level of 
general knowledge and their technological and cultural levels 
have improved significantly, the ranks of agricultural 
technicians and experts have increased, a great change has taken 
place in conditions for cultural lives in the rural areas, and 
the rural areas in our country have turned into civilized and 
abundant socialist cultural rural areas. 
  Based on the new agricultural guidance system, guidance and 
management on the rural economy has been improved and 
strengthened endlessly; the leading role of all-people ownership 
in relation to cooperative ownership has been enhanced; and, as 
a result, major progress has been made in overcoming the 
differences between the urban and rural areas in terms of types 
of management and ownership. 
  Counties across the country have been built strongly and are 
excellently carrying out their mission and role in carrying out 
the three revolutions. They are also excellently carrying out 
their mission and role as bases that link cities to rural areas. 
  The socialist rural theses gave our people and 
agricultural workers the great honor and pride of having 
pioneered the only correct road in solving rural problems and 
gave firm belief in the victory of socialism to progressive 
mankind and vigorously inspired them to the struggle. 
  In the past 30 years, our agricultural working people have 
contributed greatly to the prosperity and development of the 
country and to providing better happiness to the people by 
blossoming new socialist living on the fatherland with a firm 
belief in socialism and through devoted struggle and creative 
labor. 
  The victory of socialism of our own style is being reliably 
guaranteed because we have the most advanced socialist rural 
economic system and large contingents of heroic agricultural 
working people, which are being strengthened and developed every 
day, upholding the leadership of the great leader and the great 
party with the strong support of chuche-based industries. 
[applause] 
  The WPK Central Committee highly appraises our agricultural 
working people for achieving great labor feats in the struggle 
to complete the tasks presented by the socialist rural theses 
upholding the leadership of the party and the leader. [applause] 
  To further vigorously carry out the socialist rural 
construction is an important requirement for highly displaying 
the superiority of our country's popular masses-centered 
socialism and successfully completing the chuche-oriented 
socialist cause. All the party members and working people of 
the agricultural sector should wage a more vigorous struggle to 
effect a new upsurge in rural construction and agricultural 
production upholding the historic letter "For the Ultimate 
Solution to Rural Problems Under the Banner of Socialist Rural 
Theses" sent to this meeting by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The three 
revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- is 
the basic content of revolution to be practiced by the party of 
the working class after the socialist system is established, and 
to be continued until the construction of communism. 
  The basic key to win a greater victory in the socialist 
rural construction is to thoroughly carry out the three 
revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in 
rural communities in conformity with the demands of a new higher 
stage. [applause] 
  By deepening the ideological revolution, first of all, party 
members and working people should arm themselves with a great 
chuche idea and party's chuche-oriented rural construction idea 
to vigorously carry out the work of revolutionizing farmers. 
  By strengthening the indoctrination of the chuche idea, 
agricultural working people should think and act as demanded by 
our party's chuche idea and chuche-oriented idea for rural 
construction. They should also deeply grasp and further glorify 
the proud history in which the world has began under such a 
chuche ray. 
  Agricultural working people should become deeply aware of 
the 
greatness of the party and the leader [suryong] by continuously 
and vigorously carrying out the indoctrination of loyalty. As a 
result, they should possess the spirit -- the spirit of 
endlessly following the party and the leader while sharing their 
fate of life or death with the party in any difficult situations 
-- as their first revolutionary trust and hold as their firm 
faith the truth that our socialism, which is leading the great 
party, will surely win victory by smashing any challenges and 
obstructive maneuvers. 
  Along with this, they, by further deepening the class 
indoctrination, should not forget the class stand but instead 
strongly keep it all the time as they enjoy their happy life 
with each passing day. Also, for a society and collective, they 
should work and cooperate with each other, overflowing with a 
revolutionary zeal. 
  By vigorously carrying out the technological revolution at a 
higher level, agricultural working people should further 
strengthen the material and technological foundation of the 
rural economy and effect a constant upsurge in the agricultural 
production. Also, they should promisingly solve the increasing 
water problems by further increasing irrigation facilities and 
by consolidating the operation of the already established 
irrigation system and make the grand circle-style irrigation 
system -- which was established in our country -- effect a 
greater upsurge in agricultural production. At the same time, 
they should actively accelerate field irrigation construction. 
  Along with this, they should properly prepare power 
production bases, stabilize production, accelerate ongoing power 
plant constructions, and build many small-, and medium-sized 
power plants everywhere throughout the country by conducting 
mass-oriented campaigns. As a result, they should more 
satisfactorily meet the increasing demands of electricity from 
rural communities. 
  Today, rural technological revolution is faced with the 
major task of further enhancing the industrialization and 
modernization of agriculture. In order to outstandingly carry 
out the general mechanization and scientification of the rural 
economy, we should produce more farming machineries of various 
kinds, such as tractors, and more chemical fertilizers, highly 
effective agriculture chemicals, and herbicides and send them to 
rural areas. 
  We should further develop our socialist rural areas to 
become 
ideal villages to work and live in by actively expanding the 
rank of technicians of the agricultural sector through a more 
vigorous cultural revolution, upgrading the technological and 
cultural standard of agricultural working people, who are 
directly in charge of agricultural production, and by 
establishing production culture and living culture. 
  The entire party, entire country, and all the people should 
further vigorously push ahead with the struggle to complete the 
historic task to turn farmers into working class, and 
industrialize agriculture, while filled with pride and 
confidence in achieving a great victory in solving the rural 
problems. [applause] 
  The industry-first policy is the most correct policy that 
enriches our people's dietary life and embodies our party's idea 
of strengthening and developing socialism of our own. [applause] 
  Functionaries and working people of the agricultural sector, 
who have walked along the rewarding road of socialist rural 
construction while courageously overcoming severe trials and 
difficulties following the leadership of the party and the 
leader, should uphold the party's revolutionary economic policy 
and display the sense of revolution and combat capabilities in 
the struggle to implement the agriculture-first policy. 
  All the agricultural working people should deeply bear the 
responsibility of the master who makes sure the nation's rice 
granary is full and effect a great upsurge in agricultural 
production by methodically and tenaciously carrying out all 
farming works in accordance with the demands of chuche-based 
farming method. 
  Guiding functionaries in the rural economy sector should 
highly demonstrate the superiority and vitality of chuche-based 
agricultural guidance system by embodying the demands of the 
great spirit of Chongsan-ri, the methods of Chongsan-ri, and 
should be deeply involved with farmers, share joys and sorrow 
with them, solve their problems with responsibilities, and lead 
them to implement the party's agricultural plan by setting 
examples and showing practices. 
  With the principle that industries help agriculture and 
urbanize rural areas, all masses should efficiently support 
rural areas so that the party's agriculture-first policy is 
thoroughly implemented. Rural party works should be more 
vigorously carried out in conformity with the developing reality. 
  Party organizations should carry out work with human 
beings and political work, firmly bond the agricultural working 
people around the party, further strengthen our party's rural 
bases, enhance our role in socialist rural construction by all 
means, and firmly guarantee our party's leadership in rural 
construction. 
  Based on the accomplishments already achieved in socialist 
rural construction, party organizations and functionaries should 
diminish the differences between industrial and agricultural 
economic management standards, and correctly carry out the work 
to gradually transform cooperative ownership to all-people 
ownership in rural areas. 
  It is a proud revolutionary trait of our people and 
agricultural working people to courageously overcome 
difficulties and trials they are faced with and continue to 
innovate, to advance toward new victories following the 
leadership of the party and the great leader under the banner of 
self-reliance and fortitude. 
  The WPK Central Committee firmly believes that all our 
agricultural working people would excellently repay the party's 
trust and expectation by resolutely continuing the struggle to 
firmly defend and further elucidate socialism of our style under 
the banner of the chuche idea while firmly uniting around the 
party and the leader. [applause]

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- "For the ultimate 
solution of the rural question under the banner of the socialist 
rural theses," the letter sent by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song to the national agricultural conference, is a programme 
of socialist rural construction in our times and a militant 
banner which makes it possible to develop in depth our 
agriculture to a higher level, says NODONG SINMUN in an 
editorial Tuesday. 
  The editorial says the historic letter of the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song consummates the theoretical and practical 
matters for finally solving the rural question, the most 
difficult question in socialist construction, by dynamically 
accelerating rural construction along the road indicated by the 
rural theses. 
  The editorial quotes the respected leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song 
as saying: 
  "If we consolidate the position we have already taken up and 
launch a new battle by making more strenuous efforts, we will 
win a historic victory in the solution of the rural question, 
the most difficult question in the building of socialism." 
  The work, it notes, is a militant banner that instills into 
the minds of our agricultural working people and other people 
the conviction of the might of the chuche-based system of the 
socialist rural economy and the invincibility of the 
Korean-style socialism and that powerfully encourages them in 
the work for consolidating and developing them; it is a highly 
important guideline in effecting a new revolutionary turn in our 
rural economy and in all sectors of agricultural production. 
  The work is a famous work that has further developed and 
enriched the revolutionary theory of the working class on 
socialist and communist construction with new and unique 
contents, the editorial points out, and goes on: 
  It is of weighty significance in the development of the 
revolutionary theory of rural construction that the great leader 
in this work gave a comprehensive exposition of the principle, 
ways and time of the conversion of cooperative property to 
all-people property. The theories of creating conditions for 
the switchover of cooperative property to all-people property, 
conducting it with the county as a unit, and correctly defining 
the forms and ways of the switchover and other theories 
propounded in the work light the path of finally solving the 
rural question without the slightest deviation. 
  The great leader's work is a powerful weapon in refuting the 
sophism of the imperialists that socialism cannot find a 
solution to the rural question and smashing all descriptions of 
opportunist tendencies of removing the revolutionary principle 
of the working class in rural construction. 
  The editorial calls upon all the party members and other 
working people to make a deep-going study of the profound idea 
and theories laid down in the work, fully grasp them and develop 
in depth the three revolutions, ideological, technical and 
cultural, in compliance with the requirements of socialist rural 
construction on a new, higher stage.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- Industrial 
establishments of Korea overfulfilled their February plans and 
are expanding the achievements. 
  The Anju District coal mining complex topped its February 
target on all indices by introducing a new coal cutting method. 
It continues boosting production in March. 
  The Chilli coal mine doubled production in February compared 
with the same month of last year by introducing a new blasting 
method. 
  The Tokchon District coal mining complex carried out its 
February assignments for capital tunnelling at 100.5 nercent, 
preparatory tunnelling at 101.3 percent, slope pit tunnelling at 
101.3 percent, pit concreting at 112.8 percent and coal output 
at 101.8 percent as of February 27. 
  The Changjagang Power Station fulfilled its February plan 
three days ahead of schedule and the Chagang provincial combined 
general bureau of forestry produced over 10,000 more cubic 
metres of timber in February as against the same period of last 
year. 
  The Songsan mine surpassed its February goal by 48 percent 
in 
terms of output value and by 27 percent in kind. It is carrying 
out its daily quotas at 130 to 150 percent in march. The mine 
fulfilled its January plan in a matter of 14 days. 
  February plans were also overfulfilled by the Myongchon 
District coal mining complex, the General Bureau of Harbour 
Works, the Pyongyang Municipal General Bureau of Garment 
Industry and many other units, which are keeping a high rate of 
production in March.

<F P=106> [Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 Feb 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of Japan [BOJ] expects there will be little 
impact on the yen rate despite the fact the G-7 meeting ended 
with member nations failing to clearly define cooperative 
efforts toward stabilizing the exchange market, as Japan had 
hoped. A senior official of the BOJ's International Department 
said: "To a certain degree, the market already reflects the 
fact that the exchange rate was not going to be high on the 
agenda at the latest meeting." 
  At a meeting with the Japanese finance minister, the U.S. 
treasury secretary requested in strong terms that Japan try to 
cut its current account surplus. Some market officials, 
therefore, predict a yen rise in the exchange market early next 
week. However, the BOJ is doubtful, saying, "there does not now 
seem to be an automatic appreciation in the yen when the United 
States takes a hard-line attitude."

  [Text] Police have concluded their investigation of the 
Saudi jewellery scandal and submitted an official report to 
Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, an informed Interior 
Ministry source said yesterday. Chavalit received the report on 
Sunday. He is studying it in detail before deciding what to do 
next, the source said. "The minister said he will need two days 
to study the report," the source said. 
  A high-ranking Foreign Ministry source yesterday said Saudi 
officials have told the ministry that Thai-Saudi diplomatic ties 
would be restored and upgraded to full ambassadorial level in 
seven months. This is if the police fulfilled their promise to 
settle the case within this month. The account could not be 
confirmed by Saudi Charge d'Affaires Mohammed Said Khoja 
yesterday. "I don't know anything about it," he told The Nation 
by telephone. 
  Chawalit yesterday would not confirm whether he had received 
the official report from police. "The results should be known in 
two days," he said without elaborating. 
  The same source said police are preparing to arrest an 
elderly woman who was once the wet nurse of a police general. 
They have acquired evidence pointing to her possession of some 
of the missing jewellery. 
  The same Foreign Ministry source yesterday confirmed that 
Chawalit had received the police report concluding the years-old 
investigation into the disappearance of the Saudi jewellery. The 
source said the Foreign Ministry had consistently kept Saudi 
Arabia informed of progress in the case and the latest details, 
but not including the final report submitted to Chawalit, were 
translated and sent through the Thai Charge d' Affaires in 
Riyadh, Mahadi Wimana. The ministry has told its Saudi 
counterpart that the Thai police were wrapping up the jewellery 
case and preparing to arrest those suspected to be involved in 
the crime, he said. 
  The Saudi side was also told that Thai officials had 
promised 
good news in March, understood to mean the arrest of culprits, 
including some police officers, the source said. Riyadh has 
expressed appreciation for Thailand's efforts to settle the case 
and urged a continuing attempt to bring the culprits to justice, 
he said. "The Saudis have said if Thai authorities could settle 
the case in March as they have promised, Thai-Saudi diplomatic 
ties would be restored and upgraded to full ambassadorial level 
in seven months," the source said. Thailand and Saudi Arabia 
currently have charges d'affaires as the head of their 
respective embassies. 
  Thai-Saudi relations have been strained by the disappearance 
of some of the jewellery retrieved by Thai police in early 1990 
after it was stolen by a Thai worker in Riyadh, and by the 
murders of three Saudi embassy officials in Bangkok in the same 
year. Riyadh has stopped issuing visas to Thai workers while 
pressing for settlement of the jewellery and murder cases. 
  Seven policemen and one civilian are on trial in connection 
with the suspected embezzlement of the missing jewellery and 
more arrests are expected. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said he was 
waiting for official results of the investigation.

  [Text] Washington, March 1 (YONHAP) -- A senior U.S. State 
Department official has publicly expressed his desire to see 
South Korea repeal its controversial National Security Law. 
Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of State for East 
Asian and Pacific Affairs, made the remark at a seminar on 
U.S.-South Korean relations in the Pacific era, sponsored by 
American University on Feb. 25. In a keynote speech, Hubbard 
praised South Korea for making "heartwarming success in 
establishing democracy and marked improvement on the human 
rights front." 
  "Despite (these) successes -- or perhaps because of them -- 
the United States still wishes the Republic of Korea would 
repeal the National Security Law," Hubbard said. Hubbard 
acknowledged that friction exists between the United States and 
South Korea stemming from extensive interaction between nations. 
But such friction really results from the "problems of 
success," he said. In any event, it was the first time that any 
senior U.S. Government official has publicly expressed a desire 
to see South Korea's National Security Law repealed. 
  The remark is attracting even more interest since it was 
made 
by the American representative to a recent series of 
Washington-Pyongyang working-level contacts held in New York to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Contacted for 
clarification on Tuesday, a State Department official confirmed 
that Hubbard's remark reflects "the official position of the 
U.S. Government." The official also confirmed that the U.S. 
Government has been urging the Seoul government to undertake 
"additional measures" to solidify "democratization" in South 
Korea. The official, however, took pains to stress that 
Hubbard's comment has nothing to do with the ongoing discussions 
between the United States and North Korea on the nuclear and 
other issues. 
  Officials at the South Korean Embassy in Washington admitted 
that the U.S. Government has urged Seoul to improve human 
rights. But they were at a loss to explain why Hubbard made 
such remarks when the North Korean nuclear issue has entered a 
critical stage. 
  Many South Korean leaders including President Kim Yong-sam 
believe it is premature to repeal the National Security Law, 
which was enacted to deter espionage and other hostile 
activities by communists in North Korea aimed at overthrowing 
the Seoul government.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to South 
Korea James Laney said Wednesday that Washington will announce a 
four-point agreement with Pyongyang at their working-level 
contact at 11 P.M. Thursday [1400 GMT] (9 A.M. Washington time). 
  The agreement includes the date for a third round of 
high-level talks between the United States and North Korea, 
tentatively slated for March 21 in Geneva. 
  Laney made the disclosure during a meeting with Deputy Prime 
Minister and head of the National Unification Board [NUB] Yi 
Yong-tok. Laney briefed Yi on the process and the content of 
the U.S.-North Korean agreement, according to NUB spokesman Kim 
Hyong-ki. 
  At the meeting, Yi again stressed the South Korean 
Government's position that Seoul and Pyongyang must exchange 
special envoys before the United States and North Korea can hold 
a third round of negotiations. 
  Yi and Laney shared the opinion that Washington and Seoul 
need to consult closely on the issue, the spokesman said. 
  If South and North Korea failed to exchange special envoys 
before March 21, Yi and Laney agreed that North Korea would be 
in a difficult position, Kim added.

  [Text] According to military sources, the South Korean 
puppets conducted provocative gun firing [tobalchogin chongpo 
sagyok haengwirul kamhaeng] on 28 February near the DMZ in the 
frontline in front of us, agitating [chaguk] us. 
  The puppet army's large-caliber artillery group, moved and 
deployed in Yulli-ri and Waechon-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, 
Kangwon Province, South Korea, showered tens of shells on the 
area near the DMZ that day. The puppet army's armed rascals 
occupied battle positions in Sogong-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi 
Province and Korangpo-ri, Yonchon County and created a stir by 
firing at random as many as some 2,000 shells of large-caliber 
machine guns and automatic rifles, while advancing toward the 
Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets openly and in 
broad 
daylight moved and deployed some 10 armored cars and many armed 
rascals near the DMZ in the north of Kajon-ri, Inje County, 
Kangwon Province, South Korea. They also mobilized hundreds of 
armed rascals to Chungse-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon 
Province, South Korea, and were immersed in a war frenzy 
[chonjaeng kwanggirul puryossumnida]. 
  Meanwhile, the puppet army's fighter-bombers flew in 
formations in the skies above Changsin-ri and Haesang-ri, Kosong 
County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and were frenzied in 
ground striking aimed at the northern half of the Republic. 
Armed helicopters and transportation helicopters moved out in 
formations in the skies above Yonchon, Paju, and Hwachon and 
were frenzied in ground-attack supporting and air-borne 
operations exercises, flying at low and very low altitudes. 
  This worthless fire game [mumohan pulchangnan sodong] shows 
even more clearly the South Korean puppets' bellicose nature 
[hojongjok chongche].

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he and his cabinet will 
not do anything, including reversing the decision to ban British 
firms from new government contracts, until the British press 
learns to speak the truth. He said it is very difficult for the 
British press to report the truth. 
  He said Malaysia is not asking British Premier John Major to 
apologize or anyone else to do anything to solve the existing 
relations between the two countries. However, the prime 
minister said this is the time for the British press to do the 
right thing. 
  He was replying to questions posed by newsmen after 
attending 
the breaking of fast with the orphaned and handicapped children 
in Kuala Lumpur. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that the decision 
made in the cabinet meeting last Friday has nothing to do with 
the British Government, people, and its businessmen. 
  When asked about Major's statement that Malaysia is 
shortsighted and unjustified in banning British firms from new 
government contracts, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he will find 
out whether Major's statement was true or just misreported by 
the British press.

  [Text] Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the 
purchase of the Royal Malaysian Navy's frigates worth 1.2 
billion ringgit from a British company was a genuine 
value-for-money buy. Denying an allegation that the government 
had been ripped off by the company Yarrow Shipbuilders, he said 
as far as the armed forces was concerned, the purchase was 
within the requirement. 
  He said the contractor had quoted a figure of 1.4 billion 
ringgit, which was in line with the minister's evaluation of the 
market value. The proposed purchase included the weaponry 
systems fitted on the ship, which was almost equivalent to the 
type (Silver Creek) frigate, a bigger class frigate (?acquired) 
by Malaysia. 
  When the contract was signed, the pound sterling was at 3.7 
against the ringgit. Datuk Sri Najib said he had no (?clues) to 
seek legal action on the allegation made by the British 
opposition MP Stephen Byers, that Yarrow had ripped off the 
government. He was speaking to reporters after the ministry's

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 3 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday that a statement by 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd Wednesday confirmed that 
the British media actually published stories which were untrue 
and figments of the imagination to smear the name of Malaysian 
leaders. 
  Describing Hurd's statement to the House of Commons foreign 
affairs select committee as good, Abdullah said it confirmed 
Malaysia's view that the British media did not have an 
understanding of what it reported. 
  He (Hurd), therefore, understands why Malaysia had to take 
such action (to stop awarding any more government contracts to 
British companies), Abdullah told reporters. 
  Hurd was reported to have said that the British media 
reports 
on the Pergau dam and claims related to it were creatures of 
fancy and that many of those who write evidently live far from 
the real world in which we want Britain to thrive. 
  Hurd had also described the British media allegations 
against 
the dam project as swirls of speculative allegations with no 
connection with the Pergau project. He had also said that the 
British media allegations had severly damaged British interests, 
particularly in trade. 
  The Malaysian Government announced last Friday that the 
cabinet had decided to stop awarding any more government 
contracts to British companies following allegations the British 
media had hurled incessantly at Malaysian leaders, including 
Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's 
official visit to the Philippines, the first by a Malaysian 
premier to that country, is already yielding results. The 
Philippine Government is keen and serious about enhancing trade 
relations with Malaysia. And this should be the case with 
[words indistinct] ASEAN. In response to Dr. Mahathir and his 
delegation's visit to the Philippines in February, a 
high-powered multimember delegation from the Philippines paid a 
two-day visit last weekend to the Federal Territory of Labuan 
off the East Malaysian state of Sabah. The Philippine delegation 
was truly interested in knowing more about the development of 
Labuan as an offshore financial center and also about foreign 
investment opportunities in both the East Malaysian states of 
Sabah and Sarawak. What is encouraging is that the visit showed 
the commitment of the Philippine Government to the development 
of the East ASEAN Growth Area. The visiting mission was given a 
detailed briefing on the investment opportunities available in 
Labuan as well as in Sabah and Sarawak. 
  It is noteworthy that the Philippine delegation's visit was 
the first by a well-represented government and private sector 
mission from that country. What seemed to interest them was the 
function of Labuan as an international offshore financial 
center, or IOFC. The delegation included a group of bankers who 
appreciated the IOFC concept being adopted in Labuan. The 
president of the Philippine National Bank has been quoted as 
saying his bank was considering setting up an offshore bank in 
Labuan. The bank would like to finalize joint financial 
undertakings not only with the Malaysian Government but also 
with the private sector. 
  Cooperation between the Philippines and Malaysia is 
certainly 
on the way up. One of Malaysia's leading companies is currently 
involved in the development of infrastructure in the 
Philippines. Malaysian participation in the power supply, stock 
development, and telecommunication sector will also be welcomed 
in the Philippines. [Words indistinct], both countries can help 
each other to promote their respective tourism industry. The 
idea of setting up a regional air link needs serious 
consideration. The visit by the Philippine president, Fidel 
Ramos, to Malaysia last year and the reciprocal visit by Dr. 
Mahathir have opened the way for increased cooperation between 
the two ASEAN partners. The private sector of the two countries 
should take this opportunity to go into joint ventures for their 
mutual benefit.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Major can help break impasse"] </F>
  [Text] It was inevitable that Malaysia should have reacted 
angrily to British newspaper allegations that there was 
something underhand about the deals involving the Pergau Dam and 
the purchase of British military equipment. The British Audit 
Office may have indeed concluded that the Pergau Dam would not 
be an economic proposition and should not be built. But it is 
for Malaysians to decide. Malaysia has brilliant think tanks, 
an effective parliamentary opposition, and a highly vocal 
environmental lobby. The British certainly don't have any 
special wisdom that has missed all of them. Nor should British 
papers assume that concessionary loan arrangements in return for 
purchase of warplanes and contracts for major development 
projects are unusual. If such linkages are prohibited in 
Britain, that is for the British Government to answer. It has 
nothing to do with Malaysia. And there is simply no link 
between these deals and the BMF [Bumiputera Finance] affair. In 
fact, it says something about the British press that it has only 
now discovered that scandal. Carrian [company] collapsed a 
decade ago. All the BMF offences were committed in colonial 
Hongkong. Most of the people involved remain in the British 
colony's jurisdiction. London has seen it fit to grant Lorraine 
Osman [former BMF official] residence in Britain after he served 
a short sentence in a plea bargain deal. British newspapers 
could still demand an accounting, if they are so inclined. 
Britain could set up a full inquiry into the affair and 
override colonial inhibitions. Instead, British papers dredge up 
some old BMF stories and link it tenuously to the Pergau Dam 
payments. 
  Truth to tell, the British newspapers have their own 
political agenda: they want to bring down John Major and the 
Tory government. The editors feel that the Conservatives have 
been in power too long. Some of them also feel that Major's 
government has been dishonest in telling them Britain would 
never deal with terrorists while holding secret negotiations 
with the Irish Republican Army. Mr. Major's Back-To-Basics 
policy has also gone seriously awry. It was meant to distract 
attention away from high unemployment and other economic woes. 
The Tory right wanted to use it to punish single mothers and 
others living off social welfare. Unfortunately, the British 
press decided that Tory politicians should be held to the same 
moral standards that they prescribe for others. The result was a 
series of embarrassing disclosures for Mr. Major. The Pergau 
Dam and the arms deal has become yet another bludgeon against 
Mr. Major. 
  None of this would have bothered Malaysia except that in the 
process the British papers began to attack Mahathir Mohamed 
personally, without a shred of evidence. It was too much. But 
a shutout of British firms from future government contracts is a 
very blunt instrument of retaliation indeed. It punishes the 
wrong people. More importantly, it dilutes the principles of 
free trade and competition. On his part, Mr. Major should help 
to limit the damage to British industry. Of course, he has no 
control over the British press. He should, however, officially 
disassociate his government from these scurrilous reports. It 
may only be a simple symbolic act but it might help to break thc 
impasse.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Waiting for GSP Extension"] </F>
  [Text] The United States government's decision to grant 
Indonesia another six months in which to improve the protection 
of its workers rights before deciding whether to extend or with 
draw its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) surely portends 
an eventually satisfactory solution to that issue. We, thus 
feel that we can rest assured that the American government will 
opt for the most rational measure to maintain good, productive 
relations and mutual understanding with Indonesia. 
  Extending the validity of the GSP facility seems to be the 
best alternative, seen from at least two major points of view. 
  First of all, now is the worst time for the U.S. to pick a 
fight with Indonesia, the chair of the Nonaligned Movement, 
which will host the next annual summit of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum in November. Withdrawal of the GSP 
facility not only would unnecessarily become a thorn in the side 
of the otherwise good and mature relations between the two 
countries but also would be counter-productive to the United 
States' noble objective of helping improve human and workers' 
rights. 
  The Indonesian Government which has now become increasingly 
assertive in international fora, obviously dreads the political 
more than the economic impact of the stoppage of the facility. 
After all, the $650 million worth of exports that it might lose 
with the GSP withdrawal would only make a small dent in its 
total exports of more than $30 billion. What would hurt most 
would be the "political slap in the face" of a government which 
has been priding itself on many internationally-acclaimed 
development achievements. 
  However, the most important point is the fact that the 
Indonesian Government has fully understood the message of the 
United States' threat to withdraw the GSP facility. The 
government has been making concerted efforts to improve the 
protection of workers' rights. The trade union movement has 
been restructured to make it a more effective forum for the 
protection of those rights. The decree that allowed military 
intervention to break strikes has been revoked and the minimum 
daily wages have been increased. 
  The government may perhaps violate the International Labor 
Organization's convention by allowing only one trade union but 
that, we think, is not "the end of the world" in terms of the 
workers' plight. In fact, that issue is more political in 
nature than it is economic. 
  In a country where millions of people are fully unemployed 
and over 30 million are under-employed, the political right to 
organize is certainly not top priority in the agenda for the 
protection of workers' rights. [sentence as published] 
  What the government has been doing to force employers to 
improve the lot of their workers counts much more than the mere 
existence of hundreds of trade unions, which are either impotent 
or technically incompetent to negotiate anything economically 
viable with powerful employers, or which are simply 
trigger-happy bodies ready to resort to strikes anytime they 
want to demand something. 
  Obviously, the protection of workers' rights should not be 
seen nor undertaken as a oneshot measure, but should be treated 
as an ongoing process, which follows the stages of economic 
development and which should take into account the international 
market competition. 
  It would be futile or even disastrous to the economic 
stability of this nation if the government, under strong 
pressure from outside, enforced minimum wages at such high 
levels it might drive many employers into bankruptcy. 
  We fully understand that a facility or trade privilege, such 
as GSP, normally imposes certain economic and political 
requirements. But the enforcement of such requirements should 
take into account what is economically and politically feasible 
in the country beneficiary at a particular period of time and 
what should be postponed until a more appropriate time rolls 
around.

  [Text] Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said that a total 
of around Rp. [Rupiah] 371.2 trillion in investment funds was 
successfully collected under the Repelita V [Fifth 5-Year 
Development Plan] (1989-1994) or 55.3 percent higher than the 
target of Rp. 239.1 trillion during the same period. 
  The investment funds intended comprised public investment of 
around Rp. 270.4 trillion or about 105 percent higher than the 
target of Rp. 131.8 trillion and government investment of Rp. 
100.9 trillion or six percent lower than the projected Rp. 107.5 
trillion. 
  As such, the role of public investment during the period 
intended was bigger than the role of the government investment. 
If the target of investment which was projected under the 
Repelita V comprised public sector (55 percent) and government 
sector of 45 percent, the realisation of the comparison was 
estimated to change into 72.8 percent (public sector) compared 
to the government sector of 27.2 percent. It was also projected 
that the public sector's role will increase to around 75 percent 
compared to the government sector's sector [as published] of 26 
percent under the Repelita VI (1994-1999). 
  Mar'ie Muhammad made the remark when explaining the results 
which had been achieved during the Repelita V period in a 
working meeting with the State Budgetary (APBN) Commission of 
the House of Representative (DPR) which was led by the 
commission's chairman, Drs. [academic title] Afif Mar'uf, here 
on Friday. To last until February 22, the meeting constitutes 
the third phase of discussion concerning the draft of the 
1993-1995 budget year between the government and DPR. Bill for 
the 1994-1995 budget year between the government and DPR. 
  Furthermore, the minister said the source of financing 
development which was originally from home savings reached 
around Rp. 341.7 trillion under the Repelita V or about 92 
percent out of the whole source for the financing of 
development. While the total of foreign loans during the same 
period was estimated to reach only Rp. 29.6 trillion or about 18 
percent out of the total source. 
  Mar'ie said the success of development in Repelita VI did 
not 
close the fact that there were obstacles which need to be coped 
with in facing the implementation of the national development in 
the future. "Parallel with it, the development also creates 
various problems and new challenges which are not taken into 
account before," he said. 
  Mar'ie went on to say that the policy and development 
programmes which will be applied under the Repelita VI will be 
directed to the utilisation and development maximumly the 
available development potential as well as taking benefits of 
every opportunity both at home and abroad by constantly paying 
attention to the obstacles which might be faced. [sentence as 
published] 
  He explained the success of development under the Repelita V 
because the government and DPR shared the same opinion that the 
results which had been achieved during the Repelita V will 
become one of the basis in deciding the steps which will be 
taken in effort to achieve the target of economic macro [as 
published] under Repelita Vl. 
  Touching on foreign loan which was projected to reach about 
Rp. 10.012 billion under the 1994-1995 budget year, Mar'ie said 
that around 72 percent out of the total intended will constitute 
assistance for government projects, 26 percent for export credit 
and around 2 percent for technical assistance. The foreign loan 
intended, among other things, will have no political connection, 
while the amount of foreign loan is adjusted with the capability 
to repay in the future," Mar'ie said.

  [Text] Jakarta, Mar 2 (ANTARA) -- The Attorney General's 
Office Wednesday denied allegations that "political intrigue" 
was behind its current investigations of the Bapindo [Indonesian 
Development Bank] bad debt case. 
  The office's chief information officer, Dr. Suparman Sh 
[Master of Law], in a talk with newsmen here also dismissed as 
untrue suggestions that it was conducting the enquiry "under 
pressure". 
  "What we are investigating now is a pure penal case and 
there 
is no political intrigue behind it nor are we being pressured by 
anyone," he said. 
  However, he said he could not guarantee that the case would 
remain a pure penal case. "Nobody can be sure that the case will 
remain so," he said. 
  Suparman also refuted media reports criticizing the Attorney 
General's Office for allegedly not being very objective in 
deciding who had to be subjected to questioning in connection 
with the Bapindo credit scam. 
  "We are not discriminative in our investigations. If to date 
we have detained only two persons this is merely in accord with 
the evidence collected so far," he said. 
  Since the inquiry of the case began the Attorney General's 
Office has detained two persons, namely E.T., chairman of GKG 
[Golden Key Group] group of companies and Sup, former deputy 
head of Bapindo's Kuningan branch office. 
  A number of other persons often mentioned in the media as 
being most probably involved in the case, have so far not been 
arrested. 
  Suparman said in conducting the inquiry into the Bapindo bad 
debt case the Attorney General's office was sticking strictly to 
the penal code (KUHP), other relevant laws and regulations as 
well as banking laws. 
  He called on the public to observe self-restraint in making 
comments on the on-going investigations of the case, saying that 
comments not based on precise knowledge of the matters at hand 
would only mislead society. 
  Meanwhile E.T. was today again interrogated by Attorney 
General's Office investigators. 
  On Tuesday Kusno Aksan, a top management officer of three 
companies owned by E.T., was questioned by Attorney General's 
Office agents as a material witness.

  [Text] Vientiane, March 3 (KPL) -- Brigadier General 
Douangchai Phichit, secretary of the Lao-Thai Border Security 
and Order Commission, February 28, informed KPL correspondent 
that the news that Thai authority is charging and trying to 
apprehend former army generals of the old Vientiane regime -- 
Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun -- was welcomed in Laos, 
adding that this was a good omen for the increasing relations 
between the two neighbours. 
  The two men were charged and sentenced as enemies of the 
nation and sentenced in absentia by the present regime following 
the establishment of the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] 
in 1975. The men and their followers were recently charged by 
the Thai authority for generating threat to security in Thailand 
by destabilising security and order along the Lao-Thai border 
with an intent to overthrow the regime of the Lao PDR, thus 
jeopardising the relations of good neighbours between Laos and 
Thailand, particularly threatening those living along the border. 
  Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit said that the bilateral 
relations lately have seen marked progress, particularly since 
the first through third meetings of the Joint Cooperation 
Committee for Border Security and Order. This has created 
favourable conditions for making the two countries's border a 
border of peace and friendship. He pointed out that joint border 
committees have been created in several places and memoranda of 
understanding have been signed. One of the tasks of these 
committees is to weed out bad elements that wish to create 
trouble and destabilise the situation. 
  He concluded by hoping that the Thai authority will take 
appropriate measures to deal not only with Vang Pao and Thonglit 
Chokbengboun but others whose intention is to disturb peace and 
security along the Lao-Thai border.

  [Text] This morning in Vientiane capital, Khamphoui 
Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister and chairman of the 
Committee for Planning and Cooperation, received a courtesy call 
from Victor Khlystun, minister of agriculture and foodstuffs of 
the Russian Federation and chairman of the Russian-Lao 
Governmental Committee on Economic, Trade, Scientific, and 
Technical Cooperation, and his entourage. 
  The deputy prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic hailed the visit by the Russian delegation, noting that 
it serves to further promote and strengthen the long-standing 
solidarity, friendship, and cooperation between Laos and Russia. 
  Earlier on the evening of 1 March at Lan Xang hotel in 
Vientiane capital, a ceremony was held to sign a memorandum 
between the Lao and Russian Governmental Commissions on the 
Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation and a 
cooperation agreement between the Lao National Council of Trade 
and Industry and the Russian Council of Trade and Industry. 
Signing the documents on the expansion of Lao-Russian 
cooperation on investment for the Lao side were Sompadit 
Volasan, minister of trade and chairman of the Lao commission; 
and Sisouk Sisombat, chairman of the Lao National Council of 
Trade and Industry. Signing for the Russian side were Victor 
Khlystun, minister of agriculture and foodstuffs and chairman of 
the Russian commission; and (Gennadiy Roskoskov), trade 
representative of the Russian Federation to Laos. According to 
the two documents, the two sides have agreed to render immediate 
assistance to organizations concerned to set up a joint 
Lao-Russian business venture on the basis of the laws of each 
country. The Russian side expressed their readiness to study 
proposals to ensure the normal operations of all business 
enterprises and projects set up during the period of technical 
assistance provided by the former Soviet Union. As for 
scientific and technical cooperation, the Lao side reaffirmed 
its readiness to set up scientific and technical cooperation 
with Russia on the basis of the utilization of its own natural 
resources, technical lessons from Russian, and funds from third 
countries, the IMF, and interested businessmen. The fundamental 
task of this cooperation program is the protection of the 
environment, the conservation and restoration of forests, the 
raising of the level of harvest efficiency, the eradication of 
crop pests, and mining and exploration.

  [Text] Vientiane, March 2 (KPL) -- The latest development 
cooperation report to be compiled by the United Nations 
Development Programme [UNDP] has been released. 
  The report, which contains information and analysis of the 
sources and uses of external assistance to the Lao PDR [People's 
Democratic Republic] for 1992, estimates a total of U.S. $167.3 
million -- 6 percent less than the amount of U.S. $177.3 million 
development assistance registered the year before, indicated the 
UNDP press release. 
  It is estimated that approximately 55 percent of the total 
government budget for 1992 was funded through external 
assistance inflows. 
  The bulk of this development assistance, U.S. $88.6 million 
or 52.9 percent, originated from multilateral sources, mostly in 
the form of concessional loans. 
  UNDP or UNDP-administered funds, amounting to U.S. $11.9 
million or 7.1 percent of the total, provided the largest 
multilateral source of outright grants. 
  Among the bilateral donors, Japan and Sweden were the major 
sources of aid, each disbursing over U.S. $22 million or 13 
percent of the total. 
  The 24 non-governmental organisations engaged in development 
and humanitarian activities in the Lao PDR in 1992 reported a 
total disbursement of U.S. 6.3 million (3.8 percent). 
  In 1992 the transport sector became the top aid recipient 
(23.7 percent of the total), followed by economic management 
(19.9 percent) and agriculture, forestry and fisheries (16.8 
percent). The communications sector also received a substantial 
share with 10.4 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade 
official said Thursday a revival by U.S. President Bill Clinton 
of the so-called "Super 301" provision threatens to shrink world 
trade and urged the U.S. Administration to "act sensibly." 
  Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and 
industry, speaking at a regular press conference, made the 
warning following news reports that Clinton is ready to 
reinstate the controversial trade law, which would give him 
broad authority to impose retaliatory sanctions against Japan 
over trade disputes. 
  "Such a unilateral approach to solving trade disputes will 
result in a shrinkage of world trade. From the viewpoint of 
GATT rules, a revival would be problematic," Kumano said. 
  U.S. dailies, including THE NEW YORK TIMES, reported 
Wednesday that Clinton has decided to reinstate the "Super 301" 
provision of the 1988 trade law by executive order. 
  "Japan is cautiously watching the U.S. move. The U.S. should 
act sensibly," Kumano said.

  [Text] Nagoya, March 3 KYODO -- A Japanese business leader 
said Thursday [3 March] it will take time for Japan's economy to 
recover while admitting that some positive economic signs like 
housing construction have emerged. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), said, "it is hard to tell whether 
Japan's economy is at this stage capable of rapidly recovering. 
We have problems like the yen's surge and asset deflation." 
  Referring to reports that the United States may revive its 
Super 301 trade legislation, Hiraiwa said, "I hope the U.S. 
will not take such punitive measures against Japan." He said 
that instead "Japan needs to carry out practical and concrete 
steps...to stimulate domestic demand, relax various government 
regulations, and open up its markets."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan has sent to U.S. 
trade officials letters refuting their claims that past 
bilateral trade agreements have not served to open Japan's 
markets, a Japanese trade official said Thursday. 
  In letters sent to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
and other U.S. officials, the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry insisted that many pacts have worked well on 
raising imports of U.S. products, the official said. These 
letters point to the fact that Japan's imports of U.S. beef 
nearly doubled in 1992 from 1988 following a bilateral trade 
agreement and that the ratio of foreign products to government 
purchases of computers climbed to 18.9 percent in fiscal 1992 
from 8.8 percent in fiscal 1991. 
  Also cited in these letters are statistics showing an 
increase in sales of imported autos in defiance of a general 
market slump and progress in cooperation between Japanese and 
U.S. firms in boosting the U.S. share in Japan's chip market. 
In bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the United States 
has insisted past trade pacts have not worked well because of a 
lack of objective criteria.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher will hold talks separately with Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on 
March 10, a senior Foreign Ministry source said Thursday [3 
March]. 
  Trade problems between Japan and the United States are 
expected to be high on the agenda for the talks, government 
sources said. 
  Christopher and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner will 
participate the same day in security consultations with Hata and 
Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, the ministry source 
said. 
  The consultations are expected to take up matters pertaining 
to the bilateral alliance and the issue of North Korea's nuclear 
program. 
  Christopher, who arrives in Japan on March 9 on a 
four-nation 
trip to Asia and Australia, is also expected to attend a meeting 
in Tokyo of the International Committee on Reconstruction of 
Cambodia (ICORC). 
  The secretary of state said in an interview Wednesday that 
he 
expects political and security ties between the U.S. and Japan 
will remain intact despite bilateral trade woes. 
  "Our relationship on the first two aspects is excellent and 
I 
would not expect it to be negatively affected by the economic 
matters we are going to be discussing or economic actions to be 
taken," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Pollees who consider 
Japan-U.S. relations to be good plunged to a record low of 20 
percent, down from 37 percent two months earlier, an ASAHI 
SHIMBUN poll released Thursday showed. 
  Those who do not consider the bilateral relations to be good 
increased to 64 percent, from 42 percent in December last year, 
the ASAHI said. 
  In the survey, 16 percent, down from the previous 26 
percent, 
said the bilateral relations will head in a good direction, 
while 23 percent predicted relations would head in a bad 
direction. 
  As for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's refusal to accept 
the U.S. demand for numerical targets to measure the degree of 
openness of the Japanese market, voiced during a summit meeting 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton last month, 20 percent said the 
action was only natural, 57 percent said it was unavoidable, and 
12 percent said it was not good. 
  The ASAHI conducted the survey on February 27 and 28, 
polling 
3,000 people aged 20 and older, of whom 2,318 people responded.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry will 
send a senior official early next week to Detroit to tell U.S. 
automakers what to do to facilitate the flow of U.S. autos into 
the Japanese market, officials said Thursday [3 March]. 
  The United States has criticized Japan's automotive 
standards 
and certification system as an import barrier, and called for an 
immediate removal of the barrier. 
  The officials said there are two methods of certification 
for 
foreign cars -- one method being a one-by-one certification of 
imported autos and the other a blanket certification of imported 
autos of the same type. 
  If a foreign automaker is to ensure blanket certification, 
it 
will have to file with the ministry for designation of autos of 
the same type, the officials said. 
  If a foreign automaker wins type designation for a certain 
type of auto, the cost of bringing such autos into Japan is 
lower and the formalities involved are much simpler, they said. 
  Thus, most of the autos imported from Europe are covered by 
the type designation system, while most of the U.S. automakers 
have not utilized the system. 
  The ministry is sending Hideaki Mukaiyama, vice minister for 
international affairs, to Detroit next Tuesday to encourage U.S. 
automakers to utilize the system. 
  The ministry is due to station a consul at the Japanese 
Consulate General in Detroit from April to help U.S. automakers 
win type designation for their autos.

  [Text] Nagoya, March 3 KYODO -- Japan's largest auto 
manufacturer Toyota Motor Corp. will probably announce a 
vountary target of purchasing a six billion dollar U.S.-made 
auto parts in fiscal 1996, industrial sources said Thursday [3 
March]. 
  Other automakers are likely to follow suit in an apparent 
effort to break an impasse in trade talks between Japan and the 
United States, the sources added. 
  Japan's 11 auto makers pledged to buy U.S. auto parts worth 
19 billion dollars in fiscal 1994 as part of efforts to reduce 
Japan's huge trade surplus when then U.S. President Gerge Bush 
visited Tokyo in 1992. 
  Earlier in the day, Toyota Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda showed 
a 
positive stance on setting a voluntary target for imports of 
U.S. auto parts. 
  Toyoda suggested at a news conference that the Japanese side 
could propose the voluntary target on condition that the U.S. 
does not take a retaliatory measure if Japanese automakers fail 
to realize such an objective. 
  Toyoda said the auto manufacturers of Japan and the U.S. are 
on good terms, adding it is better to set a voluntary target 
than to damage the relations between them. 
  The economic relations between Japan and the U.S. have been 
strained since February 11 when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach agreement on a 
U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to gauge the openness 
of Japanese markets to American products. 
  The bilateral trade negotiations have centered on four 
fields 
-- autos and auto parts, medical equipment, telecommunications 
products and insurance services. 
  On Wednesday, Clinton indicated that he will soon revive the 
super 301 provision of the 1988 omnibus trade act, which would 
allow for retaliatory measures against countries deemed to be 
engaging in unfair trade practices. 
  Toyoda has been named new chairman of the Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren) to replace Gaishi Hiraiwa, 
chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co.

  [Text] Sendai, March 3 KYODO -- Japanese apple growers 
outraged over the expected opening of the market to apples from 
the United States staged a protest rally in Sendai on Thursday[3 
March], warning that cheap imports would result in the collapse 
of domestic production. 
  Tokuei Kimura, chairman of the Apple Growers' Association of 
top-producing Aomori Prefecture, accused the government of 
neglecting domestic producers by lifting the ban without taking 
sufficient precautions. 
  "The current quarantine system does not prevent infested 
imports," Kimura told some 500 apple growers from all over the 
nation. 
  Following the rally the apple growers staged a demonstration 
in the city center. 
  Tokyo officially opened its apple market in 1971 but 
continued to ban imports from the U.S., saying there was not 
enough proof they do not carry insects or viruses. 
  A similar ban on apples from New Zealand was lifted last 
June 
on grounds that they meet quarantine regulations. Frustrated 
U.S. growers have said they would seek trade sanctions against 
Japan. 
  In an effort to end the decades-long apple dispute, Tokyo 
said it would import U.S. apples from this fall at the earliest 
following a revision of quarantine checks.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan will urge China 
through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to cut 
its tariffs and open its markets to foreign products, government 
officials said Thursday [3 March]. 
  The requests will be included in a list of recommendations 
Japan will submit to a GATT working committee to help China join 
GATT at an early stage, as it hopes to, the officials said. The 
committee opens a meeting in Geneva on March 15. 
  China, on receiving such recommendations from GATT member 
nations, is expected to submit a list of proposed tariff cuts to 
GATT by next summer. 
  Under an agreement reached last year at the Uruguay Round of 
global trade talks, Japan is to cut its tariffs by an average 
1.5 percent and the United States and European nations are to 
reduce theirs by 3.0 percent. 
  China's high tariffs have hindered its admission to GATT. 
  The Chinese tariffs are believed to average more than 40 
percent, although China itself puts the average at 22 percent. 
  The Japanese-proposed tariff cuts for China are expected to 
cover hundreds of items, including automobiles, machinery and 
electronics products, the officials said. 
  The World Trade Organization (WTO), which is to replace GATT 
in January 1995, is expected to impose stricter conditions for 
admission than GATT. 
  All GATT members, however, will be allowed to join the WTO.

an unidentified NHK reporter on 2 March; place not given; from 
the "NHK News 7" program; NHK announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata reads 
report in Japanese; Zhu Rongji answers questions in Mandarin 
with Japanese captions -- passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] PRC Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is 
visiting Japan at the invitation of the Foreign Ministry, gave 
an interview to NHK. This interview was the first exclusive 
interview with a foreign news media after he took up the post of 
vice premier. 
  During the interview, Zhu expressed great expectations for 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China scheduled for 
19 March. He cited concrete figures when discussing the focal 
issues of anti-inflation measures, future problems in the 
Chinese economy, and relations with Japan, giving an in-depth 
account of PRC's policy thinking as the highest responsible 
official for China's economic reform. 
<H5>  Impression of His Visit to Japan </H5>
  [Zhu] "I feel that friendship and cooperation between China 
and Japan and between the Chinese and Japanese people have 
struck roots in the hearts of people here and have become a 
trend sweeping across Japan. I feel that this kind of thinking 
will not change, no matter how the Japanese political situation 
develops and what happens in the rest of the world." 
<H5>  Prime Minister Hosokawa's Visit to China </H5>
  [Zhu] "We and Prime Minister Hosokawa have decided through 
discussion that the prime minister will visit China in mid- and 
late March. We have long since made active preparations to 
welcome Prime Minister Hosokawa. President Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Li Peng are looking forward to holding fruitful talks 
with him in Beijing." 
  [Announcer] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also a member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau, was promoted 
from his position as mayor of Shanghai three years ago for his 
outstanding economic abilities. He has since been in charge of 
the economic reforms advocated by Deng Xiaoping. 
  Discussing the problems and prospects of economic reforms, 
for which he is the key leader, Zhu said, the Chinese economy 
will be able to continue its rapid growth. He expressed 
confidence in dealing with the crucial anti-inflation measures. 
He said: 
  [Zhu] "Inflation was caused by excessive increase in 
investment, which was not healthy, and by reform of our price 
structure. The latter was an extremely important factor. Last 
year, we lifted control of the prices of grain and most of the 
capital goods. This could not but cause price increases. 
However, this kind of reform is essential to instituting a 
market economy. With the adoption of price-stabilizing measures, 
I believe this year's inflation rate can be kept below 10 
percent. Asia, and China in particular, is witnessing the 
fastest economic growth in the world today. I believe that 
strengthening economic cooperation with China and with other 
parts of Asia will not only contribute to economic prosperity in 
the region, but will also help Japan in its economic 
readjustment and accelerate its economic revitalization. I feel 
this is something worth considering." 
  [Announcer] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who has been in Japan 
since 23 February, extended his stay by one day, and is 
scheduled to return home the day after tomorrow [4 March].

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan's exports of 
completed cars to China are increasing dramatically ahead of 
customs duties to be slapped on imports of autos by foreign 
firms, industry sources said Thursday [3 March]. 
  Foreign companies in China "are rushing to buy foreign cars 
before the duty is imposed," an official at Nissan Motor Co. 
said. 
  "But the boom will be short-lived. After the duties are 
slapped on in April, shipments will plunge," he said. 
  In January, the Chinese Government decided to impose a 
uniform 110 percent custom duty on cars to be purchased by both 
domestic and foreign companies. The latter have up to now been 
allowed to import cars duty-free. 
  Under the tax reforms, import licenses issued last year will 
be extended to the end of March. This gave foreign firms 
operating in China a three-month grace period to import 
duty-free cars. 
  Nissan shipped some 2,700 vehicles to China in January, more 
than double the number for December. 
  Mazda Motor Corp.'s exports have doubled since December to 
some 250 vehicles a month, according to the industry sources. 
  The Chinese import boom has helped Japanese automakers 
reduce 
their inventories of completed vehicles by more than two-thirds 
from 20,000 at the worst stage last year, they added.

pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon) said Thursday. 
  In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Ho Chong-man, vice 
chairman of Chongnyon's Central Standing Committee, said he met 
the younger Kim during a visit to North Korea in late February 
and also saw him horse riding. Ho dismissed press reports in 
February that Kim had sustained serious injuries. 
  Ho said he met Kim on the afternoon of February 28. It was 
Ho's fifth meeting with Kim. 
  Kim told him that North Korea highly appreciates its 
agreement with the United States over international inspections 
of North Korean nuclear sites. Ho said Kim told him North Korea 
"honors its promises." 
  Ho said he met Kim in Pyongyang and later encountered him 
outside the capital where he saw him riding a white horse and 
accompanied by several high-ranking government officials. He 
said Kim stopped and asked him to join him in horse riding. But 
Ho said that after he explained he did not know how to ride a 
horse, Kim rode away at the head of a group of riders on three 
other horses along a seven- to eight-kilometer country track. 
  Ho said he was fully aware of the reports that Kim had been 
injured but said he could see no sign of injury during his 
discussions and walks with Kim. He said Kim appeared robust and 
slimmer than when they previously met. 
  At a dinner reception in the evening, Kim said North Korea 
"is conducting diplomacy of its own volition on an equal footing 
with the United States." 
  The U.S. and North Korea agreed last Friday at a 
working-level meeting in New York that Pyongyang would resume 
dialogue with South Korea and fully implement International 
Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its seven declared nuclear 
plants.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) issued a warning to 12 agricultural cooperatives Thursday 
[3 March] about their suspected pressuring of wholesalers to 
keep high the prices of rice offered on the free market in 1990 
and 1991. 
  FTC officials said the commission suspects the cooperatives 
directed wholesalers to adopt certain prices and volumes with 
the aim of sustaining the price of rice not subject to 
government control. 
  It is the first time for the commission to issue a warning 
in 
a case involving rice deals. 
  A system of bidding for free-market rice was initiated in 
1990 but the auctions have been suspended since last fall 
because last year's harvest was the worst in the postwar period 
and foreign-grown rice had to be imported on an emergency basis. 
  Agricultural cooperatives, which virtually monopolize the 
supply of domestic rice, allegedly decided the prices and 
volumes of rice put up for auction on the free market during the 
first two years. 
  Most of Japan's rice is bought by the government from 
cooperatives at highly subsidized prices and sold to the public 
at government-set prices. 
  Some of the cooperatives are suspected of promising 
kickbacks 
to wholesalers under the guise of sales promotion expenses in 
return for making higher bid prices, the officials said. 
  In the wake of higher-than-expected prices in the bidding 
for 
rice in 1990 and 1991, the commission started investigations 
into agricultural cooperatives and wholesales nationwide and 
determined they had violated the Antimonopoly Law, the officials 
said. 
  The cooperatives cautioned by the commission are located in 
Akita and Niigata Prefectures, northern Japan, where popular 
brands of rice like Koshihikari and Sasanishiki are produced. 
  About four million tons of rice are allowed every year to be 
traded outside of government price control. 
  The prices of one million tons of this rice are set through 
auctions in local rice markets nationwide and the prices of the 
remainder are decided in direct deals between the national 
federation of agricultural cooperative associations and 
wholesalers.

<F P=106> [News conference with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa by </F>
unidentified domestic correspondents at the prime minister's 
official residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified dean of the press corps] As dean of 
the press corps, I will ask the first questions. This news 
conference is scheduled to last for approximately 20 minutes. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, you have decided to put off a reshuffle 
of your cabinet. Mr. Prime Minister, I would ask you why you 
have decided to put off a reshuffle of your cabinet. Mr. Prime 
Minister, you have stated that your government will shift from a 
government for political reform to a government for economic 
reform and that you will work with this shift in mind. Mr. 
Prime Minister, you have had difficulty handling the issue of 
replacing the chief cabinet secretary. How are you going to 
deal with these issues? 
  [Hosokawa] I have caused the people great worries. Yesterday 
and today, I met with leaders of the ruling coalition parties to 
ask them about their respective intraparty situation and their 
views on the cabinet reshuffle. As you just said, I have worked 
on political reform as a major item on my domestic policy agenda 
for the past seven months since my government was inaugurated 
last August. During that period, I have worked to deal with the 
Uruguay Round and with a package of economic stimulus measures 
and with the Japanese-U.S. framework talks. I think that all of 
these have been major policy tasks for me. 
  Although the legislation for political reform has yet to be 
completed, I think that in general, my government has completed 
its first phase. From this point forward, my government will 
enter its second phase. I think that during the first phase, my 
government pushed for political reform. In the second phase, my 
government will deal with Japanese-U.S. economic frictions and 
will work on deregulation, which I believe is related to 
Japanese-U.S. relations. Because of different tasks, the nature 
of the government needs to be changed. In this context, I think 
now is the time for a cabinet reshuffle. I officially mentioned 
the issue of reshuffling my cabinet yesterday for the first 
time. The issue of reshuffling my cabinet has been reported. 
  I yesterday met with leaders of the ruling coalition parties 
to ask their views on a cabinet reshuffle for the first time. I 
met with them yesterday and today to ask their views. I have 
realized through a series of meetings with the leaders of the 
ruling coalition parties that I should not do what might cause a 
rift within the coalition government. Other leaders of the 
ruling coalition parties said that it is not good to give the 
impression that I am trying to oust a specific cabinet member. 
In short, many leaders of the ruling coalition parties 
expressed their opinion that the most important thing is to hold 
the coalition government together. 
  I and many leaders of the ruling coalition parties have 
considered the need to make the prime minister's official 
residence function smoothly. As for the issue of replacing the 
chief cabinet secretary, who plays the key role in the prime 
minister's official residence, I have been concerned that the 
ruling coalition parties have reacted against the chief cabinet 
secretary's behavior. The chief cabinet secretary has worked 
hard to support me. 
  There is the opinion that although Mr. Takemura is the head 
of Sakigake [Harbinger], he should concentrate on his duties as 
chief cabinet secretary. I said this straightforwardly to Mr. 
Takemura today and asked him to take this into account. I asked 
him to concentrate on his duties as chief cabinet secretary. 
Needless to say, the duties of the chief cabinet secretary are 
to coordinate views among the ruling coalition parties as well 
as the opposition parties. I asked Mr. Takemura to concentrate 
his efforts on coordinating views within the ruling coalition 
parties on economic issues including Japanese-U.S. economic 
frictions, which are emerging as a major item on the agenda of 
my government. In response, Mr. Takemura told me that he fully 
understood what I asked of him and that he will carry out his 
duties keeping in mind what I have asked of him. As I said just 
a while ago, in giving importance to the unity of the ruling 
parties, I have decided to postpone a cabinet reshuffle. 
  [Reporter] You just said that you have postponed carrying 
out a cabinet reshuffle at this point, but did you discuss with 
the leaders of the coalition parties the possibility of 
reshuffling the cabinet in the future, for example, after the 
Diet passes the budget bill? 
  [Hosokawa] No, I did not. 
  [Reporter] You mentioned the treatment of the chief cabinet 
secretary. Does your decision to postpone a cabinet reshuffle 
mean that you will not remove Mr. Takemura from his post? 
  [Hosokawa] That is correct. 
  [Reporter] It may not be an appropriate expression, but from 
what you have said, I understand that Mr. Takemura will not 
resign voluntarily. Is my understanding correct? 
  [Hosokawa] I believe that he will not resign voluntarily. 
  [Reporter] You have planned to establish a new ministerial 
post in charge of deregulation and to carry out a reorganization 
of the cabinet to transform it into an economic reform 
government. Thus, are you considering reshuffling the cabinet 
around May? 
  [Hosokawa] I am not thinking about doing that so far. 
However, because, as I said earlier, the government has to deal 
with issues with a particular emphasis on economic problems, I 
would like to tackle those issues by taking the initiative. 
  [Reporter] You mentioned that your relations with Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Takemura are not smooth. He is not attending 
this news conference. Do you think that you will be able to 
improve relations concerning the operations of the cabinet over 
the next several months? 
  [Hosokawa] He was originally scheduled to attend this news 
conference, but I told him that it was better for him not to 
attend because he was the person to be discussed. I would not 
mind his attending, but because I thought that he would feel 
uneasy, I recommended to him that he not attend. He has been 
supporting me completely, and I have discussed things 
straightforwardly with him. Because he told me that he would, I 
believe that Mr. Takemura will continue to support me. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you said just a while ago 
that 
yesterday was when you first made an official proposal 
concerning a cabinet reshuffle, but half a month ago you did not 
deny a possible cabinet reshuffle in response to reporters' 
questions. As a matter of fact, I think that your intention to 
carry out a cabinet reshuffle invited a political vacuum for 
more than half a month. The media has reported such a political 
vacuum, and it can be said that the prime minister's office has 
not been functioning. What do you think of this? 
  [Hosokawa] What I said a half month ago means that the first 
task of the political reform-oriented government has been 
carried out and that the situation now permits me a free hand. 
I do not think that the prime minister's office has not been 
functioning. Because the cabinet is composed of the coalition 
partners, which are precariously balanced, I think it is 
inevitable that I will undergo a twist-and-turns process in 
making decisions on political issues -- such as the welfare tax 
issue. 
  [Reporter] We have heard that Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] Secretary General Ozawa has persistently called for Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Takemura to be replaced. Did he consent to 
your decision when you met with him today, and what did you 
discuss with him? 
  [Hosokawa] I think that Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa -- 
I want to refrain from mentioning specific parties -- must have 
thought that, like the opinions mentioned earlier, it is time 
for a cabinet reshuffle because one goal called political reform 
has been achieved, and that it is necessary to consider the fact 
that relations between the chief cabinet secretary, who is a key 
person in the cabinet, and the ruling parties are rocky. 
  [Reporter] In view of a series of confusing incidents such 
as 
the welfare tax issue and the cabinet reshuffle, there is the 
opinion that it is impossible for the coalition to run the 
government, even though the government -- which originally set 
political reform as its major goal -- plans to shift its 
emphasis to economic matters following the attainment of 
political reform. What is your opinion? 
  [Hosokawa] I know that there are various opinions. At the 
meeting of top leaders of the ruling parties held just a while 
ago, we confirmed the intention to maintain the unity of the 
coalition government. 
  [Reporter] What is the reason for maintaining the unity? 
  [Hosokawa] The reason is that it is impossible to carry out 
the reforms proposed by the government unless the unity of the 
ruling parties is secured. We all keep this in mind -- although 
there sometimes is an unpleasant atmosphere within the ruling 
partners, and things can be awkward in running the government -- 
and we reconfirmed this at the meeting. 
  [Reporter] In addition to the fate of the chief cabinet 
secretary, the focus of attention has been on whether Political 
Reform Minister Yamahana will be appointed a minister 
plenipotentiary. Are you thinking of giving him a new special 
post? 
  [Hosokawa] At present, I am not planning to do so, but that 
may be possible. I would like to study this later. 
  [Reporter] I believe that you planned a cabinet reshuffle to 
deal with many issues. It is possible that because you 
abandoned the plan for a reshuffle, your leadership will greatly 
weaken. As a result, the government may lose its centripetal 
force, and this would have negative effects on the Hosokawa 
government, which has to tackle many problems. What do you 
think about this? 
  [Hosokawa] As you know, it is the prime minister's arbitrary 
right to reshuffle a cabinet. It is wrong to say that I failed 
to carry out the plan. Because I think that the unity of the 
ruling coalition is important, I have decided to postpone a 
reshuffle. Some may not agree with me, but I do not think I have 
failed. 
  [Dean of the press corps] We are running out of time. We 
would like to conclude the news conference with one more 
question. Are you confident that you can continuously get along 
well with the chief cabinet secretary, who is opposed to your 
exercising your right? 
  [Hosokawa] Even under former governments led by the Liberal 
Democratic Party, cabinet reorganizations were decided after 
hearing opinions from each faction, not to mention the fact that 
it is more difficult for the coalition government to carry out a 
cabinet reshuffle because it is composed of several parties. 
Although it is the prime minister's arbitrary right, I have to 
make a final decision on a cabinet reshuffle based on the 
opinions of each party and on the political situation. I think 
that this is the right way for the ruling coalition to do this. 
  [Dean of the press corps] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- The House of Councillors 
special committee on political reform on Thursday [3 March] 
passed amendments to a package of political reform laws enacted 
in January. 
  The amendments are expected to become law after clearing an 
upper house plenary session Friday. 
  The House of Representatives on Tuesday approved the 
amendments, which feature changes in the lower house's election 
system and revised regulations on corporate donations to 
political fund-raising organizations. 
  Under the amendments, 300 seats will be allocated in 
single-seat constituencies and 200 by proportional 
representation based on the popular vote in 11 electoral units. 
Currently, lower house members are elected from multiseat 
constituencies. 
  The original government package called for 274 single-seat 
districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional representation 
on a nationwide basis. 
  The original package banned corporate donations to 
politicians and their fund-raising organizations, but the 
revised bills will allow firms to donate up to 500,000 yen per 
year during the next five years as a temporary provision. 
  The original package was passed on January 29 at the 
extraordinary Diet session shortly after Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and opposition Liberal Democratic Party president Yohei 
Kono had agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement 
would be discussed during the current ordinary session. 
  Lower house elections based on the new political reform 
legislation can be held once a bill identifying the 300 
single-seat constituencies clears the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, head of the 
leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said Thursday 
[3 March] the cabinet of the ruling coalition may be nearing the 
end of its political reform mission since it cannot agree on 
economic reform. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, however, defended 
differences of opinion as "awkward" but underlined the unity of 
the coalition during questioning at a meeting of the special 
committee on political reform in the House of Councillors. 
  "It is fate that we make our decisions while maintaining and 
worrying about the delicate balance between the eight parties," 
said Hosokawa. 
  "Even though it is a bit awkward, each party believes in 
upholding the unity of the coalition," he said. 
  Hosokawa's remarks and the challenge from Kono and the LDP 
came in the wake of the prime minister's decision to give up 
reshuffling his cabinet. 
  "The prime minister said he wanted to form an economic 
reform 
cabinet, but he couldn't do this since they couldn't reach a 
consensus (within the coalition) on economic reform," Kono said. 
  "If political reform is realized, the mission of the cabinet 
will be completed," said Kono. 
  He further criticized the coalition, saying, "this is not 
the 
time for a power game. They should be thinking more about the 
welfare of the nation and the lives of the people." 
  Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said 
it 
was "very regrettable" that cabinet reform had apparently been 
intended to remove him from his position as top government 
spokesman. 
  Takemura has openly differed with Hosokawa over economic 
policies including a bombshell proposal by the prime minister to 
install a 7 percent national welfare tax in place of the current 
3 percent consumption tax as part of the budget package for the 
next fiscal year. 
  Takemura acknowledged there were reasons for the talk of his 
removal, saying, "rather than handing in my resignation, I will 
continue to do my best with a new attitude." 
  Takemura told reporters he decided not to attend a general 
meeting of his party, Sakigake (Harbinger), so as to draw a 
clear line between his roles as party leader and chief cabinet 
secretary. 
  "I will be more careful so as not to be misunderstood," he 
told a news conference. 
  Asked about his future relations with Hosokawa, Takemura 
said 
he and the premier had held discussions on seven or eight 
occasions and reaffirmed that they will remain friends as before. 
  "We agreed to maintain our friendship and I have no 
apprehensions about this." 
  He also noted he will try to stay more in touch and exchange 
views more often with Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and 
Komeito, the two forces that backed Hosokawa's plan for a 
cabinet reshuffle centering on the removal of Takemura as chief 
of staff. 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama, 
head of the coalition's largest faction, told the party's 
central committee that he wanted to see the SDP assume 
responsibility for strengthening the coalition administration. 
  "What is urgently needed is to get the budget through the 
Diet, since we have responsibility to respond to the people's 
expectations," Murayama said. 
  Keigo Ouchi, head of the Democratic Socialist Party, sounded 
an optimistic note in calling for coalition unity, "we have 
avoided antagonism within the cabinet and the government. 
  "The storm is over and clear weather is coming, but it is 
important to maintain a singleness of purpose in the coalition 
parties from now on."

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Shiro Yoneyama: "Hosokawa Gradually Losing </F>
Control of Coalition Government"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- For the second time in a 
month, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has held a news 
conference to apologize for tactical mistakes -- one about an 
abortive national welfare tax and now about his plan to 
reshuffle his cabinet. 
  An apologetic Hosokawa said at a news conference that he 
will 
keep Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the top 
government spokesman, for the time being for the sake of the 
seven-party coalition which drove the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] from power last summer. 
  Barely one month ago, Hosokawa, a descendant of a samurai 
warlord in southern Japan, caused a political commotion by 
proposing a 7 percent national welfare tax to replace the 
current 3 percent consumption tax. 
  The plan took the entire nation by surprise, and among those 
who were not consulted in advance was Takemura, leader of 
Sakigake [Harbinger], an LDP splinter group and coalition member. 
  The tax and cabinet change fiascoes, along with his 
allegedly 
nonchalant way of politicking, have driven Hosokawa's popularity 
ratings down from over 70 percent to the 50 percent range in 
recent newspaper polls. 
  With controversial political reform bills nearing their 
final 
parliamentary approval, Hosokawa is gradually tilting toward 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, the 
coalition's chief backroom strategist and protege of disgraced 
LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru. 
  And Takemura's Sakigake, the Social Democratic Party and the 
Democratic Socialist Party are alarmed by the emerging alliance 
of Ozawa's Shinseito and the Soka Gakkai [Buddhist sect]-backed 
Komeito [Clean Government Party]. 
  Hosokawa told reporters Wednesday [2 March] night he is 
giving up the idea of a cabinet change to maintain unity within 
the coalition. 
  But LDP President Yohei Kono blasted the Hosokawa government 
for losing control of itself and engaging in power politics at 
the expense of the economic and trade issues confronting Japan. 
  Once close allies with the aim of overhauling Japanese 
politics, Hosokawa and Takemura, former prefectural governors, 
have parted ways in substance if not in style on the road to 
achieving their grand objective. 
  Under Hosokawa's failed attempt to change his cabinet, the 
government's key three economic ministers would have gone. 
  They are Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii for involvement in 
a 
money scandal, International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi 
Kumagai for a squabble over the dismissal of a senior ministry 
official, and Economic Planning Agency chief Manae Kubota for 
her allegedly poor grasp of statistics. 
  One result of the latest episode and similar ill-prepared 
scenarios in the Hosokawa cabinet is that politics in Japan 
remains fluid. And that is not good news for the rest of the 
world.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Two Japanese dailies on 
Thursday criticized Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's method of 
governing as capricious, following his announcement Wednesday of 
giving up his cabinet reshuffle plan. 
  For two weeks the prime minister had been expected to shake 
up his seven-month-old cabinet, ostensibly to better tackle 
economic reform, but apparently intended to oust Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN blamed the confusion and instability in 
the government on Hosokawa's tendency to do the "unexpected" 
rather than on his tactical errors, including most notably his 
abandoned welfare tax and the current crisis over cabinet reform. 
  It was only natural that Hosokawa gave up the cabinet 
reshuffle plan in the end, the MAINICHI said. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN wondered if the prime minister 
understood 
that his tendency is the cause of the stagnation in government. 
  Hosokawa's impulsiveness in decision-making is also to blame 
for the drop in public support for the government from 72.4 
percent last month to 58 percent most recently, the YOMIURI 
suggested. 
  The YOMIURI reasoned that it is natural for the prime 
minister to want to create an "economic reform administration" 
to deal with the issues of recession, budget and trade frictions 
with the U.S. 
  It added, however, that opposition at the heart of the 
administration has crippled the government just as budget 
deliberations are set to begin in the Diet. 
  The MAINICHI opined that the passing of next year's fiscal 
budget to deal with the current economic sluggishness should 
have taken precedence over plans to reform the cabinet. 
  The MAINICHI concluded that no matter how one might consider 
cabinet reform as an exclusive responsibility of the prime 
minister, Hosokawa should first sound out the intentions of the 
coalition members and make adjustments before carry out 
restructuring.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Recent rises of long-term 
interest rates and the yen's value are unlikely to put a drag on 
Japan's economy, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said Thursday 
[3 March]. 
  Saito told a regular press conference that the climbs were 
recent developments and did not reflect long-term trends. 
  Concerning the interest rates, Saito said rates were rising 
from a very low point and remain at "sufficiently low levels." 
  He said that "at one time" the yen was said to be on another 
uptrend but those expectations did not come about. 
  Saito said more time is needed to watch interest rate and 
currency market trends. 
  Japanese benchmark 10-year government bond yields jumped 
Monday to 3.94 percent, their highest level since just before 
the Bank of Japan cut its official discount rate to a record low 
1.75 percent a year in September. 
  Banks are moving to raise their long-term prime lending 
rates, which would put upward pressure on housing loan rates. 
  Market players have cited a halt in the decline of business 
confidence signaled by a key survey released Monday, and 
concerns of oversupply in the wake of the government's 
stepped-up bond issuance. 
  The yen also climbed Monday as reports circulated that the 
United States would revive a retaliatory trade law, rekindling 
bilateral trade friction and heightening expectations of U.S. 
backing of a higher yen to curb Japan's huge trade surplus. 
  On the economy, Saito said there had been worries in some 
quarters of further setbacks but they have dissipated. On the 
other hand, he said, there is still no confirmation that the 
economy is bottoming out. 
  It is still too early to judge the economy based on recent 
statistics showing some hope that the worst is over, he said. 
  But he repeated that the effects of last month's 15.25 
trillion yen economic stimulus package have yet to be felt and 
expressed hope that the measures will get the economy on track 
for a strong recovery in the fiscal year starting next month and 
stable growth starting in the following fiscal year. 
  Saito declined comment on reports that President Bill 
Clinton 
will revive the super 301 retaliatory trade provision, saying 
nothing official has been decided. He said Japan's policy 
remains not to draft numerical targets to gauge progress in 
opening markets.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Myo Nyunt, chairman of the 
committee for holding the 49th Armed Forces Day and the 
management committee for Armed Forces Day and commander of the 
Yangon [Rangoon] Military Command headquarters, met with and 
addressed officers, noncommissioned officers, and rank and file 
who will participate in the military parade at Hlaing Stadium in 
Hlaing Township at 0800 today. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said the Defense 
Services, which have been fighting various armed organizations 
since 1948, have been modernizing the Army, the Air Force and 
the Navy step by step and have remained consolidated and strong 
to this day. The Defense Services have been organized and 
trained in order to serve the three cardinal causes 
[nondisintegration of the Union; nondisintegration of national 
unity; perpetuation of national sovereignty]. 
  Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said our Defense Services must have 
quality and be one with the people, constantly striving to 
maintain their prowess. Today's Defense Services are 
endeavoring to build a peaceful and modern nation and the major 
requirement for this endeavor is peace. 
  At a news conference held on 16 February in Bangkok, U.S. 
Congressman Mr. Bill Richardson said: The Burmese should settle 
the Burmese issue, and not outsiders. He also said: I am not a 
Burma expert. Nonetheless, I have been involved in human rights 
in Burma in connection with an amendment that provided financial 
assistance to some Burmese dissident groups. 
  Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said it was therefore necessary to 
constantly expose those organizations opposed to the government. 
Likewise, he said, some organizations who cannot bear to see 
the forthcoming 49th Armed Forces Day ceremony because it 
precedes the golden anniversary of the Defense Services are 
likely to resort to overt and political means to receive 
assistance from armed organizations in the jungles, to instigate 
people from behind, and to infiltrate the economic sector by 
manipulating rice prices and causing high prices of commodities 
to create hardship among consumers. 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said external radio stations 
and certain organizations and persons who pine for the outsiders 
have plans, as in the past, to collude in creating impatience 
and anger among the members of the Defense Services from various 
military commands and divisions who will be marching in the 49th 
Armed Forces Day parade in order to get what they want according 
to their plan. 
  Those opposing us are using force as well as subtle peaceful 
means and if these methods fail they are likely to resort to 
unrest. Therefore, it is necessary for members of the Defense 
Services to uphold the motto "Plotting to cause the 
disintegration of the Defense Services is unacceptable; those 
striving to cause the disintegration of the Defense Services are 
our enemy" and to remain undaunted despite attempts to frighten 
you. He urged those present to have political, military, 
administrative, and economic awareness and to be vigilant about 
security. In accordance with the belief that the strength of 
the nation lies within, it will be necessary to join forces with 
the strength of members of the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea 
resumed their dialogue for the first time in four months 
Thursday but ended their meeting without reaching any 
substantial agreement on the exchange of special envoys to help 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The two sides, however, agreed to meet again at 10 AM next 
Wednesday at Tongil-gak on the northern side of the 
demilitarized [zone] in the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  The delegates to the fourth working-level inter-Korean 
contact could not even take up the problems related to the 
exchange of special envoys when North Korea demanded that they 
first discuss two new issues. 
  North Korea demanded that South Korea stop trying to deploy 
Patriot anti-missile missile and clarify recent remarks by South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. 
  The southern delegation, led by Song Yong-tae, vice minister 
of the National Unification Board, proposed at the meeting a 
13-point agenda for discussions including the implementation of 
the delcaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
and the inter-Korean basic accords and a summit between 
President Kim and North Korean President Kim Il-song. 
  Thursday's meeting ended a few hours after the South Korean 
Defense Ministry announced a conditional suspension of the joint 
U.S.-South Korean military exercise "Team Spirit" in Seoul. 
  South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend the 
military exercise on condition that Pyongyang resume dialogue 
with Seoul for the exchange of special envoys to discuss issues 
including the North Korean nuclear question. 
  "The southern side tabled a revised draft of the proposal 
for 
the exchange of special envoys to help resolve the nuclear issue 
and other measures to improve inter-Korean relations," Song said 
after the meeting. 
  "But we could not make any progress in discussions for the 
exchange of envoys since North Korea raised four conditions," 
Song said. 
  In addition to the two new demands, North Korea wanted South 
Korea to scrap the Team Spirit exercise and stop participating 
in an international campaign against North Korea. The two sides 
are expected to take up the question of exchanging special 
envoys at the next meeting on Wednesday, sources asid. 
  In his opening statement, the South Korean chief delegate 
stressed that South and North Korea will have to exchange their 
special envoys before North Korea could hold a third round of 
high-level talks with the United States, which is tentatively 
slated for March 21 in Vienna. 
  The special envoys have to be exchanged as soon as possible 
so that the two Koreas could solve the nuclear problem as well 
as other pending inter-Korean issues, Song said. 
  Shortly before the meeting started at "Peace House" on the 
southern side of the demilitarized zone, Song met with the 
northern delegates and shook hands with them. He then noted 
that the inter-Korean contact was suspended in October last year 
"when the winter began to set in." 
  "As we are meeting you here again today, we feel like we are 
waking up from a long hibernation," Song told the northern 
delegation led by his counterpart, Pak Yong-su. 
  "I hope that the inter-Korean relations will also wake up 
from a long winter sleep and spring arrives in Panmunjom," Song 
added. 
  The North Korean chief delegate deplored that "we wasted a 
whole season since we met each other last fall when grains were 
ripe for harvest." 
  "Let us try to clear up problems for the exchange of special 
envoys within today," Pak said.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South and North 
Korean officials were still high-strung despite their 
reencounter Thursday after a four-month break. 
  Seoul's top representative Song Yong-tae compared the break 
to winter hibernation, hoping that inter-Korean relations would 
wake up from winter sleep. 
  Song's North Korean counterpart Pak Yong-su chided they 
wasted one whole season and called for successful conclusion of 
their negotiations within the day. 
  -- Spiked words were exchanged even before the two sides sat 
down for the negotiations. 
  Pak make the first strike after pointing to Song's big 
briefcase. "I only brought a small envelope containing a draft 
agreement because I am intent on reaching an agreement today," 
said Pak, "But I see that you brought a big briefcase and 
obviously have a lot to say about this and that." 
  Song laughed it off, saying he brought the briefcase to take 
home the presents since it's Pak's turn to give the gifts. 
  -- A remark on how Seoul is celebrating its 600th birthday 
immediately met retaliation from Pyongyang who recognizes Koryo 
Dynasty as the first unified Korea. 
  Song explained how Seoul was trying to restore Kyongbuk 
Palace by 1997 to celebrate the 600th anniversary and is 
preparing for the visit Korea year. He went on to say how he 
wants to see foreign tourists travel back and forth between the 
two sides. 
  Pak immediately retaliated Song's historical perspective. He 
described how his country completed reconstructing the tomb of 
King Wangkon, the founder of Koryo Dynasty last January to mark 
his 1,117th birthday. 
  He named Wangkon as the first king of a unified nation as he 
emphasized the historical surroundings linking Koryo to North 
Korea. 
  -- Song changed the subject to just-ended Lillehammer Winter 
Olympics, reminding how the Seoul team won a record-breaking 
number of medals and saying he was sorry to hear North Korea 
could not field its athletes due to injury. 
  He indirectly hinted how an inter-Korean unified team would 
do so much better at international games and urged North Korea 
to open to various exchanges. 
  Song replied everything will go well once the two sides 
exchange presidential envoys. 
  -- Top interest among North Korean journalists was 
apparently 
who Seoul will pick as its envoy. 
  Many asked if the Southern side already decided who is to be 
sent as the envoy while hinting that Pyongyang may choose 
between Kim Yong-sun, party secretary for South Korean Affairs, 
and Vice President Kim Yong-chu.

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 3 (YONHAP) -- Vice Unification Minister 
Song Yong-tae, who represented the South at Thursday's 
South-North contact at Panmunjom, said later in the day he could 
not predict the prospects of future South-North talks. 
  "At the moment, I cannot be optimistic or pessimistic about 
the future of the contact," Song said upon return to Seoul from 
the truce village. 
  While explaining about the talks he just had with the North 
before a group of reporters, Song said North Korea unreasonably 
raised two new issues in addition to their oft-repeated demands 
for the suspension of "nuclear war games" and the South's 
renouncement of its international cooperative system over the 
nuclear question. 
  The vice minister said it is ridiculous for North Korea to 
dispute the issue of purely defensive Patriot missiles while 
they themselves test-fired "Nodong-1" missiles. 
  President Kim Yong-sam's remarks which North Korea disputed 
were a justifiable statement under the then circumstances. 
  "North Korea seems trying to engineer the projected exchange 
of special envoys in a direction favorable to them while 
delaying the talks on the strength of their new demands," he 
said. 
  Song said that it seems at the moment North Korea is less 
interested in the exchange of special envoys. 
  But, there may be a last-minute aboutface on the part of 
North Korea as they are well aware that the third-round 
U.S.-North Korea high-level talks could take place on March 21 
only after special envoys were exchanged between the two Koreas, 
Song said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- As inter-Korean contact 
resumed on Thursday, Seoul was set to begin preparations for a 
bid to co-host the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament along with 
Pyongyang, government officials said. The South decided earlier 
to propose to the North that they jointly apply to host the 
World Cup, but has not yet conveyed its intention because of 
their frozen relations resulting from the North Korean nuclear 
problem. South and North Korea on Thursday met at the truce 
village of Panmunjom for a working-level contact on exchanging 
special envoys. 
  As soon as South Korea succeeded in qualifying for its third 
consecutive World Cup last October -- a first in Asia -- it 
launched a full-fledged drive to host the 2002 soccer World Cup. 
  The preparatory committee seeking to host the World Cup 
tournament plans to contact several international sports 
organizations including FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and 
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ask them to help 
South and North Korea win the right. 
  The government also plans to propose the creation of a 
unified Korean team for this year's Hiroshima Asian Games slated 
for October, and resumption of the unification soccer matches 
between South and North Korea, when full-fledged inter-Korean 
talks begin.

  [Text] Vienna, March 3 KYODO -- A seven-member team began 
Thursday [3 March] inspecting North Korea's nuclear facilities, 
a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
said. The inspection of seven declared facilities will last 
through March 15, the spokesman said. The IAEA inspection team 
arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday. The inspections followed an 
agreement reached by the United States and North Korea last 
Friday at a working-level meeting in New York that Pyongyang 
fully implement IAEA inspections of its seven declared nuclear 
plants.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with President Kim Yong-sam by KBS </F>
anchorman Yi Yun-song at Chongwadae, the presidential residence, 
on the 21st anniversary of the founding of KBS, on 3 
March--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Yi Yun-song] The greatest 
pending foreign policy issue is the inspection of the North 
Korean nuclear facilities. The North Korean nuclear issue is a 
problem which we are directly concerned with, and it is a 
difficult problem to solve for the world as a whole. 
Fortunately, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection team has entered Pyongyang to conduct official 
inspections. In Panmunjom, a working contact is being held for 
the exchange of special envoys. How do you think this problem 
will be solved? If it is not solved, what measure do you think 
will be necessary? 
  [President Kim Yong-sam] The North Korean nuclear program 
should be stopped by all means. This is necessary not only for 
the survival of the 70 million fellow countrymen but for peace 
in Northeast Asia and the world. This is a problem directly 
connected with our survival and for peace on the Korean 
peninsula. Therefore, I think we should mobilize all means 
possible to solve this problem. 
  Fortunately, the IAEA inspection has started. The working 
contact for the exchange of special envoys is being held. We 
cannot be too optimistic at this stage, for we have undergone 
numerous critical stages in our relations with North Korea. We 
cannot expect that everything will be settled smoothly. We will 
have to overcome some more critical points. However, now that 
North Korea is permitting the nuclear inspection, the so-called 
nuclear card has left the North Korean hand. I think the 
inter-Korean dialogue, therefore, has to make considerable 
progress. The United States has promised us that it will not 
hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea unless 
there is significant progress in the exchange of special envoys. 
North Korea has also officially announced it will do so. 
  What is most important at the present stage is that we are 
handling every matter in close cooperation with the United 
States. The United States has always consulted us on their 
contacts with North Korea. At times, the United States even 
halted the talks with North Korea to have time to discuss 
matters with us. 
  I think what is most important to the ROK is maintaining 
such 
a close cooperative system with the United States. If the 
exchange of special envoys and inter-Korean dialogues proceed as 
we intend and North Korea's nuclear development program is 
hindered, we could promote relations with North Korea in 
various areas, including the economic sector. 
  I think North Korea should acknowledge the fact that the ROK 
is in a position to actively help it improve relations with the 
United States. It would be foolish of North Korea to think that 
it can discuss this issue without the ROK. 
  [Yi] In a recent news conference, you said that the 
precondition for the exchange of special envoys is holding a 
summit. You even said that you would meet with the North Korean 
president when you believed it conducive to keeping North Korea 
from developing nuclear weapons. When do you think it will take 
place? 
  [Kim] It is hard to predict now. I will have to judge the 
timing by watching the development for the exchange of special 
envoys. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. official who 
caused a sensation in Seoul with his comments on South Korea 
needing to abolish its national security law, explained that he 
was stating his personal opinion and not that of his government, 
the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. 
  U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard met 
with 
South Korean Embassy officials in Washington and explained he 
was commenting on basics while talking about overall South 
Korean-U.S. relations, Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin 
told reporters. Hubbard was quoted as saying he is sorry about 
the controversy generated by his misstated expression of a 
sensitive problem. He also told South Korean officials he 
understands the extraordinary circumstances surrounding Korea, 
Choe said. 
  During a seminar held Feb. 25 at American University, 
Hubbard 
said South Korea and the United States differ on "how to respond 
on some regional and global issues." 
  "And despite heartwarming success in establishing democracy 
and marked improvement on the human rights front -- or perhaps 
because of them -- the United States still wishes the Republic 
of Korea would repeal the national security law," Hubbard said. 
  The incident created an immediate commotion here because 
Hubbard is the chief working-level U.S. negotiator with North 
Korea. Initial speculation went that the issue was raised during 
the recent North Korean-U.S. talks led by Hubbard. 
  South Korea's national security law prohibits any 
unauthorized contact with North Korea and any public statements 
or acts sympathetic to the North Korean regime. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney called Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-chu Wednesday night to supply an explanation as well, 
Choe said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party on Thursday refuted a U.S. State Department 
statement confirming Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for 
East Asia and the Pacific Tom Hubbard's recent remarks calling 
on Seoul to repeal its National Security Law as the official 
U.S. position. 
  Emerging from a staff meeting presided over by Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil, Party Spokesman Ha Sun-pong issued a statment 
rebuking the U.S. State Department statement. 
  Noting that the National Security Law's abolition has been 
one of North Korea's consistent demands, Ha said the question of 
repealing this law must be dealt with carefully because North 
Korea has not yet guaranteed the transparency of its nuclear 
program and because the North's military threat still exists. 
  Chairman Kim said, "I don't think Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of State Hubbard made such remarks with any knowledge about 
North Korean laws... I can't understand why he raised such a 
sensitive issue at this point of time." 
  Secretary-General Mun Chong-su called Hubbard's remarks "an 
intervention of domestic affairs" and criticized the opposition 
party for its support of the comments. 
  Chief Policy-maker Yi Se-ki supported Mun, saying the 
opposition party should take a stand against such remarks.

  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government announced conditional suspension of this year's "Team 
Spirit," the annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise, 
on Thursday morning. 
  The Defense Ministry said in the announcement that, in view 
of recent progress on the North Korean nuclear problem, South 
Korea and the United States have agreed on Team Spirit '94's 
conditional suspension. 
  "In view of this progress, the governments of the Republic 
of 
Korea and the United States have decided to suspend Team Spirit 
'94 with the expectation that the IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities 
will be successfully concluded and that practical discussion 
toward the resolution of the North Korean nuclear question will 
be undertaken through the exchange of special envoys between 
South and North Korea," the statement said. 
  "If the above steps are not fulfilled," it continued, "the 
governments of the Republic of Korea and the United States will 
reconsider the decision to suspend Team Spirit '94." 
  After the announcement, a ministry spokesman explained some 
of its terms. 
  "It's fundamentally up to the IAEA to judge if the 
inspection 
has been successfully concluded. We think every inspection 
activity of the IAEA inspection team should be carried out 
without any restrictions and the results of the inspection 
should be understandable to the IAEA as well as to the 
international community." 
  Last Saturday, Pyongyang told Washington it would allow 
unrestricted IAEA access to seven declared facilities and accept 
Seoul's proposal to hold working-level talks on exchanging 
presidential envoys. 
  In return, Washington was to suspend this year's Team Spirit 
and conduct high-level talks with North Korea later this month. 
  At the beginning of the announcement, the government judged 
that progress has been made on the nuclear issue. 
  "Recently, progress has been achieved on the North Korean 
nuclear question, as North Korea has agreed to accept the 
inspection activities which were requested by the IAEA of the 
seven declared nuclear facilities. North Korea has also agreed 
to reopen working-level contacts in order to discuss the 
exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea." 
  Meanwhile, Defense Ministry officials explained that the 
government suspended Team Spirit because IAEA inspections of 
North Korean nuclear facilities began on Thursday and 
inter-Korean contact on exchanging special envoys has resumed. 
  The South Korean Government was to announce the suspension 
of 
the military exercise Tuesday afternoon on condition that North 
Korea cooperated with the IAEA nuclear inspections and agreed to 
hold the working-level contact on envoy exchanges Tuesday. 
  But since Pyongyang postponed the contact until Thursday, 
Seoul also delayed announcement of the military maneuvers' 
suspension.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States took bold steps Thursday in trying to solve the 
North Korean nuclear problem that have to be appreciated more 
for their overall principles than their details. As agreed last 
week after exhaustive negotiations between North Korea and the 
United States, Seoul announced suspension of this year's "Team 
Spirit," the joint military exercise with Washington held 
annually since 1976. Washington is to follow up with the 
announcement of a March 21 meeting with North Korean officials 
in Geneva, the third round of high-level dialogue, wrapping up a 
small package deal in a first-phase resolution of the nuclear 
problem. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu labeled these announcements as 
steps "enabling thorough inspections in North Korea, preventing 
a threatening situation and allowing room for a solution through 
dialogue." But he admitted to shortfalls in details that 
outwardly show Pyongyang holding more marbles after the game. 
"But let's look at the forest, not each tree. There are more 
optimistic aspects than negative ones," Han said. 
  As things stood Thursday, the decision on Team Spirit's 
suspension and North Korea-U.S. high-level talks was 
conditional. Pyongyang must allow unrestricted access to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team. It 
also has to exchange presidential envoys with Seoul. The former 
condition is likely to be met easily. South Korean officials 
expect the latter to be fulfilled in one form or another. 
  Pyongyang doesn't come right out and say it, but it fully 
understands that the envoy exchange is an absolute prerequisite 
to the March 21 meeting with Washington, Seoul officials insist. 
But their explanations hardly allay concerns that North Korea is 
succeeding in isolating South Korea from the nuclear 
negotiations. 
  A high-level official in Seoul admitted that realistically, 
there wasn't enough time for both sides' envoys to make the 
visits. Seoul is thinking of sending its representative to 
Pyongyang first, around March 15, which may have to suffice for 
the demand on envoy exchanges, according to this official. 
Shortfalls in such small but significant items serve as bases 
to claims of failure in microscopics. But as the foreign 
minister says, looking at the big picture, the nuclear stalemate 
has turned back from the brink and is heading in the right 
direction. All concerned parties -- South Korea, North Korea 
and the United States -- will all keep on negotiating. 
Meanwhile, the more immediate task of nuclear inspections in 
North Korea can continue. 
  Although pessimism lingers on the viability of the 
inter-Korean envoy exchange, officials here point the finger at 
Pyongyang for refusing to accept it. "Once the envoys do meet, 
they cannot but discuss inter-Korean matters," said Han in 
sounding a note of optimism. Besides, officials here reason, to 
break off the negotiations over differences on the envoy issue 
would be a serious setback for all concerned. There would be no 
IAEA inspections, no more diplomatic dialogue. One official goes 
as far as saying that "if there can't be a meaningful 
inter-Korean dialogue anyway, then it's better to at least 
secure IAEA inspections."

  [Text] Deng Xiaoping, the supreme leader of China, handed 
out a directive to policy makers in China to fully support the 
North Korean economic reform policy and to help realize North 
Korean President Kim Il-song's visit to China. This was 
revealed by a diplomatic source in Seoul on 2 March. 
  The source said that Deng Xiapoing handed out such a 
directive after hearing the report on North Korean affairs from 
Ding Guanggen, member of the Chinese Communist Party Political 
Bureau. 
  Ding held talks with Hwang Chang-yop, secretary of the North 
Korean Workers Party Central Committee and chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee in the Supreme People's Assembly, who 
headed a five-member delegation's visit to China last January. 
  Hwang Chang-yop stayed in China from 15 to 23 January. 
During his stay, he met with Chinese leaders and discussed 
North Korean economic policies and the issue of President Kim's 
visit to China.

<F P=106> [Article by Korean Military Academy professor On Man-kun] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In this article, we will 
examine North Korean [DPRK] nuclear development, the reality of 
our society--rampant with indifference and optimism concerning 
the DPRK threat--and the background of this reality. Through the 
present state of the DPRK's development of weapons of mass 
destruction, to include nuclear weapons, we will examine the 
DPRK's intentions, the extent of its threat to us, and our 
posture concerning this threat. 
  First, we will consider the optimistic view of DPRK nuclear 
development and discover where it originates. In some sectors of 
our society today, a view of the DPRK is gaining acceptance 
which is not easy to refute. According to this view, as one of 
the poorest nations in the world, there is little reason at 
present for concern over the DPRK's war-fighting capability and 
intentions, and even if it is actually attempting to develop 
nuclear weapons, this is only to maintain the DPRK system and 
make diplomatic gains, not for military use. 
  As a basis for this viewpoint, we can point to the DPRK's 
weak economic and military capability and its diplomatic 
isolation, as seen through various indicators. With its switch 
from barter trade to hard-currency settlements due to a change 
in its trade relations with the Soviet Union and China, the 
DPRK's economic situation has daily grown worse. The state of 
its economy is so serious that it has recorded continued 
negative growth for the past several years. DPRK food shortages 
are an already well-known fact. The present DPRK GNP, at a 
little above $20 billion, is one-fifteenth of South Korea's 
[ROK]. At about $1,000, its per capita income is about 
one-seventh of ROK's (See "North Korean Abstract" [Pukhan 
Kaeyo], 1993: North and South Korean Social and Cultural 
Indicators [Nambukhan Sahoe Munhwa Chipyo], 
Unification Board, 1992). 
  Weapons possessed by the DPRK are out of date and it also 
lags behind in technology. Although superior in numbers, when 
consideration is given to quality, its military capability 
cannot be said to surpass that of ROK, it is argued. 
Furthermore, its traditional allies, including the Soviet Union, 
having disappeared with the collapse of the communist bloc, 
there is now no longer any nation to actively support the DPRK. 
Because of this, the argument goes, it is unthinkable that the 
DPRK would start a conflict as it did the Korea war (quoted from 
O Kwan-chi, Korea Forum [Hanguk Nondan], December 
1993). It is a fact that the DPRK is in an economic slump, that 
much of its weaponry and equipment is outdated, and that it is 
diplomatically isolated. With such a reasonable foundation, some 
aspects of our society's indifference and optimism concerning 
DPRK war-fighting capability and nuclear development appear 
convincing, 
  Where can we find the source of this attitude, which ranges 
from indifference to optimism? Influential views on DPRK nuclear 
development are divided largely into two categories. The first 
is the position that the DPRK's nuclear development is 
ultimately to enhance war-fighting capability by developing 
nuclear weapons. The second is the opinion that the DPRK is 
using the nuclear issue as a political and diplomatic lever, for 
political negotiations whose objective is normalized relations 
with the United States and Japan, discontinuance of Team Spirit 
exercises, the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the ROK, removal 
of the U.S. nuclear umbrella over the ROK, and elimination of 
nuclear threats to the DPRK. Of the two views on DPRK nuclear 
development, optimists seem to particularly accept the latter. 
Also reinforcing the optimistic position is the undeniable fact 
that several statesmen in the past have frequently used security 
issues as a means for maintaining power. In the past, when 
political instability had deepened, incidents involving DPRK spy 
rings or military provocation were opportunely reported. As a 
result, people grew to distrust or be indifferent toward 
official government announcements or opinions on the DPRK threat 
or national security. This is also the background reinforcing 
public indifference toward the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  Then, is DPRK war-fighting capability weak and its nuclear 
development only for achieving political and diplomatic 
objectives? To obtain the answer to this, we will examine its 
strategy toward the South, its military capabilities, and in 
particular, its chemical and biological weapons and nuclear 
program. 
  To overcome recent economic difficulties, the DPRK has 
opened 
up some areas and is promoting the introduction of foreign 
capital and technology. It is also trying to break through its 
international isolation and economic crisis by establishing 
diplomatic relations with advanced countries. One thing that has 
not changed despite this is its unification strategy toward the 
South. An overall analysis of the DPRK's unification-related 
strategy would be that the DPRK is sticking to its line, 
"revolution in South Korea first, unification of the fatherland 
second." As always, the ROK is a land to be liberated and the 
ROK Government is an object to be toppled. The reasons the DPRK 
is adhering to its unification strategy despite its various 
difficulties are that it has used this to encourage its people 
and that it has been the foundation making preservation of the 
regime possible. 
  Military capability is an absolutely necessary precondition 
for liberating the ROK. The DPRK is an armed camp with the 
military making up 4 percent (10.1 million) of the total 
population. If reserve forces are included, it has the largest 
per capita armed force in the world (6 million of a total 230 
million). After 1960, military spending made up over 30 percent 
of the DPRK national budget. It continued this way for some 
time, but then was suddenly reduced. This is because it is 
concealing military spending under other items. At present, 
actual military spending is estimated to be at the 30-percent 
level ($5.6 billion of $18.5 billion) (Unification Board, 1993). 
  More important is the fact that, as a result of its 
persistent development of chemical and biological weapons since 
the 1960's, the DPRK has the third-largest stockpile of chemical 
and biological weapons in the world. At Sariwon and other 
locations, the DPRK stores chemical weapons made of blister 
agents, nerve agents, and asphyxiating agents, and strong 
bacteriological weapons that use the infectious bacteria of 
cholera, bubonic plague, and anthrax. Eclipsed by the nuclear 
problem, these chemical and biological weapons have not become a 
diplomatic issue, but their danger is actually tremendous. 
Bacteriological weapons in particular are dangerous, so 
dangerous, that one kilogram could incapacitate the whole 
population of the ROK (DONGA ILBO, 1 November 1992). Even in its 
economic slump, the DPRK appears to be using chemical and 
biological weapons as an important card, along with nuclear 
weapons. This is because it can manufacture them, because they 
have a great killing and wounding effect, and because evidence 
of them is easily destroyed. 
  According to the 1993-1994 National Defense White Paper 
[Kukbang Paekso], the DPRK is at the stage immediately 
before the development of nuclear weapons: It already has 
nuclear reprocessing facilities and has completed detonator 
testing. The reasons the DPRK rejoined the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused special nuclear inspection 
by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], it is judged, 
is that it is about to develop nuclear weapons and is trying to 
earn time and make diplomatic gains. If the DPRK mounted nuclear 
weapons or chemical and biological weapons on a Nodong 1 or 
Nodong 2 missile, which it has finished testing, we, along with 
neighboring countries including Japan, would fall within its 
firing range and thus be in danger. Because of this, Japan and 
the United States are deeply concerned about the DPRK nuclear 
program. Ultimately, we can see that DPRK nuclear development is 
not for negotiation purposes alone, but aims at both enhancement 
of war capability and diplomatic concessions. Thus, rather than 
making a distinction between strong and moderate responses, we 
need the wisdom to block its nuclear development by the 
appropriate use of both, according to the DPRK response. 
  Also, security issues must not again be seen at the 
government level as means for political maneuvering. The story 
of how none of the townspeople tricked by the mischief of the 
shepherd boy went running to help him when the wolf actually 
appeared is extremely common, but speaks to us of truths. 
Debating the security of a nation is itself an important 
national objective and the government must accurately inform the 
public of those portions of security-related information not 
requiring secrecy. [passage omitted] 
  To pass on the economic prosperity and security we enjoy and 
to prepare a peaceful living space for our descendants, we must, 
individually and socially, guard against excessive indifference 
or optimism on security issues. Preparing for war is the most 
effective shortcut to preserving the peace. [passage omitted]

designated Chongjin port as a free trade port, North Korea has 
been allowing ROK-flagged vessels to enter Chongjin port, 
reviewing the feasibility on a case-by-case basis. 
  Accordingly, three large-size cargo ships carrying used

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea plans to 
drastically expand the cargo-handling capacity at Chongjin port, 
which was earlier selected as a free economic area along with 
the Najin-Sonbong free trade zone, informed sources here said on 
Wednesday. Pyongyang wants to develop Chongjin port on the East 
Sea [Sea of Japan] because of its potential as a link with China 
and Russia by land and sea when the North Korean region near the 
Tuman River opens up to foreign investment. 
  North Korea's committee on promotion of external economic 
cooperation recently distributed pamphlets on the project to 
develop Chongjin port to Western financial institutions and 
investors here, explaining how Pyongyang wants to gradually 
expand the port's capacity to transfer and handle cargo up to 20 
million tons and 10 million tons, respectively, by the early 
2000s. In doing so, North Korea will construct a container 
terminal for 1 million tons of cargo next year and expand the 
present seven quays. It will also dredge a 700,000-square-meter 
area in front of the port and build storage facilities covering 
560,000 square meters. 
  Chongjin port currently sits on a 300,000-square-meter site 
and the total length of its quay is 2,138 meters. It can 
accommodate 105,000 tons of ships, or eight 10,000-ton ships and 
five 1,000-ton ships, at a time and 8 million tons of cargo a 
year. Pyongyang also plans to lay rails linking 
Najin-Sonbong-Chongjin-Hunchun (China)-Khasan (Russia)-Posyet 
(Russia) to improve the transportation system.

  [Text] Our conclusion is that North Korea's Kim Chong-il 
places his utmost trust in the combatant troops of the Korean 
Workers Party (WPK) Operations Department, above all, among his 
political power support groups in order to solidify his own 
power base. 
  Based on the overall analysis of testimonies given by 
defectors from the north, we conclude that various North Korean 
military and government agencies perceive that Kim Chong-il 
places his utmost trust in the Party Operations Department as he 
recently issued his guideline to WPK Operations Department 
stating, "The soldiers who would defend the Party even to the 
very end and prevent any rebellion are the combatant troops of 
the WPK Liaison Offices," and instructed massive reinforcement 
of treatment and training of the combatant troops. 
  Specically, Kim Chong-il, at every possible opportunity, 
takes an inspection tour of the Party Operations Department, 
gives the combatants his highest praise, and expresses his trust 
in them saying, "The fighting spirit and the training of the 
Party Operations Department combatants are superior to those of 
any other units and the operational capability of them, though 
small in number, exceeds that of a People's Army Corps strength." 
  The reason for Kim Chong-il's trust in the concern for the 
Party Operations Department combatants is because the unit's 
mission, which ordinarily is to guide and guard North Korean 
espionage agents to and from South Korea, would instantly become 
a special mission to crush any such element in case of an 
internal coup d'etat within the power structure or an appearance 
of threat to the regime's life. 
  In other words, Kim Chong-il, fearing plots of coup d'etat 
within the Ministry of People's Armed Forces and the General 
Gerard Bureau, is nurturing the Party Operations Department 
combatants to be his most trustworthy power center to be his 
personal guards and to check against those other agencies. 
Facts supporting this analysis are that O Kuk-yol (a general) 
who was discharged from the position of Chief of the Armed 
Forces General Staff in February of 1988 became Director of WPK 
Operations Department and commands the troops of the department 
and that the emphasis of training for the department combatants 
has shifted, after Kim Chong-il's instructions on "maintaining 
the capability of riot control," to maintenance of the system 
and the capability for execution of conventional warfare, from 
the past unconventional type training designed for operations 
against the south. 
  O Kuk-yol is the son of O Chung-hap, a partisan associate of 
Kim Il-song's, who acted as the top military assistant with Kim 
Chong-il's total trust having successfully led the effort to 
eliminate Yi Yong-mu, chief of the Armed Forces General 
Political Bureau, who resisted Kim Chong-il's being selected as 
the successor in the mid-70's, but was discharged from the 
position of chief of the Armed Forces General Staff because of 
his conflict with O Chin-u, minister of the People's Armed 
Forces. 
  During the period of semi-state of war declared by North 
Korea in March to counter the "U.S.-South Korea combined 
excerise: Team Spirit `93," combatants of the Party Operations 
Department took, for their conventional warfare skills, a 6000 
li (2400 kilometer) round trip march along the provinces of 
Pyongan, Hwang-hae, and Kangwon, during which they conducted 
such conventional warfare training exercises as seizure and 
demolition aimed at military organizations and other 
agency/installation, snowed cave bivouac, assault, and ambush, 
that have little bearing on the performance of their originally 
designated mission. 
  In the meantime, the North Korean Government, in order to 
comply with Kim Chong-il's directive of total trust and special 
treatment, made an enormous improvement in salary and rations 
for the combatants. A combatant senior lieutenant receives a 
salary of 155 wons per month, exceedingly higher than all other 
senior lieutenants' 100 wons per month salary, and daily 
allowances of 800 grams of rice, two eggs, 200 grams of meat, 
150 grams of fish, and three or more varieties of fresh 
vegetables, and a weekly allowance of 200 grams of glutinous 
rice or flour. 
  This special treatment of combatants of the Party Operations 
Department makes their allowance of rice three times higher and 
their other food allowances twice as much as those of other 
military officers, rank by rank, and they nearly equal the 
levels accorded to members of the 2nd Security Guard Division of 
the General Guard Bureau which is in charge of Kim Chong-il's 
personal protection.

  [Text] As the 21 November election of provincial (and 
directly administered city) delegates approaches, North Korea is 
gearing up its public agitation campaign in order to project the 
election as an extension of the theories of socialist 
superiority and systemic reinforcement applying such propaganda 
as that North Korea's election system is `the most democratic 
and people-oriented.' 
  North Korea, which now elects four-year term delegates in 
accordance with the statute [section 134] prescribed in its 
constitution following the election of provincial (and directly 
administered city) people's assembly delegates in November of 
1989, published lists of voters in every election district for 
the (district election committee) all over the nation on 6 
November and has carried out its agitation campaign for "100 
percent participation, 100 percent `yes' vote," mobilizing the 
government operated broadcast media, every level of organization 
cadre and students/agitators. On 5 November, a Pyongyang 
broadcast pointed out that this election was taking place "in a 
strained situation in which there were constant schemes to 
destroy the our-style socialistic sytem," and emplasized, "We 
must demonstrate that our unfailing unified force around the 
Party and the President will never be broken by any scheme of 
any enemy," relating the election to the international pressure 
on North Korea for its nuclear inspection issue. 
  Meanwhile, KCNA (8 November) was intensifying its drumbeat 
calling for the reception of the election "with combativeness to 
bring about the shining achievement of increased coal 
production" and was urging to commence the battle to accelerate 
the all-out march for the our-style socialist system. 
  North Korea has presented a detailed description of its 
regime's election rules such as "general," "equal," "direct," 
and "secret," stated in its constitution (article 6) through 
Pyongyang radio in a news commentary titled "Most 
People-Oriented Election System Implemented in Northern Half of 
Peoples Republic" immediately after the announcement of delegate 
election. 
<H5>  The First Rule of Election Is "Generality" </H5>
  North Korea maintains that all citizens, 17 years of age or 
older, have the rights to vote and to run as a candidate for an 
election regardless of their gender, national origin, 
occupation, length of residency, levels of income and education, 
political party affiliation, political opinions and religion 
(Article 66 of the constitution), and the working mass do 
participate in an election on unlimited basis. As the result, 
it further maintains, yesteryear's farmhands, odd laborers and 
women, who make up one-half of the entire population, are being 
elected to various levels of elective offices of the regime. 
<H5>  Artificial Rules of "Equality" for Meaningless "Election" </H5>
  However, we can surmise that this rule of "equality" is 
nothing more than a statutory clause in the constitution and has 
no special meaning in practice of real operations. Because, in 
practice, the freedom to vote and to run for an election is not 
guaranteed for all "citizens." 
  In case of the gender issue, it is true that historically 
about 26 percent, in average, of the total delegates elected for 
local people's assemblies were women. However, this is nothing 
but a result of the acceptable safe distribution ratio carefully 
designed artificially based on Workers Party of Korea (WPK) 
policies not only of women but of various sectors and levels. 
We can describe this rule of "generality" as a systemic 
mechanism to carry out efficiently the "unilateral control" by 
bringing in various sectors and levels of the "citizens" into 
WPK one-party dominated political activities, with their 
individual freedom of expression effectively restricted, and 
mobilize them into puppet plays. 
  The second rule, "equality" of election, is to maintain that 
fairness and honesty are assured for election. 
  This is due to the idea that the "generality" rule, which 
enable all of the working mass to participate in an election, by 
itself, could not guarantee the perfect equality. The core of 
the "equality" rule is that no voter would have any "special 
preferential right" and everyone has one vote, election 
districts are based on an equal number of population and each 
district elects one delegate. 
  North Korea's election is a process for one delegate from 
each election district with a population of 30,000, which is the 
unit basis for the electoral division of the country. We do not 
consider North Korea's election, which is an uncontested 
election without a multiple candidacy, which is artificially 
blocked, an election of "equality" that assures "honest 
reflection" of the will of its "citizens," as North Korea 
claims. This is because the election is meaningless as far as 
the will of the electors is concerned for the election not only 
restrict the freedom of candidacy but any candidate once 
nominated would certainly be elected as if "winning by default" 
because electors do not have the choice of electing one among 
several candidates. 
<H5>  Political Mobilization To Rationalize Hereditary System </H5>
  North Korea describes its one-delegate-for-one-district 
election system as "having significance in that each delegate of 
a comparable level people's assembly represents equal number of 
population and , thus, all electoral votes have an equal 
weight." But this is no justification for eliminating a 
competitive election with multiple candidates, and the election 
is nothing but a systemic device to have particular persons 
elected, ignoring the principles of free democratic election 
which prescribe the fundamental rule of majority decision. 
  The undemocratic nature practiced by North Korea in its 
election system is displayed clearly further in selection 
process of candidates and voting mechanism. 
  North Korea maintains that candidates for delegate positions 
are nominated and selected through free debates and expression 
at a "respective resident general meeting" or "work site member 
general meeting." However, a candidate selected at a "resident 
general meeting" in reality neither has the origin nor a 
resident of the district involved. The meeting but performs the 
function of selecting a candidate as directed by the WPK 
disguising the process as if it was the reflection of the local 
residents' will. 
  The selection of candidates by political parties is carried 
out in the same manner. There are such political parties as 
Korean Socialist Democratic Party and Chon-dogyo Young Friends 
Party as North Korea's constitution in its formality permits a 
multiple political party system [Article 67] but they act as 
WPK's satellite organizations and, instead of selecting a 
candidate on their own, follow WPK's directive pertaining to the 
rule of assignment and execute the channelled-down selection 
process. 
  In effect, the instrument called the local people's assembly 
is nothing more than a tool for WPK dictatorial rule consisting 
of delegates handpicked by the WPK and installed by the regime. 
  Following official announcement of the election, WPK opened 
its so-called election campaign by publicly displaying charts of 
election districts and their candidates and reviewing the 
rosters of voters in accordance with the administrative rules of 
the people's assembly election law. 
  The election campaign aims at simply stirring up the 
environment for election by mobilizing General Federation of 
Trade Unions, Agricultural Workers Union and General Federation 
of Culture and Art, which are government-mandated hierarchical 
organizations, Juvenile Corps and Socialist Working Youth League 
which are age-oriented organizations, and Women's League, and 
does little to gain actual votes. This is simply because there 
is no need to go after a vote in the channelled down single 
candidate and uncontested election. 
  North Korea is boasting about its lowering the eligible 
voter's age from 20 as stated in its old constitution (of 1948) 
to 17 (the socialistic constitution of 1972) as a proof for 
implementation of the "generality" election rule but this was 
done in fact, we believe, in order to mobilize student/youth 
organizations such as Juvenile Corps and Socialist Working Youth 
League as vanguard units for election activities. 
  And, the "100 percent voting record" has been achieved 
through the mechanisms such as having voters go to their voting 
place in group formations, rather than individually, under the 
direction of the chief of their people's neighborhood unit, and 
mobile ballot boxes which an election committee brings to homes 
of the elderly and the disabled. 
  The third rule is direct election and secret ballot. 
  North Korea continues its propaganda that its election 
system 
demonstrates the "people-oriented and democratic" nature, 
claiming that the "direct/secret" election rule is "in order to 
assure an election that accurately reflects the people's will." 
This refers but to the window-dressing piece of constitutional 
statute designed for external propaganda consumption and, in 
real practice, it is a widely acknowledged fact that an election 
committtee consisting of representatives of political parties 
and socialist organizations plans and supervises a series of 
election activities and conducts an open ballot election. The 
perfect election record of the past which had shown "100 percent 
approval" is the proof of this fact. 
  North Korea's election system is counter-people oriented in 
that it stresses the "100 percent voter participation" 
irrespective of constitutional provisions or the free will of 
its citizens and is undemocratic in that it manufactures "100 
percent approval" ignoring the free democratic election process. 
North Korea, which is about to have the provincial (and 
directly administered city) delegate election, is unmistakably 
proving that its election is a political mobilization scheme to 
assure establishment of the hereditary succession system of Kim 
Il-song, the father, and his son as its tradition, through its 
agitation campaign for unified political ideology centered 
around Kim Il-song/Kim Chong-il and linking the election to 
fighting against the nuclear inspection pressure it faces and to 
such other issues as for increased coal production.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The United States is 
waiting to apply trade pressure on South Korea until after the 
North Korean nuclear problem is resolved, according to reports 
by American consulting firms commissioned by the Korea Foreign 
Trade Association (KFTA) Wednesday. The U.S. Government 
currently places top priority on resolving the North Korean 
nuclear question and is therefore refraining from bringing up 
trade issues with Seoul, the reports said. Labeling 10 major 
developing economies, including South Korea, as "Big Emerging 
Markets (BEMs), Washington decided earlier to focus on widening 
its access to these markets as this year's top trade policy. 
But it has reportedly made South Korea an exception until the 
North Korean problem is settled. 
  The United States will instead concentrate on improving 
trade 
conditions in Japan and all other BEMs excepting Korea. It has 
chosen Indonesia to test the policy first and is limiting trade 
pressure against Korea to merely "telling what it wants" through 
the bilateral Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) channel, 
the reports said. But Washington is expected to turn up the heat 
on Seoul sometime before June as tensions from the nuclear 
problem slowly ease and the Uruguay Round [UR] act is likely to 
pass congress around then, they said. 
  Its trade demands will aim mainly at Korea's financial 
services market and policy on corporate competitiveness, which 
were excluded from the UR negotiations, and Washington has 
alreadly begun dropping hints through the dec channel to soften 
the blow, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has expressed 
concern over Washington's move to renew Super 301 trade 
legislation that authorizes the U.S. Government to retaliate 
against nations which erect barriers to American products, and 
is even considering multilateral action against future U.S. 
application of the trade act. 
  The U.S. Government is yet to officially confirm the 
reinstatement of the Super 301 clause, a government official 
said Thursday. 
  Nevertheless, Seoul has already told Washington that 
reintroduction of the retaliatory trade act runs counter to the 
multilateral dispute settlement capacity of the World Trade 
Organization [WTO], which will replace the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after the Uruguay Round pact is signed 
next year. 
  The American press reported that President Bill Clinton has 
decided to reauthorize Super 301 in an executive order raising 
tariffs on Japanese imports following the collapse of 
Washington-Tokyo trade talks last month. 
  Though initially aimed at Japan, Super 301 will eventually 
be 
used to widen U.S. access to Korea and affect Korean advancement 
into the American market. 
  Washington has made it clear that it will apply Super 301 on 
non-WTO-bound countries and areas so that its impact is less 
pronounced, the official said. 
  The 1988 omnibus trade act was largely denounced as the most 
retaliatory U.S. tool against countries with which it suffered a 
trade deficit and was finally killed toward the end of 1990. 
  Korea will seek multilateral steps and act strongly against 
any unilateral retaliation by the United States, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- The government will 
closely study the United States' 1,000-page Uruguay Round [UR] 
schedule submitted to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), revised from offers made at last December's 
negotiations, and hold an international policy coordination 
meeting next week to decide whether to make revisions as well 
before handing in its schedule. 
  In its schedule that was turned in late last month, the 
United States offered to cut overall duties on certain items 
rather than abolishing them as promised in the Uruguay Round 
negotiations, Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su 
said Thursday. 
  Seoul has acquired a copy of the U.S. schedule and will 
finish analyzing it in a day or two, he said. 
  If certain revisions are deemed to affect Korean exports 
adversely, Seoul will act accordingly, the trade minister said, 
strongly hinting at changes in Korea's commitment to the UR pact. 
  Korea may eliminate some items on which it had offered to 
abolish duties and hand in the revised version, or consult with 
the European Union, Japan and other countries before submitting 
its amended list, he said. 
  Assistant Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Suk-hwan 
pointed out that the United States made fewer tariff concessions 
than planned because Japan decided not to scrap tariffs on wood, 
leather and non-ferrous products. 
  Therefore, he said, Washington and Tokyo may strike a deal 
before April, when the UR accord concluded in December is due to 
be signed and sealed. 
  Korea will also wait and see how other countries respond to 
the U.S. schedule before making a decision, Chang said. 
  The negotiations on the non-tariffication provision are just 
a small part of the UR tariffication sector and the agreement on 
under-33-percent tariff cuts on industrial goods is effective, 
he explained. 
  Although there may be slight friction over the zero-tariff 
efforts, it is unlikely to impede the signing of the UR 
agreement on April 5, he said. 
  He said the U.S. revisions are not all harmful to Korean 
exports, adding that for some items they may even be 
advantageous.

  [Text] Washington, march 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea poses a 
multiple threat on the Korean peninsula but no extraordinary 
signs of a pending attack have been detected, the chief U.S. 
commander in South Korea said Wednesday. 
  But if South Korea and the United States do detect any sign 
of aggression, they "are prepared to react decisively," Gary 
Luck, commander of the UN Command, said before the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. 
  Asked about deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, 
Luck answered that preparations have been completed to make the 
action possible at any time. But Seoul is unlikely to approve 
the Patriots' deployment unless the United Nations first imposes 
sanctions on Pyongyang. 
  Luck, also commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces 
Command, said he had recommended the Patriots be deployed at 
last year's end. But the plan was suspended due to South Korean 
concerns that it might provoke North Korea. 
  "Even its very name, the 'Democratic Peoples Republic of 
Korea,' is a great lie," said Luck in describing the Stalinist 
state. "North Korea is certainly not remotely democratic nor is 
it a republic by any generally held definition." 
  While Pyongyang continues to "make all manner of bellicose 
verbal threats," there is no sign of pending attack, according 
to the commander. 
  "And you can be sure I am looking long and hard, with some 
of 
the best surveillance and warning systems and most skilled 
military analysts in the world." 
  Despite its deteriorating economy and years of poor havests, 
North Korea continues to mechanize its huge ground forces, 
expand its already massive artillery formations, enhance its 
special operations forces and upgrade its ballistic missile 
arsenal. The biggest danger of war lies in "a serious 
miscalculation" by North Korean leaders. 
  Only the "aging dictator" Kim Il-song knows whether an 
attempt will be made to reunite the peninsula under his control. 
  "We cannot risk a miscalculation by the North," Luck told 
the 
Senate committee. "Their leaders must always know in their 
hearts and minds that they could never win a war on the 
peninsula or even be sure that their regime would remain in 
power after a war."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>
  [Text] The unrealistic approach of the Korean government to 
introduce U.S. technology and to shun U.S. pressure to open the 
Korean markets wider to American businesses has stalled. Seoul 
proposed to Washington the formation of a Korea-U.S. committee 
on industrial cooperation when Trade-Industry-Energy Minister 
Kim Chol-su visited the United States last April. 
  Kim's proposal was aimed at introducing advanced technology 
to wipe out trade disputes by linking Korean and U.S. 
manufacturers through technological tie-ups. But Minister Kim 
seemed unaware of the differences in the economic structure of 
the two countries, an observer said. 
  In Korea, the government is able to easily guide enterprises 
in whatever direction it wants, but in the United States, 
government intervention in private business is impossible 
because of its free market mechanisms, the observer explained. 
Minister Kim proposed to form an alliance between Korea and the 
United States in technology, investment and overseas market 
development in high-tech industries during Washington talks with 
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. 
  During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
conference in Seattle last November, Kim and Brown agreed, in 
principle, that the committee will be launched when trade 
ministers talks are held again this year. 
  Seoul also proposed to form nine subcommittees on 
semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, medical equipment, 
computers, machine tools and power generation facilities, 
environment-related facilities, automobiles and aircraft, a 
Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry official said. But Washington 
has cited various difficulties in proceeding with ahead with the 
bilateral industrial cooperation program under the government 
initiatives. 
  The official is pessimistic about the proposal, citing a 
bilateral science and technology cooperation committee whose 
inauguration has still yet to be seen due to passive attitude of 
the U.S. government although Seoul proposed nearly 10 years ago. 
  Korea has also suggested establishing a fund on industrial 
and technological cooperation each with money provided by each 
government and businesses to carry out projects. 
  Korea has set up a fund this year with 3.2 billion won 
donated by the business circle and 800 million won of state 
subsidy. The government plans to increase the fund to $20 
million (some 16 billion won) by 1997. 
  The government has also drawn up a concrete program on the 
operation of the fund when the subcommittees are established. 
The official said that the fund will be used to support joint 
venture projects, introduction of advanced U.S. technology, 
feasibility studies to sort out areas for possible cooperation 
and exchanges of science and technology researchers. But the 
U.S. government has turned down the suggestion, reportedly 
saying that it is unable to set aside money from its budget and 
to force businesses to donate to that purpose, the ministry 
official said. 
  Korea also proposed that both government officials and 
businessmen participate in the nine subcommittees. But the U.S. 
government objected to the inclusion of public servants in the 
subcommittees, the official said. 
  During the conference of the Dialogue for Economic 
Cooperation (DEC) in Washington last month, the two sides agreed 
to change the subcommittees to private advisory forums composed 
of businessmen from both countries. But the U.S. reiterated 
that public officials should be excluded. 
  As expected, the U.S. government has also faced difficulties 
in arranging for American companies to take part in the 
formation of the advisory forum in each field, although Korea is 
ready to do so, according to the Trade-Industry-energy Ministry. 
  U.S. officials reportedly insist that technology transfers 
can be possible on commercial basis among companies and as a 
result their government can hardly intervene in private 
businesses. 
  Although Minister Kim's idea is good, he does not understand 
the different industrial structure of the two nations, an 
official of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), a private 
interest group of large business concerns. 
  "In fact, there are many sectors for manufacturers of both 
nations to cooperate," the FKI official said, adding that Korean 
and U.S. companies will be able to join hands to advance to 
China with the enormous market potential with U.S. high 
technology and Korea's experience of massive production and 
still cheap skilled manpower. 
  He said, "The urgent problem to be tackled for high-tech 
imports is to create an atmosphere for foreign investment here 
and trust on Korean firms." 
  "Restrictions in the financial sector, acquisition of real 
estate, construction of plants are a great hindrance to foreign 
investment," the FKI official stressed. 
  The WALL STREET JOURNAL recently reported that 220 foreign 
firms withdrew $369 million in investments here in 1992 and 52 
of them completely closed their plants here due to the 
unfavorable business environment.

  [Text] On 1 March, the government decided to actively move 
in building nuclear power plants in China. 
  According to materials submitted to the National Assembly by 
the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the government 
plans to widen the scope of the move into China after forming 
the foundation through technological trainings on and advisory 
support in building and operating nuclear power plants, aiming 
at the ultimate goal of plant exports to China. 
  To achieve this goal, the government has decided to hasten 
the conclusion of an ROK-PRC nuclear energy treaty, which is now 
being negotiated, and as well as make efforts to conclude the 
"ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Treaty," which will practically 
back domestic companies' move into building nuclear power plants 
in China, before the end of this year. 
  The government also plans to unify channels for this and 
make 
a single one to prevent excessive competition among domestic 
companies in building nuclear power plants in China and to build 
a complementary cooperation system. It also decided to seek 
methods of forming a consortium with foreign professional 
companies, if necessary. 
  If negotiations with China are being held smoothly, with 
President Kim Yong-sam's China visit as a momentum, it will 
become possible to promote this by field, such as plant and 
system design (The Technology and Atomic Energy Institute of the 
Korea Electric Power Corporation [KEPOC]), manufacturing of 
machines and materials (Korea Heavy Industries and private 
enterprises), operation and maintenance (KEPOC), and 
construction (private enterprises).

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- Beginning Wednesday, 
foreigners applying for investment in South Korea will be told 
within three hours whether their application forms and other 
supporting documents have been prepared properly and within 15 
days, instead of the previous 30, whether their applications 
have been approved. Moreover, procedures for foreign-invested 
firms to expand into areas not covered by their initial 
investment plans and for foreign investors to sell stocks will 
be greatly simplified. 
  Foreigners may now invest in tourist hotels simply by 
registering their investment plans with the government. 
  These are highlights of the new regulations governing 
foreign 
investment that the Finance Ministry put into effect on 
Wednesday under the revised foreign capital inducement law. 
  Under the new rules, the government cannot reject foreign 
investment in areas where such investment could lead to monopoly 
of or encroachment on the domestic market, though it can still 
reject foreign investment in areas sensitive to public order and 
morals, national security and national health and environment. 
  The business of handling foreign investment applications 
will 
be transferred from the Bank of Korea to all domestic foreign 
exchange banks, effective July 1. 
  The new foreign investment rules are expected to increase 
foreign investment in domestic industries, ministry officials 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Wednesday that Koreans should start forming a vision for a 
unified Korea in the 21st century while striving to maintain 
collective security in the Asia-Pacific region. In an address 
at the commencement ceremony of the Korea Military Academy's 
50th class, Kim said a unified Korea would not be a burden to 
the peace and prosperity of the Asia and Pacific region. 
Rather, it would be a promoter of such ideals, he said. Kim is 
the first civilian president to give a commencement address at 
the military academy in more than three decades. 
  "Responding to the demands of the times, our military has to 
develop into an efficient, scientific, future-oriented and 
internationalized Armed Force," Kim said. 
  "We have to build an Armed Force of quality rather than 
quantity," the president said. The military must undertake 
reform and change not because of demands from the outside, but 
in its own best interests, he said. 
  "As the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of this 
country," Kim said, "I will try to do my best not to betray the 
love and trust of our officers and men." 
  "I'll take a deep interest in building up an elite force and 
improving conditions for professional soldiers," Kim said. 
  The president noted that North Korea is now standing at an 
important crossroads and the world community is gravely 
concerned about its actions. 
  "North Korea will have to guarantee transparency of its 
nuclear safeguards and make sincere efforts to solve the nuclear 
problem peacefully," Kim said. 
  Unless South Korea maintains a strong security setup, it 
cannot expect to attain true independence, Kim said. "We have to 
maintain a defense system that can meet any change in security 
and be alert at all times in this transitory period."

<F P=106> [Article by Reporter Kwon Yong-ki] </F>
  [Text] The process of "filling the Blue House Secretariat 
all-out with officials from the Republican Democratic Party 
[RDP]" has now been completed. If the reshuffle late last year 
of Blue House senior secretaries as well as Cabinet ministers 
and vice ministers and four Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] 
executive officers, signified a change in the "upper strictures" 
of the Blue House, the party, and the Administration, then the 
15 January reshuffle of Blue House secretaries and 
administrators (Grades I through III) was a change in the "lower 
structure" of President Kim's governing system in person. The 15 
January reshuffle signifies the consummation of President Kim 
Yong-sam's direct governing system because it filled the Blue 
House Secretariat--the machinery that assists the president near 
at hand--with people from the RDP faction. 
  The latest reshuffle of the Blue House Secretariat was 
carried out according to the decision on an organizational 
revamping of the presidential secretariat and its personnel 
management that was adopted after long deliberation. Quite a few 
non-RDP people were also appointed. Nevertheless the reshuffle 
of the Blue House Secretariat is out of the ordinary in the 
sense that it signifies an "all-out placement of people from the 
RDP faction in the state machinery." 
  First, Secretary Kim Mu-song (Grade 1) has been reassigned 
as 
second secretary for civil affairs from his former post as first 
secretary for administrative oversight. Kim To (Grade I), former 
secretary for personnel administration under the senior 
secretary for general affairs, is now the first secretary for 
political affairs in the office of the senior secretary for 
political affairs. Kim Kil-hwan (Grade 1), former first 
secretary for civil affairs, is the secretary for civil affairs, 
whose jurisdiction encompasses the combined jurisdictions 
formerly under the now defunct offices of the first and second 
secretaries for civil affairs. Kim Chae-sok, former LDP General 
Affairs Bureau chief, has replaced Kim To as secretary for 
personnel administration. In addition, a number of secretaries 
and administrators from the RDP faction have been promoted. 
Overall, the ratio of secretaries and administrators with the 
RDP background to the total number may not be so high. But we 
should examine the importance of the posts occupied by these 
people from the RDP faction beyond their seemingly inconspicuous 
numerical strength. 
  First, let's begin with the post of the first secretary for 
administrative oversight, which Kim Mu-song occupies by 
succeeding Kim Hyok-kyu, who is now governor of South Kyongsang 
Province. The first duty of the first secretary for 
administrative oversight is to draw up plans for audit and 
inspection, work out programs for oversight, and play the role 
of a clearing house in inter-agency consultations and 
coordination among inspection authorities. In fact, it was this 
secretary who set the direction for the Administration's 
oversight activities for this year. When a joint meeting of 
officials of inspection agencies, such as the fourth coordinator 
at the Office of the Prime Minister, public prosecutors, and 
members of the Board of Audit and Inspection is planned, the 
first Blue House secretary for administrative oversight makes a 
necessary advance arrangement. His second duty is to check and 
evaluate the performances of high-ranking government officials 
with Grade I and above and executive-class officials of 
government-financed organizations. Records of these evaluations 
are used as a reference material in taking personnel actions 
relative to Cabinet ministers and vice ministers and other 
important officials. 
  Kim Mu-song, first secretary for administrative oversight, 
who was the focus of attention in the latest reshuffle of Blue 
House secretaries and administrators, is a younger member of the 
DRP faction who enjoys an unswerving trust of President Kim. He, 
at 43 years old, is the fifth son of Kim Yong-chu (deceased), 
the founder of Chonbang Co., Ltd. His father-in-law is Choe 
Chi-hwan (deceased), who served five terms in the National 
Assembly as an independent and then as DRP assemblyman. When Kim 
Yong-sam opened the Institute for National Affairs in 1983 after 
being released from house arrest subsequent to his hunger 
strike, Kim Mu-song became a managing director of and an expert 
adviser to the institute, thereby joining the Sangdo-tong inner 
circle for the first time [Sangdo-tong is the name of the 
residential block in Seoul where President Kim's private 
residence is located]. Subsequently, he became a member of the 
Council for the Promotion of Democracy [CPD], chief of the RDP 
financial bureau and then of the RDP general affairs bureau, and 
chief of the RDP parliamentary affairs office. In 1992 he became 
the chief of the overall control bureau of the Committee for 
Promoting the Kim Yong-sam Candidacy and a policy affairs 
adviser to candidate Kim Yong-sam. Following President Kim's 
election, he was in charge of the administrative office of the 
Transition Committee. With the inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam 
administration, Kim Mu-song entered the Blue House as second 
secretary for civil affairs. 
  The post of the secretary for civil affairs, which combines 
the duties of the abolished posts of the first and second 
secretaries for civil affairs, is an important post that 
directly assists President Kim in the execution of his 
presidential duties. The duty of the secretary for civil affairs 
is, among others, to keep tabs on the drift of public sentiment 
and report public opinion to the president as it is. It is also 
his duty to report to the president about public reaction to 
actions taken by the president in performing his presidential 
duties. Kim Kil-hwan, who holds this post, entered politics in 
the 1980's as an official of the Democratic Korea Party, and 
subsequently became an expert adviser to the then RDP 
Parliamentary Affairs Committee. After the three-party merger, 
he served as the second chief of the DLP Policy Research Office. 
He is a career party bureaucrat with a DLP background. 
  The post of the second secretary for political affairs, 
currently held by Kim To, has been newly created in connection 
with the latest reshuffle. Yi Won-chong, new senior secretary 
for political affairs, upon assuming his new post, strengthened 
the organization of his office, with particular emphasis on its 
function dealing with government-party relations. In the past 
this function was handled by Yun Won-chung, secretary for 
party-government relations. However, being a person with a DJP 
background, Yun was not too familiar with the inner affairs of 
the opposition parties. Naturally, he neglected matters 
concerning party-government relations. In connection with the 
latest reshuffle, the hitherto single post of the secretary for 
political affairs has been split into two posts, namely the post 
of the first secretary and that of the second secretary for 
political affairs. Yun Won-chung is the first secretary for 
political affairs, and Kim To is the second secretary. This 
means that Senior Secretary Yi Won-chong's range of activity has 
expanded accordingly. 
  Secretary Kim To is an administrative type men belonging to 
the RDP faction, with his secretarial background at Sangdo-tong. 
He joined the Sangdo-tong secretariat during the "Seoul Spring" 
in 1980, but withdrew from politics in the wake of 17 May [1980] 
incident. He returned to the RDP fold following the 13th general 
election in 1988. 
  Kim Chae-sok, 52, who joined the Blue House for the first 
time by replacing Kim To as secretary for personnel 
administration under the senior secretary for general affairs, 
worked as a secretary when President Kim opened his first 
factional office in 1971. He is among the former "veteran" 
members of the Sangdo-tong secretarial staff, and may be 
regarded as one of President Kim's close aides. After quitting 
politics following the 17 May 1980 incident, he returned to 
President Kim's side as chief of the RDP Bureau of Organization 
following the 13th general election in 1988. Last year when the 
LDP carried out a reduction in force for its administrative 
personnel, Kim Chae-sok took command of the downsizing operation 
in person under then DLP Secretary General Choe Hyong-u. Kim 
Chae-sok, a native of Yonggwang, South Cholla Province, is one 
of the few in the RDP faction who hail from the Honam area. 
  The most salient feature of the latest reshuffle of Blue 
House secretaries is that "the president's people on the same 
wavelength" with him were placed on key strategic positions, 
such as those for handling political and civil affairs. When 
President Kim organized his first Blue House secretarial staff 
in last February, some senior secretaries were reluctant to have 
personages from the RDP faction appointed as secretaries under 
them. That is why quite a few of carryover secretaries from 
President No Tae-u's secretariat survived after President Kim 
took over the reins of government. But now their positions are 
held by people from the RDP faction. 
  Reportedly, it has been decided that the newly established 
position of the secretary for planning and coordination (held by 
Kim Kwang-nim, junior grade II-A official dispatched from the 
Planning Board) will only handle matters relating to liaison and 
coordination between the offices of the senior Blue House 
secretaries. The original plan was to have filled this post with 
someone with Grade I from the RDP faction, but it was scrapped 
because the dominant view was against it on the grounds that it 
was like putting a fifth wheel to a coach. 
  The entry into the Blue House by Yi Won-chong as senior 
secretary for political affairs late last year marked the 
beginning of the process of bringing the Blue House secretariat 
completely under the control of personages from the RDP faction. 
Observers say that Senior Secretary Yi Won-chong, together with 
Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong and Hong In-kil, senior 
secretary for general affairs, is doing his best to assist the 
president. In addition to those secretaries who were reassigned 
to other secretarial posts in the latest reshuffle, people with 
the Sangdo-tong secretarial background also occupy other 
important posts in the Blue House Secretariat. They include: Kim 
Ki-su, chief the presidential entourage office; Chang Hak-no, 
chief of Annex I; Chong Pyong-kuk, chief of Annex II; Kim 
Tae-hwan, secretary to the secretary general; and Pak Yong-hwan, 
chief of the Chunchu Hall. Quite a few of former Sangdo-tong 
secretaries are working as administers to assist Blue House 
secretaries. Among them are Yi Song-hon and Kim Yong-chun in the 
office of the senior secretary for political affairs; and Pyo 
Yang-ho in the office of the senior secretary for public 
information. 
  Said a Blue House secretary: "Secretary General Pak 
Kwan-yong 
can now move around pretty lightly with a heavy load removed 
from his shoulders. In the past some senior secretaries 
misconstrued the true intentions of the president, often causing 
delays in the conduct of business. But with the appointment of 
Yi Won-chong as senior secretary and the filling many of the 
secretarial and administrative posts with people from the RDP 
faction, this shortcoming is disappearing."

<F P=106> [By Kim Yu-chong] </F>
  [Text] We are living in a "Hobbesian World" with neither 
eternal comrade nor eternal enemy, and only having national 
interests. With the development of advanced communications, this 
has become a more complex, mutually dependent world, a world in 
which the competition for economic survival is more intense than 
ever before. 
  Under the leadership of the United States, world politics 
are 
being interspersed with conflict and strife. With Japan and 
Germany headed toward their apex, the world economy is evolving 
into regional blocs. The history of confusion and unrest is not 
rolling along; it is moving by leaps and bounds. 
  How are we acting at this point in time? How and where shall 
we find our interests? In the sense that we must act 
independently and autonomously in the international community, 
and are doing so, is the Republic of Korea, as a sovereign 
nation, acting autonomously and carrying out an independent 
policy? The Korean people began to be aware of the nuclear 
issue and policymakers began turning their eyes toward nuclear 
problems or nuclear policy, particularly nuclear policy toward 
North Korea, in 1989, when U.S. and French satellite photographs 
of DPRK nuclear facilities captured the attention of the world 
press. 
  Before then, we only went along with the U.S. NCND [neither 
confirm nor deny] policy (One part of its strategy to restrain 
the DPRK, this was the U.S. policy to neither confirm nor deny 
the existence of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on the Korean 
peninsula.). We have believed the U.S. NCND policy guaranteed 
our greatest security interests and have just followed along 
with it. 
  Later, on 8 November 1991, President No Tae-u made his 
"Denuclearization Declaration," even renouncing nuclear 
enrichment and reprocessing. One month later, after proclaiming 
the "absence of nuclear weapons," he signed the DPRK's 
"Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression and Cooperative 
Exchange Cooperation [Hwahae wa Pulgachim mich Kyoryu e kwanhan 
Hapuiso]," without any mention of the nuclear issue. 
  In this agreement, the government demonstrated an intention 
to pursue a DPRK policy dealing with the nuclear issue and other 
issues "in parallel." Running up against strong U.S. 
dissatisfaction with this, however, the government elucidated a 
"linkage" policy: "If the DPRK nuclear issue is not resolved, 
North-South economic cooperation is impossible." Afterward in 
September 1992, we came to support what could be called the 
U.S.' greatest outstanding issue, the extension of the NPT 
(Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty). 
  There are still two years left until the NPT-extention 
negotiations, and non-nuclear countries, using the NPT-extension 
negotiations as a opportunity, are looking for concessions. 
Despite this, we supported the U.S. desire for an indefinite 
extension, directly and indirectly. 
  The above is a general outline of the 6th Republic's nuclear 
policy. There are more than a few problems with it. First, 
although we can acknowledge that our government's ability to 
collect intelligence is clearly limited because it has no 
independent reconnaissance satellites, it did not come up with 
an appropriate response when the DPRK nuclear issue was first 
raised or when the DPRK admitted to possessing plutonium. 
  The DPRK nuclear issue was brought up a long time ago. Even 
when some experts warned of the possibility of a DPRK-style 
NCND, the government showed no movement on this whatsoever. It 
was only when the domestic media started making an uproar that 
it began to seek a solution to the problem. 
  Second, in its approach to the nuclear issue, the government 
was unable to secure our interests due to a lack of expert 
knowledge. 
  Our nuclear policies can be generally divided into two 
categories: "nuclear-possession policy" and "non-possession 
policy." Pursued by the five nuclear powers, the U.S., Russia, 
China, the United Kingdom and France, the nuclear-possession 
policy maximizes military, political, and diplomatic national 
interests by maintaining nuclear weapons. 
  Although it gives up nuclear weapons, surrendering to the 
pressure of the nuclear powers, the non-possession policy seeks 
to maximize national interests within given conditions by 
obtaining economic and diplomatic concessions while arguing 
against inequality. For various reasons, such as our alliance 
with the United States, we have had no choice but to adopt a 
non-possession policy. Are we, then, getting concessions? 
Unfortunately, we are not. 
  Our government proclaimed its renunciation of nuclear 
weapons 
and even elucidated that it would not maintain the enrichment 
and reprocessing facilities so necessary for the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and for dealing with nuclear waste. The is no 
nation on earth like ours. This was the first time we 
surrendered our autonomous nuclear policy. As a minimum 
concession for giving up nuclear weapons, we should have at 
least obtained a U.S. effort to reduce trade pressures, such as 
pressure to open our markets. 
  Third, the fact that we accept as is the U.S. worldwide 
nuclear policy and its nuclear policy toward the Korean 
peninsula clearly shows our lack of an autonomous nuclear 
policy. We have overlooked the fact that nuclear politics arise 
in the world of the zero-sum game in which one side loses as 
much as the other side gains. Our lack of an autonomous nuclear 
policy becomes even clearer when we look back on U.S. 
interference in our nuclear development. 
  The ambitious nuclear-development program pursued by 
President Pak Chung-hi in the 1970s was frustrated by the U.S. 
(Of course, it can be said that he brought this on himself 
because he pursued it with openly military objectives). Since 
then, even the possession of enrichment and reprocessing 
facilities for peaceful uses has been suppressed. 
  In 1976, a plan to import a "nuclear-research reactor" from 
Canada came to nothing and a plan to import "mixed-nuclear-fuel 
technology" from Belgium was also discontinued because of U.S. 
pressure. 
  The U.S. has applied a first-supress-then-see style of 
pressure against even nuclear technology unrelated to nuclear 
bombs. Considering the elimination of the "seeds of misfortune" 
which may result from the development of nuclear weapons more 
important than the economic loss of a friendly nation, the U.S. 
nuclear-weapons-prevention policy is directly applied to our 
industrial policy. 
  The fourth blunder of the 6th Republic was to include the 
non-possession of enrichment and reprocessing facilities in its 
prohibition against nuclear weapons with its "Denuclearization 
Declaration." Let us say that it was a good thing to declare our 
abandonment of nuclear weapons. Considering the present 
international order keeping small countries from possessing 
nuclear weapons, it is true that an attempt to possess nuclear 
weapons would not be in our national interests. However, why 
did we declare that we would not maintain enrichment and 
reprocessing facilities? 
  The government did not have to include the renunciation of 
enrichment and reprocessing facilities in its Denuclearization 
Declaration, but it did. This declaration was only in the 
interests of the United States, which views the growth of our 
military and economic nuclear potential as contrary to its 
national interests (it has long classified the ROK as a nation 
having the potential to possess nuclear weapons), and 
surrounding nations. This is because enrichment and 
reprocessing are core technologies essential for the nuclear 
energy industry, although they are also needed in manufacturing 
nuclear bombs. Because of this, if a nation receives 
international inspections, then there is not the least legal 
problem with maintaining these facilities. 
  Thus, a legal basis capable of freezing the ROK's nuclear 
potential and closing the DPRK's nuclear facilities within the 
North-South Joint Denuclearization Declaration, which includes 
the abandonment of our enrichment and reprocessing facilities, 
is for the United States and surrounding nations a mechanism by 
which they can effortlessly achieve their aims. 
  Ultimately, our non-nuclear policy conforms well with the 
composition of superpower hegemony. Thus, the nuclear policy of 
the 6th Republic was totally ill-suited for securing our 
interests. This 6th Republic's nuclear-policy failure left the 
new government with pressing problems, that is, with nuclear 
tasks and dilemmas it must resolve. These are urgent issues the 
new government must confront and solve. The first dilemma is 
the possibility that the DPRK possesses nuclear weapons. Even 
though the DPRK has not openly proclaimed that it possesses 
nuclear weapons, the probability is growing that it will carry 
out its own style "uncertainty strategy." Signs of this are 
already appearing. 
  For this strategy to succeed, it must indirectly obscure its 
ability to possess nuclear weapons. The DPRK already boasts 
reprocessing capability. Even while aware that it is a violation 
of the Joint Denuclearization Declaration, it has admitted to 
possessing plutonium. Also, it has carried out approximately 70 
detonation tests and left signs of this. Even while showing 
signs that it is developing nuclear weapons, such as rumors it 
is smuggling plutonium, officially it still maintains that it 
has neither the ability nor the intention to develop such 
weapons. 
  To put it another way, contrary to our government's casting 
off of all such capability by its nuclear-free and 
joint-denuclearization declarations, the DPRK has tricked us 
with the joint declaration and has been successful enough in 
dragging out the nuclear issue to be a psychological burden to 
us. 
  Second, we still needs to decide on a posture concerning the 
possibility of sanctions by the international community against 
the DPRK. If the DPRK is deceptive in the inspections and 
continues its development of nuclear weapons, there is a 
possibility the situation could develop into a head-on collision 
with the nuclear hegemony of the United States. Various senior 
American political leaders have already hinted on several 
occasions of the possibility of military sanctions. 
  Also, the DPRK's continued refusal to accept inspections 
have 
caused the UN Security Council to begin a full-scale search for 
a solution to the problem. This will develop into a UN 
resolution for forced inspections. If even this is refused, 
military action may follow diplomatic and economic sanctions. 
Would this, then, solve the DPRK nuclear issue? 
  It is in no way a simple problem. The threat of war due to a 
DPRK retaliation against the ROK cannot be precluded. This could 
result in the entire Korean peninsula being polluted by nuclear 
radiation. North-South relations would enter their worst 
possible state and the dream of peaceful coexistence and 
unification we have so carefully cultivated would retreat far 
into the background. 
  There can be no change in our fundamental position desiring 
that the DPRK accept inspections. However, it is not in our 
national interests to go beyond what is needed. This is because 
the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) is a mechanism of 
inequality protecting the superpower's nuclear monopoly. 
  Since the collapse of the East-West composition of the 
international order, nuclear southernization [Namgukhwa] 
(attempts by non-nuclear countries to obtain nuclear weapons) is 
increasing. At this time, the IAEA has restored its authority 
weakened by Iraq and is building a strong system outlawing 
nuclear weapons. There is no reason for us to step too far 
forward. 
  Since the nuclear issue will undoubtedly progress along with 
the larger current of "North-South Relations" (the relationship 
between the possessing "North" and the non-possessing "South"), 
being more concerned about what we can do at the level of the 
Korean peninsula, such as reopening North-South talks and 
negotiations on mutual inspections, would be more in our 
interests. 
  Third, an issue we will have to worry about in the future is 
nuclear-energy security. This is because the ROK nuclear-energy 
industry is estimated to have suffered considerable damage with 
the government's elucidation of its abandonment of enrichment 
and reprocessing facilities. Apart from simple economic 
considerations, the maintenance of enrichment and reprocessing 
facilities signifies much in relation to nuclear-energy security. 
  Fourth, the government of the 6th Republic adopted a linkage 
policy as its official position: "Without progress on the 
nuclear issue, we cannot proceed with the issue of North-South 
exchange." This is still accepted as valid. This linkage policy 
has behind it the at-first-glance convincing argument, "North 
Korea is stubbornly persisting in its nuclear development. How 
can we offer economic cooperation?" 
  The problem is that this argument is too uniform. Thus, we 
need to apply a flexible linkage policy. 
  First of all, uniform linkage cannot guarantee a DPRK 
abandonment of nuclear weapons. The first reason for this is 
that inspection is not a perfect means of hindering nuclear 
development. With IAEA inspections, which are hampered by many 
obstacles to inspecting sites other than reported facilities, 
and mutual inspections, which investigate only agreed-upon 
sites, we cannot be 100% sure of a DPRK abandonment of 
nuclear-weapons development. 
  When through exchange we establish a structure of 
interdependence between North and South Korea, destroying the 
military utility of nuclear weapons, we will have found a final 
solution to the nuclear problem. 
  Uniform linkage blocking exchange, therefore, promotes an 
immediate resolution of the nuclear issue, mutual inspections, 
but is actually an obstacle to reaching a final solution to the 
problem. We need to understand this fact. 
  What must be made clear at this point is that bringing up as 
a reason for linkage cordial diplomacy toward allies such as the 
United States and Japan betrays simplistic thinking unable to 
understand the realism of international politics. The reasoning 
that, because these allies maintain the position that they will 
not normalize relations with the DPRK without a resolution of 
the nuclear issue, we must admit that this is illogical. 
  Concerning the nuclear issue, the U.S. and other nuclear 
powers have exercised their influence to prevent all non-nuclear 
nations from gaining nuclear capability in order to maintain 
their nuclear monopoly. Of course, the reflective benefit gained 
by Japan from a denuclearized Korean peninsula is great. 
  We must keep in mind that, viewed from the perspective of 
the 
U.S. and Japan, both of which want a "non-capable" Korean 
peninsula, our linkage policy must seem to be us sacrificing our 
own long-term interests, standing at the forefront of the 
"neutralization of North and South Korea [Nambukhan Muryokhwa]" 
desired by surrounding nations. 
  Fifth is the dilemma created by Japan, emerging as an 
"asymptomatic nuclear nation [mujunghu haekguk]" (a nation 
possessing nuclear weapons that, while not exposing military 
aims, actually has military potential). Apart from its 42 
nuclear power plants presently under operation, Japan maintains 
the advanced nuclear facilities on an enormous scale: 15 
research reactors, two high-speed breeder reactors, two 
converter reactors, nine critical experiment devices, five 
reprocessing facilities, five enrichment facilities, nine 
nuclear-fuel processing facilities, and ten large-scale research 
complexes. In scale and quality, the facilities of North and 
South Korea cannot compare with this. 
  Japan has a plan to expand its existing enrichment 
capability 
to 3,000 tons by the year 2000. Using an advanced laser 
enrichment beam, they can enrich uranium by over 90 percent. 
Furthermore, having built the 210-ton-capacity Tokai factory, a 
large-scale reprocessing factory with a capacity of 800 tons per 
year is now under construction in Aomori and is scheduled to be 
completed by 1995. Japan is presently implementing a plan to 
stockpile large amounts of plutonium. Their reason for this is 
that it is needed for operating their high-speed breeder 
reactors and for their mixed-nuclear-fuel development. 
  Japan receives nuclear inspections and says that it uses its 
nuclear facilities and nuclear material for peaceful purposes. 
When its advanced nuclear technology is combined with existing 
means of transportation, the world's most advanced electronics, 
materials, electronics industry, aviation industry, and space 
industry, it could instantly create a formidable nuclear force. 
  While developing its peaceful nuclear-energy industry, Japan 
ultimately obtained the byproduct of this nuclear-weapons 
potential. Japan carried out brilliant nuclear diplomacy toward 
the United States by retaining enrichment and reprocessing 
facilitates in exchange for its 1967 announcement of its three 
non-nuclear principles. In comparison, one cannot help but think 
we have lost much. The nuclear policy of the 6th Republic did 
not reflect our national interests well and the problems faced 
at that time still remain dilemmas. This was because it lacked a 
deep understanding of the reality of the nuclear world, which 
moves according to the principles of hegemony and the zero-sum 
rule, and of the double value of nuclear power. For us to 
pursue an autonomous nuclear policy, therefore, we must 
understand the economic value of nuclear power used peacefully 
as well as the reality of the nuclear world. 
  One of the two values of nuclear power is the political and 
diplomatic tools, as well as the military tool, gained from 
possessing nuclear weapons. The other is the use of nuclear 
power to expand national interests economically and 
technologically. It has been a long time since the fierce, 
political battle over nuclear power as a means of bringing at 
once both national security and national wealth has become 
normal between actors on the international stage (nations and 
terrorist groups also). 
  This battle gave birth to the nuclear non-proliferation 
system. Its character is represented by "North-South Problems," 
"North-North Problems" and "South-South Problems." That caused 
by the fierce competition and jealously between nuclear nations 
is the North-North Problem. The lack of a security guarantee for 
non-nuclear nations, the distrust among non-nuclear nations, and 
so on, are called South-South Problems. 
  Looking at the North-South Problem of nuclear power in 
relation to the nuclear problems of the Korean peninsula, its 
essence is the inequality between nuclear and non-nuclear 
nations. For example, if we look at the pillar of the nuclear 
non-proliferation system, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT), it has three nominal objectives. These are to prevent 
the lateral proliferation of nuclear weapons, to prevent the 
vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to encourage the 
peaceful use of nuclear power. On closer inspection of the text, 
however, one can quickly see that it is an unequal treaty: it 
permits vertical proliferation, the continued development and 
deployment of nuclear weapons by established nuclear powers, 
while prohibiting lateral proliferation, the acquisition of 
nuclear weapons by non-nuclear powers resulting in their 
emergence as new, nuclear nations. 
  Compared to the time the treaty went into effect, the United 
States and Russia actually have come to possess more than three 
times the number of nuclear warheads. They have developed 
multi-warhead missiles, cruise missiles, and other fearsome new 
weapons. Compared to this, despite the treaty's call for the 
encouragement of the use of peaceful nuclear power by 
non-nuclear nations, this article has in fact been made a dead 
letter by the nuclear powers. 
  Although this is also due to the "dual nature of nuclear 
power," which results in increasing capability for its diversion 
to military uses as a peaceful nuclear industry develops, this 
is really because the Hobbesian instinct of the great powers to 
maintain a monopoly on power has dominated the nuclear order. 
This inequality is even more obvious in the regulations on 
nuclear inspections. They burden nuclear nations with no 
obligation whatsoever to accept nuclear inspections, but make it 
obligatory that non-nuclear member nations conclude a 
saftey-meassures agreement with the IAEA and open all their 
nuclear facilities to international inspection within 18 months. 
This unequal treaty became the textbook of today's nuclear 
world, with its 146 member nations, because of the reality of 
the power difference between the great powers and smaller 
nations. 
  Recently, however, the inequality of the treaty has become a 
point of contention in international, nuclear politics as 
developing nations have gradually begun voicing their opposition 
to it. A heated North-South debate is predicted between nuclear 
nations and non-nuclear nations demanding a price during the 
negotiations on extending the NPT. 
  It is difficult to set up a sound, autonomous nuclear policy 
without an understanding of the economic value of peaceful 
nuclear power. The problematic points of the 6th Republic's 
nuclear policy resulted from a lack of national-policy 
deliberation concerning this. The economic value of nuclear 
power is centrally related to enrichment and reprocessing 
facilities. 
  First of all, "enrichment" is the key to Koreanizing nuclear 
fuel. Of the nine nuclear reactors in use by the ROK, eight are 
light-water reactors using enriched uranium as fuel. As long as 
we have no enrichment facilities, we are doomed to import 
enriched uranium from foreign countries. 
  In the case of the ROK, the fuel fabrication process is now 
done domestically, but possessing no enrichment facilities, it 
is missing one important element for Koreanizing nuclear fuel. 
Because it is a central part of the fuel cycle, without the 
enrichment process we cannot achieve the Koreanization of the 
nuclear fuel cycle, nor can we achieve nuclear-energy security. 
  Possessing eight light-water reactors and having already 
established their economy, we must no longer put off securing 
enrichment facilities. This is even more the case given the 
energy-security nature of the problem. 
  Also, just as with enrichment facilities, as long as we have 
no "reprocessing" facilities, it will be impossible to make our 
nuclear-industry truly advanced. The gains brought by 
reprocessing are as follows. First, reprocessing produces 
several hundred varieties of isotope, including transuranium 
isotope (possible to produce only by reprocessing), used for a 
variety of purposes: medical, agricultural, industrial, 
measuring instruments, chemical compound synthesis, and so on. 
  Second, some uranium remains in the nuclear fuel after use. 
This is also a valuable resource. Third, through reprocessing, a 
valuable resource for nuclear energy, plutonium, is extracted 
from spent nuclear. 
  If the ROK only had reprocessing facilities, it could 
extract 
2.4 tons of plutonium every year from 240 tons of used nuclear 
fuel. Plutonium is used as fuel for high-speed breeder reactors. 
An almost magical nuclear reactor using plutonium as a fuel to 
create new plutonium, the high-speed breeder reactor makes 
possible an epoch-making recycling of resources, extending the 
use of uranium over 60 times. Lastly, reprocessing itself is an 
invaluable, peaceful technology for treating nuclear-energy 
byproducts: it divides and treats resources to be recycled from 
waste material to be disposed of. 
  Abandoning such precious enrichment and reprocessing 
facilities, the "8 November Denuclearization Declaration" was 
nothing more than a result of our obedience to the 
hegemony-seeking, non-proliferation policy of the nuclear 
powers, who seek to prevent both North and South Korea from 
possessing nuclear-weapons potential. Once we possess these 
facilities, we will have considerable political and diplomatic 
influence on the international stage. 
  No lengthy explanation is needed when we consider the gains 
made by the DPRK with one, not even completely built, 
reprocessing facility. At the same time, advanced nuclear energy 
signifies our influence as a people after reunification. As this 
cannot be achieved in a day, we must understand that we are 
wasting precious time. 
  What, then, would be an autonomous nuclear policy? What our 
nuclear policy must be and where we must go have already been 
revealed in the matters discussed above. To enumerate these a 
little more systematically, we must complete two supreme tasks. 
One is that we must wipe out the nuclear threat from our 
immediate enemy, the DPRK. The other is that we must set up a 
nuclear policy preparing for unification, taking into account 
the dual nature of the DPRK as our companion, who together with 
us must achieve unification in the future. 
  To establish and promote an autonomous nuclear policy, 
first, 
we must reverse our abandonment of enrichment and reprocessing 
facilities and secure these facilities as soon as possible. 
Second, we must actively nurture our nuclear-energy industry and 
make an issue of the U.S. discriminatory policy which denies us 
even the "basics" while permitting Japan enrichment and 
reprocessing, as well as allowing it to stockpile large 
quantities of plutonium. 
  Third, by raising our intelligence capability and gaining 
"eyes," we must cultivate a space industry so that we do not 
depend intelligence provided by foreign countries. 
  Fourth, we must clearly renounce military use of nuclear 
power and increase opening and self-inspections one step. We 
must limit to nuclear weapons our "undressing-together" nuclear 
policy toward DPRK and, to the extent that is legal, we must 
switchover to a "dressing-together" nuclear policy (while not 
permitting imbalance between North and South Korea). 
  Fifth, converting from an unconditional linkage policy to a 
selective one, we must search for a North-South dialog 
separating the nuclear and exchange issues. 
  Sixth is elevating our diplomatic image on the international 
stage by participating in Third-World nuclear diplomacy while 
improving the one-sided, Korean-American nuclear relationship, 
making it more of a partnership, 
  If we admit that we should establish and promote an 
autonomous nuclear policy, learning from the 6th Republic's 
nuclear policy, then there is still a chance for us. We must 
play our part in the diplomatic battle to take place in the NPT 
negotiations opening in 1995. 
  In our position, we must hurry the development of nuclear 
energy, if for no other reason than to minimize the dilemmas 
left to us by the nuclear policy of the 6th Republic, in the 
sense of maximizing the use of the dual nature of nuclear power 
and of approaching security and energy issues simultaneously. 
The year 1995, then, will truly be our best opportunity for 
securing the right to unlimited, equal use of nuclear power, by 
making the most of our negotiating ability. 
  As a plan for using this opportunity productively, we can 
first think of a staged approach. First of all, while supporting 
a limited, three-to-five year extension of the NPT, as a 
non-nulcear member, we need to align ourselves with the position 
advocated by the Third World. 
  In the second stage, through negotiations with the United 
States, we receive a guarantee of our right to legitimate, 
peaceful use of nuclear power. The ROK should consider 
supporting an indefinite or 25-year extension of the NPT in the 
third stage, under the condition that our right to the 
autonomous use of nuclear power is secured in the second stage. 
  The ROK must revise the inadequate Korean-American Nuclear 
Energy Agreement [Hanmi Wojaryok Hyopjong] and, while receiving 
inspections, improve its present status as an uninspected 
country unable to handle plutonium. It is obvious that as long 
as we guarantee transparency and comply with international 
inspections, there should be no restrictions on our research and 
development of civilian technology, such as enrichment and 
reprocessing. 
  The past's hasty expression of a "supportive position" 
toward 
the United States is now taboo. We must understand that the era 
has passed in which this form of nuclear diplomacy is justified 
under the name of "diplomatic reality." 
  Nuclear diplomacy must no longer be the exclusive property 
of 
one ministry. We must understand that the time has come when 
there is no problem with most nuclear diplomacy progressing in 
the open after receiving the official approval of the relevant 
organizations and public opinion. 
  In January of this year, we signed a chemical weapons 
treaty. 
In his September, 1992 speech before the UN, President Roh 
Tae-woo said that we would do this, so we had no choice. Of 
course, this signing was done without any mention of the large 
number of chemical weapons maintained by the DPRK. 
  We demanded no concessions of the United States either. The 
"diplomatic-realtiy" logic was once again emphasized: "It's okay 
to give sooner what we have to give eventually, anyway." Nuclear 
policy must not be repeated in this way. 
  It would be absurd for us to promise support for an 
indefinite extension of the NPT before the U.S. begins 
"underwater diplomacy" in earnest.

  [Text] The chief executive officer of a Pohang Iron and 
Steel Co. subsidiary, selected as the major shareholder of the 
projected cellular phone business, said yesterday that he would 
choose foreign partners in a few months through consultation 
with the Federation of Korean Industries [FKI]. 
  "It will take one or two months to tap a few foreign 
partners 
for the second cellular telephone company," said Kwon Hyok-cho, 
president of Sinsegi Mobile Telecomm. "We will soon have 
contacts with the FKI and the Communications Ministry to fix the 
timetable for our new service." 
  Sinsegi was awarded a 15 percent stake in the international 
consortium for the project at the end of two months of intensive 
screening by the FKI that ended Monday. Its rival, Kolon group, 
will have a 14 percent interest. 
  The two large shareholders, which will share management, 
have 
to present a detailed business plan to the ministry by June 30. 
  Under an agreement signed by the FKI leadership and the 
chairmen of Pohang Iron and Steel and Kolon, three to four 
foreign companies will be given a combined share of 20.2 percent 
in the "grand consortium" rearranged by the FKI and composed of 
over 160 partners. 
  Kwon strongly suggested that Qualcom and Tactel, both 
American companies, with which Sinsegi set up partnerships for 
the 1992 and 1994 tenders would be assured of privileges as 
"they have high levels of technologies" though their contracts 
were nullified by the accord. 
  His remarks are likely to invite arguments from former 
partners of other consortia which failed in the bidding. 
  The accord just stated, "Foreign enterprises that promise to 
offer the most excellent technologies at the cheapest cost and 
in more favorable terms will be selected as partners." 
  A total of 11 foreign companies in the three consortia, each 
led by Pohang Iron and Steel, Kolon and Kumho, vied for access 
to the business 
  Foreign partners will be excluded from management. They will 
only have the right to recommend one member of the board of 
directors who will be in charge of technological service. 
  The projected company will begin operation in 1996.

  [Text] According to Plotprasop Suratsawat, the Fishery 
Department director, in the past three months Burma has sunk 50 
to 70 Thai fishing boats and caused the deaths of over 200 Thai 
fishermen by gunshot wounds or drowning. A number of Burmese 
fishermen have also lost their lives. 
  Plotprasop said that although Thai fishing boats were guilty 
of fishing in Burmese waters, Burmese punishment was excessive. 
The Burmese Government is asked to look into the matter. There 
should be a standard in punishing guilty Thai fishing boats, not 
applying violent methods. It is believed that the violent 
action was committed by low ranking sailors who were patrolling 
the sea. In any event, Thailand has asked to negotiate the 
fishing problem with the Burmese Government but there has been 
no response to date.

  [Text] The police arrested of the 17 anti-Burmese 
Government elements of the Mon ethinic group on charge of 
illegal entry into the country early in the morning of 25 
February. One of those arrested was identified as Chaiyot 
Pinsukan, alias "Nai Phayap," a former Kuomintang military 
officer who is regarded as a key man in the Mon leadership. He 
was charged with sheltering illegal immigrants. The arrest, 
which took place only one day before the celebration of the Mon 
ethnic group's national day scheduled at a stronghold at Hub 
Phak border pass in Marid township near the Thai- Burmese 
border, served as a warning for the Burmese minority groups that 
are now engaging in the rebellion against the Burmese Government. 
  A source close to Chaiyot told PHUCHATKAN that the arrest 
was 
definitely politically motivated because Chaiyot and other Mon 
leaders were known to have been active in opposing the 
cease-fire talks between the New Mon State Party and Burmese 
regime. They believe that the cease fire agreement will bring 
an end to their struggle for national liberation. 
  On 24 February, the Mon arrestees lodged a letter with the 
United Nations Office in Bangkok to demand the separation of 
their area from Burma and complain about Mons being deprived of 
their human rights by the Burmese Government and the eviction of 
the Mon refugees in Kanchanaburi Province. 
  The source disclosed that the arrest took place at about 
0600 
on 25 February when immigrantion police and officers from the 
Police Special Branch raided a house on Soi Ramkhamhaeng in 
Bangkapi District of Bangkok. Chaiyot reportedly used the house 
as his office and a shelter for the Mon during their stay in 
Thailand. 
  However, some of the Mon were later released because they 
could produce official permits allowing them to travel outside 
the restricted areas. 
  Meanwhile, Chaiyot is still being detained at the 
Immigration 
Police Command Headquarters. His Taiwanese wife is seeking 
legal help to bail him out. Earlier, Special Police Branch was 
keeping a close surveillance on Chaiyot's movements because the 
Thai Government feared that the activities of the Mon rebels on 
Thai soil might damage relations between Thailand and Burma and 
create obstacles to the ongoing cease-fire talks between the 
Burmese Government and minority groups. 
  During an interview granted to PHUCHATKAN prior to his 
arrest, Chaiyot claimed that he had 5,000 Mon soldiers under his 
control to fight the Rangoon regime. He stressed that he would 
continue to lead the struggle against the Burmese Government 
even if the New Mon Party signed a cease-fire agreement with the 
Burmese authority, saying that he was not afraid of being 
arrested. He said: "You only die once. They can do anything 
with me." 
  However, Nai Aung Tin, secretary general of the executive 
committee of the New Mon State Party, told PHUCHATKAN in an 
interview during the celebration of the Mon national day in 
Marid that Chaiyot does not play any role in the party. He is 
an outsider who used to support the party. 
  It was reported that the Burmese Government and four ethnic 
groups, namely Kachin, Red Wa, Kokang, and Palaung have now 
agreed to a cease-fire. The Karen, Karenni, and Mon are the 
only three groups that are still at odds with Rangoon. The 
Karen once requested Thailand to host peace talks, but the Thai 
Government rejected their request.

  [Text] SYDNEY, March 3 (AFP) -- Australia will urge the 
United States in ministerial talks next week to nurture its role 
as a force for stability in the Asian region by making clear an 
awareness of regional sensitivities, officials said here 
Thursday. Australia believes that, being closer to the region, 
it has developed a greater awareness of these sensitivities and 
that it has "some perspectives on this that might be usefully 
conveyed" to Washington. 
  They will be conveyed to a U.S. delegation led by Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher and Under Secretary of Defence Frank 
Wisner, who are due in Canberra Monday for bilateral 
discussions. Warren [Christopher] will leave Wednesday for 
meetings in Beijing and Tokyo after a day and a half of talks 
with the Australian delegation led by Foreign Minister Gareth 
Evans and Defence Minister Robert Ray. 
  It is Australia's first ministerial meeting with senior 
officials of the Clinton administration following postponement 
of a talks originally scheduled for Cairns last July. "It's an 
imporant opportunity for us to reaffirm the alliance ties and 
for us to have an influence on US policy development," an 
Australian official told a media briefing here. 
  "One of our objectives is to bolster US perceptions of 
Australia as an active participant in the region, a responsible 
player and an ideas generator for the region." Australia will 
take the opportunity to impress upon its closest ally and 
largest trading partner after Japan the view that it should work 
to sustain what is seen as a well respected role as a regional 
force for stability. 
  "For that to be sustained I think the US has got to show an 
awareness of regional concerns and regional sensitivities, 
something we feel that we in Australia have developed a little 
more of in recent years," said the official. Australia would not 
lecture the United States, but wanted to indicate its view that 
Washington is still needed and wanted as a major player in the 
region. 
  Canberra is also keen on the eve of Christopher's visit to 
Tokyo to see an early settlement of the US-Japan trade dispute 
over the trade imbalance favouring Japan. Australia did not take 
sides and supported Washington in its efforts to open Japanese 
markets further and bring Japan more into the sort of trading 
patterns that exist elsewhere. But the official added that 
Australia also shared Japanese concerns about the imposition of 
quantitative indicators in particular market sectors. Canberra's 
view is that if Japan opens its markets in particular areas they 
should be open to all countries, not just the United States, and 
if their dispute cannot be resolved it might be referred to the 
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). 
  Canberra will also raise the issue of renewal by Washington 
of its Most Favoured Nations (MFN) trading status in China, 
which is dependent on a judgment about human rights. "There are 
also questions of sanctions that the US has in place against 
high technology exports because China has refused to commit 
itself to the missile technology control regime guidelines, 
something which affects us," the official said. Australia had 
human rights concerns with China, but did not tie them to trade, 
the official said, commenting: "In essence we are singing from 
the same songbook, but we don't have a linkage with trade."

  [Text] A Fiji's opposition leader says Indians will not 
accept the place in the government of Prime Minister Sitiveni 
Rabuka until there are changes to Fiji's constitution. This 
comes after Mr. Rabuka, after being reelected prime minister 
following the recent Fiji elections, said he hoped the 
Government of National Unity could be formed within the next 
five years. [sentence as heard] 
  Opposition Leader Jai Ram Reddy says before that can happen 
there must be a review of Fiji's 1990 constitution, which he 
says discriminates against Indians and ensures they remain in a 
parliamentary minority. Terms of reference have been agreed for 
a constitutional review, which must be completed by 1997. In 
last month elections, Mr. Reddy's National Federation Party won 
20 of the 27 seats set aside for Indians in Fiji's 70-seat 
parliament. Indians make up 45 percent of Fiji's population.

<F P=106> [By Marichu A. Villanueva] </F>
  [Text] The Senate yesterday ratified two Philippine 
treaties with India which will ease the exchange of economic and 
technical information and enhance the transfer of technology 
between the two countries. Senator Blas Ople, chairman of the 
Senate foreign relations committee, secured the passage in 
second reading of the two Philippines-India treaties, bringing 
to 25 the total number of treaties so far ratified by the Senate 
since the 9th Congress started in July, 1992. 
  Ople also pushed for the Senate ratification of the 
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the 
Convention on Assisting in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or 
Radiological Emergency. In his sponsorship speech for the Senate 
concurrence of the two Conventions related to nuclear accidents, 
Ople cited that this international agreement will place the 
Philippines within the protective umbrella of an international 
commitment to provide assistance in case of nuclear accidents. 
  The first treaty with India concurred in by the Senate, 
involves economic and technical cooperation in research and 
design, delivery and installation of plants, machineries and 
equipment and technical assistance in the field of industrial 
research, nuclear energy, engineering, telecommunications, 
agricultural and industrial research. 
  The other treaty with India ratified by the Senate calls for 
the scientific and technological cooperation which provide for 
the exchange of scholars, training programs and information 
exchange on metallurgy, silkworm culture, textile development, 
and low level technology which could be applied to countryside 
development program. 
  Ople said that even before the two treaties were ratified by 
the Senate, the Philippines and India have already put them into 
effect when Filipino scholars and trainees went to India to 
participate in research programs in agriculture, nuclear energy 
generation, industrial chemicals and health programs. 
  Meanwhile, Ople urged his colleagues at the Senate to also 
ratify with dispatch the two Conventions related to nuclear 
accident in the light of dangers it poses to mankind. Ople 
specifically pointed out the presence of nuclear reactors in 
neighboring countries of the Philippines within the 500 miles 
range. These countries, he said, include Taiwan which is 240 
kilometers from Laoag, 795 kilometers from Manila with six 
nuclear reactors in operation and is building two more, Japan 
has 42 nuclear power plants, including two fueled by "highly 
dangerous" plutonium; China has one nuclear power plant and 10 
research reactors; South Korea has five nuclear reactors, and 
North Korea with seven nuclear reactors and which continues to 
resist UN inspection on the real status of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  Under the two Conventions in which the Philippines is a 
signatory, the government would be in a position to demand from 
the erring country, through the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) or its neighbor for technical and technological 
assistance to prevent the effects of radiation from nuclear 
accidents. 
  "The early notification would allow us to protect our people 
and our land from the spreading nuclear poison," Ople pointed 
out. "It is imperative that we become a party to these two 
conventions," he stressed. Ople recalled the Chernobyl accident 
in Russia where radioactive emissions were wind-carried to 
neighboring countries and demonstrated to the world the horrors 
of a nuclear accident.

  [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] denied 
yesterday it was participating in peace talks with the 
government next month. In a statement, NDF Vice Chairman Luis 
Jalandoni branded the information as a form of "disinformation" 
aimed at "diverting attention from the current massive protests 
of the people against Mr. Ramos' policies." 
  Former Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello was recently quoted 
as saying he received a communication from exiled communist 
leader Jose Ma. Sison announcing the holding of preliminary 
talks either in Europe or Vietnam next month. 
  Jalandoni said the claim was untrue and baseless. Indicating 
that the talks have even become uncertain, he said, "The NDF 
leadership, in considering possible preliminary or exploratory 
talks between the NDF and the government of the Republic of the 
Philippines, is taking into account the deep and widespread 
anger of the people against the Ramos regime's imposition of 
intolerable burdens on them, while continuing to be subservient 
to the IMF and World Bank and the foreign monopolies." 
  He also protested the government's recent move allowing 
detained rebel Arturo Tabara to be temporarily released on bail. 
Tabara is among the so-called rejectionists in the communist 
movement who are opposed to the leadership identified with 
Sison. By releasing Tabara, Jalandoni said the government was 
merely coddling "renegades and expellees" from the Communist 
Party of the Philippines. "If the Ramos regime is indeed serious 
in improving the climate for peace talks, it should release the 
more than 350 political prisoners," he said. Jalandoni accused 
the government of disinterest in the peace efforts and of 
resorting again to "psywar schemes." 
  Meanwhile, Sen. Rodolfo Biazon (Laban) [Lakas ng Bayan -- 
People's Power] yesterday urged President Ramos to declare an 
eight-day unilateral cease-fire during the Holy Week, in 
observance of the Lenten season. The suspension of offensive 
military operations (SOMO), Biazon proposed, should run from 28 
March to 24 April, four days longer than the usual cease-fire 
period government declares during the Holy Week. 
  Biazon pushed for an extended Lenten cease-fire due to the 
success of the extended cease-fire government declared last 
Christmas season. Traditionally, government declares a six-day 
cease-fire during the holiday season, but last year, it declared 
a 17-day SOMO, which Biazon said gave both soldiers and rebels 
and the people in the affected communities a respite from the 
armed struggle.

  [Excerpts] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan 
[Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance -- RAM] is far from being a 
weak and spent force as government alleges, said RAM leader 
Gregorio Honasan, who added the RAM still possesses "significant 
firepower," including light anti-tank weapons and other 
high-powered firearms. 
  Honasan said the government does not know the real strength 
and manpower of the movement. "No matter how the information 
machinery and the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] tries to 
dig on us, they still don't know who we are, how many we are, 
and where we are." [passage omitted] Honasan said the RAM will 
surrender its firearms only when the ongoing peace talks end in 
a "comprehensive political settlement." He said RAM leaders have 
given the peace talks another year before declaring them a 
failure.

  [Text] San Fernando, Pampanga -- Two New People's Army 
rebels were summarily liquidated and not killed in an encounter 
with government troopers as police had reported, the Task Force 
Detainees [TFD] of the Philippines Pampanga Chapter said. 
  Police said Mario Bagain alias Ka [Comrade] Jayson and Ka 
Benjo, a member of the Mariano Garcia Brigade -- a liquidation 
squad based in Mabalacat town and reportedly involved in the 
killing of two American servicemen at the former U.S.-run Clark 
Air Base -- and Rico Gutierrez alias Archie, were killed in a 
pre-dawn encounter 9 February with the police in Barangay 
[village] San Antonio, Mexico town. 
  During a rally, leaders and members of the TFD Pampanga, 
Bagong Alyansang Makabayan [New Nationalist Alliance], League of 
Filipino Students, Kilusan ng Kababaihan Kapampangan-GABRIELA 
[Movement of Women from Pampanga-General Assembly Binding Women 
for Reforms, Integrity, Equality, Leadership, and Action], and 
other cause-oriented groups, said the rebels were "salvaged" by 
policemen. 
  Sonia Sotto, secretary-general of GABRIELA in Central Luzon, 
said residents of Mexico town told human rights representative 
that policemen belonging to the San Fernando-based 172d Mobile 
Force Co. under Superintendent Lino Calingasan went to Barangay 
San Antonio early dawn of 9 February, herded all the men in an 
open area, and picked out the two rebels. They said the two were 
shoved into a tinted car and were shot them in their presence. 
[as published] 
  Sotto said the cops also picked up three other male 
residents, including the father of Gutierrez, Roberto, for 
tactical interrogation, released them later, she said. [as 
published] Sotto said the policemen warned villagers not to say 
anything before they left.

  [Text] President Ramos said yesterday factionalism in the 
military, if it exists, is not a threat to the country's 
stability. It should, however, be the responsibility of the AFP 
[Armed Forces of the Philippines] chief of staff "to make sure 
that there is no disunity in the armed forces," he said. 
  In a press conference in Romblon, the president said: "I do 
believe that because of the efforts being done by the government 
and the cooperative response of many of the members of the 
so-called RAM [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan -- 
Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], this disunity need not be 
considered as a threat to the stability of the country because 
that is to me, now of much smaller proportions." But, the 
president said, "It (factionalism) remains a challenge to the 
leadership of the Armed Forces to overcome, if indeed it exists." 
  The president's statements appear to be a light admonition 
to 
General Lisandro Abadia, AFP chief of staff, who said Friday 
that factionalism still haunts the armed forces as he disclosed 
that the military rebels are still making the rounds of military 
camps.

  [Excerpts] Armed Forces Chief Gen. Lisandro Abadia admitted 
yesterday the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] continues to 
be plagued by factionalism within its rank and file. Without 
identifying the supposed factions, the retiring AFP top man was 
obviously referring to the rebellious Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang 
Makabansa [RAM], Soldiers of the Filipino People, and the Young 
Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU). The group which is headed by 
cashiered Army Col. Gregorio Honasan has been responsible for 
the series of attempts to overthrow the former Aquino Government. 
  "Factionalism still hounds the AFP. The RAM, for instance, 
is still making the rounds among AFP personnel. Umiikot pa rin 
sila [They are still moving]," Abadia said when interviewed 
during yesterday's commemoration of the February 1986 
Revolution. Abadia was referring to the series of consultations 
of RAM in various military camps aimed at popularizing the 
ongoing peace process among soldiers and military personnel. 
  He likewise scored the persistence of the "bata-bata 
[patronage] system" in the military establishment which, he 
said, contributes to the harboring of discontent among AFP 
officers. "We should really go back to the merit system in the 
promotion of our officers. We should do away with the bata-bata 
systems," he said. 
  Abadia recently revealed he had been asked by several 
politicians and businessmen to stage a coup before the national 
elections in 1992. But he said he flatly refused the overtures 
made by the group saying he wanted to give democracy a chance. 
[passage omitted] 
  In a related news, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said 
the 
government should not be faulted for the delay in the release of 
six RAM members contrary to complaints aired by the RAM. Drilon, 
in a memorandum for President Ramos said Sergeants Alberto 
Caoili, Fernando Casanova, and Victoriano Cordova have been 
confined in respective local jails pursuant to the order of the 
courts and can only be released upon the order of said courts 
which acquired jurisdiction over their respective cases. He said 
that appropriate motions for the temporary release of the three 
on recognizance were filed but the courts concerned denied the 
said motions. Clearly, he said, the prosecution cannot be held 
responsible for their continued detention. 
  Caoili and Cordova are facing charges of illegal possession 
of firearms and ammunition. The nature of Casanova's case was 
not established, though it was reported to be a bailable one. On 
the other hand, Drilon said Sergeants Antonio Soriano, Orlando 
Ayeras, and Willy Marayag were not among the RAM/SFP/YOU members 
in the list which was the subject of the president's order for 
release dated 23 December 1992.

  [Excerpts] A senior officer and one of the pioneers of the 
Revolutionary Nationalist alliance-Young Officers Union 
(RAM-YOU) yesterday asked Armed Forces Chief General Lisandro 
Abadia to stop making the military rebel group as his "whipping 
boy" for his failure to unify the military. Former Philippine 
Constabulary Lieutenant Colonel Billy Bibit, said RAM-YOU 
members are making rounds inside the various military camps but 
stressed that they were just visiting former classmates. 
  According to Bibit, his group should not be denied access in 
visiting classmates and friends still in the military service. 
"We are visiting our friends. What do they want, that we don't 
visit our friends anymore; isn't it normal for us to go and 
visit them because we also used to be in the AFP?" Bibit asked. 
"If they've failed in their mission (to unify the AFP), they 
shouldn't point a finger at anyone. They can't use us as their 
"whipping boys," he added. [passage omitted] 
  Bibit said unifying the AFP is a difficult undertaking, and 
it was the primary objective of the RAM (formerly called the 
Reform the AFP Movement) after the 1986 civilian backed military 
uprising which toppled President Marcos from power. "But after 
three or four months, the RAM backslided because of patronage 
system," Bibit said. 
  Bibit disclosed that military officials have already 
identified the patronage system as contributing factor in the 
growing discontent in the military ranks, but only failed to 
neutralize them. "They know what they are supposed to do but 
nobody dares to for fear of their own security, or let us say, 
you are not popular if you do not have proteges," Bibit said. 
  One of the advantages in the patronage system, according to 
Bibit, is having better opportunities for schooling abroad, 
promotion and good assignments.

  [Text] The Abu Sayyaf problem will not die the way other 
insurgent groups might, a Basilan official said yesterday. This, 
according to Gov. Abdulgani "Gerry" Salapuddin, is because the 
Islamic religion is being used to fuel the commitment of the 
group's members to turn Mindanao into an Islamic state. Basilan 
is where the group started to gain prominence and followings. 
It was founded by Islamic leader Abdulajik Janjalani. The 
military has described the group as "the third force" to reckon 
with in Mindanao, after the Moro National Liberation Front 
[MNLF] and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). 
  "This (Abu Sayyaf problem) is more difficult to solve than 
mere insurgency," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER. He said the 
insurgency problems are rooted on political and economic 
factors. Once these factors are addressed in a sustained manner, 
"the issue will die down by itself," he said. "But not 
extremism because ideas and beliefs don't die." It is likely, he 
said, that the group will not give in to any concession short of 
the establishment of an Islamic government in Mindanao. Abu 
Sayyaf members are ready to die for their cause, believing they 
will go to heaven (or surgah) if they die fighting. 
  Salapuddin, a former MNLF commander, continued: "They will 
be accorded martyrdom by Allah if they are killed in combat. 
This is what new members are taught. It is difficult to 
re-orient them otherwise." It is the appeal on religious 
extremism, Salapuddin said, that contributes to the growing 
appeal of the group to new members in Mindanao and in Metro 
Manila. "Extremism catches fire," he said. 
  Moreover, the group is reported to be targeting both the 
Muslim intellectuals and the poor fishermen "who are not 
educated enough to know the true meaning of Islam." But the 
majority of more than four million Muslims here are reportedly 
not supportive of the cause and ideal propagated by the Abu 
Sayyaf. "Islam espouses moderation, anything that is extreme is 
not what Islam teaches," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER. 
  He urged local government leaders in Mindanao to mobilize 
the 
local "moderate" Muslim leaders to "counter the spread of 
extremism," which had reportedly reached many Muslim-populated 
barangays [villages] in Mindanao and Metro Manila. 
  Meanwhile, he said the top leaders of the Abu Sayyaf have 
left Basilan for other places in the country. He could not say 
where they have gone to, but he gave this hint: "Where bombs are 
exploding, where terroristic activities are -- you can guess 
they have leaders there."

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 2 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
and his Singaporean courterpart, Mr Goh Chok Tong delivered 
speeches at a banquet here this evening in honour of the 
latter's current official visit to Vietnam. 
  In his speech, P.M. [Prime Minister] Kiet said: 
  `This visit of yours is the first official one to our 
country 
ever in history by a head of government of Singapore. It takes 
place only five months after the visit to Singapore by 
Secretary-General Do Muoi and four months after the second visit 
to Vietnam by his excellency Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. This 
clearly proves that our friendly and cooperative relationship 
has been incessantly growing in an broadening scope and with a 
deepening and intensifying nature. 
  `It gives me great pleasure to note that, since my last 
visit 
to Singapore in October 1991, in line with the agreements and 
arrangements which have been concluded to form a foundation for 
the cooperation between our two countries, the volume of two-way 
trade and particularly the investment in Vietnam by Singapore 
have been increasing considerably. Singapore friends have 
shared with us development experience, particularly in the key 
area of infrastructure in which Singapore has proven strength 
and Vietnam is interested. We greatly appreciate your valuable 
ideas and suggestions, and assistance in training Vietnamese 
personnel in various fields through the Indochina Assistance 
Fund. I strongly believe that, your present visit and the 
signing of the avoidance of double taxation agreement will help 
further enhance the sound cooperation between our two countries 
for the sake of prosperity of our respective countries and of 
the region. 
  `In the recent years, the global and regional situation has 
been changing greatly and profoundly. In the panorama of mixed 
colours, the striking feature is the shared desire by nations 
for a peaceful and secure environment for development, and the 
growing trend of regional cooperation. Against this overall 
context, the trend of peace, cooperation and development in our 
region is all the more highlighted. Nowadays, Southeast Asia is 
in the most favourable condition ever since the end of the 
Second World War to lay down a foundation for cooperation in the 
interest of durable peace and prosperity of the entire region. 
Besides most encouraging achievements as a result of the 
correct policy of `Doi Moi', in overcoming the socio-economic 
crisis, in developing the economy and maintaining political 
stability, Vietnam has recorded new successes in pursuing the 
foreign policy of independence, sovereignty and openness in the 
direction diversification and multilateralization. Our primary 
interest is to further expand and strengthen cooperation with 
the countries in the region, both bilaterally and 
multilaterally. We stand ready to be hand in hand with the 
Southeast Asian peoples to proceed towards a future of peace, 
independence, prosperity and development. 
  `It is my firm conviction that your visit will not only 
strengthen further the relations of friendship and cooperation 
between our two countries, but also contribute to peace, 
cooperation and development in Southeast Asia. 
  Prime Minister Kiet went on: 
  `We are indeed very satisfied with the results of the 
exchanges of views we have had today. Mutual understanding and 
confidence between us have been enhanced, areas of cooperation 
broadened and promise brilliant prospect. Your visit will 
therefore certainly mark a new development in the 
Vietnam-Singapore cooperation'. 
  In his turn, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said `Your 
excellency's visit to Singapore in October 1991 opened a new 
chapter in our bilateral relationship. Since then, our 
relations have strengthened rapidly, with several exchange 
visits of top leaders. 
  The Indochina Assistance Fund has been used to fund 
technical 
assistance programmes for your country. Singapore has also 
established the infrastructure task force to help Vietnam in its 
development. We are pleased to share our development experience 
with you and to help Vietnam plan and build its infrastructure. 
  `Singapore is now Vietnam's largest trading partner and 
eighth largest investor. The Singapore private sector has 
demonstrated its confidence in Vietnam through its increasing 
investments. I hope that my visit here will pave the way for 
more trade and Singapore investments in Vietnam'. 
  P.M. Goh Chok Tong continued: `Vietnam now has some 
experience working with foreign investors. It has already 
achieved good economic growth rates in the last two years. You 
are blessed with abundant natural resources and a hardworking, 
intelligent workforce. If Vietnam presses on with its `Doi Moi' 
and makes foreign investors feel welcome, it can be another 
dynamic east Asian economy. 
  `We welcome your accession to the treaty of amity and 
cooperation in Southeast Asia. 
  Your foreign minister is now a regular participant at the 
annual ASEAN ministerial meetings. 
  Vietnam is also one of the charter-members of the ASEAN 
regional forum [ARF], which will meet again soon to discuss 
regional political and security cooperation issues. 
  We hope that through both ASEAN and the ARF, our 
relationship 
will not only broaden but also deepen. 
  Together, we can work to safeguard Southeast Asia's 
security'.

struggle for a new world economic order and the great role of 
the Non-Aligned Movement and the `Group 77' in this struggle. 
They also agreed to promote and strengthen south-south 
cooperation. 
  Vice President Binh conveyed President Le Duc Anh's 
invitation to President Conte to visit Vietnam. The Guinean 
president accepted the invitation with pleasure. 
  At the end of the visit, the two sides signed an agreement 
on 
economic, cultural, scientific-technological and commercial 
cooperation, and issued a joint communique. Vice President 
Nguyen Thi Binh left Guinea yesterday for Guinea-Bissau, the 
fourth leg of her Africa tour.

  [Text] The midterm party conference of the sixth Hai Hung 
Province party organization opened this morning, 1 March, at the 
Hai Duong district capital. Comrade Dao Duy Tung, member of the 
Political Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee, 
is attending. 
  Comrade Pham Van Tho, member of the party Central Commmittee 
and secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a 
report to the conference. According to the report, after 
scoring outstanding achievements and effecting a considerably 
high economic growth rate over the past three years, Hai Hung is 
now adopting new measures to shift to the commodity economy and 
effect economic restructuring in the direction of the market 
mechanism. The average gross domestic product for the last 
three-year period increased by 7.85 per cent, which is 2.3 times 
higher than that of the previous five-year period. The 1993 
grain output reached 1,252,000 tons and the local industrial 
output accounted for 29.2 per cent of the overall national 
industrial product. The average export index reached 9 million 
dollars. 
  The report of the provincial party organization's executive 
committee also pointed out Hai Hung's shortcomings as follows: 
The local economy still depends entirely on agriculture and is 
unstable. The pace of development of the commodity economy is 
slow. Production operations are scattered. Agricultural 
products processing and consumption is still rife with many 
difficulties. Unemployment constitutes a burning problem. 
  Hai Hung is making efforts to ensure that from now until the 
conference of the seventh provincial party organization it will 
achieve an average increase of more than 9 percent in the gross 
domestic product; formulate an overall economic development plan 
under which agriculture will account for 40 percent of overall 
production, industry for 30 percent, and the service sector for 
30 percent; apply uniform measures to boost the multisectorial 
economic growth; make continued efforts to renovate and perfect 
the mechanism and economic management system, create a favorable 
environment for the development of the commodity economy, 
resolve social problems, renovate and revamp party 
organizations, and strengthen the relations between the party 
and people.

full strength of 1,520 megawatt with the installation of its 
eighth and last turbine. The installation of the 670-tonne 
turbine was completed at the Hoa Binh plant on the Da River 
southwest of Hanoi on Friday. The giant hydroelectric scheme, 
which has taken more than 10 years to complete and was one of 
the former Soviet Union's main foreign aid projects, was 
finished in time for the major diversion of power from the 
surplus north to the deficit south. Inauguration of the new 
1,500-km north-south transmission line is scheduled for 5 April.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 3 (KCNA) -- The fourth working 
contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and the South was held behind closed doors in the South 
side's portion of Panmunjom today. 
  The contact was resumed by the North side's sincere efforts 
four months after the third contact was held in October last 
year. 
  After the contact, the head of the North side's delegation 
met with home and foreign reporters on the spot and briefed them 
on its results. 
  According to him, the North side said the way of breaking 
through the difficulties smoothly and at the earliest date at a 
time when the danger of a nuclear war is menacing the nation is 
to remove the obstacles to the exchange of envoys. It urged the 
South side to stop all the large-scale nuclear war exercises 
against its dialogue partner, give up seeking an "international 
cooperation system," cancel the projected introduction of 
Patriot missiles and withdraw its remarks that it "could not 
shake hands" with its dialogue partner. 
  The South side, however, made it impossible to discuss 
working procedures concerning the exchange of envoys, repeating 
its far- fetched argument in a bid to justify its unreasonable 
stand towards dialogue. 
  The sides agreed to have the next working contact at the 
Tongil House in the North side's portion of Panmunjom on March 9.

  [Text] According to a report of Christian Broadcasting 
Network in Seoul, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Hubbard, in a speech made at the American University on 25 
February, called for the abolition of the National Security Law 
in South Korea. 
  Meanwhile, in a public session on 1 March, a U.S. Department 
of State spokesman confirmed that the U.S. deputy assistant 
secretary of state's remarks calling for the abolition of the 
National Security Law were made by a responsible authority and 
reveal [palkida] the U.S. official position. 
  Faced with the U.S. side's position urging the abolition of 
the National Security Law, the South Korean authorities and the 
Democratic Liberal Party went around busily reacting with 
remarks about interference in domestic affairs and so forth. 
  On the other hand, a spokesman of the opposition Democratic 
Party, said that the U.S. side's expression of its official 
position calling for the abolition of the National Security Law 
is, in terms of universal principles, rightful [tangyonhan], and 
strongly urged the authorities to abolish the National Security 
Law.

Korea" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- Hubbard, U.S. deputy 
assistant secretary of state, speaking at a seminar sponsored by 
American University on February 25, demanded the abrogation of 
the "National Security Law" (NSL) in South Korea, the 
Seoul-based "CBS" reported. 
  On March 1, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department 
confirmed that the remark of Hubbard, a senior U.S. Government 
official, publicly demanding the repeal of the "NSL" reflects 
the official position of the United States. 
  The South Korean authorities and the "Democratic Liberal 
Party" side now are much upset by it, calling it an 
"interference in their internal affairs". 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the opposition Democratic Party 
of 
South Korea in a commentary strongly demanded the authorities 
repeal the "NSL", saying it is natural in view of universal 
principles that the U.S. side manifested its official stand 
urging the abrogation of the "NSL".

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] On 3 March, Seoul vernacular newspapers 
react to Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, 
who expressed the hope that the "ROK would abolish the National 
Security Law." 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "United States and the National Security Law." 
  It first says that abolishing the National Security Law is 
not a matter that a third country can intervene in, and adds 
that, unlike what he has said, the law does not exist to hinder 
the promotion of human rights in the ROK, and that he should 
have been cautious in commenting anything on the ROK because he 
is a leading member of the U.S. delegation to the scheduled 
third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. Noting the possibility 
that North Korea persistently raised the issue concerning the 
National Security Law during the recent North Korea-U.S. 
negotiations, the editorial suspects that in a hasty effort to 
make North Korea accept nuclear inspections, the United States 
may have agreed during its negotiations with North Korea that it 
would later say something about the National Security Law. The 
editorial then concludes: "Hubbard made such remarks at a time 
it has been learned there may be some conflict or disharmony 
between the ROK and the United States concerning the North 
Korean nuclear issue. Such remarks may possibly make us an 
'uneasy spectator.' This is the problem." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "True Intention of Hubbard, Who Hoped for the 
Abolition of the National Security Law." The editorial 
questions why he made such remarks at a time when North-South 
dialogue is about to resume. The editorial concludes that before 
expressing the hope that the National Security Law would be 
abolished, the United States should ask North Korea to "stop 
suppressing its people and abolish its criminal laws" which bear 
a resemblance to those of the Stalinist era. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "What a U.S. Official Should and Should Not 
Say." The editorial first says that his remarks are 
"inappropriate" and "undesirable." The editorial even suspects 
that the National Security Law may have been a topic in the 
negotiations between the United States and North Korea. The 
editorial concludes: "An ROK- U.S. cooperation system must be 
further strengthened to prevent a similar confusion in the 
future."

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front 
[SKNDF] (Hanminjon) released a statement on February 26 
denouncing the South Korean authorities for dumping nuclear 
waste into the East Sea of Korea, the Seoul-based radio Voice of 
National Salvation reported. 
  Noting that nuclear waste dumped into the East Sea of Korea 
by the atomic power stations of South Korea from 1986 to 1992 
amounted to 11,000 trillion becquerels, or about 100,000 curies, 
the statement said: 
  As a result, the East Sea of Korea has already turned into a 
"sea of death" and Ullung Island into the "second Bikini." 
  Such anti-national criminal acts of the South Korean 
authorities have caused wholesale deaths of fishes and 
extermination of fishes, shellfishes and cultured sea products 
in the sea off Uljin, Wolsong and Kori where atomic power 
stations are situated. A diver's wife gave birth to a brain 
immature infant and many people are dying of incurable diseases 
of unknown origin after eating fishes caught in the sea. 
  Our people are now eating radioactive materials and sleeping 
on the U.S. nuclear-powder keg which may explode at time, with 
their heads resting on pillows of nuclear waste from atomic 
power stations. 
  The South Korean authorities have kept media from reporting 
about the release of radioactive materials from atomic power 
stations in a bid to cover up their crimes. Worse still, they 
unhesitatingly perpetrated such a treacherous act as concealing 
even the dumping of 900 tons of nuclear waste into the East Sea 
of Korea by Russia with a hypocritical "investigation" in which 
they alleged "they could not find a sign of pollution." 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately make public the 
amount and kinds of nuclear waste dumpted into the sea and the 
dumping places, apologize to the whole nation and promptly stop 
such an act. If it continue dumping nuclear waste into the sea, 
it can by no means escape a stern judgement by the nation and 
mankind.

Anti-War, Anti-Nuke Struggle"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- "Let all the patriotic 
people from all walks of life, who truly want to enjoy a 
peaceful life in the territory of 3,000 ri free from nuclear 
weapons and war, turn out in a nationwide anti-war, anti-nuke 
struggle to remove the crisis of a nuclear war hanging over the 
nation and safeguard peace!" 
  A spokesman for the Central Committee of the South Korean 
National Democratic Front appealed this in a statement on Feb. 
25, according to radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. 
  Drawing attention to the ever-expanding anti-war, anti-nuke 
struggle of the South Korean people of different strata, the 
spokesman said: 
  "All the patriotic and democratic forces and activist 
organizations should raise higher the torch of the anti-war, 
anti- nuke struggle and expand and develop it into a nationwide 
struggle involving people of broad strata, one person inspiring 
ten, ten persons a hundred, and a hundred persons a thousand. 
  "The entire people who set store by the destiny of the 
nation 
should rise as one in the anti-U.S. struggle to get the U.S. 
troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn immediately, decisively 
oppose the planned deployment of 'Patriot' missiles and 
categorically frustrate the nuclear war games. 
  "Kim Yong-sam is the first-class traitor to the nation who 
has unhesitatingly opened the whole rice market, the blood and 
flesh of the people, flattering and yielding to outside forces, 
and who does not mind plunging the whole country into the 
holocaust of a nuclear war. 
  "The entire people should wage an anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle 
on a nationwide scale, mindful that the nation would be 
exterminated if his bellicose group is pardoned."

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government 
is concerned over the rumors about "nuclear armament of Japan" 
swirling through the startled air of the United States, Asia and 
European countries and is racking its brains to find a 
countermeasure. This shows that Japan is finding itself 
attacked on all sides, put in the dock, for its nuclear 
activities. 
  NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today. 
  The analyst points out: 
  In an effort to get out of the tight corner, the Japanese 
authorities are using the anti-nuke sentiments of the Japanese 
people as a veil for Japan's nuclear armament. 
  The first nuclear victims in the world during the second 
world war, the Japanese people do not want the repetition of 
that holocaust and are opposed to Japan's nuclear armament. 
  Turning a deaf ear to their voice, the Japanese Government 
is 
claiming that the possession of nuclear weapons is an 
indispensable requisite to the conversion of the country into a 
military power and a political power and hastening nuclear 
armament to gratify its wild dominationist desire. 
  Japan has stockpiled a huge amount of plutonium and 
technologically prepared to manufacture nuclear weapons. The 
world thinks that it is a matter of time for Japan to 
manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  Japan's launching the nuclear-capable space rocket H-2 shows 
that if Japan possesses nuclear weapons, all the regions of the 
world shall come within Japan's nuclear range. 
  The Japanese Government authorities are peddling "particular 
sentiments of the people of the A-bomb victim nation" in a bid 
to lull the apprehensions of the world for Japan's nuclear 
armament. This is an insult to the A-bomb victims of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki and other Japanese people and a mockery of the 
world people. 
  Unless it shows its will not to seek nuclear armament in 
deeds, Japan will invite a bitter condemnation and accuses 
worldwide, isolating itself.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 28 (KNS-KCNA) -- A central meeting 
of Korean Residents in Japan was held in Tokyo on February 28 to 
commemorate the 75th anniversary of the March 1st popular 
uprising. 
  In his report, So Man-sul, vice-chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), said the March 1st popular 
uprising was a nationwide anti-Japanese people's resistance in 
which the Korean people rose in struggle to retake the territory 
of their country lost to the Japanese imperialists and restore 
the national sovereignty. 
  The desire of the Korean people to achieve the sovereignty 
and independence of the country could be realised successfully 
as the respected leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song roused the 
entire fellow countrymen to accomplish the historical cause of 
national liberation, he added. 
  He recalled that the great leader formulated the "10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country" and led the 70 million fellow 
countrymen in the struggle to achieve the national reunification 
under the banner of the great national unity. 
  He condemned the anti-DPRK campaign of the reactionaries at 
home and abroad and called upon all the people to firmly unite 
as one and fight under the banner of the great national unity to 
open a new phase of national reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- Some 2,000 citizens and 
students reportedly held a rally and demonstration in Seoul on 
March 1 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the March 1st 
uprising of the Korean people against the colonial rule of the 
Japanese imperialists. 
  The protesters marched in downtown Seoul, shouting "Yankee 
Go 
Home", "Get Out Yankees Who Raise the Danger of War on the 
Peninsula" and "No `Patriots'". 
  The AP news agency said the protesters demanded an end to 
the 
heavy U.S. military presence in South Korea and the cancellation 
of the plans to deploy "Patriot" missiles there. "Students argue 
that the heavy U.S. military presence here blocks unification of 
North and South of Korea", it reported.

<F P=106> ["Pro-Japanese Treacheries Cannot Be Concealed" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam in his "memorial address" at a "meeting held to mark 
the March 1 uprising" Tuesday described his fascist, treacherous 
regime as "an orthodox civilian" regime which has inherited the 
"legal tradition of the Shanghai Provisional Government", raving 
that it was striving to "carry forward the spirit of the March 1 
uprising". 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says it is the height of 
folly, that he, a despicable pro-American and pro-Japanese 
stooge, dared to let out such remarks, lost to shame. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The March First popular uprising of 1919 was an 
anti-Japanese 
resistance against the Japanese imperialists' brutal colonial 
rule and for the independence and sovereignty of the country. 
Kim Yong- sam is not entitled to talk about it, even if he had 
ten mouths. 
  His "civilian" regime is a treacherous one of "the second 
term of the sixth republic" which has inherited the tradition of 
treacheries of the "first republic" of Syngman Rhee who 
manipulated the assassination of Kim Ku, the leading figure of 
the "Shanghai Provisional Government". 
  What should not be overlooked is that the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, allegedly commemorating the March First movement, 
insulted patriotic forerunners. 
  He drivelled that although they rose up in resistance 
against 
the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule, the forerunners did 
not intend to "discipline Japan's crimes". And he said it is 
necessary to have a correct understanding of "new Japan" of 
today and "cooperate" and "compete" with it. 
  This rigmarole of the traitor is a sermon telling the South 
Korean people to forget and not to call into question all the 
disgraces and sufferings they had undergone under the Japanese 
imperialist rule. It is a shameless jargon intended to conceal 
his pro-Japanese flunkeyist treacheries and prettify his 
clique's tieup with the Japanese reactionaries. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the traitor Kim has more 
glaringly betrayed his true color as a pro-Japanese traitor 
although he tried to conceal his treacheries through his "March 
First address".

<F P=106> [Foreign Ministry spokesman's press statement (tamhwa) on </F>
the massacre of Palestinians by an Israeli] 
  [Text] The DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a press 
statement on 2 March on the recent heretofore rarely seen [yure 
tumun] massacre of Palestinians in an Israeli-occupied area: 
  A heretofore rarely seen massacre was recently committed 
against Palestinians in an area occupied by Israel. A Jewish 
immigrant arbitrarily fired at Palestinians who were saying 
morning prayers in Hebron, on the west bank of the Jordan River. 
Some 50 persons were killed and some 300 persons were injured 
in the crime committed by the Jewish person. 
  This awful massacre is an act of violent terrorism against 
Palestinians and deliberate provocation to create an artificial 
obstacle to the ongoing Middle East peace process. We severely 
denounce the massacre by Israeli extremists [kuktan punja] as a 
grave crime. 
  This tragic incident at a mosque on the Jordan River's west 
bank is a direct consequence [chikchopchok hugwa] of Israel's 
occupation policy. It shows that Palestinian's cannot remove 
the element of danger from their lives nor free themselves from 
their miserable lot, unless Middle East issues, including the 
Palestinian problem, are resolved. 
  In order to guarantee durable peace in the Middle East, 
Israel must withdraw from the occupied Arab lands, and Middle 
East issues must be resolved in a fair and comprehensive way 
[kongjonghago pogwalchoguro] in the interests of the people in 
the region. Israeli authorities must punish those responsible 
for murdering and wounding innocent Palestinians and must take 
steps to help the victims. At the same time, they must ensure 
that no act contrary to the Middle East peace process is 
conducted. 
  We will continue to send our active support and firm 
solidarity to the just struggle of the Palestinian people and 
the entire Arab people to restore their legitimate national 
rights and to accelerate the peace process in the Middle East.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 
a statement today vehemently denounced the massacre of 
Palestinians by Israeli extremists in Hebron on the West Bank as 
a grave crime. The spokesman said: 
  This massacre is violent terrorism against Palestinians, 
which is a deliberate provocation to create an artificial 
obstacle to the on-going Middle East peace process. The tragic 
incident at a mosque on the West Bank is an immediate conseqence 
of the occupation policy of Israel. It shows that the danger to 
the lives of the Palestinian people cannot be removed nor can 
they be freed from their miserable lot, unless the Middle East 
issues including the Palestinian problem are resolved. 
  For guaranteeing a durable peace in the Middle East Israel 
must withdraw from the occupied Arab lands and the Mideast 
problem be solved fairly and comprehensively in the interests of 
the people in the region. 
  The Israeli authorities must punish those who murdered and 
wounded innocent Palestinians, take a step to assist the victims 
and, at the same time ensure that no actions contrary to the 
peace process in the region are committed. 
  We will continue to extend active support and firm 
solidarity 
to the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the entire 
Arab people to restore the legitimate national rights and 
accelerate the peace process in the Middle East.

and "celebration of 30th anniversary," pictures depicting rich 
harvests and illumination. 
  When the great leader President Kim Il-song appeared in the 
box amid the welcome music, enthusiastic cheers of "hurrah!" and 
thunderous applause resounded through the stadium. 
  Kimilsongia and Kimchongilia and letters "Glory to You," 
"Agriculture Is the Great Foundation of the Country" and 
"Celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Socialist Rural 
Theses" appeared on the background and waves of flowers rolled 
on the floor. 
  Watching the performance were member of the presidium of the 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the Workers' 
Party of Korea [WPK] and Minister of People's Armed Forces O 
Chin-u, Politburo member of the C.C., the WPK and Premier of the 
Administration Council Kang Song-san, Politburo members of the 
C.C., the WPK and Vice-presidents Yi Chong-ok, Pak Song-chol and 
Kim Yong-chu and other party and state officials and the 
participants in the national agricultural conference. 
  The display successfully showed on great epic canvases the 
imperishable feats performed by President Kim Il-song, who 
published a unique, great programme of socialist rural 
construction and set an example of the century in the solution 
to the rural question to build a prospering socialist 
countryside in this land and the happiness of the Korean 
agricultural working people, who are enjoying an independent and 
creative life thanks to the rural theses. 
  It also demonstrated the unshakable will of our agricultural 
working people and all other people to finally solve the rural 
question and hasten the complete victory of socialism by 
remaining loyal to the party's leadership and thoroughly 
carrying out the tasks set by President Kim Il-song in his 
letter to the national agricultural conference. 
  The performance made up of gymnastics, gymnastic dances, 
acrobatics and slide-background was acclaimed by the audience 
for its high ideological and artistic value and high technique, 
organization and discipline. 
  President Kim Il-song congratulated the performers on their 
successful performance and waved to the cheering crowd.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- Production is moving 
upward in different sectors of the national economy of Korea. 
  The Yongsong combined general bureau of machines 
overfulfilled its January and February plans and is keeping a 
high rate of production in March. 
  The Musan mining complex, a leading producer of iron 
headings, beat its February target at 100.1 percent and 
fulfilled the first-day quota of March at 120 percent. 
  The Sunchon district coal mining complex overfulfilled its 
February plan and is now carrying out its daily assignments at 
110 percent. 
  The Kim Chong-tae general electric locomotive enterprise has 
brought the production of electric locomotives and passenger 
coaches to an all-time high. 
  The Pyongyang spinning mill and other spinning mills topped 
the February goal of silk yarn 20 percent, greatly helping the 
Pakchon, Yongbyon and Palwon silk mills boost production. 
  The February plans were overfulfilled by the March 17 
general 
hydro-power enterprise, the October 5 general automation works, 
the Yanggang Provincial combined general bureau of forestry and 
many other units, which are now expanding the achievements in 
March.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Case of Sour Grapes"] </F>
  [Text] It is indeed unfortunate that British industries, 
which are in dire need of foreign business to keep them going, 
should now suffer the consequences of their irresponsible press. 
The height of its mindless communication, as manifested in its 
utterly ridiculous allegations against the integrity of our 
leaders, threatens to cripple the British industries and 
relations between the two countries. 
  But nobody, not even the Government there, seems to be able 
to imbue the British Press with a sense of being responsible. 
Perhaps it is now up to those who suffer and have to survive 
the consequences of their fallen fourth estate who must exhaust 
their resources to do something about it. 
  Since the British Government seemed to shy away from doing 
anything concrete to rebut the ridiculous and unsubstantiated 
allegations made, the maligned Malaysian Government seems to 
have no choice but to end all further dealings with British 
companies. 
  Indeed, why should the Malaysian Government give contracts 
to 
British companies, only to suffer various allegations and 
ridicule in the British Press? As the Malaysian Government 
cannot expect justice or reasonableness from the once-respected 
British Press, it should not be blamed for assuming it could not 
hope for justice from a British court should it decide to take 
legal action against the offending newspapers. 
  Perhaps the Malaysian Government, in its wisdom, knows that 
taking the newspapers to the British courts would be a lengthy 
process bound to tie up human and financial resources which are 
better utilised for the development of the country. In any case 
the British Press has not shown due respect to its own legal 
system. It openly criticised court judgments. 
  As such, there is nothing that could stop it from further 
maligning our leaders should the court rule in favour of the 
Malaysian Government. 
  The British Press always prides itself in being free, 
independent and liberal. This may seem so. But while it may be 
free from Government influence, it can never be free from 
editors who are beholden to the owners. The history of the 
British Press is full of examples of independent editors of 
newspapers being put out on the streets by the owners. A 
landmark example was when Harold Evans had to leave after he 
disagreed with Rupert Murdoch, who had just then acquired THE 
TIMES. 
  The British Press and some British Ministers, in trying to 
justify the ferocity of their attacks against Malaysia and the 
Malaysian leaders, have often referred to the Malaysian Press as 
being controlled by the government. What they failed to 
recognise is that the Malaysian Press has not only been 
responsible but has been instrumental in helping to create a 
stable, peaceful and harmonious multiracial Malaysia that is on 
the threshold of becoming an industrialised country. 
  Malaysia, unlike Britain, is built on the foundation of 
mutual respect among members of society -- the press included. 
It is this respect that is fostered, and allowed to grow and 
spread, that has helped establish a strong and industrious 
nation. This formula is so successful that even the British 
companies benefited by way of trade and contracts. 
  Unlike the British Press, the Malaysian Press does not 
believe in opposing for the sake of proving a point or showing 
that it is powerful and independent. It is a part of the 
national tradition and we are proud of our role.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa urged the United States on Thursday to be cautious in 
reviving the Super 301 trade retaliation mechanism as a means of 
bringing pressure on Japan to further open its markets to 
foreign competition. 
  "I strongly hope the U.S. Government will take sensible 
action based on a sensible judgment," the premier said at a 
session of the House of Councillors special panel on political 
reform. He made the comment in reply to a question by Hidehisa 
Otsuji of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Hosokawa also said the Japanese Government will be closely 
watching U.S. moves on the matter, in lieu of contemplating 
countermeasures to the potential revival of the Super 301 trade 
law. Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the 
government the right to retaliate against countries which the 
U.S. deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices. 
  U.S. media reports have speculated that the measure might be 
revived for use against Japan following the collapse of 
bilateral trade "framework" talks and as a result of 
Washington's discontent over Tokyo's alleged failure to grant 
sufficient access for U.S. firms to its telecommunications 
market. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also called on 
the 
U.S. to take a cautious stand over the handling of the lapsed 
Super 301, reiterating that Japan has already decided to 
voluntarily devise a package of measures to further open its 
markets, to be announced by the end of March. "The Japanese 
Government started making efforts to break a stalemate quickly 
and voluntarily," the top government spokesman told a news 
conference, adding that Washington should take such moves by 
Tokyo into account. 
  Meanwhile, a government source on Thursday morning said 
Tokyo 
would file a complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) if the U.S. moves to impose sanctions on Japan over 
the spat on access to the Japanese cellular phone market. 
  Saying the revival of Super 301 has already been discounted, 
the source revealed the Japanese Government is considering 
taking the case to the GATT in accordance with international 
rules in order to settle what it perceives as unilateral 
sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [3 March] suggested a cut in the size of 
Japan's ground forces as part of a planned revision of the 
country's basic defense policy that was formulated during the 
Cold War, government officials said. 
  In a meeting with Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi, Hosokawa 
reportedly said the revision of the 1976 national defense 
program outline will inevitably focus on the size of the Ground 
Self-Defense Force (GSDF). 
  Hosokawa's remark implies that the strength of the GSDF as 
laid out in the outline could be reduced from 180,000 to less 
than 150,000, the officials said. 
  Hosokawa instructed Aichi to take the lead in revising the 
basic defense policy but do it in such a way as not to cause a 
sense of insecurity among members of the GSDF, the officials 
said. 
  Aichi reported to the prime minister the setting-up of a 
defense agency panel to help review the national defense program 
outline, adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Takeo Miki in 
1976. 
  The program calls for the government to maintain Japan-U.S. 
security arrangements to defend Japan against large-scale 
attacks and also to build up Japan's own defense capabilities to 
repel limited-scale invasions. 
  A numerical defense table attached to the outline sets the 
size of the GSDF at 180,000 troops, but the actual number of 
personnel is 152,000, chiefly because of difficulty in 
recruiting volunteers. 
  Apart from the Defense Agency's panel, Hosokawa established 
a 
nine-member consultative council last month to review Japan's 
basic defense policies. 
  The Defense Agency panel will give advice to the prime 
minister's advisory body, officials said.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea 
met at the truce village of Panmunjom Thursday after a 
four-month break to discuss procedures for the proposed exchange 
of special envoys to resolve the North Korean nuclear question 
and other pending inter-Korean issues. 
  The fourth working-level contact, held at "peace house" on 
the southern side of the demilitarized zone, was attended by 
Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean delegate, and his North Korean 
counterpart, Pak Yong-su. 
  The two sides are meeting at Panmunjom to determine the 
date and agenda for the exchange of special envoys. The envoy 
exchange between the two Koreas was one of the conditions set in 
the U.S.-North Korean agreement worked out at their 
working-level contact in New York. 
  Pyongyang must resume dialogue with Seoul if it wants to 
hold 
a third round of high-level talks with the United States, 
tentatively slated for March 21 in Geneva. 
  With the meeting, Seoul is expected to announce the 
suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise Team 
Spirit on condition that practical discussion toward the 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear question will be 
undertaken through the exchange of special envoys between South 
and North Korea.

  [Text] According to a report from Panmunjom by reporters 
Kim Chong-chin and Kim Chong-ki, North and South Korea started a 
working-level contact at 1000 today at the House of Peace, on 
our side of Panmunjom, to discuss procedures for the exchange of 
special envoys. However, no progress has been made at the 
contact because North Korea again insisted on preconditions for 
the working-level contact. As a result, North and South Korea 
agreed to hold a fourth working-level contact on 9 March at 
Tongilgak, on the North Korean side of Panmunjom. 
  In today's contact, both sides delivered key addresses only. 
They could not enter into discussions on procedural matters. 
  However, the sides reportedly agreed in principle to 
exchange 
special envoys of top leaders at the earliest possible date. 
  In his keynote speech, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior 
delegate, presented a revised letter of agreement on the 
exchange of special envoys. The revised agreement stipulates 
the handling of the nuclear issue by special envoys, the 
implementation of the North-South basic agreement, North-South 
summit talks, and reunification. 
  Our side presented this revised agreement after accepting 
North Korea's proposal that the missions of special envoys be 
specified. Our side had previously insisted that no special 
mission be stipulated. Regarding the method of envoy exchange, 
our side demanded that our side's special envoy be allowed to 
first visit Pyongyang, and said that if the North is willing, 
our side is willing to be flexible. 
  However, contrary to our expectations, the North side again 
put forward in its keynote speech the preconditions for 
working-level contacts which it had previously asserted, 
including the suspension of the international cooperative system 
and so forth. Thus, there was no practical discussion on the 
issue of special envoy exchange.

  [Text] Adjudication of cases involving violations of 
intellectual property rights (IPR) in the country has remained 
problematic because of numerous constraints, says a recently 
released study. According to the study, the country's IPR laws 
need strengthening and updating to become effective. While IPR 
complaints have been routinely filed with the Department of 
Justice, most IPR cases have not resulted in convictions of 
alleged violators. Most IPR cases have been settled out of 
court. In the few cases where the court has ruled in favor of 
IPR owners, the convicted were punished with a small fine, or 
put on probation without serving their prison terms. 
  These are among the findings of a study commissioned by the 
Philippine Exporters Confederation (Philexport), through its 
Private Investment and Trade Opportunities -- Philippines 
(PITO-P) project. The SRI [Stanford Research Institute] 
International-Washington team conducted the study. Rico Domingo 
led the SRI study team. Other team members were: Carlo Carag, 
technical expert; Peter Boone and Ophelia Yeung, international 
economists. 
  The study acknowledges the increasing international 
consensus 
about the need to protect intellectual property to encourage 
technological and artistic innovation. Indeed, the recently 
concluded Uruguay Round of the General Trade and Tariff 
Agreement's program to come out with a multilateral global trade 
framework has agreed for a stricter intellectual property 
protection standards. The study suggests several reforms to 
protect and enforce intellectual property in the country -- 
fully consistent with international standards. These reforms 
involve changes on the IPR regime itself, the streamlining of 
the IPR adjudication process and the prevention of intellectual 
property violations. 
  According to the study, its survey of intellectual property 
owners and representatives has shown that the Philippine 
judicial system is not at all effective in enforcing IPR 
violations. The general constraints to IPR adjudication in the 
Philippines include the following: 
  -- low priority given to IPR protection; 
  -- inadequate resources and training for IPR enforcement 
agencies; 
  -- possible judicial and government agency bias against 
multinationals; 
  -- lack of information and knowledge on IPR laws among 
enforcement agents and judicial officers; 
  -- public apathy or lack of awareness; 
  -- lack of coordination among IPR enforcement agencies; 
  -- overall inefficiency of the judicial system; and 
corruption. 
  The study identifies these legal regime problems: 
  -- overly technical and stringent evidentiary requirements; 
  -- tenuous legal authority among enforcement agencies to 
expedite IPR violations; and 
  -- inadequate fines and criminal penalties. 
  The adjudication system is equally difficult, says the 
study. 
The investigation stage has the following problems: 
  -- difficulties obtaining receipts to prove sale of 
counterfeit items; 
  -- difficulties establishing identity of intellectual 
property violators; 
  -- problems finding witnesses to sign affidavits; 
  -- availability of judges, 
  -- refusal by owners to allow entry during raids and in 
the serving of search warrants; 
  -- "protection" offered to infringers by "influential 
friends"; 
  -- and; lack of storage space for seized evidence 
(counterfeit and pirate goods). 
  During the prosecution phase the following difficulties were 
identified: 
  -- respondent's inability to answer subpoena and notices; 
  -- liberal extensions granted by the prosecutor to the 
respondent to appear in preliminary investigation hearings.

  [Text] Vienna, March 2 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) is likely to start inspections of North 
Korea's seven declared nuclear facilities on or after Thursday, 
an IAEA spokesman said Wednesday. The schedule for inspections 
by a seven-member IAEA team was based on the prospect that the 
United States will announce an agreement on the issue with North 
Korea on Thursday. The agreement will include a date for a 
third round of high-level talks between Washington and 
Pyongyang, tentatively set for March 21 in Geneva. 
  IAEA sources said, however, the team will actually be able 
to 
start inspections from Friday as the U.S. announcement is likely 
to be made during the night in Far Eastern time. The inspection 
team, which arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday, is expected to be 
engaged in inspections for two weeks. 
  The U.S. and North Korea reportedly agreed last Friday at a 
working-level meeting in New York that Pyongyang would resume 
dialogue with South Korea and fully implement IAEA inspections 
of its seven declared nuclear plants to realize a third round of 
bilateral talks.

  [Text] The fourth working-level contact for the exchange of 
the special envoys of the highest-level leaders of the North and 
the South was held in the South side area of Panmunjom today. 
  The contact was held today because of our side's sincere 
efforts over the four months since the third contact held in 
October of last year. 
  As was reported, our side proposed the exchange of special 
envoys of the highest-level leaders of the North and the South 
in May of last year, and have made every effort we can for its 
realization at the earliest date. 
  If the South side had taken a sincere position for the 
exchange of the special envoys, as our side repeatedly demanded, 
such as suspending the dialogue-negating, provocative nuclear 
war exercise, not seeking the international joint cooperation 
system designed to harm the fellow countrymen under the pretext 
of the so-called nuclear issue; and apologizing, in particular, 
for the violent remark that they would not hesitate to take 
military countermeasures against the dialogue partner, the 
working delegates' contact would have been concluded and the 
special envoys of the two sides would have traveled between 
Pyongyang and Seoul. 
  However, despite our side's just demand, the South side not 
only enforced the large-scale Hwarang and Eagle-93 war exercises 
one after another, but requested the United States not to hold 
the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, even calling for so-called 
sanctions against us. Thus, continuously conducting the outside 
force-depending acts and antinational acts, the South side 
caused the working-level contact to be suspended. 
  The contact today was held in camera. After the contact, the 
head of our side's delegation held a news conference for 
domestic and foreign reporters on the spot, and informed the 
reporters of the status of the contact. 
  Our side first made clear our serious position [chinjihan 
ipchang] for the working-level contact, and said that in light 
of all the facts, the problem was that the South side has not 
had the proper attitude and position for the realization of the 
exchange of special envoys and attempted to crush [apsal] us 
with the outside forces under the pretext of the nuclear issue 
and putting the brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks. Our side made 
clear that the South side should feel responsible for long 
delaying the exchange of the special envoys of the highest-level 
leaders of the North and the South, which are aimed at bringing 
forth a turning point for peace and the peaceful reunification 
of the country. 
  Our side stressed that the way of breaking through the 
difficulties most promptly and smoothly at a time when the 
threat of nuclear war is menacing the nation is exchanging 
special envoys of highest-level leaders of the North and South 
at the earliest date. Our side urged the South side to take 
immediate steps to remove obstacles lying in the way of the 
exchange of special envoys. 
  Regarding this, our side insisted that the South side should 
stop all the large-scale nuclear war exercises against its 
dialogue partner, give up seeking an antinational international 
cooperation system, call off its attempt to bring in Patriot 
missiles to South Korea, and withdraw its remarks that it will 
not shake hands with its dialogue partner. 
  Our side stressed that these four points are just measures 
necessary for successfully exchanging special envoys between the 
North and South under a good atmosphere and environment. 
  Our side maintained that the two sides should wind up the 
discussions on procedural matters concerning the exchange of 
special envoys in an hour or so after the South side, at today's 
contact, gives a satisfactory explanation on its stance toward 
the four points in any form. After that, our side held, the two 
sides should realize the exchange of special envoys of the 
highest level leaders of the North and the South within the next 
few days. 
  At the contact, the South side, however, declined to clear 
its stance on the principled demands of our side from the 
beginning, in a bid to justify its unreasonable stance toward 
dialogue, the South side rep. 
  In connection with this, our side asked whether the South 
side truly has the intention to realize the exchange of special 
envoys and repeatedly urged it to clear its stance toward our 
just demands. 
  Our side, most of all, stressed that a hostile large-scale 
nuclear war exercise is the biggest stumbling block lying in the 
way of exchanging special envoys and that the South side is 
assuming a stance of wait-and-see by saying empty words about 
suspending the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, violating the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement. Our side pointed out that the South side, 
moreover, attempts to stage another large-scale nuclear war 
exercise. 
  Our side said that the South side should give deep 
thought as to what grave consequence the large-scale nuclear war 
exercise would bring to the nation if the South side enforces 
such a nuclear war exercise against us, and urged the South side 
to make clear without delay its clear position, in the first 
place, on suspending all hostile large-scale nuclear war 
exercises for the survival of the dialogue and the nation. 
  Our side noted that the international joint cooperation 
system is not aimed at realizing the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula, but is, instead, the system of harming the 
nation and hurting the national interests in collusion with the 
outside forces [urichugun namchugi chuguhango innun kukje 
kongjocheje yoksi minjogul sallinun tuksa kyohwangwa choltaero 
yangnip toelsu opsumyo, kugosun choson pandoui pihaekhwarul 
silhyonhagi wihangosi anira, oesewa hanchagi toeo minjogui iigul 
haechiryonun minjok mohae chejerago chijok haessumnida]. Our 
side stressed that the South side should abandon the policy of 
depending on outside force and return to the true road for the 
nation. 
  Our side also noted that the South side's attempt to bring 
in 
such modern weapons as Patriot missiles is an open threat to the 
dialogue partner, and stressed that if the South side continues 
bringing in war equipment and force confrontation despite the 
consistent protests and denunciations of the people at home and 
abroad, not only the exchange of special envoys but also the 
situation on the Korean peninsula will proceed along toward a 
grave phase which no one can predict. 
  Our side noted the fact that the South side, which absurdly 
took a dialogue-negating position in the past, saying that it 
cannot shake hands with the other side which has a nuclear 
weapon, is now mentioning the exchange of special envoys, saying 
that it cannot consider that we have a nuclear weapon. Our side 
then said that if the South side has the true desire to conduct 
the exchange of special envoys and the summit talks [choegowikup 
hoedam] with us, it should not shake hands with the outside 
forces with nuclear weapons but with the fellow countrymen 
without nuclear weapons. 
  Saying that the North and the South are flesh and blood and 
fellow countrymen despite the difference in ideology and system, 
our side strongly urged the South side to make a decision to 
make a new start from the position of national independence and 
great national unity, in conformity with the demand of the 
present situation, instead of making the nation victimized by 
the outside forces. The South could not make any reply to this. 
  The two sides decided to further study the other side's 
position and plan and discusst them at the next contact. The 
two sides agreed to have the fifth working-level delegates' 
contact at Tongilgak in our side's area of Panmunjom on 9 March.

  [Excerpt] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed says the 
Malaysian Government is disappointed over the British 
Government's silence on the lies spread by the irresponsible 
British media. The British Government also did not act well to 
deny or give a true explanation on the claim by the 
irresponsible media in that country that the Malaysian leaders 
were corrupt. British newspapers frequently attack Datuk Sri 
Dr. Mahathir and other Malaysian leaders of having received 
pay-offs for approving privatized projects to British companies. 
  The prime minister however said that the Malaysian 
Government 
had no quarrel with the British Government and British companies 
when it decided not to offer any new contracts to British 
companies. He made the remarks when breaking the fast with UMNO 
[United Malays National Organization] Youth leaders in Kuala 
Lumpur last night. 
  In another development, the Health Ministry will no longer 
import medicine produced in Britain under the cabinet's 
directive to bar British firms from getting government-funded 
contracts. This was stated by its minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai. 
He said, however, existing contracts with British companies 
would be honored. He said this after presenting a check for 
100,000 ringgit to the nongovernment council on AIDS at its 
office in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Singapore Government has taken a one-third stake 
in a U.S.$161 million (S$1.2 billion) [Singapore currency] fund 
which will invest in infrastructure projects in Asia, including 
China. This marks its single biggest commitment in a direct 
investment fund so far. Called AIG Asian Infrastructure Fund 
L.P., the fund could eventually reach U.S.$1 billion in three to 
four months, when more subscribers are drawn in, officials said. 
  Singapore's investment is being made through the Government 
of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), which has contributed 
U.S.$200 million, and Temasek Holdings, which has injected 
U.S.$50 million. This makes a total of U.S.$250 million (S$400 
million). "This will be the single biggest commitment and direct 
investment for GIC and Temasek," GIC's deputy managing director, 
Dr Teh Kok Peng, said yesterday, following the fund's 
contract-signing ceremony. 
  The other major investor in the fund is American 
International Group (AIG), which has committed U.S.$100 million 
through its wholly-owned subsidiary American International 
Reinsurance Company. 
  The partners hope to attract other Singapore investors, who 
must contribute a minimum of U.S.$10 million each. 
  The fund has already caught the interest of major American 
pension and endowment funds, which account for most of the 
remaining U.S.$411 million invested. Subscribers include General 
Electric Co, the University of California and Princeton 
University. 
  China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) 
-- one of Beijing's biggest conglomerates -- has invested 
U.S.$25 million. State-owned Citic and the Bank of China will 
give advice on the fund's investments in China. 
  GIC and Temasek will co-manage the fund through their 
newly-set up affiliate, Singa Infrastructure Management. The 
other co-manager is AIG. 
  Pakistan's former caretaker prime minister and ex-World Bank 
chief of operations, Mr Moin Qureshi, will be the fund's chief 
financial adviser. It is believed that Mr Qureshi's credentials 
helped persuade the Singapore Government to participate in the 
fund, when it was approached initially by AIG several months 
ago. Another factor was the high potential financial returns. 
  As much as half of the fund is expected to go to projects in 
China. The balance will be invested in Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines Taiwan and Thailand. However, other Asian countries 
may receive up to one-fifth of the fund. Said Mr Qureshi 
yesterday: "China and ASEAN offer the most attractive 
opportunities for foreign investment over the next decade." 
  The fund will focus on power, telecommunications and 
transportation projects. It can, however, invest in other 
resource developments, property or environmental services 
projects. 
  Officials said they hoped to give investors a 20-25 percent 
return on equity. The 10-year fund is allowed to invest up to 
U.S.$80 million in any single project. 
  The fund is considering investing in projects in Thailand 
and 
China first. China alone is forecast to need between U.S.$55 
billion and $60 billion to develop its power facilities. Asia's 
cash-starved infrastructure sector has emerged as a red- hot 
investment target for global funds. 
  In early February, billionaire financier George Soros's 
Quantum Industrial Holdings teamed up with GE Capital to set up 
a U.S.$2.5 billion global fund for power projects. Mr Soros had 
also announced plans to link up with Hong Kong brokerage 
Peregrine Investment to launch a U.S.$1 billion Asian 
Infrastructure Fund. Officials said the success of these 
infrastructure funds could spark off a flow of capital into the 
region on an unprecedented scale.

February commented on a remark made by Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii during his recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury 
Lloyd Bensten, saying: "He made the remark under the premise 
that the ruling parties' Tax Reform Council will come to a 
conclusion (on the question of whether to continue with the tax 
reduction) within one year. It was not an international 
commitment." Fujii in the meeting with Bentsen told the latter 
the tax reductions -- before increasing other taxes-- would 
continue into 1995 and thereafter as part of the taxation system 
reform.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroaki Ito from Washington; from the "Kiryu </F>
[Air Current]" column: "Groundless U.S. Criticism Against 
Japan"] 
  [Text] During the process leading to the "breakdown" of 
the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations, U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor and other officials had repeatedly 
voiced the criticism that "no results have been achieved in all 
33 past agreements between Japan and the United States," giving 
the impression that Japan had not abided by the agreements. 
However, such an accusation seems to be groundless. 
  After the recent Japan-U.S. summit, Kantor told ASAHI 
SHIMBUN's General Bureau for America that "we will show you the 
list of 33 agreements." However, a spokesman for Kantor later 
said, "The list does not exist. We do not have enough material 
to compile an official list." "I think somebody briefed the 
USTR based on old materials." Thus, no concrete evidence was 
presented at all for the criticism. 
  This criticism constitutes a basis for asserting "Japan is a 
nation that will not come up with results unless there are 
criteria for gauging the degree of market liberalization in the 
future." It has been an important basis for the U.S. position 
that "objective numerical criteria are indispensable." 
  Senior U.S. Government officials also repeated the same 
criticism in public and at news conferences at least four times, 
and this has certainly influenced public opinion. 
  However, if the USTR explanation is true, it means that the 
United States' repeated official criticism against another 
country did not have any clear basis. 
  The Japanese Government has looked into past agreements, and 
compiled documents showing examples of remarkable results of 
Japanese efforts -- such as "Under the NTT [Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation] procurement agreement of 1980, the 
purchase of foreign products increased by 46 times in 12 years; 
and under the 1988 beef and orange agreement, beef imports 
increased by 1.9 times in four years" -- to refute U.S. claims. 
It is asking the U.S. government for an explanation. 
  The Japanese are strongly critical of the United States 
because "in past negotiations, the United States has also 
criticized Japan based on dubious statistics." "This is the 
usual American lawyers' tactic of reiterating arguments that 
suit their purpose," (according to a Japanese negotiator). 
  The main reason for the recent "breakdown" in the framework 
talks was the lack of trust between the two parties. What is 
needed now is not one-sided criticism and threats, but a 
"mature" attitude of not doing anything to aggravate this lack 
of trust.

  [Text] U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan Spero (for 
International Economic Affairs), a U.S. Government official in 
charge of the Japan-U.S. framework talks, is to visit Japan on 9 
March to meet informally with his Japanese counterpart Deputy 
Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura. The Japan-U.S. framework 
talks, which broke down at the latest Japan-U.S. summit in 
February, are now in a "cooling-off period," (as Prime Minister 
Hosokawa has said). This is the first time that Japanese and 
American officials in charge of the talks will meet informally. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Matsuura intends to explain to U.S. 
Under Secretary of State Spero about Japan's posture to work 
voluntarily for opening the Japanese market and discuss ways to 
resume the framework talks with the American official, 
(according to a senior Foreign Ministry official).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Way To Defuse Japan-U.S. </F>
Friction"] 
  [Text] The government has begun to speedily explore ways 
to break the impasse in the Japan-U.S. framework talks that 
ended in a breakdown. The government held a meeting of cabinet 
members in charge of foreign economic issues on 25 February to 
confirm that the government will map out a package of measures 
during March to promote imports, relax bureaucratic regulations, 
promote government procurement and adopt a competitive policy, 
and also map out a set of measures to expand domestic demand. 
Bureaucrats still strongly resist setting specific targets for 
them, and it remains to be seen whether these measures would be 
able to soften the U.S.'s tough trade stand on Japan. 
<H5>  Promotion of Imports </H5>
  The "Market-Opening Issue Headquarters," mandated to examine 
specific measures to open the Japanese market, held its first 
meeting on 25 February to confirm that nontariff barriers 
keeping foreign firms from gaining access to the Japanese market 
should be quickly reviewed. 
  According to the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], the 
Secretariat of the Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman 
(OTO), the OTO handled 509 cases of business complaints filed by 
foreign companies. EPA believes that if common barriers 
hampering foreign firms from gaining access to the Japanese 
market are identified in the course of handling the business 
complaints, it would be possible for the government to map out a 
set of internationally-praised measures on its own to help 
foreign firms gain access to the Japanese market. 
  The "Market-Opening Issue Headquarters" was created on 1 
February with Prime Minister Hosokawa leading the organization. 
EPA describes the creation of the headquarters as an 
"indication of Japan's eagerness to grapple seriously with the 
issue of increasing foreign access to the Japanese market." The 
old headquarters, established in 1982, has been disbanded. 
Given the mandate of handling business complaints lodged by 
foreign companies, the newly established headquarters will have 
to map out a set of measures during March to resolve the 
business complaints filed by foreign firms, but it will be 
difficult to do that within the month under the present 
situation. EPA Director General Manae Kubota says: "We have no 
choice but to vigorously publicize OTO for the time being. We 
are going to send missions abroad within the year to publicize 
it." 
<H5>  Automobiles </H5>
  As for measures to open the Japanese market to foreign 
automobiles and auto parts, the government's standard for import 
certification will be reviewed and the business community will 
be urged to voluntarily work out its own plans to boost imports 
of U.S. automobiles and auto parts. These actions will form the 
core of Japan's measures to boost imports of U.S. automobiles 
and auto parts. 
  As for measures that the government can take to increase 
their imports, the standard for import certification is likely 
to be reviewed and the possibility of reducing the remodeling of 
imported U.S.-built cars which meet both Japanese and U.S. 
environmental and safety requirements is likely to be studied. 
The government's measures are likely to include stopping 
Japanese car repair factories from discriminating between 
domestically-made auto parts and imported auto parts and 
promoting the imports of auto parts used by them. 
  Given the frequent occurrence of friction resulting from 
misunderstanding, the government intends to promote the 
design-in formula, under which Japanese and U.S. enterprises 
cooperate with each other from the design stage. The government 
plans to hold a "Big Three Seminar" (tentative name) to brief 
U.S. corporations on how Japanese and U.S. enterprises have 
cooperated with each other so far and what results the 
cooperation has brought about. 
  U.S. Commerce Undersecretary Garten will visit Japan on 4 
March and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] will present him with the government's package of 
measures to open the Japanese market in an informal meeting and 
to feel out his reaction to the package. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, an 
organization formed by auto makers and the Japan Automobile 
Dealers Association, an organization created by auto dealers, 
have begun the joint work of drawing up plans for the purchase 
of U.S.-built cars and U.S.-made auto parts after 1995. They 
will compile a document to explain the current level of sales of 
U.S.-built automobiles in Japan to U.S. automakers. Regarding 
auto parts, which has become a focus of dispute between the two 
countries, three major Japanese carmakers -- Toyota Motor 
Corporation, Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, and Nissan Motor 
Company -- will unveil their respective plans in early March. 
Mazda Motor Corporation and other Japanese automakers are 
expected to unveil their plans. 
  In 1933, Japan purchased only $14.48 billion in U.S.- made 
auto parts, an increase of 6.3 percent over the year earlier, 
and meeting the target of purchasing $19 billion worth of 
U.S.-made auto parts is almost impossible. The view is 
spreading among Japanese automakers that "the automobile issue 
should be settled by Japanese and U.S. automakers." 
<H5>  Insurance </H5>
  Japan shows no signs of making concessions on opening the 
Japanese insurance market. 
  The non-life insurance industry is reacting against setting 
any targets for the share of U.S. insurance firms in the 
Japanese insurance market. A major insurance firm says, "Japan 
has run a deficit with the United States in the insurance 
sector, and we are not concerned about any U.S. sanctions." 
Some Japanese insurance companies are voicing the need for 
Japan to take a tough stand on the United States. Given this 
backlash from the non-life insurance industry, it would be 
difficult for the Finance Ministry to map out a set of 
concessions to open the Japanese insurance market. 
  Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry plans to introduce a 
brokerage system by amending the Insurance Business Law next 
spring to help U.S. insurance companies strengthen their 
marketing activities in Japan. The Finance Ministry plans to 
use the administrative discretion to delay the liberalization of 
the Japanese insurance market. The ministry, however, will seek 
the understanding of the United States by explaining to the 
United States its plans to help maintain the currently high 
share of the Japanese insurance market held by U.S. insurance 
companies. 
<H5>  Expansion of Domestic Demand </H5>
  Last year, the United States posted a record $59.3 billion 
trade deficit with Japan. Even if the government decides to put 
into effect measures, especially the four-point measure to open 
the Japanese market, those measures can hardly be regarded as a 
trump card to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
Japan is also under pressure to map out a set of measures in 
the macroarea. 
  As a target that can be easily understood abroad, presently 
under study is an increase in the ten-year plan for public 
investment totalling 430 trillion yen that was incorporated in 
the final report of the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediment 
Initiative Talks in June 1990. At a cabinet meeting on 25 
February, many cabinet members spoke positively of the increase, 
and a report compiled by the Economic Reform Research Council 
(headed by Gaishi Hiraiwa) last December proposed the increase 
on the condition that the "government secure financial 
resources." The increase is expected to be approximately 100 
trillion yen at the end of the coordination of views within the 
government. 
  In addition, the "national welfare tax" called for 18 
trillion yen in tax cuts over the next three years, but the 
government has decided on tax cuts for only one year, provoking 
growing complaints in the United States. Finance Minister Fujii 
intends to explain to his U.S. counterpart at the Japan-U.S. 
finance ministerial talks on 26 February that the "tax cuts are 
Japan's promise to make a sweeping reform of the current tax 
system," but it is unclear how to secure financial resources to 
make up for a financial shortfall resulting from the tax cuts. 
It is also unclear to what extent Japan will be able to obtain 
U.S. understanding on the tax cuts. 
  In addition to those measures, the idea is surfacing of 
establishing a target effort to keep Japan's current account 
surplus at 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product and making 
the target effort "Japan's commitment." Foreign Minister Hata 
supports the idea, and there is a possibility that Japan will 
present the United States with this idea as a 
voluntarily-established numerical target. However, 
Administrative Finance Vice Minister Jiro Saito has said, "The 
government's consensus is that it will not present the United 
States with anything like numerical targets." In this way, some 
Finance Ministry officials are voicing their disapproval of the 
idea. 
<H5>  Government Procurement </H5>
  The government will try to put into effect the action 
program 
designed to expand government procurement and make it 
transparent. The government will publicize English-language 
versions of bidding advertisements and databased bidding 
information in an attempt to smoothly supply information to 
foreign contractors that have so far had difficulty obtaining 
such information. The government plans to announce its plans 
earlier than ever for the procurement of goods worth more than 
800,000 SDR (the special drawing rights of the IMF), improve the 
current system for settling bidding complaints lodged by foreign 
construction firms and simplify the current procurement 
procedure. 
<H5>  Relaxation of Bureaucratic Regulations </H5>
  The relaxation of bureaucratic regulations has frequently 
been mentioned as an effective means to expand domestic demand 
and open the Japanese market since last September when the 
government announced a package of economic stimulus measures. 
The relaxation of bureaucratic regulations requires the 
amendment of many relevant laws. Most of the deregulation, 
though incorporated in the September package of economic 
stimulus measures, will be put into effect after this spring. 
Even if the government announces a set of new measures to relax 
regulations, it is doubtful whether this would bring about an 
immediate effect. 
  In particular, the package of measures to relax bureaucratic 
regulations will greatly affect the established enterprises, 
though only temporarily. It seems that the enterprises want to 
put off deregulation as long as possible. 
  The September package of economic stimulus measures included 
relaxing 94 regulations, including regulations on housing 
construction, but relaxation of only 35 regulations out of the 
94 has been put into effect. The rest will be relaxed after the 
Diet amends relevant laws. 
  The Hiraiwa Report proposes that "economic regulation must 
be 
confined only to exceptional cases out of principle." The 
report also points out the need to study the possibility of 
amending the Large-Scale Retail Store Law and deregulating five 
areas, including the first-kind telecommunications business. 
The "Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters" of the 
government, which was established in early February, has pointed 
out the need to reduce or deregulate 682 cases of certification 
and licensure. A February package of economic stimulus measures 
emphasizes the need to relax 54 regulations as an effective 
means to stimulate the economy. 
  Some government officials are saying the "government has 
already taken all immediately enforceable steps to expand 
domestic demand and relax bureaucratic regulation." The 
certification and licensure of cases, currently numbering 
11,402, show no signs of shrinking, and the United States will 
incessantly press Japan to reduce its number of regulations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sojaburo Okamatsu, deputy minister at the </F>
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, by Tokyo Economic 
News Department reporter Satoshi Tachibanadaka; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Tachibanadaka] The United States says Japanese 
bureaucracy stands in the way of concluding the Japan-U.S. 
framework talks. Do you agree? 
  [Okamatsu] I believe the United States has criticized the 
Japanese bureaucracy for rejecting its demand that numerical 
targets be set. Criticism of bureaucrats has grown in Japan 
since 1993 and I think, perhaps, the United States mistakenly 
believed that if it criticized bureaucrats in Japan it would be 
able to crush opposition to the setting of numerical targets. 
  It appears there are some Americans in the government and in 
the business community who see numerical targets and the 
liberalization of beef and orange imports in the same light. 
The liberalization of beef and orange imports has made it 
possible for Japanese consumers to buy these products at lower 
prices because there were import limits on them. The United 
States says "Japanese consumers want to buy American-made cars, 
but Japanese bureaucrats prevent them from buying those cars." 
Japanese duty on imported cars is zero. American automakers 
have failed to supply Japan with cars that Japanese consumers 
like, and the United States does not understand this. 
<H5>  Without Forgetting Bitter Experience </H5>
  [Tachibanadaka] Japan went along with the United States on 
its trade demands when former President Bush visited Japan with 
American business leaders in 1992, but Japan has refused to meet 
the Clinton administration's trade demands. How should the 
United States see this? 
  [Okamatsu] Japan was careful in choosing the wording of its 
voluntary plans to purchase American-made auto parts in 1992, to 
prevent them from becoming numerical targets. It also announced 
they were a "statement by the Japanese business community." 
  Nonetheless, the United States has pressed Japan to 
implement 
the plans after distortedly interpreting them as a "promise by 
the Japanese Government." Japan will not repeat the same bitter 
experience. The United States has persistently maintained that 
"if numerical targets are not set, Japan will do nothing," while 
at the same time hinting at "sanctions" against Japan. While 
the U.S. takes such a stand against Japan no trade agreements 
can be reached between the two. 
  [Tachibanadaka] Japan and the United States have failed to 
break the deadlock at their framework talks on the issue of 
numerical targets. 
  [Okamatsu] While the United States demanded Japan accept 
numerical targets, Japan rejected the U.S. demand. The United 
States has since said that no results have come from numerous 
trade treaties concluded between the two countries, and has 
repeated its demand that Japan set specific numerical targets 
and work to meet them. 
  The U.S. position is that although setting any percentage 
figure could lead to managed trade, the maintenance of past 
import growth rates will not. Japan, though, does not agree. 
<H5>  U.S. Urged To Understand Japan's Political Situation </H5>
  [Tachibanadaka] Why has the United States stuck to its 
demand 
for numerical targets? 
  [Okamatsu] Perhaps because its more than $50 billion trade 
deficit with Japan continues to grow. The Hosokawa government 
is now promoting economic reforms, the centerpiece of which is 
deregulation. It seems the United States has failed to fully 
understand the changes taking place in Japan. New officials in 
the U.S. Administration largely share the view of revisionists 
and it appears that they have yet to purge themselves of the 
revisionist view. 
  [Tachibanadaka] What does the United States expect of 
Japan's 
macroeconomic policy? 
  [Okamatsu] The United States has reportedly complained about 
Japan's macroeconomic policy, but I had hoped it would have 
understood a little better the political situation that forced 
the Japanese Government to cut taxes for one year. 
  The United States praised the national welfare tax announced 
by Prime Minister Hosokawa. The government later decided to cut 
taxes by 6 trillion yen for one year, triggering complaints in 
the United States. If the government had decided, however, to 
cut taxes by 6 trillion yen for three years running, this 
measure would have met a favorable response in the United States. 
<H5>  Premature To Review Framework Talks </H5>
  [Tachibanadaka] Japan and the United States agreed last 
summer to hold the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Is there any 
possibility the framework talks will be reviewed? 
  [Okamatsu] I believe it is premature to review the framework 
talks. Since leaders of the two countries agreed to hold 
framework talks, it has become unavoidable that Japan and the 
United States would disagree. But Japan has no intention of 
giving up the framework talks because of a dispute with the 
United States over numerical targets. If the United States 
sticks to its demand for numerical targets, the two countries 
will be unable to settle the framework talks. Although we do 
not know if the United States will agree to negotiate with Japan 
at the framework talks after putting aside the issue of 
numerical targets, we intend to look for areas of agreement. 
  [Tachibanadaka] How can the deadlock be broken? 
  [Okamatsu] We plan to look at how we can build a 
relationship of trust with the United States. Japan is 
proposing that the two countries promote industrial cooperation 
in the automobile sector. Even if the United States refuses to 
agree to the proposal, Japan intends to work to break the 
deadlock in the framework talks by doing what it has promised to 
do.

<F P=106> [Article by industrial reporter Jun Ando: "Industrial World </F>
Coolly Views Government's Movement; Impact of Debt of `20 
Percent Share' Over Semiconductors Felt"; second in a series 
entitled "Review of the Four Areas of Japan-U.S. Friction"] 
  [Text] "That was not an `emergency' meeting." This is 
what the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
repeatedly explains to interested parties whenever it has a 
chance regarding an emergency meeting on the semiconductor issue 
held in January. MITI is saying this because admittance of the 
meeting as an emergency meeting is tantamount to accepting U.S. 
claims that "no progress has been made regarding the issue of 
improving Japanese semiconductor market access." 
<H5>  Drop of Market Share According to U.S. Calculation </H5>
  The share of semiconductors in the Japanese market by 
foreign 
countries, including the United States, exceeded 20 percent in 
the fourth quarter of 1992, which was the goal of the United 
States. But the market share is shrinking, according to a 
calculation by the United States. However, MITI is not ready to 
alter its stand, saying "the amount we spent for purchasing 
foreign semiconductors is steadily growing." 
  The United States is proud that the "20 percent" figure, 
which was incorporated in a Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord, 
expanded Japan's semiconductor imports. Many interested people 
in Japan admit this was one of the U.S. motives in demanding 
Japan accept numerical targets in other fields as well. It is 
likely the United States will stress the effectiveness of 
numerical targets should Japanese semiconductor users introduce 
"emergency measures" by accepting the U.S. demand. Because of 
this, it is said MITI unofficially instructed the industrial 
world to "keep quiet for a while." 
  Immediately prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, A. 
Prokashini [name as published], managing director of the U.S. 
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), warned that the 
"Japanese and American semiconductor industrial worlds are 
moving toward an era of confrontation and criticism." He 
explained his understanding that the "honeymoon period," which 
interested people in Japan began to talk about a year ago, was 
about to end due to the Japanese Government's clumsy handling of 
the situation. 
<H5>  American Companies in Japan Show Good Business Performances </H5>
  However, there is no sign that Japanese users are taking 
this 
remark seriously, which can be understood as a threat. They are 
not paying serious attention to the remark because major 
American semiconductor manufacturers in Japan achieved good 
business results in 1993, and because supply is not catching up 
with demand. 
  Sales figures for Intel Japan (located in Tsukuba in Ibaraki 
Prefecture) increased to 87.7 billion yen, a 36 percent increase 
from the previous year. Its net profit was 9.4 billion yen, 
which was a 74 percent increase from the previous year. Both 
figures were the highest in the company's history. Japan Texas 
Instruments' (Japan TI located in Minatoku) semiconductor sales 
also increased by 20 percent from the previous year, totaling 
100 billion yen. 
  Not only major semiconductors but U.S. semiconductor 
manufacturers in general have no intention to use the U.S. 
Government to open up semiconductor markets in Japan. R. 
Dickinson, president of Cirrus Logic [name as published], says: 
"We do not see any problems regarding market access." T. 
Rogers, president of Cyprus Semiconductors, also points out that 
"the Japanese electronics market is open." He coolly adds: 
"The job of the USTR is to make a racket, so they merely say 
various things." 
  Regarding the semiconductor issue, Motorola, which is 
complaining about the closed nature of the mobile telephone 
market in Japan, is also remaining quiet. Integrated circuits 
(IC's) for cars and telecommunications are selling well. Japan 
Motorola says that "we do not have enough memory chips or 
microcontrollers (MCU's) to sell to our Japanese customers." 
  Some Japanese semiconductor users are saying that "since the 
U.S. semiconductor makers are not capable of supplying enough 
semiconductors, they will be at a loss if we ask them to sell us 
more semiconductors," (according to a major electric machine 
maker). Because of this, a growing number of people are of the 
view that the SIA will not ask Japan to introduce special 
measures linked to the expansion of semiconductor purchases. 
<H5>  Pressure May Be Applied as a Result of Excessive Supply </H5>
  However, with the help of their good business results, major 
American manufacturers are making huge investments in plants and 
equipment. South Korean makers are also rapidly expanding their 
production capabilities. Some people predict that since new 
factories will start to operate, "some of the goods will be in 
excessive supply around the second half of this year," 
(according to a major domestic user). If that is the case, 
there is a possibility that the United States may strengthen its 
pressure again on Japan for an expansion of market share. 
  However, major Japanese users are already using a 
considerable quantity of foreign semiconductors. More than 30 
percent of semiconductors Toshiba Corporation and Hitachi Ltd. 
use are foreign made. It is more than 20 percent for Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Corporation. The reality is that "Japanese 
users' efforts are reaching the limit because they are forcing 
themselves to realize the 20 percent share." Some people think 
that foreign semiconductor makers's market share in Japan is 
unable to move upward "because of the unreasonable efforts" made 
during the second half of 1992 to expand market share. 
  Japan should listen to the United States regarding such 
matters as clarifying standards for selecting semiconductor 
suppliers. However, Japan has already suffered the boomerang 
effect of temporary measures for expansion of market share. 
Some people feel a sense of security, saying that "nobody will 
benefit from recurrence of the Japan-U.S. friction over the 
semiconductor issue," (according to MITI). The general trend is 
that Japan should not introduce rough-and-ready measures to deal 
with the situation.

Occurring in Cray's Predominant Position in Supercomputers; It 
Faces Battle Over Pricing and Paralleling Technology"; third in 
a series entitled: "Review of the Four Areas of Japan-U.S. 
Friction"] 
  [Text] "I think Fujitsu has gone too low to win the bid." 
And so saying, Yoshikazu Hori, president of Japan Cray Company, 
the Japanese arm of Cray Research Company of the United States, 
instructed his man in charge of negotiations with government 
offices to ask the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] about the deal. This happened when Fujitsu's bid won the 
firm its first supercomputer contract under the first 1993 
supplementary budget. MITI insisted "there was no problem" with 
the bidding, but Cray was not satisfied. Of the 11 sets of 
supercomputers bought by the government under the supplementary 
budget, six were U.S.-made. As this was more than the five 
Japan-made sets, one would have thought this would have 
alleviated trade friction, but there was still more trouble 
ahead. 
<H5>  "Problems in Procurement Procedure" </H5>
  In tenders under the initial 1993 budget, Japanese 
manufacturers won all four bids to supply supercomputers. In 
July last year, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
complained strongly about this, warning, "U.S. concern is 
mounting." He said he would watch closely procurement done 
under the supplementary budgets. Results of procurement under 
the first supplementary budget show that even though Cray won 
only two, U.S. companies won six altogether. Cray argued that 
the reason it failed to win up to five of the contracts, as it 
had expected, was the result of problems with government 
procedure. President Hori of Japan Cray insisted: "The 
technical performance review should be done more strictly, 
through the creation of a third-party evaluation agency, and 
price ceilings should be set to prevent price competition from 
becoming excessive." 
  Cray is concerned about Fujitsu, which won contracts to 
supply four sets in biddings this time around. Take, for 
instance, the bidding to supply Tsukuba University Academic 
Information Processing Center. In terms of technical 
performance evaluation, Fujitsu's product led Cray's slightly, 
but was a long way ahead of NEC Corporation's. Fujitsu offered 
its product at about 2 billion yen, way below the 3.5 billion 
yen cost quoted by Cray and lower, even, than NEC's price of 2.6 
billion yen. An executive member of U.S. Cray, who was in Japan 
at the time of the bidding, was told of Fujitsu's price and 
said: "This is incredible." 
  NEC managing director Akira Kobayashi said his company 
"could 
not have anticipated" such a low price. The contract is awarded 
on the basis of dividing technical performance points by price. 
NEC opted for a low-price bid in view of the known performance 
of its product. Fujitsu's product, not only high-performance but 
low in price, was a landslide winner. In other projects Fujitsu 
has won bids even when it was not the lowest bidder. Chairman 
Takuma Yamamoto said the "victory was due to good planning." To 
Cray, however, it "looks like a money-losing deal." 
<H5>  Domestic Manufacturers Are Cool </H5>
  The U.S. Government and Cray had previously insisted that 
bidding procedures should be made clear, and that Japanese 
Government procurement was not clear enough. Since then, 
competition over price has intensified and, as a result, an 
ironic situation has developed -- Cray is at even more of a 
disadvantage. Japan Cray President Hori said: "If the price 
comes down too low, it becomes a precedent, and insufficient 
funds will be set aside in the budget for the next round of 
procurement." 
  The first supplementary budget envisaged spending about 30 
billion yen on supercomputers, but ended up spending only about 
22 billion yen. 
  Domestic manufacturers have little sympathy for Cray's 
position. NEC said: "The technical performance evaluation is 
something that should be done by the users, any third-party 
review agency is not necessary. Besides, they should not 
denounce efforts by manufacturers to bring their prices down." 
  Fujitsu said: "The United States in its tenders applies the 
Buy-American clause, which gives preferential treatment to 
U.S.-made products. It does not make sense to complain about 
Japanese Government procurements only." 
  These two Japanese companies -- Fujitsu and NEC -- sell 
their 
products in the United States, but neither has managed to sell 
to government offices. 
  To find out why Cray has lost its previous market share 
within the context of a very good performance overall by U.S. 
companies, it is necessary to note that the supercomputer 
industry is now undergoing a new wave of technological reform 
called "paralleling." 
  In the field of parallel computers, Cray and Japanese 
manufacturers have been laggard. Among the new, rising forces 
are Intel and Thinking Machines of the United States. In bids 
for parallel computers, three Japanese companies, including 
Hitachi Ltd., have participated in government procurement 
tenders in cooperation with these U.S. companies. Many 
"Japanese-U.S. alliances" have been born, and a Fujitsu official 
went so far as to say "Japan-U.S. friction centered on Cray is a 
thing of the past." 
<H5>  Time To Find Common Ground </H5>
  To date, Cray supercomputers have represented the very 
essence of U.S. high-technology. And competition between Cray 
and Japanese manufacturers who have tried to catch up with its 
technological lead has led to friction. But that is coming to 
an end, and now Japan and the United States are reaching a state 
of equilibrium. An associate professor at a national research 
organization said: "Cray's difficulties are now due to its 
backwardness in paralleling technology." 
  Total supercomputer demand in Japan amounts to about 40 to 
50 
billion yen a year. Even if U.S.-made products took the whole 
market, its contribution to reducing Japan's trade surplus would 
be small. It is only because the products were thought to be 
symbols of high-technology that Japanese and U.S. manufacturers 
been at each other's throats. Meanwhile, users have been given 
no say. Users in Japan and the United States should get 
together and exchange information and discuss procurement 
procedures to find common ground for competition between the two 
countries.

"Communications Gear -- Japan, U.S. Confrontation Over Mobile 
Phones Is Emerging as a Major Item Subject to U.S. Sanctions on 
Japan"; fourth in a series entitled "The Review of Four Areas of 
Japan-U.S. Friction"] 
  [Text] In response to a news report on 16 February that 
the U.S. trade representative has begun taking moves to impose 
sanctions on Japan because of friction over the issue of raising 
U.S. access to the Japanese mobile phone market, a senior 
official in a major telecommunications equipment maker angrily 
said, "I have no choice but to say that it is utterly 
unreasonable." 
<H5>  Distrust in Motorola </H5>
  The mobile phone issue was not on the agenda of the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which ended in breakdown. 
The U.S. trade representative has asserted that the "mobile 
phone issue had nothing to do with the breakdown of the latest 
Japan-U.S. summit talks," but the mobile phone issue has emerged 
as a "major item" subject to U.S. sanctions on Japan. The Japan 
Mobile Communications Company [JMCC] is being criticized as 
responsible for Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue. 
JMCC President Kenyu Tsukada, however, says, "The demand by the 
U.S. trade representative and Motorola is impossible for us to 
meet." In this way, the JMCC maintains its confrontational 
posture. The JMCC has already made a compromise proposal to 
Motorola that it would spend 30 billion yen over the next two or 
three years to expand the Motorola mobile phone service in 
Japan. The JMCC says, "We can no longer make concessions for 
Motorola," and nongovernmental negotiations remain deadlocked. 
On 16 February, the Telecommunications Equipment Industry 
Association (headed by Yoshi Sekizawa) issued an unusual 
statement saying, "If the United States imposes sanctions 
against Japan, Japan needs to argue with the United States in 
multilateral trade organizations like the GATT." The 
telecommunications equipment industry is increasingly expressing 
its distrust in Motorola, saying, "Motorola's demand for setting 
numerical targets for Japan's purchase of U.S.-made mobile 
phones is clearly a steamroller, and the U.S. company has made 
the demand with the idea of sanctions on Japan from the 
beginning." 
  In mid-February, when the United States strongly hinted at 
taking moves to enforce sanctions on Japan, JMCC President 
Sekizawa told Toyota Motor Corporation, a major shareholder of 
the JMCC, that "sparks of fire may fall upon us." Electric 
tools surfaced as items targeted by U.S. sanctions on Japan in 
connection with friction over the semiconductor issue. Japan is 
in the grip of U.S. suspicion. 
  Regarding sanctions on Japan under consideration by the 
United States, Ryoichi Sugioka, managing director of Fujitsu 
Ltd, ostensibly projects a calm attitude, saying, "I cannot 
comment on them before the specific contents of the sanctions 
come to light." Since the latest Japan-U.S. friction has arisen 
over the mobile phone issue, there is growing apprehension that 
"automobiles and mobile phones are most likely to be targeted by 
U.S. sanctions on Japan." 
<H5>  Overwhelming Export Surplus </H5>
  Japanese makers of mobile phones produce about 4.2 million 
sets every year, and of these, about 1.9 million sets are sold 
in the U.S. market. An official familiar with the 
telecommunications equipment industry says, "Japanese mobile 
phone makers produce 70 percent of the mobile phones sold on the 
U.S. market in the United States, and any increase in U.S. 
duties on them will have little impact." 
  In 1992, Japan exported $2.407 billion in telecommunications 
equipment to the United States and imported $556 million, an 
overwhelming net export surplus in favor of Japan. Speculation 
is rampant that if the United States imposes sanctions on Japan, 
the sanctions would target "telecommunications equipment 
generally," not only mobile phones, and overseas procurement by 
the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) would be 
embroiled in the sanctions." 
  A top executive of Oki Electric Industry Ltd has said, "The 
exports of facsimile machines would be hit the hardest by U.S. 
sanctions." Japan's exports of facsimile machines to the United 
States account for about 60 percent of its total exports of 
communications-terminal products to that country. If U.S. 
sanctions target facsimile machines, it would become a matter of 
life or death for Japanese producers of the machines. 
<H5>  Japan, U.S. Feud Over NTT Procurement </H5>
  The NTT, too, is worried about being targeted by U.S. 
sanctions. The United States has demanded that the NTT's 
procurement be incorporated into the framework of the government 
procurement. In response, Japan has rebutted the U.S. demand, 
saying, "The NTT has already been privatized so it is impossible 
to meet the U.S. demand." As a result, negotiations between the 
two countries have yielded no agreement. 
  The International Procurement Office of the NTT says: "We 
have procured many goods through joint-development arrangement. 
Our procurement formula is different from conventional 
procurement. If our procurement is incorporated into the 
framework of government procurement, this would not be an 
advantage for the United States." In this way, the NTT appears 
to have no room to accept the U.S. demand. 
  The trade structure between the two countries of network 
products such as switchboards is totally opposite the trade 
structure of such communications terminals as facsimile machines 
and telephones. Japan exports $199 million worth of network 
products to the United States while importing $257 million worth 
of network products from that country. The United States has a 
net surplus in the trade of these items. 
  Most of Japan's imports of network products are due to the 
NTT's procurement activities abroad. The International 
Procurement Office of the NTT says: "The NTT has increased its 
amount of overseas procurement to $784 million (including the 
amount for the procurement of computers), an increase of 23 
percent over the amount of such procurement in 1992. We have 
procured 95 percent of our goods from U.S. producers. There is 
no reason for the United States to criticize the NTT for being 
responsible for the current trade imbalance between the two 
countries." 
  Behind the Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue 
is 
Motorola, a company which has scored great achievements by 
taking a tough stand on Japan whenever trade friction has 
occurred between the two countries. It is unpredictable how the 
Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue will develop in 
the future. The Japanese telecommunication industry is likely to 
be pushed around by the friction for the time being.

  [Text] In connection with the issue of opening the 
Japanese cellular phone market, Japan Mobile Communications 
Company [JMCC] and Motorola are believed to have tentatively 
reached an agreement. While JMCC provides its cellular phone 
service in the capital and central Japan, Motorola has 
complained of difficulties in providing service in those parts 
of the country. JMCC will agree with Motorola to settle the 
issue by making investments in Motorola mobile phone facilities 
earlier than planned. In response, the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry will urge the U.S. Trade 
Representative to stop taking procedures to slap sanctions on 
Japan. 
  JMCC proposed in late January raising the level of the 
current Motorola-type mobile service to that of its NTT-type 
mobile phone service by constructing 323 radio ground stations 
for the Motorola-type mobile phone service in the capital, and 
the central part of Japan by March 1997. In response, Motorola 
asked JMCC in mid-February to construct the radio ground 
stations two years ahead of schedule -- by March 1995 -- and for 
JMCC to purchase 225,000 sets of Motorola-made cellular phones. 
  In hitherto informal negotiations, JMCC had expressed a 
willingness to invest in Motorola cellular phone facilities 
earlier than planned. 
  JMCC is saddled with borrowings that are 20 times the value 
of its capital, and the raising of funds holds the key to 
implementing its side of the agreement. Toyota Motor 
Corporation has expressed willingness to go along with JMCC's 
request for increasing its capital. The Japanese car maker has 
also promised to do everything it can to expand the 
Motorola-type mobile phone service in Japan. 
  Meanwhile, Motorola will withdraw its request for the 
purchase of its cellular phones. Motorola has concluded that it 
would be a plus for it to compromise with JMCC at this stage 
where it has prospects for real profits, rather than push ahead 
with sanctions. A senior Motorola official is due to visit 
Japan this weekend. While in Japan, he will meet with the 
Japanese side to discuss ways for JMCC to invest in Motorola 
mobile phone facilities earlier than planned. 
  The U.S. trade representative is believed unlikely to slap 
sanctions on Japan if JMCC and Motorola conclude their 
negotiations successfully. There is a possibility, however, 
that the U.S. trade representative will not immediately halt 
procedures for slapping sanctions on Japan with the aim of 
wringing concessions from Japan in Japan-U.S. framework talks 
that broke down at the most recent Japan-U.S. summit talks in 
February, and therefore an intergovernmental agreement is likely 
to be deferred until later.

Russian defense researchers closed on 2 March. The session was 
part of the program for the third Japan-Russia defense study 
exchange of researchers of Japan's Defense Agency and the

meeting, the Russian officials presented their view on the issue 
of nuclear arms development by the DPRK (North Korea) and said 
economic sanctions against that country would have no effect.

  [Text] The DPRK (North Korea), which has attracted 
attention because of its alleged involvement in nuclear 
development, will start holding South-North working-level 
consultations on 3 March on exchanges of special envoys with the 
ROK. While progress has been made in the promotion of dialogue 
on South-North relations, there is totally no prospect of 
resumption of Japan-DPRK negotiations on normalizing diplomatic 
relations. 
  While welcoming the start of upcoming inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Japanese 
Government has indicated its stand that "it will be the best for 
the DPRK too" to rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT) and to win understanding and cooperation from the 
international community. 
  Since last year, Japan has tried several times in Beijing 
and 
other places to urge the DPRK to resume the preparatory meetings 
on the talks for normalizing bilateral ties. However, there 
have been no responses so far. It is believed that "for the 
DPRK, that attaches the greatest importance to the talks with 
the United States, the issue of normalizing diplomatic relations 
with Japan is of low priority," (according to a Foreign Ministry 
source).

  [Text] The government plans to call on China to 
substantially reduce its tariff rates. With the working group 
on China's joining GATT set to meet in Geneva in mid-March, the 
government will present China with a list of products including 
textiles, machinery, and electrical equipment, on which Japan 
wants it to reduce duty rates. Japan will also ask China to open 
up its markets in the service areas of trading agency business, 
distribution, and telecommunications. The duty rates in China, 
averaging more than 30 percent, are conspicuously higher than 
those of Japan, Europe, and the United States. 
  China hopes to be admitted to GATT within this year, and 
GATT 
member nations like Japan, the United States, and European 
nations have expressed a willingness to support its admission. 
But with tariff rates so high and service markets not open 
enough, China is expected to have a tough time negotiating 
admission. Japan intends to work on China to reduce its tariff 
rates and open up its service sector, to help China in its 
negotiations on admission to GATT. 
  As a result of the year-end agreement in the Uruguay Round 
of 
talks on tariff reductions, the average tariff duty rate for 
Japan came down to 1.5 percent, and that for Europe and the 
United States to the 3-percent level. Coming into 1994, China 
effected a large-scale tariff reduction of its own, but tariff 
rates in general still remain high, with, for instance, the 
import duty rates for gasoline-fueled vehicles of less than 
3,000cc in displacement and color television sets running to 110 
percent and 50 percent, respectively. 
  The government will suggest large-scale tariff rate 
reductions primarily on Japan's key export products to China 
like machinery, textiles, and electric equipment. The Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry is now studying the specific 
rates to suggest, but also is considering first suggesting 
actions on rates which exceed 50 percent. For Japan, China is 
the second largest trading partner after the United States, and 
the government hopes to expand its exports by having the latter 
reduce import duties. 
  In the service market, Japan will call on China to open up 
the trading agency business which is currently under state 
control, and to also open up the distribution and 
telecommunications markets. 
  At present, China and also Taiwan are getting ready to join 
GATT, and member nations agree: "Taiwan should be admitted 
after China is admitted." China in effect is accepting GATT's 
admission of Taiwan. That being the case, once China's admission 
into GATT becomes certain, the government will start 
negotiations on tariff reductions with Taiwan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Should Rectify Its Inward-Looking </F>
Disposition"] 
  [Text] The Group of Seven (G-7) meeting of finance 
ministers and central bank governors was held in Frankfurt, 
Germany, last weekend. During the meeting, criticism against 
Japan's current accounts surplus was stronger than ever. 
  This was expected because economic conditions in all seven 
nations, except the United States, are bad, and the G-7 are all 
plagued with the problem of mass unemployment. Japan was 
particularly isolated at this recent international conference 
because even the United States joined the attack on Japan. 
  However, looking back at the G-7 meeting and recent behavior 
of the government, we are concerned that Japan is becoming 
overly inward-looking in its relations with the United States, 
and in the international arena. 
  Japan cannot evade the responsibility for enjoying a huge 
current accounts surplus for more than 10 consecutive years. 
Yet, it has also made various efforts. 
  With regard to efforts to expand domestic demand, Japan has 
compiled a 15-trillion-yen comprehensive economic package 
featuring income tax cuts. Yet, these macroeconomic measures 
are not appreciated at all. It is true that there is room for 
argument with regard to the merit of these measures. However, 
in view of declining revenue income, the economic package 
probably represents maximum efforts on the part of Japan. 
  U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen voiced the 
criticism that "Japan's stimulation measures are insufficient." 
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus also said, "Only minimal 
growth effect can be expected." To the Japanese financial 
authorities, their arduous efforts that went into the 
formulation of the economic stimulation budget have indeed 
received shockingly little appreciation. 
  The ratio of Japan's current accounts surplus to GNP is 
expected to diminish rapidly even according to the forecast of 
international organs. Yet, the United States turns a blind eye 
to such estimates. It is also strongly critical of the tax cut, 
claiming "since this is limited to one year, it would only be 
half as effective." 
  How come our efforts to expand domestic demand are not 
conveyed to foreign countries accurately? If things go on like 
this, Japan will surely be in a very difficult position. Why is 
it that we are unable to make even U.S. Ambassador to Japan 
Walter Mondale understand us correctly? 
  The Hosokawa administration has failed in its efforts to win 
the foreign countries' understanding. The question is: Why is 
the communication process that bad despite the fact that Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton enjoy 
a good relationship of trust? 
  The Ministry of Finance used to have friendly relations with 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Such relations 
deteriorated in the past two or three years, and they have 
worsened recently. The U.S. Treasury Department's assessment of 
our macroeconomic policy may be a consequence of this. 
  Communication channels between the governments and 
legislatures of Japan and the United States have also been 
reduced. In short, there is not one out of 100 members of the 
U.S. Congress who truly supports Japan. The fact is, in 1985, 
the U.S. Senate passed a bill to impose sanctions on Japan 
unanimously. 
  What has the Foreign Ministry been doing? And what about the 
Japanese Embassy in Washington? Has the Hosokawa administration 
been serious about having dialogues with the United States? Has 
it really worked hard to persuade the international community? 
  Coordination between Japan and the United States was a basis 
for the past G-7 meetings. Such a basis has disintegrated since 
the recent Frankfurt meeting. The recent meeting seemed to have 
conducted level-headed discussions and reached appropriate 
conclusions on issues such as aid to Russia, economic growth 
strategy, Japan's surplus, and turbulence in the bond market due 
to interest rate fluctuations in the United States. 
  There is no guarantee that an encirclement of Japan would 
not 
be formed. Any nation may try to look for a scapegoat for its 
domestic difficulties. 
  Japan should brace itself up. It should also exert untiring 
efforts to make the world understand its position. Bureaucrats 
should look to the world. Otherwise, we may end up repeating 
the stupid mistake of not being appreciated even though we 
donated $13 billion during the Gulf war.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister, foreign </F>
minister, and head of Shinseito, by an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The coalition parties are 
evenly divided for and against on the issue of a cabinet 
reshuffle. 
  [Hata] Once someone talks about it, everyone talks about it, 
and then you have disagreements. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Why have a reshuffle now? 
  [Hata] It is true a reshuffle is being discussed. If things 
are left as they are at the moment we will be criticized. 
People will complain that we are in disarray. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have said your basic position is 
that a cabinet should not be reshuffled on a regular basis. 
  [Hata] Yes, but the coalition government is still in its 
early stages, and its composite parties sometimes find 
themselves in peculiar circumstances. Besides, the parties did 
not come to power because they won the election, so the 
situation we have now is somewhat unusual. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people have said you might 
become the new chief cabinet secretary. 
  [Hata] I have not heard of it. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you still believe a party leader 
should not be chief cabinet secretary? 
  [Hata] This is not an issue because of Masayoshi Takemura, 
but about the post of chief cabinet secretary. We should not 
have believed that anyone within the coalition could be chief 
cabinet secretary. We must think about personnel matters more 
carefully. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] If there is to be a cabinet 
reshuffle, do you think we will have a clearer picture of future 
political reorganization than we have now? 
  [Hata] If you are asking me whether there is common 
agreement among the parties of political realignment, I must say 
that is not the case. There are questions to be answered. 
Should all the parties be dissolved and merged into one, new 
group? Or should they become two groups? If they are divided 
into groups, will they function well? I personally prefer the 
idea of two major forces. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You mean the coalition forces should 
become one force? 
  [Hata] Yes. They have gone through many difficulties to 
come this far. It is important to hold on to this framework, 
even though there will be difficulties in organizing them into a 
single party. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does this concept find common ground 
with Prime Minister Hosokawa's concept of a "single floor group." 
  [Hata] His concept is one of the choices. After all, can we 
face the election divided? It would be very tough. The next 
general election will be held under the single-seat district 
system. We will have difficulties even with our forces combined. 
Dividing them will have an adverse impact on the election as 
far as proportional representation is concerned as well. If 
both groups are interested only in assuming leadership after the 
election, they will never be able to compromise in an election 
campaign. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] We understand there is an idea that 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] merges with the Japan New Party 
first of all. 
  [Hata] That is one choice. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] One of the reasons for discord within 
the coalition is said to be the discontent about the wish of 
Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party] to lead the 
coalition. 
  [Hata] I do not know why people want to talk about that so 
much. In order to handle so many difficult issues in such a 
short time, strong leadership was necessary. It was impossible 
to take time and take it easy. I have never seen any reactions 
myself, though I can understand the positions of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger 
Party]. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Don't you think the basic issue of 
the structure of the future political system is being confused 
with the strategic issue of how to fight the next general 
election? 
  [Hata] The issue concerns one party remaining in power too 
long. The basic point remains that we must find a way to make a 
change of government possible. I do not see much contradiction 
between the two issues. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] So the fight in the future will 
continue to be one between reformists and nonreformists? 
  [Hata] No, that will no longer be possible. Even among 
those called conservatives, there are people who are changing 
their thinking. There are now people who are moving toward the 
creation of a new system, in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
as well as the coalition parties. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, said he could work with Shinseito. 
  [Hata] I do not want to say anything which might cause 
ripples. Until now it has been debatable whether they were 
really at the same venue when it came to discussing this issue. 
But I think we can now openly talk about reform issues, even 
with the LDP. That is important.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Hosokawa's Policies: Creation of </F>
One Advisory Body After Another"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has yet to decide on 
reshuffling his cabinet, is showing his intention to vigorously 
grapple with policy tasks by setting up one private advisory 
body after another, including a "panel on the defense issue." 
With political reform settled, the prime minister seems to be 
intending to consolidate a foothold for his coalition government 
to develop into a long-term full-fledged government by working 
on new reform tasks and giving the impression that his coalition 
government is in transition to "its second term as a reformist 
government." The prime minister seems intended to set up one 
private advisory body after another to break away from the 
conventional "bureaucrat-led" policy decision formula and set 
forth his own policies. Bureaucrats, however, are expected to 
resist shifting the policy decision to advisory bodies that are 
made of people from the private sector. 
  Advisory bodies to be established are panels on "the defense 
issue," "the 21st century global environment," and "housing and 
land" to be placed under the Administrative Reform Promotion 
Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Hosokawa). The "defense 
issue panel" is mandated to review the "Guideline for the 
Defense Buildup Plan," taking into account the post-Cold War 
world situation. The panel, to be presided over by Asahi 
Breweries Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi, will hold its first meeting 
on 28 February. 
  The "global environment panel" is to exchange views on how 
Japan should contribute to addressing global environmental 
problems. In response to the prime minister's intentions, late 
last year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura urged Environment 
Agency Director General Wakako Hironaka to establish the panel, 
saying: "Let us work together to tackle environmental problems 
transcending the jurisdiction of each ministry and agency." The 
panel, to be chaired by Japan Academic Council President Kondo 
Jiro, is composed of 14 people from the private sector. The 
panel will hold its first meeting on 10 March and compile 
recommendations within this year. 
  The "panel on housing and land" under the Administrative 
Reform Promotion Headquarters is the first among panels to be 
established for the discussion of deregulation. Keio University 
Professor Shigeru Ito and five scholars and businessmen will 
join the panel as "experts." The panel will be established in 
March. Their participation in the panel as "experts" reflects 
the prime minister's hope to "allow civilians to participate in 
policy decision making." The prime minister intends to promote 
the deregulation by overriding resistance from the bureaucracy. 
  The prime minister is setting up one advisory body after 
another before he reshuffles his cabinet. Explaining why the 
prime minister is doing so, an aide to the prime minister says: 
"With the political reform settled, the Hosokawa government 
needs to present its next policy tasks to tackle." The prime 
minister seems to intend to keep the centripatal force of his 
government from waning after the political reform is put into 
effect. 
  Explaining why the prime minister intends to fill the 
advisory bodies with civilians, another aide to the prime 
minister says the "prime minister has begun talking about his 
distrust in the bureaucracy, saying, `If I get things done in 
the way the bureaucracy tells me, I may face failure.'" 
  Some bureaucrats are criticizing the prime minister for 
taking the position of attaching importance to the advisory 
bodies, saying: "It is absurd to allow civilians to participate 
in the government's policy decision making without making clear 
their status and responsibility." Other bureaucrats complain: 
"The global environmental problems panel has already been 
established in the Environment Agency and the establishment of 
another such panel is duplication." 
  If recommendations to be made by the advisory bodies are 
different from policies of each ministry and agency, this will 
raise the issue of how the recommendations will be put into 
effect. The prime minister's leadership will be questioned from 
time to time in the future.

  [Text] The Defense Agency held the first meeting of the 
"Conference on Defense Capability" with Director General Kazuo 
Aichi as its chairman on 1 March. In his speech, Aichi 
stressed: "Discussions at the council will be very important in 
deciding Japan's optimum defense capability." The Defense 
Policy Council, a private advisory body to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, has also started reviewing the "National 
Defense Program Outline" to study the optimum defense 
capability. The Defense Agency's study group will proceed 
independently with discussions on medium- to long-range policies.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 3 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- It is 
natural that now a requirement arises to expand and develop 
Mongolian-Vietnamese relations in accordance with the new 
tendencies and processes appeared in the world and the 
Asian-Pacific region, said the president of Mongolia in an 
interview to the Vietnamese newspaper "NHAN DAN". 
  In an interview, which has been granted in connection with 
his official visit to the SRV, the president P. Ochirbat notes 
that the peoples of Mongolia and Vietnam have wonderful 
traditions of long-standing friendly relations. 
  Mongolia and Vietnam are encountering today with objective 
difficulties in making active and developing cooperation between 
them because of the reason connected with economic reforms in 
the two countries, financial-economic difficulties caused by 
them. 
  In addition to this, objective transport problems should be 
taken into consideration. 
  That is why, said the president, the head of the Mongolian 
state is on the official visit to Vietnam. The purpose of the 
visit is to have talks, exchange views with the state and 
government leaders of Vietnam on the ways, forms and 
possibilities of making active and developing relations between 
the two states. 
  We are confident in the availability of considerable 
opportunities for renewal and consolidation of bilateral 
relations and cooperation, leaning upon rich experience, 
traditions, of our relations and advantages of the two sides 
connected with their peculiarities. 
  P. Ochirbat defined the rendering of support by the two 
sides 
for strengthening of business contacts between the 
representatives of the private sector as a new perspective form 
of relations, at the same time, of course, expansion of economic 
cooperation between the two countries on the state line.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 2 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In 1992 
Mongolia has made the statement on becoming a nuclear free zone. 
The USA, the PRC, Great Britain, and recently France have 
announced about their respect for this status of Mongolia, is 
said in the statement of the representative of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation of March 1. 
  I would like to note that position of the Russian side on 
this issue has been reflected in the clause 4 of the treaty on 
friendly relations and cooperation, which was signed with 
Mongolia in January 20, 1993, as follows: "The Russian 
Federation will have a respect for Mongolia's policy banning the 
stationing on her territory of foreign troops, nuclear and other 
weapons of mass annihilation, letting them through her 
territory", is said in the statement, the Ministry for External 
Relations of Mongolia informed about this today.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 2 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
Mongolian press is covering widely the official visit of the 
President P. Ochirbat to the countries of Asia. The newspaper 
"ARDYN ERH" informs that the Mongolian president with his spouse 
has paid a visit to His Majesty King of Thailand Phumiphon 
Adunyadet and his spouse at their residence. P. Ochirbat and 
those accompanied him visited the ancient capital of Thailand 
Ayuttaya and the largest centre of tourism city of Pattaya. 
Speaking there at the press conference the President P. 
Ochirbat noted with satisfaction the unanimity of stands of 
Mongolia and Thailand on both the fundamental issues of 
bilateral relations and international ones. P. Ochirbat 
stressed the significance of signed during his visit to Thailand 
agreements between the two countries concerning the airline 
communications and non-visa exchange of persons with diplomatic 
and official passports. 
  In this speech the Mongolian president emphasized the 
interest of Mongolia in participating actively in the regional 
cooperation of countries of Asia. 
  The newspaper publishes the full text of the joint 
communique 
on the visit of the President of Mongolia P. Ochirbat to 
Thailand. The newspaper informs about the working trip by the 
Prime Minister of Mongolia P. Jasray to the Hobd Aymag where he 
is getting acquainted with the wintering of cattle, life and 
working conditions of herdsmen. The newspaper underlined that 
P. Jasray has displayed much interest to the work of the local 
research institute relating to the growing of oilproducing crops. 
  According to the newspaper, the constitutional court has 
considered the claims of three citizens on the breach of the 
provisions of the Constitution committed by members of the 
parliament P. Elbegdorj, D. Ganbold and S. Zorig, in reference 
to the execution by them their obligations of a party members. 
The constitutional court noticed nothing in this to be regarded 
as the violation of the Constitution. 
  The newspaper informs about the outcome of the 17 winter 
Olympic games held in Lillehammer and carries the standings of 
countries whose sportsmen succeeded to win medals. 
  The central organ of the Mongolian National Democratic Party 
(MNDP) "ERH CHOLOO" puts the statement of the General Council of 
the party on its pages. The MNDP considers that the accusations 
of corruption hurled at the leadership of the parliament and the 
Prime Minister P. Jasray instead of being considered properly 
are just being used in the interests of politicizing the current 
situation in the country. 
  According to the newspaper, the General Council of the MNDP 
acknowledged at its last sitting the impossibility for their 
party to be being represented in the parliament. 
  The committee on ensuring order of the MNDP has taken a 
decree on the necessity to improve the activities of the General 
Council and other central bodies of the party reproving strictly 
the leader of the party D. Ganbold and the General Secretary E. 
Bat-Uul. Touching upon the visit paid by the Chairman of the 
ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party B. Dash-Yondon to 
Japan the newspaper is wondering whether the Japanese side 
decided to give political and moral support to this party.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday he received a phone call from U.S. 
President Bill Clinton explaining his decision to reinstate the 
"Super 301" trade provision. 
  The premier declined to elaborate on what was discussed, 
made 
just after midnight Thursday Japan time, but a Japanese 
Government source said both Hosokawa and Clinton agreed to make 
efforts to avoid retaliatory action being taken. [sentence as 
received] 
  The measure gives the U.S. Government power to retaliate 
against trading partners deemed to be engaging in unfair 
practices. The two leaders failed in talks on February 11 to 
agree on a new trade framework to reduce Japan's surplus in 
bilateral trade. 
  Government sources said the Hosokawa government will shortly 
issue a statement to express its regret over the Super 301 
announcement.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday the U.S. decision to reinstate the "Super 
301" trade retaliation provision is aimed at putting pressure on 
Japan. 
  Hosokawa told reporters the United States expects a more 
favorable response from Japan over trade disputes, particularly 
those over cellular phones, insurance and government procurement 
markets. 
  The prime minister said he will take the lead in improving 
ties between Japan and the United States. 
  Hosokawa said he was informed of the U.S. decision in an 
early morning telephone call on Friday by president Bill Clinton. 
  Hosokawa quoted Clinton as saying that the U.S. Congress is 
preparing more rigid trade action and that the reinstatement of 
the Super 301 legislation is considerably more moderate. 
  The premier said, however, it would take a long time for the 
U.S. to actually apply the Super 301 provision. 
  Earlier in the day, Hosokawa said he is not considering any 
immediate steps to counter the fresh U.S. move. "No, none at 
this moment," Hosokawa said. "We agreed to deal with the matter 
coolly," he said. 
  Hosokawa later ordered cabinet ministers to give priority to 
opening the telecommunications market and the distribution 
system in working out economic deregulation to provide foreign 
firms wider access to the Japanese market, government officials 
said. 
  The officials said Hosokawa issued the order at a meeting 
held after a regular cabinet session.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday he is not considering any immediate steps 
to counter the U.S. decision to reinstate the "Super 301" trade 
retaliation provision. 
  "No, none at this moment," Hosokawa said when asked if the 
government may take action against the U.S. move announced 
Thursday. 
  Hosokawa said he was informed of the U.S. decision in a 
telephone call by President Bill Clinton. 
  "We agreed to deal with the matter coolly," he said. 
  Hosokawa later ordered cabinet ministers to give priority to 
opening the telecommunications market and the distribution 
system in working out economic deregulation to provide foreign 
firms wider access to the Japanese market, government officials 
said. 
  The officials said Hosokawa issued the order at a meeting 
held after a regular cabinet session. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi told the meeting that 
the 
government's emphasis on deregulating housing and real estate 
would not help improve overall relations between Japan and the 
United States because Japanese imports of housing-related goods 
are limited, the officials said. 
  Hosokawa said deregulation of the telecom market and 
streamlining the distribution system should be added to the list 
of priorities, they said. 
  In a related development, Posts and Telecommunications 
Minister Takenori Kanzaki told reporters Friday he is not sure 
whether a dispute with Washington over mobile phones can be 
settled quickly in private-sector negotiations. 
  He said the talks are nearing a conclusion, but it is not 
known if they will bring about a quick solution. 
  Motorola Inc. of the United States and Nippon Idou Tsushin 
Corp. (IDO) of Japan have been discussing U.S. demands for 
boosting foreign access to the Japanese cellular phone market 
since Washington announced plans in mid-February to retaliate 
against Japan over the dispute. 
  Washington, accusing Japan of breaching a bilateral 1989 
trade pact, has threatened to raise its tariffs on imports of 
Japanese telecom goods and possibly other products. 
  It has set March 17 as the deadline for unveiling a list of 
Japanese imports to be targeted for retaliation. 
  Japanese business leaders deplored the U.S. Administration's 
decision to reinstate the super 301 clause. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), said super 301 runs counter to the 
spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aimed at 
freer world trade. 
  He called on the Japanese Government to promote the opening 
of Japan's market. 
  Kosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said the Clinton administration apparently wants to 
use the clause as a tool to take the upper hand in its trade 
negotiations with the Japanese Government.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata expressed concern Friday over the U.S. move to revive the 
Super 301 trade weapon, calling it "unilateral." 
  Hata told a news conference that the move is "unilateral 
procedural strengthening" and that he is "concerned about it." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday announced 
reinstatement of the 1988 trade act's Super 301 portion, which 
allows the president to retaliate against countries deemed to be 
engaging in unfair trade practices. 
  Noting that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks 
completed in December had agreed to prohibit unilateral steps, 
Hata said Japan hopes the United States will act on the trade 
authority carefully. 
  He also indicated Japan will not hesitate to bring its case 
to the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, if the U.S. uses the weapon against Japan. 
  "Japan wants to resolve the case multilaterally rather than 
bilaterally," he said. 
  Admitting that Japan's unabated current account surplus 
creates frustration in other countries, Hata also emphasized the 
need for Japan to make "meaningful" efforts to cut the surplus.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata by NHK </F>
announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata and NHK Economic News Department 
reporter Tsruo Mochitsuki via satellite; Hata speaks from 
unidentified location, Kawabata and Mochitsuki speak in NHK's 
Tokyo studio] 
txt}[Text] [Kawabata] We will interview Foreign Minister Hata. 
Mr. Hata, what do you think of the U.S. decision to revive the 
Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act? 
  [Hata] For a long time, there have been moves among U.S. 
congressmen to submit a bill to revive the Super 301 provision. 
At the same time, the U.S. Administration has maintained that 
it would be better to issue a presidential executive order 
rather than enacting the bill in Congress. It has been reported 
since last month or earlier that the administration would decide 
to revive the Super 301 provision. 
  [Kawabata] Do you mean that the Japanese Government has 
anticipated the revival of the Super 301 provision? 
  [Hata] Yes, yes. The idea of reviving the Super 301 
provision has been around in the United States for a while. The 
latest step the U.S. Government has taken is a procedure to 
revive the Super 301 provision. It is said that the revival of 
the Super 301 provision targets Japan because the Japan-U.S. 
framework talks ended in a breakdown, but it is not true. Our 
understanding is that the revived Super 301 provision will be 
applied to all other nations and will not target any specific 
nations. 
  [Mochitsuki] Mr. Hata, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has 
unequivocally told a news conference that the Japanese market is 
very closed. Has the United States decided to revive the Super 
301 provision with Japan in mind? 
  [Hata] Americans already have in mind that Japan is the top 
surplus nation among trade partners of the United States. In 
that sense, I think there are many venues for the United States 
to discuss the trade issue with Japan. For the United States, 
Japan is its second largest trade partner, second to Canada. 
Japan's imports from the United States equal the imports of 
France, Britain, and Germany combined from that country. I 
believe Japan is an important trade partner for the United 
States. 
  [Watanabe] Mr. Hata, we just had a discussion in this 
studio. 
What do you think of a six-month moratorium for negotiations? 
  [Hata] I think the United States probably intends to set a 
direction of settling the trade dispute within six months. My 
understanding is that the terms of the Super 301 provision are 
more reasonable than the past terms. In this connection, the 
Uruguay Round of GATT was recently concluded, and a new trade 
organization called the World Trade Organization will be 
created. Various trade disputes will be settled by the new 
trade organization, and this is an international rule for 
negotiating trade disputes. The United States intends to settle 
bilateral trade issues through the revival of the Super 301 
provision after the Uruguay Round has just concluded. We deeply 
regret the revival of the Super 301 provision by the United 
States. 
  [Mochitsuki] In reality, the Japan-U.S. framework talks 
ended 
in a breakdown. I think the talks did not end, but they should 
be resumed in the future. Japan is said to be ready to discuss 
the issue of numerical targets with the United States. 
  [Hata] Yes. 
  [Mochitsuki] What do you see as the prospects of such talks? 
  [Hata] The moment the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in 
breakdown, what I told officials from ministries and agencies 
was that, despite the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks, they should not be careless. I also told them that Japan 
is the world's largest trade surplus nation, and this is a 
problem, and opening the Japanese market will make the people's 
lives affluent. Japan should work to voluntarily open its 
market. The prime minister returned to Japan with the same 
idea. He called in cabinet members the day after he returned to 
Japan. Recently, key cabinet members met to agree to map out a 
package of measures in March to open the Japanese market. 
  [Kawabata] If the United States raises the issue of 
numerical 
targets in future negotiations, will Japan say no to them again? 
  [Hata] Rather than us saying no, U.S. Trade Representative 
Kantor has not said that numerical targets should be a yardstick 
and only one means to measure bilateral trade. [sentence as 
heard] The Hosokawa cabinet intends to promote administrative 
reform and deregulation. In other words, the cabinet is moving 
toward keeping it from intervening in the activities of the 
private sector. Japan, therefore, has told the United States 
that setting such numerical targets is no good at a time when 
the Japanese Government is making such moves. Japan also told 
the United States that setting such numerical targets would 
disrupt free trade and the Uruguay Round has just concluded. I 
am confident that the issue of the numerical targets will 
undoubtedly be resolved if the two countries trust each other 
and fully understand each other's recent actions. There are 
some other trade issues between the two countries. I think 
negotiations between the two countries on such trade issues as 
the insurance sector and government procurement came closer to 
agreement. I believe an agreement will be hammered out through 
negotiation. I believe the two countries should do so. 
  [Kawabata] I would like to ask about future Japan-U.S. 
relations. Do you think that the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. 
framework talks has prompted the U.S. Administration to decide 
to revive the Super 301 provision? 
  [Hata] I do not think so. I do not think that the U.S. 
Administration has decided to issue the presidential executive 
order because of the breakdown of the framework talks. 
  [Kawabata] Some are pointing out that the revival of the 
Super 301 provision would affect not only bilateral economic 
issues, but all Japan-U.S. relations. 
  [Hata] During a meeting with me, Mr. Kantor told me that 
although the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in a breakdown, 
the United States has experienced many breakdowns in trade talks 
with European nations and Canada. Mr. Kantor also told me: Mr. 
Hata, do not worry about the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. 
framework talks. Mr. Kantor went on to said to me: No matter 
how well security, political, and international cooperation 
goes, bilateral economic issues will trigger frustrations among 
Americans. The bilateral economic issues will hurt bilateral 
relations. The two countries should settle the economic issues. 
He and I feared that if the economic issues are not settled, 
this would create a rift in relations between the two countries. 
I hope to resolve the economic issues in one way or another. 
An agreement document was exchanged between the prime minister 
and the President on cooperation between Japan and the United 
States in tackling environmental problems, the population issue, 
and AIDS. 
  [Kawabata] I would like to ask about how the Japanese 
Government will deal with the revival of the Super 301 
provision. In past negotiations on the Super 301 provision, 
Japan avoided facing sanctions from the United States by making 
concessions to the Untied States. Will Japan make concessions 
to the United States again? 
  [Hata] No, Japan will not make concessions to the United 
States. The United States has not decided to revive the Super 
301 provision to target Japan. I hope the two countries will 
discuss their trade issues in the WTO. My frank feeling is that 
the United States should have been cautious about reviving the 
Super 301 provision. 
  [Tsuruo] The government intends to map out a package of 
measures on its own to relax the bureaucratic regulations and 
open the Japanese market. This package will be mapped out, but 
it is often said that bureaucrats are strongly resisting the 
relaxation of bureaucratic regulations. Mr. Hata, will Prime 
Minister Hosokawa display his leadership? 
  [Hata] We are talking with various bureaucrats. Politicians 
and bureaucrats realize that if Japan is left untouched, it 
would be able to do nothing. The people are also realizing that 
deregulation will raise their living standard. Deregulation 
will create new projects, and the people are realizing that. I 
am confident that bureaucrats will work for deregulation, and I 
can say there will be no problem. Prime Minister Hosokawa is 
working on the issue with a firm resolve. I believe that 
deregulation will bring about a tangible effect. The United 
States intends to sell its goods in Japan and gain access to the 
Japanese market, and other nations intend to do so too. Japan 
should open its market to those nations and compete with them. 
I think that Japan cannot bypass this. 
  [Kawabata] The government will map out a package of measures 
in March. Would you specify them? 
  [Hata] I cannot specify them since the government is now 
working on them. 
  [Tsuruo] Mr. Hata, what do you expect from private 
enterprises? 
  [Hata] Private enterprises should be determined to compete 
with foreign firms. Private enterprises should purchase their 
goods from many foreign firms. If they make effort to that end, 
their efforts will be understood in the international community. 
  [Kawabata] Mr. Hata, thank you very much for appearing on 
our 
interview program.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The following is a statement 
by Chief Cabinet Secretary and government spokesman Masayoshi 
Takemura on the U.S. Decision to reinstate the "Super 301" 
provision: 
  1. The government of the United States has decided to 
reinstate the Super 301 clause through an Executive Order. 
However, unilateral measures not in accordance with the dispute 
settlement rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be 
established as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
are explicitly prohibited. At a time when we have essentially 
agreed upon these new international trading rules, the 
Government of Japan cannot keep silent its concerns over this 
move to strengthen procedures enabling the United States to 
initiate unilateral actions against another country in the 
resolution of trade problems. 
  2. While it is necessary to closely watch what sort of 
measures the United States will take based upon the provisions 
of the reinstated Super 301 clause, the Government of Japan, in 
recognition of the responsibility for the development of the 
world economy that Japan and the United States, as the two 
largest economies in the world, bear in striving to maintain 
smooth bilateral economic relations, strongly hopes that the 
Government of the United States will act in a sensible manner, 
and for its part, recognizes the need for a restrained response. 
  3. In this regard, at a recent meeting of cabinet ministers 
concerned with external issues at the ministerial conference for 
economic measures, the Government of Japan reaffirmed its 
intention to advance voluntary measures toward further market 
opening. The Government of Japan is determined to make its 
utmost efforts to strive for smooth operation of our external 
relations, irrespective of the aforementioned moves in the 
United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Recent rises in long-term 
interest rates are not likely to hurt the economy and are 
probably a temporary phenomenon, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
said Friday. 
  He also told a news conference after a regular cabinet 
meeting that he is "concerned" about President Bill Clinton's 
decision to revive the retaliatory "Super 301" provision of U.S. 
Trade Law, but said Japan must react "coolly." 
  Asked about recent climbs in long-term government bond 
yields, Fujii said, "I do not think they are trending upward" 
and said they would not likely harm the economy. 
  Fujii said market rates "fell quite far" after last 
September's cut in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate to 
a record low 1.75 percent a year. 
  The benchmark 10-year government bond yield climbed to 3.94 
percent Wednesday, the highest since just before the rate cut, 
with market players citing a central bank survey that showed a 
halt in declining business confidence and supply-demand concerns 
over stepped-up government bond issuance. 
  Fujii cited markets analyses that overseas rate increases 
were pushing Japanese rates higher and that there are some 
expectations of Japanese economic recovery, but he repeated that 
the economic picture remains mixed. 
  He also repeated that the effects of last month's record 
15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package have yet to be 
felt, adding that "the effects should steadily emerge." 
  Fujii denied a suggestion that rates are rising naturally as 
the market thinks the economy has already bottomed and brushed 
off concern that premature rate increases could dash a recovery. 
  On the Super 301 trade provision, Fujii said, "It is 
possible 
that unilateral moves could occur, and we are concerned about 
that." 
  But he stressed that the overnight White House announcement 
merely sets in motion "procedures" that could ultimately result 
in sanctions or other moves. 
  He expressed hope that Washington will make a "sensible 
response," and said Japan must act in a cool-headed way to avoid 
a breakdown into a trade war. 
  Fujii said Japan plans to make a "voluntary, positive 
response," citing a pledge to complete a package of 
market-opening measures this month including deregulation, 
import promotion, improved government procurement practices and 
beefed-up antitrust enforcement. 
  But he said Japan's policy is to continue to oppose 
numerical 
targets to gauge progress, saying that macroeconomic targets 
have not been mentioned in discussions on the package by 
government ministers. 
  In the insurance sector, for which his ministry is 
responsible, Fujii said "substantial agreement had been reached" 
with the U.S. and that Japan will proceed "positively" on the 
issue. 
  Super 301 allows the U.S. Administration to retaliate 
against 
trade practices judged to be unfair, but U.S. officials have 
said they hope both sides can avoid retaliation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan on Friday voiced 
concern about U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to revive 
the "Super 301" trade retaliation mechanism through an executive 
order. 
  "We have to express concern about the U.S. Government move 
to 
build up the strength of its procedures that would clear the way 
for unilateral action in resolving trade disputes with other 
countries," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a 
news conference. 
  The top government spokesman made the comment after Clinton 
reinstated Thursday the trade measure that gives the U.S. 
Government broad legal authority to impose sanctions unless 
Japan meets U.S. demands on greater access to Japanese markets. 
  Takemura argued that taking unilateral action as a means of 
resolving bilateral trade rows is "implicitly" prohibited under 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or the 
yet-to-be-created World Trade Organization. 
  Saying both Japan and the United States shoulder heavy 
responsibility for smooth management of the world economy, 
Takemura urged the U.S. Government to "take sensible action." 
  The chief cabinet secretary also reiterated Tokyo is 
determined to do its utmost to further open its markets to 
foreign competition on a voluntary basis. 
  Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the 
President power to retaliate against countries which the U.S. 
deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa received a phone call from Clinton 
shortly after midnight Thursday Japan time notifying him of the 
decision to resuscitate Super 301, Takemura said. 
  Clinton was quoted as saying the revived provision is not 
intended to target any particular country and that the U.S. and 
Japan can resolve the brewing bilateral trade spat through 
dialogue. 
  Under the provisions spelled out by U.S. Trade 
Representative 
Mickey Kantor on Thursday, the U.S. Government will not identify 
any potential target country until September 30, and will seek 
to negotiate a settlement over a period of 12 to 18 months 
before taking any punitive action. 
  Kantor said, "It should be clearly understood we are not 
designating or identifying any practice of any country today." 
  During the phone call, Hosokawa told Clinton that Tokyo is 
scheduled to devise a package of measures to further open its 
markets by the end of March and said both countries should show 
restraint, Takemura said. 
  Asked if Japan will file a complaint with GATT if the U.S. 
imposes trade sanctions against it, the chief government 
spokesman only reiterated that Tokyo is making voluntary efforts 
to formulate a market-opening package.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan's Trade Minister 
Hiroshi Kumagai warned Friday that the U.S. decision to 
reinstate the super 301 trade provision may lead to a shrinkage 
of global trade. 
  Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, told 
a 
press conference after a morning cabinet meeting that the U.S. 
way of trying to resolve trade issues through unilateral 
measures carries the risk of shrinking trade as a whole. 
  "It is worrying that the U.S. strengthened the trade 
retaliation authority at a time when the international community 
is trying to boost free-market rules," he said. 
  Kumagai said the top priority for Japan now is to wrap up 
market- opening measures by the end of March as planned. 
  "I don't think the Japanese market is unfair or exclusive, 
but nevertheless there is a need to create a market with greater 
transparency," he said. 
  Japan needs to act voluntarily "to prevent Japan-U.S. 
relations from lapsing into a vicious cycle," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan's business community 
reacted with a mixture of caution and anger Friday [4 March] to 
the United States' revival of the so-called super 301 clause 
that allows President Bill Clinton to impose sanctions on 
countries deemed to have unfair trade practices. 
  "I deeply regret the reinstatement of this clause that has 
retaliation as a precondition," said Yutaka Kume, chairman of 
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. 
  Japan's auto industry has been under mounting pressure from 
the United States to boost purchases of U.S. Auto parts to help 
reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced Thursday 
that Clinton had signed an executive order reviving the super 
301 clause which authorizes him to identify what Washington 
regards as unfair trade practices subject to retaliation. 
  "Unilateral retaliation runs counter to the spirit of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," said an official 
at a major Japanese automaker. 
  "It's wrong to use the method of linking a macroeconomic 
issue like the (U.S. trade) deficit to a microeconomic issue 
(like auto trade)," he said. 
  Some business people said it remains uncertain whether the 
U.S. will actually take sanctions against Japan. 
  "I wonder if it is possible (for the U.S.) to do it because 
U.S. consumers will be the victims of import restrictions on 
autos," said an executive at one major automaker. 
  But some others pointed to the need for Tokyo to take 
measures to rectify the bilateral trade imbalance, saying Japan 
has been slow in taking action on the issue. 
  "The government should go ahead with macroeconomic measures 
to address the trade surplus by boosting domestic demand and 
recycling the surplus," NEC Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan's current account 
surplus rose 30.9 percent in January from a year before, marking 
a second straight increase after a one-month drop, the Finance 
Ministry said Friday. 
  The figure, representing the net balance in the nation's 
trade in goods and services and some unilateral transfers, 
totaled a preliminary 6.83 billion dollars before adjustments 
for seasonal factors, the ministry said. 
  The January figures followed December's year-on-year gain of 
9.3 percent to 12.57 billion dollars. That was a return to 
Japan's swelling black ink with the rest of the world after a 
November decline broke a string of six straight quarterly 
increases from year-earlier levels. 
  Within the current account, the merchandise trade surplus -- 
the difference between exports and imports of merchandise -- 
rose 15.1 percent in January from a year before to 8.26 billion 
dollars, the ministry said. 
  Exports rose 6.9 percent to 25.36 billion dollars, while 
imports rose 3.3 percent to 17.09 billion dollars.

<F P=106> [Policy speech by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to the </F>
129th ordinary Diet session on 4 March -- live] 
  [Text] Ever since my government was formed in August 1993, 
I have worked for the three reforms of political reform, 
administrative reform, and economic reform under the banner of 
responsible change. 
  With one era ended yet the emerging shape of the era to come 
yet unclear, we have no choice but to take the initiative in 
identifying new paths so as to ensure a bright outlook for the 
future. Having chosen the path of change and its demand that we 
remake politics, the economy, and our society, those of us 
responsible for government at this historic juncture have a duty 
to forge ahead no matter how great the difficulties. 
  Political reform was this government's first priority issue, 
and the passage of the amendments to the political reform laws 
represents a major step toward the attainment of new and 
responsible politics. Making every effort to ensure that the 
laws are implemented smoothly, I intend, with the consent of 
both houses of this Diet, to appoint the members of the House of 
Representatives Election District Advisory Commission soon and 
then, once their recommendations are received, to promptly 
submit legislation to this Diet for the actual redistricting. 
  Of course, I need not remind you that the real basis for 
rooting out political corruption and reestablishing trust in 
politics fundamentally has to lie in each and every politician's 
having a strong ethical sense. It is sad indeed that there are 
still widespread suspicions of structural linkages between money 
and politics as seen in the so-called construction scandals, and 
I believe it would be inexcusable should we fail to enact more 
effective anticorruption measures and other systemic reforms. 
  Political reform is the framework within which we can 
achieve 
responsible change, and we have only just reached the starting 
line for those real reforms where politics must take the 
initiative. Realizing how little time there is until the 21st 
century, it is clear that we must move steadfastly toward 
creating a society of quality and substance that will have the 
international community's trust. 
  In laying the foundations for a new era of development, it 
is 
first imperative that we demolish those systems and practices 
that are no longer compatible with the needs of the times. Now 
that we have made some progress on political reform, it is 
essential that we make a determined effort for economic reform 
and administrative reform, both for ourselves and so that we can 
fulfill our responsibilities to the international community. I 
thus intend to take up the gauntlet of new reforms, not 
forgetting the essential spirit of this reform government. 
  The thing that the people most ardently desire now is an 
escape from this grim recession. Although there are some bright 
spots, the overall picture remains one of uncertainty and 
dead-endedness, and we cannot take our economic future for 
granted. Within this, we must pay special attention to the grim 
employment picture. 
  It is thus crucial that we deploy all possible effective 
policy measures in a concerted and timely manner to work our way 
out of this situation. Thus it was that we recently drew up the 
comprehensive package of economic measures amounting to an 
unprecedented 15 trillion yen including income and residents tax 
cuts and additional measures under the third supplemental 
budget. Dovetailing this into the budget for fiscal 1994, we 
must now achieve seamless fiscal expenditures and get the 
economy on the road to recovery as soon as possible. 
  Along with ensuring strong growth for public works spending 
and local government projects in consideration of the state of 
the economy, the fiscal 1994 budget proposal represents a 
determined effort to promote social infrastructure improvements 
in preparation for the advent of the aged society, including 
priority investment in housing, water and sewer systems, parks, 
environmental facilities, and other areas impacting directly to 
improve the quality of Japanese life. Every possible 
consideration has also been paid to policies to support 
hard-pressed farmers and small businesspeople and to stabilize 
employment. 
  Given the critical state of the economy, I very much hope 
that this budget proposal will be enacted as soon as possible. 
  In addition to cyclical factors and the collapse of the 
speculative bubble, this recession is said to have been 
exacerbated by structural factors in that many of those economic 
structures that used to work so rationally are no longer 
effective. Dynamic development in the private sector, the main 
player in the Japanese economy, is essential if we are to 
resolve this problem and the ensure long-term development. I am 
confident that the private sector will face the current 
difficulties unflinchingly and will be able to overcome them, 
and it is to encourage and support these efforts that we must 
promote economic reform that, clarifying the medium-term 
outlook, will be conducive to business restructuring and the 
creation and development of new industries. 
  Looking specifically at deregulation, we intend to move 
toward making nonregulation the norm and regulation the 
exception in the economic sphere and to be constantly reviewing 
social regulations so as, inter alia, to expand business 
opportunities and broaden consumer choice and to enhance 
purchasing power by reducing the disparity between Japanese and 
overseas prices. We will take dramatic action with the priority 
on those areas that relate to promoting the more effective and 
appropriate use of land and encouraging housing construction, 
that stimulate the creation of new businesses in information 
telecommunications and other areas, that relate to reducing the 
disparity between Japanese and overseas prices in such areas as 
distribution and energy, and that affect import promotion. At 
the same time, we will work for the rigorous enforcement of the 
antimonopoly law to eliminate those anticompetitive practices 
that are a cause of Japan's higher prices and that inhibit the 
creation of new business opportunities and foreign access to 
Japan. 
  Administrative reform is an urgent issue that cannot be 
avoided as we seek to reform Japanese socioeconomic structures 
and make them better suited to the new era. While there is 
general agreement that Japanese administrative structures and 
systems functioned effectively for our development from the end 
of the war until recently, these structures and systems have not 
always been able to respond adequately to the striking 
transformation in the socioeconomic climate and the major 
changes in popular needs. It is impossible for administration 
alone to stand unchanged when there are such major changes 
taking place in politics and the economy. 
  Seeking to establish administration that is fair, 
transparent, and above all has the popular interest as its first 
priority, now is the time for us to initiate radical surgery on 
our administrative structures and systems. Starting with 
deregulation as an interface between the governmental and 
nongovernmental sectors and considering nothing sacred, I intend 
to reexamine all of those systems and structures that have not 
kept up with the times and to promote sweeping reform including 
redelineating governmental and nongovernment roles, redefining 
the relationship between the central and local governments, and 
correcting the impediments posed by our over-compartmentalized 
bureaucracy, as well as to make an effort for the greater 
disclosure of administrative information. 
  So far, we have spent an enormous amount of time on 
discussions at various venues, including the Second 
Extraordinary Administrative Research Council and the 
Administrative Reform Council. However, it is also true that 
there has been criticism, saying that not enough has been 
accomplished in administrative reform. While we are submitting 
legislation to this session of the Diet to establish a committee 
on administrative reform, I have resolved that the question 
before us is that of how to achieve effective administrative 
reform and am determined to promote visible administrative 
reform. 
  While I believe that our decision to implement the 
largest-ever income tax and residents tax cut was both necessary 
and justified given the current economic situation, that does 
not give us license to be irresponsible about the very serious 
fiscal situation that will exist at the end of fiscal 1994, 
including national bonds outstanding in excess of 200 trillion 
yen and a substantial overhang of local government bonds. It is 
imperative that the people understand that we cannot let the 
fiscal situation deteriorate unchecked and cannot leave future 
generations severely indebted. 
  If we are to avoid impairing the economy's vitality and are 
to respond appropriately to the needs of the times even with an 
aged society, it is essential that we press forward with fiscal 
reform and continue to work to ensure sound fiscal management, 
and further efforts will be needed to create a fiscal structure 
in which the value of national bonds outstanding does not 
continue to rise and rise. At the same time, we must also work 
for the smooth management of local finances as well. Thus it is 
that, in tandem with administrative reform, we are promoting 
thorough rationalization and prioritization of expenditures. On 
tax reform, we are working to promote discussion on the broad 
range of issues involved, including the national burden and the 
tax system, tax cuts and how to finance them, and how to 
distribute the tax burden appropriately and equitably, and hope 
to reach a consensus soon and to get the relevant legislation 
enacted by the Diet by the end of the year so as to institute a 
balanced tax structure combining income, consumption, asset, and 
other taxes and to achieve a vigorous and affluent welfare 
society. 
  I would like to make specific proposals in the three areas 
of 
(i) structuring society for boundlessly creative individuality, 
(ii) structuring the foundations for a life of abundance and 
quality, and (iii) structuring society so that older means more 
vigorous. 
  Looking at the world to come, I suspect the groundswell of 
diverse individuality will give birth to new cultural and 
economic activity and that will in turn become the fountainhead 
of new vitality. At the same time, this will constitute an 
important foundation enabling Japan to behave and to contribute 
as a responsible member of the international community. Now is 
the time for us to achieve new advances in science and 
technology, education, and information telecommunications so as 
to achieve this new development. 
  Science and technology is the driving force for the economy 
and the stuff of dreams for the future. Creating an environment 
in which scientists and engineers can engage creatively in the 
work they love is thus an indispensable investment in the 
future. It is often said that Japan lags behind in basic 
research and leading-edge research, but I believe Japan should 
play a leadership role, including international cooperation, in 
space, life sciences, the environment, energy, and other 
research areas looking ahead to the 21st century. Thus it is 
that, in addition to enhancing research facilities and the 
information infrastructure, I want to further improve the 
provisions for research and development, including education for 
boundlessly creative people and international cooperation. 
  At the same time, I would like to make Japan a society 
that radiates culture -- a society in which each individual, 
region, and the state projects richly distinctive culture that 
Japan can be proud of internationally and that works through 
cross-fertilization for new cultural creation. Accordingly, I 
will work to promote cultural, artistic, and sports activities 
such as fostering young artists and promoting cultural 
activities distinct to each region. In addition, I will place a 
high priority on promoting human resources development and 
international cultural exchanges by, for example, promoting the 
program to accommodate 100,000 foreign students by the beginning 
of the next century, further enhancing language education, and 
developing human resources in connection with our assistance 
programs so as to create a climate of dialogue in which we and 
our global neighbors can understand and accept our diversity 
better. 
  Using education to foster richly individual people is basic 
to creating a highly cultural country. There are many views of 
Japanese education, including that it is overly uniform or that 
it discourages initiative, and I want to promote educational 
reform aimed at creating more attractive and open education from 
the earliest years through university graduation. 
  One of the areas in which it is hoped that creative economic 
activity will open the way to new development in the years to 
come is that of information telecommunications. With the recent 
rapid technological advances, information is no longer limited 
by either space or time, and it is likely that we will be able 
to achieve a society early in the 21st century revolutionizing 
life and business as we now know them. Yet the fact is that 
Japanese information telecommunications has, unfortunately, not 
lived up to expectations. Thus it is that I want to draw up a 
new vision for the kind of information society that we seek from 
the long-term perspective as soon as possible, to make better 
use of information technologies in the public sector, and to 
develop a comprehensive package of measures including promoting 
the development of information telecommunications networks, 
fusing broadcasting and telecommunications, and promoting 
information education. 
  It should be noted that I will also work steadily to support 
the creation of new business opportunities in the information 
telecommunications sector by, for example, encouraging small 
businesses to go into new fields, working for flexible labor 
markets, activating the financial and securities markets, and 
promoting bold restructuring. 
  Japan has grown to be the world's second-strongest economic 
power, but I suspect many of the people do not yet have a sense 
of true affluence in their daily lives. People in the outlying 
areas feel they have fewer job opportunities than in the big 
cities and that they do not have the same convenient access to 
cultural and educational opportunities, and many people in the 
big cities feel their lives are blighted by the unaffordability 
of quality housing, the trauma of commuting, and other problems. 
Among the causes here are the overconcentration of functions in 
the Tokyo area and the inadequacy of social infrastructure 
relating to everyday life, and it is essential that we move 
quickly to institute effective policies in this area. 
  I believe the important thing here is that each region take 
the initiative in exercising ingenuity to create attractive 
communities and that we improve the infrastructure for balanced 
development throughout Japan. For this to happen, the first 
point is that local governments close to the people must take 
the lead in solving their residents' problems, which means we 
must make a determined effort to promote decentralization, 
including enhancing local government finances. I thus want to 
draw up a basic policy outline by the end of the year detailing 
the basic philosophy, the issues to be addressed, and the 
procedures to be followed, including the possibility of new 
legislation. 
  Working for the creation of a multicentered country, I also 
want to promote the dispersion of urban and industrial functions 
to outlying areas and to encourage the creation of efficient 
high-speed road, rail, and air transportation networks linking 
hub cities nationwide, to promote development for underpopulated 
and mountainous regions, and more. Along with working for the 
further enhancement of conservation and the total range of 
disaster- prevention policies, I will also continue to work 
vigorously for Hokkaido's overall growth and for Okinawa's 
development. 
  It is imperative that we further enhance the living related 
infrastructure directly related to providing greater convenience 
so that all people everywhere can have tangible sense of 
affluence no matter where they live. For example, we will seek 
to lower housing costs by promoting a dramatic restructuring of 
the housing industry, housing imports, and other means and will 
work to promote the more efficient and systematic use of land 
space so that people can live in bigger houses that feel less 
cramped and offer greater convenience. At the same time, it is 
necessary to steadfastly promote improvements in roads, parks, 
water and sewer systems, waste disposal plants, and other 
amenities and improvements in intracity rail carrying capacities 
and other social infrastructure to alleviate commuter crowding. 
  The environmental and energy issues are not only important 
issues for those of us alive today but must be dealt with in 
consideration of future generations and the whole of the global 
community. I thus want to draw up the basic environment law and 
to move to implement comprehensive policies as soon as possible 
so that we can bequeath a beautiful environment and the bounty 
of nature to future generations. Likewise, I want, in tandem 
with energy conservation and the faster development and use of 
alternative energy sources, to promote the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy premised upon assured safety. 
  The everyday safety and security that we enjoy in our lives 
is an asset that Japan can be proud of, and preserving this is 
one of the government's important responsibilities. Yet just as 
the crime picture has lately become quite grim with the 
increasing viciousness and ingenuity of organized criminal 
elements, the increasing frequency of drug-related incidents and 
shootings, and the fact that crime has become less localized and 
more international, we are also recording large numbers of 
traffic deaths. I intend to be unstinting in my efforts to 
maintain public order and to ensure public safety. 
  At the same time, I intend to submit comprehensive consumer 
protection and relief legislation, including the adoption of 
product liability rules, to this session of the Diet so as to 
enhance consumer interests in regard to product safety from the 
perspective of putting the consumer first. 
  If there is anxiety about the fact that Japan now has the 
longest lifespan in the world and will soon become the world's 
first society to have very large numbers of old people and very 
few children, this anxiety is politics' responsibility. If we 
are to achieve a vigorous and cheerful welfare society in the 
21st century, it is important that we draw up a comprehensive 
aged society welfare vision striking a balance among pension 
funding, health care, welfare provisions, and the other 
essential elements and reach a national consensus on how the 
envisioned welfare society is going to be supported. 
  To start with, I would like to structure society by the 
early 
21st century so that any individual who so desires can find 
gainful employment until at least the age of 65. In addition to 
modifying the unemployment insurance system to subsidize 
continued employment, I also want to make an active effort in 
support of reemployment and retraining for older people. The 
government pension system is a major financial support for the 
elderly, and I want to ensure that it is linked to this support 
for continued employment and want to ensure that it is basically 
reformed so as to be better suited to the truly aged society of 
the future. 
  In addition, I will fundamentally review the "gold plan" 
ten-year strategy to promote health care and welfare for the 
aged with all due heed to financing sources and will work to 
enhance the home- helper system and other care systems so as to 
create a society in which older people can enjoy good health and 
peace of mind. On the health insurance system and health 
insurance for the aged, I want to work to alleviate the cost to 
the patient of nursing care and to review the extent and 
specifics of coverage so as to enable the different systems to 
provide enhanced medical services responsive to the different 
needs of different patients. 
  Likewise, I will actively promote measures for the 
handicapped, including enhancing community access for these 
people under the new long-term program for government measures 
for disabled persons. 
  Health is a most important prerequisite to leading a rich 
life, and we will therefore move ahead with comprehensive 
policies to deal with cancer and other degenerative and 
intractable diseases. Along with drawing up a new 10-year 
strategy to defeat cancer and working to enhance the medical 
response to AIDs, including improving hub hospitals and 
advancing medical research on treatments, we will also work to 
contribute to the prevention and cure of AIDs on a global basis, 
including support for the tenth International Conference on AIDs 
to be held in Japan later this year. 
  Today's lower birth rates, the greater numbers of women 
working outside the home, and other factors have meant major 
changes in the social environment as it impacts children and the 
home. This year is the international year of the family. For 
these and other reasons, I want to work to create a climate in 
which people can have and raise children in confidence, 
including enhancing the nursery provisions and creating a 
children's environmental fund. In addition, I want to work to 
enhance the home-care leave system, including the possibility of 
postnatal leave payments under the unemployment insurance scheme 
and home-care leave legislation, so that people can reconcile 
the needs of home and work, and I also want to promote labor 
policies for part-time workers. 
  Likewise, I will promote comprehensive policies and seek to 
formulate systems conducive to the creation of a 
joint-participation society in which women are able to take an 
equal part with men in the total range of political, business, 
and social fields. 
  It bodes well for the world economy's future that the GATT 
Uruguay Round was finally concluded last December after more 
than seven years of negotiations. In concluding these 
negotiations, Japan accepted the draft agreement on agriculture, 
thereby according rice special treatment regarding tariffication 
and subjecting other agricultural products to tariffication. 
This was a most heartrending decision made after strenuous 
consideration in recognition of the broader national interest in 
the maintenance and strengthening of the free trading system. 
  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries serve many functions, 
such as ensuring the stable supply of food so vital to our lives 
and providing restful spaces rich in tradition and local 
culture. Water-filled paddies and sheaves of ripe rice are 
symbolic of Japan, and rice farming also plays a crucial role in 
land conservation and environmental protection. 
  Thus I believe it is now all the more important that the 
government make every possible effort to allay the anxieties 
felt by farmers and to create a climate in which they can devote 
themselves to farming. Taking the helm of the emergency 
agriculture and farming area headquarters established late last 
year, I am determined to make every effort to draw up a vision 
for agriculture's rebirth and to institute the necessary 
domestic measures. 
  Likewise for forestry and fisheries, I will also work to 
promote the improvement and preservation of forest resources and 
to promote a strong fishing industry drawing on the rich bounty 
of the life- sustaining sea. 
  Japan is currently running a massive current account 
surplus, 
and there are still insistent voices claiming that the Japanese 
market is closed. While some of this criticism stems from 
misunderstanding, I would rather see this as evidence of the 
high hopes people have for Japan and I believe we should take 
the initiative in implementing the necessary reforms in our own 
interest. 
  The economic reforms and administrative reforms now under 
way 
are responsive to the international community's expectations. 
Along with domestic-demand-led economic management, we need to 
ensure that the Japanese market is open to the rest of the world 
in accordance with international trade rules by promoting 
further deregulation and other measures to improve market access 
and rectify price differentials, ensuring greater transparency 
in government procurement procedures, strengthening the office 
of trade and investment ombudsman, and enhancing the import 
infrastructure. 
  I find it very unfortunate that President Clinton and I were 
unable to reach an agreement regarding the establishment of the 
so-called target values in the Japan-U.S. framework talks 
recently. Recognizing that Japan's responsibilities for 
harmonization with the international community are now greater 
than ever before, I believe that we must, while firmly adhering 
to free-trade principles, take effective measures to achieve a 
highly significant decrease in our current account surplus over 
the medium term. 
  While the road to world peace and stability is by no means 
smooth, our course is gradually becoming clearer as the 
international community pools its wisdom and its efforts toward 
its common goals. Indeed, the peace in Cambodia and the 
progress in the Middle East peace talks are symbolic of the way 
issues can be resolved through cooperation within the 
international community. 
  The United Nations is obviously the fulcrum of the 
international community's efforts, and its capacities should be 
further strengthened so that it can respond effectively to the 
needs of the new era. This year will be marked by international 
discussion of the reform of the Security Council, and Japan 
intends to take an active part in these discussions and is 
prepared to do all it can to discharge its responsibilities in 
order to meet the international community's expectations. 
  Looking ahead, I intend to work for a more peaceful and more 
prosperous world of respect for diversity by drawing upon all 
the resources at Japan's command, including not only economic 
cooperation but also personnel and intellectual cooperation, and 
marshaling them in effective combination to make a distinctively 
Japanese international contribution consistent with our Peace 
Constitution. 
  One of the areas in which Japan must play a larger role is 
that of regional conflict prevention and resolution. I believe 
resolving regional conflicts and stabilizing the affected 
regions needs a comprehensive approach that includes diplomatic 
efforts to end conflicts, U.N. peacekeeping operations, 
humanitarian assistance, and reconstruction development 
assistance for countries that have been torn apart by violence. 
The process by which the conflict in Cambodia was successfully 
drawn to a close is one good example of this approach. 
Currently taking part in the U.N. peacekeeping operations in 
Mozambique, Japan intends to continue to support international 
efforts for peace, including dispatching election observers to 
El Salvador later this month, providing support for the efforts 
to enhance Palestinian living standards as a key to peace in the 
Middle East, and enhancing its humanitarian assistance to the 
strife-ridden areas of former Yugoslavia. 
  The end of the Cold War presented an excellent opportunity 
for arms control and disarmament. Along with continuing to 
firmly uphold our three nonnuclear principles, I intend to make 
active efforts for the nonproliferation of nuclear and other 
weapons of mass destruction and missiles. On the issue of 
nuclear nonproliferation, the way has been cleared for the IAEA 
to inspect the declared nuclear facilities in North Korea, but 
it is still necessary to get North Korea to be more forthcoming. 
It is thus essential that Japan continue to respond 
appropriately to the situation as it develops, and, maintaining 
close coordination with the Republic of Korea, the United 
States, and the other countries concerned, we will work for a 
peaceful resolution of this issue. Japan will also cooperate in 
other fields of arms control and disarmament such as in 
cooperating for the dismantling of the former Soviet Union's 
nuclear weapons and ensuring effective implementation of the 
United Nations register of conventional arms. 
  Official development assistance has an important role to 
play 
in our efforts for world peace and prosperity. Japan is today 
the world's largest ODA [Overseas Development Assistance] donor 
country, and we intend to use this ODA effectively in line with 
Japan's official development assistance charter with an eye to 
encouraging the recipient countries' efforts to democratize, to 
ensure human rights and freedom, to shift to market economics, 
and to curtail military spending. 
  Along with using ODA and other means to contribute 
actively to resolving environmental issues, population issues, 
the AIDS epidemic, and the scourge of narcotics, refugee 
resettlement, and other issues, Japan will take leadership 
initiatives in the United Nations and other international 
efforts on these issues. 
  Japan and the United States have maintained a firm and 
active 
relationship over the past half-century. Although the 
relationship is currently beset with serious trade and economic 
issues, it is imperative that we cooperate to resolve these 
issues calmly and in the spirit of mutual trust. President 
Clinton and I have agreed that these issues must not be allowed 
to distort the broader Japan- U.S. relationship -- a 
relationship that is moving to a new plane in which each of the 
two countries seeks cooperation while respecting the other's 
positions and judgments. The efforts under way for reform in 
both Japan and the U.S. will strengthen this bilateral 
relationship. It is essential, not only for our two countries 
but for world peace and development, that Japan and the U.S. 
continue to maintain close political, security, economic, and 
global cooperation relations and strive to further stabilize the 
Japan-U.S. partnership. 
  The Japan-U.S. security arrangements are increasingly 
important for security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, 
which is still fraught with destabilizing factors even after the 
end of the Cold War. Japan will continue to make the possession 
of an appropriate-scale defense capability and the maintenance 
of these Japan-U.S. security arrangements its fundamental 
defense policies. It is about twenty years since the national 
defense program outline was adopted to provide the guidelines 
for Japan's defense capability, and I believe it is now 
necessary to reexamine the outline's basic approach in light of 
the dramatic changes in the international situation and the 
remarkable scientific and technological advances that have been 
made since then. Getting ideas from a wide range of people, I 
hope to identify the basic directions for this process as soon 
as possible. 
  Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of World War 
II. Once a battlefield, the Asia-Pacific region has today 
developed into one of the most promising regions anywhere in the 
world. The November 1993 informal APEC economic leaders' 
meeting bringing the region's leaders together was thus a 
historic event marking the start of a new era of regional 
cooperation. Attending this leaders' meeting, I had candid 
exchanges of views with the other leaders there and got the 
impression that there is a gradually but unmistakable 
groundswell of regional unity here. Political and security 
dialogues affecting the entire region are getting under way in 
earnest, and the ASEAN regional forum is scheduled to be 
convened this year with China, Russia and other countries also 
taking part. I do not intend to miss this opportunity to work to 
forge stable and open cooperative relations within the region. 
  Japan-China relations have made major strides forward with 
the 20th anniversary of the normalization of relations and the 
15th anniversary of the conclusion of the treaty of peace and 
friendship. I am going to visit China later this month and to 
hold candid exchanges of views with Chinese leaders, and I 
intend to work to have the cooperative relationship between 
Japan and China contribute even more to the international 
community. 
  In our relations with the Republic of Korea, as affirmed 
with 
President Kim Yong-sam in last year's summit meeting, we want to 
further expand our person-to-person and cultural exchanges and 
to work for the natural development of our future-oriented 
relationship. On the question of normalizing relations with 
North Korea, it is essential that we continue to carefully watch 
their moves on the nuclear weapons development and other issues. 
  President Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October laid new 
foundations for further development in Japan-Russia relations. 
While the situation in Russia is now less clear after last 
December's parliamentary elections and this January's cabinet 
reshuffle, Japan intends to make every effort for the resolution 
of the territorial issue and the full normalization of 
Japan-Russia relations in accordance with the Tokyo declaration 
signed during president Yeltsin's visit to Japan and to provide 
the appropriate support for reform efforts. 
  The European Union inaugurated last November represents 
further degree of integration beyond the EC, and this is also 
spreading to the North European countries and the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe. There can be no doubting that this 
more-integrated Europe will have a greater voice and will play 
an increasingly important role in the international community. 
I thus intend to broaden and deepen our dialogue and policy 
cooperation with our European friends with whom we share common 
values. 
  It is now about half a year since this coalition government 
was created embodying the fervent hopes of the people for 
Japan's rebirth. We have confronted a number of major issues 
during even this short period of time, yet these trials are only 
natural given that we have dared to choose a new and untrod 
path. The people's voice is my only guide in this unknown 
journey, I am determined to effect these great historic reforms 
in response to popular expectations. 
  In this, I ask again for your understanding and cooperation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The leader of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) blasted Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Friday for failing to explain his policy 
priorities in an address to the Diet. 
  The premier delievered a major policy speech to the 
legislature "in a very mechanical way," LDP President Yohei Kono 
told reporters. 
  He said he got the impression that the speech was 
"time-consuming but did not reveal what is important to us." 
  Improvement of strained bilateral relations with the United 
States is the issue of most concern now, Kono said, accusing 
Hosokawa of treating it as though it were a trivial matter. 
  The premier should have pointed in his Diet address to 
specific measures to jolt the nation out of the worst economic 
slump since World War II, he said. 
  Kono, the first LDP chief in nearly 40 years to be 
opposition 
leader rather than prime minister, also complained that Hosokawa 
failed to explain the muddle over his abortive plan to reshuffle 
his seven-month-old cabinet. 
  Hosokawa merely read a speech prepared by bureacrats without 
modifications, he added. 
  Asked what he will focus on when he questions the premier in 
the Diet next week, Kono said he will raise the question of what 
achievement the Hosokawa administration has made in the past 
seven months. 
  Hosokawa's coalition government ousted the LDP from power 
last August for the first time in 38 years.

<F P=106> [Foreign policy speech by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to </F>
the 129th ordinary Diet session -- live] 
  [Text] Upon opening the 129th ordinary Diet session, I 
would like to deliver Japan's basic foreign policy. 
  First, I would like to explain my view on the international 
situation. Now that the Cold War structure has collapsed, the 
world is exploring the new framework of peace and prosperity. 
The exploration, however, has a long way to go and the way is 
rocky. The present international community, which is in 
transition, is faced with uncertainty and unpredictability and 
has many tasks to accomplish. In the world economy, North 
America's economy is robustly recovering, but many other nations 
are suffering from recession and serious unemployment. As for 
regional conflicts, the first step has been taken toward 
sustained peace and reconstruction in Cambodia. Signs of 
settling the conflicts in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, despite 
concerted efforts by the international community, are still not 
visible. North Korea's suspected nuclear development and the 
possible proliferation of weapons of mass destruction following 
the breakup of the Soviet Union are threatening world safety. 
Such global issues as poverty in developing countries, the 
global environment, population, and refugees are getting 
serious. In this way, the international community is continuing 
to sail without a destination in these dramatically changing 
waves. I believe, however, that the international community 
will find a beacon to guide its voyage and the beacon is 
beginning to show the path we will have to follow. The beacon is 
a target that the international community will have to pursue 
through cooperation and collaboration and the target is to 
create a world where people can live in peace and prosperity. 
The international community has increasingly expected help from 
Japan, which has built today's prosperity in peace while 
pursuing the target. Japan should meet the international 
community's expectations and take responsibility for creating 
the framework of world peace and stability. To those ends, 
Japan's foreign policy is being asked to play a more aggressive 
role. [applause] 
  Next, in line with the principles I just stated, I would 
like 
to outline major policy tasks with which Japan will have to 
grapple. Worldwide economic stagnation and unemployment have 
resulted in an increase of protectionist moves and intensifying 
economic frictions. To build a fluent and prosperous world by 
preventing them, it is necessary for many other nations to 
promote policy coordination. It goes without saying that Japan, 
which accounts for about one-sixth of the world's GNP, has a 
responsibility to play a great role. The Uruguay Round was 
successfully concluded last December after undergoing difficult 
negotiations and I believe the successful conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round is a victory for the principle of free trade, the 
principle of open trade mutilateralism, and international 
cooperation. Faced with various difficulties, Japan was engaged 
in negotiations until the very end, and Japan insisted, to the 
maximum extent, on its rice position. Japan's decision to 
accept an agricultural negotiations accord, including the 
establishment of a special exception of comprehensive 
tariffication, contributed to the successful conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round. Japan decided to accept the agricultural 
negotiations accord with great pains from the standpoint of 
making its due international contributions. A cabinet 
ministers' meeting to sign the final documents is set to be held 
in Morocco and we are making full preparations for signing 
relevant agreement documents. I would like to ask the Diet to 
speedily ratify those agreement documents. Japan will work to 
maintain and strengthen the multilateral trade structure that is 
the basis for the prosperity of not only Japan, but for the rest 
of the world by scrupulously implementing the results of the 
Uruguay Round in the future. 
  Japan's economy remains unpredictable and Japan still runs a 
huge surplus. With this economic situation in mind, last month, 
the government announced a package of 15.25-trillion-yen 
economic stimulus measures which call for income tax cuts, an 
expansion of domestic demand, and the promotion of deregulation 
to revitalize the economy. I believe that promoting reform of 
the economic structure by steadily implementing the package and 
securing sustained economic growth led by domestic demand will 
contribute to the establishment of harmonized economic relations 
with foreign nations and the stable development of the world 
economy. As for deregulation in particular, it will serve to 
improve the quality of life for the people. I think that the 
government, therefore, needs to make further efforts for the 
deregulation. As foreign minister, I have felt keenly growing 
worldwide hopes for peace since I took office. In response to 
those hopes, Japan will have to do what it can do to fulfill 
them. 
  North Korea's suspected nuclear development is a threat to 
the peace and safety in Northeast Asia and is a major challenge 
to the nuclear nonproliferation efforts. It has been decided 
that the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will conduct 
inspections at declared nuclear sites in North Korea. Progress 
in U.S.-North Korea talks will hold the key to clearing up North 
Korea's suspected nuclear development for the time being. Japan 
for its part will persistently urge North Korea to completely 
withdraw its decision to pull out of the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), completely implement an 
agreement reached with the IAEA, and come to agree with South 
Korea to announce a joint declaration on denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula while keeping close contact with such concerned 
nations as the United States, South Korea, and China. 
  From its position of seeking reinforcement of the 
multinational framework and the mechanism for preventing 
proliferation of mass destruction weapons, Japan supports 
continuation of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. We 
are also playing a positive role in negotiations to enact a 
multinational ban on nuclear testing, which aims to further 
disarmament efforts by nuclear power nations. 
  Japan will also maintain its cooperative policy for those 
working to abolish nuclear weapons stored in the former Soviet 
Union. The Japanese Government signed the Chemical Weapons 
Convention [CWC] last year, and is seeking the Diet's early 
approval of the treaty. Japan will also strongly support 
Ukraine's efforts to dismantle its nuclear weapons. 
  To cope with the recent proliferation of both weapons of 
mass 
destruction and conventional weapons, it is necessary to review 
and reinforce multinational trade control systems. Japan will 
positively engage itself in international discussions on this 
issue. 
  Disregarding such efforts by Japan, some foreign media have 
recently raised, without any grounds, questions about Japan's 
nonnuclear policy. As the only victim of nuclear weapons, Japan 
adheres to its triple nonnuclear principles [not to manufacture, 
possess, or import nuclear weapons], and its use of nuclear 
energy is limited strictly to peaceful purposes. So, I would 
like to emphasize again that Japan will never develop nuclear 
weapons. 
  It appears regional conflicts in former Yugoslavia and 
Somalia have been caused by ethnic and religious antagonism and 
it will be very difficult to settle them; however, the 
international community is patiently dealing with the problem. 
In particular, Bosnia-Herzegovina is still suffering bloodshed. 
Japan will continue its efforts to obtain peace, in conjunction 
with the United Nations and the individual nations concerned. 
In February, the government hammered out a package of policies 
for former Yugoslavia consisting of more humanitarian aid, 
economic assistance to the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, and the reorganization of diplomatic establishments 
in the region. 
  In addition to diplomatic efforts and economic cooperation, 
Japan has promoted personnel assistance to settle regional 
conflicts through participation in UN peacekeeping operations in 
such nations as Angola, Cambodia, and Mozambique. Participation 
in UN operations in Cambodia have cost our nation great 
sacrifices of life; however, we consider that Japan's presence 
made a big contribution to Cambodian peace. We would like to 
express our sincere condolences to those who were killed in 
helping to achieve that. 
  As part of Japan's assistance to peace efforts in Central 
America, Japan is planning to dispatch election monitors to El 
Salvador later this month. With ethnic and religious conflicts 
increasing in number, it is important for us to offer counsel 
for those in trouble. We would like to promote contributions 
which are suitable for Japan to make. 
  Under our definition, a humane world is one in which people 
can enjoy prosperity with the guarantee of freedom, democracy, 
and human rights. At present, reform efforts are being promoted 
to help the large number of people who favor democracy and a 
market economy. This is a great trend of history, and Japan will 
continue to offer positive support for the trend. While some 
developing nations are making incredible economic progress, most 
still suffer from poverty and hunger. We strongly believe the 
economic and social development of these nations is a necessary 
prerequisite for peace and prosperity in the world. To achieve 
this, we should consider not only economic assistance, but also 
comprehensive approaches which include the promotion of trade 
and investments. 
  Japan's assistance to developing nations is the most 
important pillar of its contribution to the international 
community, in the sense that this is the way we can best make 
good use of our experience in economic development. Last June, 
the government hammered out the fifth midterm objective of 
official development assistance [ODA] programs under which Japan 
will offer from $70 billion to $75 billion over the five-year 
period starting in the fiscal year 1994. In view of Japan's 
desire to play a role in this field despite the current severe 
economic situation, the government has proposed ODA spending of 
1.634 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 budget plan. Based on the 
government's ODA guidelines, we would like to obtain the 
understanding of the Japanese public, and the appreciation of 
aid-receiving nations for our peace and development-minded aid 
policy. Throughout last fall and this winter, Japan has taken 
the chair of international conferences on development in 
Cambodia, Mongolia, Indochina, and Africa. Japan is, thus, 
playing a leading role in multinational frameworks to support 
development, democratization, and economic reform in developing 
nations. We would like to maintain Japan's initiative in this 
field. 
  Global issues such as environment, population, AIDS, 
drugs, and refugee problems are serious concerns to the entire 
world. It is urgent for developed and developing nations to 
cooperate in solving these problems. In this regard, Japan 
intends to actively assist developing countries in solving 
environmental issues. Also, when the prime minister visited the 
United States in February, he announced Japan's plan to spend $3 
billion, or about 300 billion yen, over the next seven years to 
assist developing nations in resolving population and AIDS 
problems. The International Conference on Population and 
Development is scheduled to hold its session in Cairo in 
September. Population problems are closely related to 
environment and development. Japan has been actively promoting 
efforts to contribute to the success of the meeting. For 
example, it sponsored a meeting of a wise men's conference on 
population and development in January. Now that relations of 
mutual dependence between countries have become deeper than 
ever, it is imperative to strengthen international cooperation 
to resolve the issues I have just mentioned. 
  Because the current international situation is severe, it is 
essential for Japan, the United States, and Europe to take the 
lead in promoting policy cooperation to tackle global issues. 
Japan intends to continue efforts to strengthen policy 
cooperation among Japan, the United States, and Europe on such 
occasions as summit meetings. Even under a new international 
situation, Japan's basic diplomatic policy of maintaining close, 
cooperative relations with the United States based on the 
security pact will never change. Japan-U.S. relations have 
become more and more important for ensuring peace and stability 
in the Asia-Pacific region. Prime Minister Hosokawa visited the 
United States in February to hold the third summit meeting with 
President Clinton. Although the two leaders failed to reach an 
accord on the bilateral framework trade talks, they agreed that 
the disagreement should not affect bilateral cooperation in 
solving political, security, and global problems. Concerning the 
framework trade talks, I myself visited Washington one day 
earlier than scheduled to coordinate opinions on objective 
criteria and numerical targets. I met with Vice President Gore, 
State Secretary Christopher, Treasury Secretary Bentsen, and 
Trade Representative Kantor and eagerly negotiated with them to 
reach an agreement. However, unfortunately, the two sides 
failed to find a common ground on trade issues and decided to 
have a cooling-off period for the time being. Meanwhile, the 
two leaders discussed international affairs relating to North 
Korea, China, and Russia in their summit meeting, and their 
discussions reflected the breadth and depth of the current 
relations between Japan and the United States. Also, the two 
nations formulated an action program to promote cooperation in 
resolving global issues such as environment, population, and 
AIDS problems. During my recent visit to Washington, I also met 
with newly appointed Defense Secretary Perry and shared the same 
view with him about the importance of the Japan-U.S. security 
system. Japan-U.S. relations are currently in a tough phase 
over economic problems. While working for maintaining and 
deepening overall Japan-U.S. relations, I am determined to make 
all-out efforts to seek a breakthrough in the deadlocked 
economic and trade relations as early as possible to solve 
pending issues, thus further strengthening the Japan-U.S. 
partnership. 
  The European Union has entered a new phase of unification 
after the EU Treaty went into effect. It is more necessary than 
before for Japan to build relations with the EU on a firmer 
foundation. Based on the Japan-EC joint declaration issued in 
1991, the government will further deepen relations with the EU 
as partners who share the same sense of values. Also, beyond 
economic and trade ties, the government will promote dialogue 
and cooperation with the EU to solve various problems common to 
the international community. 
  Amid drastic changes in the international community, 
there are many favorable factors in the Asia-Pacific region. 
The region has achieved remarkable economic development under 
relatively steady growth rates. Under these favorable 
circumstances, various forms of intraregional cooperation are 
being promoted in the region. In the political and security 
fields, an atmosphere for holding dialogue throughout the region 
has been rapidly growing in recent years in line with our 
conventional proposal. An ASEAN regional forum is scheduled to 
be held this year for the first time. In addition to member 
nations of the expanded ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting, China, 
Russia, and other nations will attend the forum where foreign 
ministers will exchange opinions on political and security 
issues concerning the entire region. I believe that it is 
important to create a sense of security among various nations 
within the region by promoting transparency concerning every 
nation's policies through such a forum. The Asian Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference exists as a framework for 
economic cooperation within the region. An informal APEC 
economic conference, which was held in November last year, made 
great achievements. For example, a future prospect for 
intraregional cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region as well 
as a direction for future cooperation were indicated at the 
conference. Holding the belief that intraregional cooperation 
in the political, security, and economic fields will contribute 
to the peace and prosperity of the international community as a 
whole, Japan hopes to take the initiative in promoting such 
cooperation in the future to turn the region into the very 
fountain of peace. 
  China is expected to become a more important entity not only 
in the Asia-Pacific region but also in the international 
community. Relations between Japan and China have been 
developing in a favorable manner. During my visit to China in 
January, I held meetings with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li 
Peng, and Qian Qichen, vice premier and concurrently foreign 
minister. I had frank and meaningful exchanges with them on 
bilateral issues as well as on international issues about which 
the two countries are concerned. Moreover, during Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan, I took the opportunity to 
have a meaningful exchange with him while keeping my visit to 
China in mind. Japan intends to build future-oriented relations 
between Japan and China as well as a bilateral relationship 
which will result in world contributions, and intends to further 
deepen cooperation between the two countries. Japan also 
intends to continue to cooperate with China in promoting its 
policy of reform and opening up. 
  The Korean peninsula constitutes an unstable factor in the 
Asia-Pacific region in view of North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development. Although negotiations between Japan and North 
Korea on normalizing diplomatic relations have been suspended, 
the government intends to tackle the issue while cautiously 
watching North Korea's future moves. 
  Under the circumstances, our relations with neighboring 
South Korea, which shares the common values of freedom and 
democracy, are increasing in importance. President Kim Yong-sam 
is expected to visit Japan as a state guest in late March. Our 
government will exert efforts to develop a broad, 
future-oriented bilateral relationship of cooperation. 
  In Indochina, a new government elected through free 
elections 
came into existence in Cambodia. Vietnam and Laos are also 
implementing liberal economic reforms. Japan proposed the 
organization of an Indochina development forum to deal with the 
development of the whole region, and this forum is scheduled to 
be held in the second half of this year. We intend to promote 
international cooperation in the future through this forum and 
other venues. 
  Democratization and economic liberalization have also gone a 
long way in Southwest Asia. Japan will assist such efforts, and 
work on nuclear nonproliferation in this region. 
  The United Nations is expected to play a very important role 
in world peace and stability. Further strengthening the 
functions of the United Nations is an urgent task. This year, a 
working level meeting will be convened on the reorganization of 
the Security Council, and wide-ranging discussions are expected 
both in Japan and in foreign countries. 
  Japan, as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, has 
exerted earnest efforts in the past two years to work for the 
building of a more peaceful world. Today, there is increasing 
demand by international public opinion for Japan to play an even 
more active role in the United Nations. In response to such 
expectations, I believe Japan should assume whatever 
responsibilities it can. In promoting international cooperation, 
Japan's relations with other major nations and regions are 
important. President Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October was a 
very important visit that laid a new foundation for promoting 
relations between Japan and Russia. Parliamentary elections were 
held last December in Russia following the President's visit to 
Japan and President Yeltsin reshuffled his cabinet last January. 
The Russian situation still remains uncertain and Japan needs to 
closely watch Russia's future domestic situation. In 
Japan-Russia relations, Japan sent election monitors to Russia 
when the parliamentary elections were held. Both Japan and 
Russia held working-level talks in February this year and they 
also resumed the meeting of the working group on the conclusion 
of a peace treaty. In this way, the two countries have been 
engaged in brisk political dialogue. At the private level, 
Japan, the United States, and Russia held the first round of the 
tripartite talks in Tokyo. Thus, Japan and Russia have held a 
broad-ranging dialogue. Under these developments, I will visit 
Russia this month. At a series of meetings with Russian leaders, 
I intend to reiterate that settling the territorial dispute and 
then completely normalizing diplomatic Japan-Russia relations 
will be important not only to the two nations but also to 
securing the peace and security of the Asian-Pacific region. I 
also intend to point out that it is important for Russia to 
continue its reform policies for democratization, market 
economy, and cooperative diplomacy which is conducted on the 
basis of law and justice. I plan to confirm with Russian leaders 
that as long as Russia continues those reform policies, Japan 
will aggressively support those reform policies. 
  Last September, Israel and the PLO agreed to issue a 
declaration on self-rule in Israeli-occupied lands and I myself 
attended a historic signing ceremony in Washington. Israel and 
the PLO have since worked to put the declaration into effect. 
Thanks to the efforts of the United States, Israel and Syria 
have held serious peace negotiations. 
  Japan is committed to providing $200 million in aid over 
the next two years to stabilize the life of Palestinians. Of the 
amount, it has already announced plans to provide $50 million. 
Aid from the international community is indispensable for 
promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. Japan will 
strengthen political dialogue with nations in the region and 
participate in multilateral talks on Middle East peace. It will 
continue to assist Palestinians. 
  In the Latin American nations, the market economy has been 
making steady progress and structural poverty remains a task to 
be tackled. Japan will continue to assist those nations' reform 
efforts. 
  In Africa, presidential and parliamentary elections were 
held 
last year in some nations and thus political reform is making a 
headway. Many nations are gripped by unstable domestic 
situations and they have difficulty overcoming their economic 
problems. Japan will continue to assist political and economic 
reform efforts by those nations. It also will assist those 
nations through bilateral and multilateral frameworks. 
  To keep the world in peace and stability, it is necessary to 
build a relationship of trust and deepen mutual understanding 
among nations. In a bid to deepen other nations' understanding 
of Japan, Japan will strengthen publicity activities and work to 
promote international exchanges. Last year, Japan hosted an 
international conference on Angkor Wat. It will aggressively 
cooperate with developing nations to preserve mankind's tangible 
or intangible cultural relics and promote their cultures. 
  Science and technology are the key to opening the future. It 
is important for Japan to steadily promote international 
cooperation to share them with other nations. 
  With the international situation still remaining unstable, 
the number of Japanese who carry out activities abroad is 
growing, and this is increasing the number of Japanese who are 
involved in accidents and crimes abroad. The government will 
strengthen measures to ensure safety for those Japanese. The 
government also will redouble its effort to speedily airlift 
back home Japanese who live in countries where civil wars or 
coups occur. 
  As I stated, in order for Japan to accomplish diplomatic 
tasks, it should respond properly to the dramatically changing 
international situation and conduct flexibly its diplomacy with 
a long-term perspective. I intend to work to strengthen 
preparedness for the conduct of Japan's diplomacy. But it is 
only possible to conduct our diplomacy with the people's 
support. I intend to continue to work to win people's 
understanding of Japan's diplomacy. I am in charge of conducting 
Japan's diplomacy at this time which is very important to the 
future of the international community and I feel awed at my 
duties. I would like to solicit further cooperation from my 
fellow dietmen and the people. [applause].

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, whose political leverage is waning following this 
week's abortive attempt to shuffle his cabinet, will face 
questioners in the Diet next week amid worsening relations with 
the United States. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will come to 
Tokyo 
next week to mend the strained bilateral ties or put further 
pressure on Japan to open its markets further. 
  Christopher's Tokyo visit follows President Bill Clinton's 
signing of an executive order to reinstate the super 301 
provision of a 1988 trade law giving the President the authority 
to retaliate against countries deemed to be engaging in unfair 
trade practices. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, responding 
immediately to the U.S. action, called it "unilateral" and urged 
Washington to exercise care in applying super 301. 
  "Japan wants to resolve the case multilaterally rather than 
bilaterally," said Hata, suggesting Japanese readiness to bring 
the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Christopher will arrive in Tokyo on Wednesday as part of a 
four- nation tour of Asia and Australia. He will meet Hosokawa, 
Hata and other Japanese leaders during his three-day stay. 
  According to a senior State Department official, Christopher 
will discuss trade issues with Japanese leaders and warn Japan 
of a potential fallout beyond economics. 
  The secretary of state will play largely a listening role 
and 
has no plan to make any U.S. proposal on how to resolve trade 
disputes with Japan, Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord 
said. 
  Lord said the economic problems afflicting Japan and the 
U.S. 
"are very serious" and added they could spill over to other 
aspects of the bilateral relationship if left unattended. 
  Clinton, ignoring a Japanese plea, took the super 301 action 
after his talks with Hosokawa in Washington last month on a new 
trade framework for the two countries collapsed. 
  The U.S.-proposed framework is aimed at opening Japan's 
markets and reducing its huge trade surplus with the United 
States by setting specific targets. 
  The failure of the talks has drastically reduced the number 
of Japanese who think Japan-U.S. relations are good. 
  An ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper poll released this week said 
pollees who consider bilateral ties to be good plunged to a 
record low of 20 percent, down from 37 percent two months 
earlier. 
  Those who do not consider relations to be good increased 
from 
42 percent to 64 percent, the poll found. 
  Hosokawa will appear in the Diet for three days from Monday 
to reply to questions from ruling and opposition legislators on 
his administrative policy speech delivered this week. 
  His political leadership was badly damaged this week as he 
failed to shake up his seven-month-old cabinet -- an action 
aimed chiefly at dumping Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura. 
  Political commentators said Hosokawa wanted to get rid of 
Takemura because of growing differences in political outlook 
between the two, both former prefectural governors whose 
relationship was once described as close. 
  The abortive attempt has left a serious scar and split in 
Hosokawa's seven-party coalition between those supporting the 
prime minister and those backing Takemura. 
  Cambodian Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun 
Sen are scheduled to visit Tokyo from Wednesday through Saturday 
to attend an International Conference on Cambodian 
Reconstruction in which the U.S. Secretary of State will also 
take part. 
  The International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia 
will be held on Thursday and Friday with the participation of 3l 
countries and the European Union as well as l2 international 
organizations, including the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund. 
  Meetings of the Cambodian premiers with Hosokawa and Hata 
are 
also scheduled, and official Japanese sources said Japan will 
offer Cambodia some 9 billion yen in grant aid for fiscal 1994. 
  Other foreign dignitaries visiting Japan next week include 
Xiao Rong, the third daughter of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  Xiao, who often accompanies her father, will stay in Japan 
from Monday to Saturday in connection with a book she wrote 
about her father's life. The book was recently translated into 
Japanese. 
  She is a vice president of the China Association for 
International Friendly Contacts and a member of the National 
People's Congress, China's parliament. 
  Other events next week include a seminar Japan will host 
from 
Monday to Friday for 12 former Soviet republics on its measures 
on arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation. 
  It will be the first gathering including all 12 former 
Soviet 
republics to discuss controls on the export of technology with 
military application. 
  The seminar is designed to help the 12 establish an 
effective 
export control system to strengthen the nonproliferation of arms. 
  On the economic front, the Economic Planning Agency will 
release a monthly economic report Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Sadao Yamahana, state 
minister in charge of political reform, accepted a request by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Friday to remain in the 
cabinet to finish work on reforming the election system, 
government officials said. 
  Hosokawa asked Yamahana, former head of the Social 
Democratic 
Party (SDP), to proceed with drawing up districts for the 300 
single-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives, the 
officials said. 
  The request was made as the House of Councillors passed into 
law political reform package amendments that will replace the 
current multiseat districts with 300 single-seat constituencies 
and 200 seats allocated according to popular vote in 11 
electoral units. 
  The package, which also revises regulations on political 
donations by corporations, will be enforced after enactment of a 
law delineating the 300 single-seat constituencies, expected 
this fall. 
  Hosokawa also asked Yamahana to study the possibility of 
lowering the age of voter eligibility from 20 to 18.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japanese Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii confirmed Friday some bright spots in consumption 
to support his assessment of the increasing chances of an 
economic recovery. 
  "The advent of demand for repurchases of durable consumer 
goods is expected," Fujii said in a fiscal policy address 
explaining economic issues and the fiscal 1994 budget package to 
a plenary session of the House of Representatives. 
  He added that phrase to an otherwise similar economic 
assessment to that made in his fiscal address to the House of 
Councillors in mid-February. 
  The latest statistics, led by the Bank of Japan's quarterly 
"Tankan" business sentiment survey, have pointed to recovering 
consumption in such durable goods as refrigerators and washing 
machines. 
  Fujii reiterated that the economy remains "tough in personal 
consumption and capital investment." 
  But "the time is steadily ripening for a recovery," he 
repeated, citing the new bright signs along with "progressing 
inventory and capital stock adjustments amid support from public 
investment and housing construction." 
  Fujii said the government has launched a record 15.25 
trillion yen stimulus package, including 6 trillion yen in tax 
cuts, to "swell those recovery buds and move the economy toward 
full-fledged recovery as soon as possible in fiscal 1994 and 
ensure a stable growth in and after fiscal 1995." 
  He reiterated his "confidence" that the package, along with 
the recently enacted third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget and 
the fiscal 1994 budget submitted to the lower house, would 
"greatly contribute to a full-fledged recovery by clearing 
uncertainties ahead and encouraging a pick-up in domestic demand 
led by personal consumption." 
  On the monetary side, Fujii did not spell out any need for 
further policy measures, saying he hopes the effects of past 
policy measures will "spread further." 
  "Various interest rates have declined sharply...as a result 
of the latest round of official discount rate cuts" to a record 
low 1.75 percent, Fujii added. 
  Touching on the issue of full tax reforms for permanent 
income tax cuts, he stressed the government would pursue an 
agreement reached by the ruling coalition leaders to enact a 
reform law by the end of year in line with a "balanced tax 
system in income, assets and consumption." 
  Fujii reiterated he would take "timely and appropriate" 
measures to stem speculative movements "as seen recently" and 
keep stable currency rates reflecting economic fundamentals. 
  He stressed Japan's active contribution to global 
development 
and called for international policy cooperation through meetings 
of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven 
leading nations and a gathering later this month in Hawaii of 
finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) forum. 
  But Fujii did not offer any new measures to curb Japan's 
huge 
trade surplus. 
  On the global economy, he said, "some signs of a recovery 
can 
be seen, but they are not yet indicating a strong growth." 
  Among the leading nations, "efforts are necessary for 
economic restructuring with structural problems such as huge 
fiscal deficits and high unemployment."
