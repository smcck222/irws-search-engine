  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japanese economic planning 
chief Manae Kubota said Friday that although times are tough the 
government hopes for a turnaround in the coming fiscal year. 
  But despite some recent bright spots in official reports, 
the 
director general of the Economic Planning Agency offered little 
change in her economic policy address to a full session of the 
House of Representatives, four days before her agency releases 
its monthly economic report. 
  In contrast to Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who has 
maintained that interest rates are low enough to help spur 
recovery, Kubota hinted that further loosening of credit may 
become necessary. 
  "On monetary policy, I think appropriate and flexible 
management is needed, while closely watching domestic and 
international economic movements and international currency 
conditions," she said. 
  Kubota said the severity of employment conditions is 
apparent 
in the broadly sluggish economy, marked by slumping personal 
consumption and falling corporate capital spending. 
  She had cited modest labor market improvements in such 
sectors as construction but had said conditions have not 
recovered. 
  She again expressed hope that Japan will meet the agency's 
official government forecast of 2.4 percent growth in gross 
domestic product in the fiscal year starting next month after an 
expected 0.2 percent gain in the current fiscal year. 
  Kubota also pledged the government's efforts to enact 
promised tax reform this year that fairly balances taxes on 
income, consumption and assets to promote a vibrant society for 
Japan's graying population. 
  She repeated her prediction that Japan's current account 
surplus will decline next fiscal year but offered no specific 
trade measures.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner on Friday proposed boosting spending on a 10-year public 
works investment project totaling 430 trillion yen to help 
accelerate the economic recovery. 
  "With the Japanese economy in a very important phase, now is 
the time to review the investment project," Manae Kubota, 
director general of the Economic Planning Agency, told a news 
conference. 
  Kubota said the step would help facilitate a full-fledged 
economic recovery in fiscal 1994, which starts in April, and 
enable sustainable growth in the following year. 
  On financing the expansion, Kubota said she expects higher 
revenues from tax increases if the economy is put on a smooth 
growth track. 
  The plan to spend 430 trillion yen on public projects from 
fiscal 1991 to 2000 was worked out under Japan-U.S. trade talks 
called the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII). 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi supported Kubota's view, 
proposing that the government study the possibility of 
increasing outlays to 600 trillion yen, officials said. 
  Igarashi also urged the government to work out measures 
promptly to open markets other than housing and real estate, 
they said.

<F P=106> ["Statement of Head of DPRK Delegation to DPRK-USA Talks" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- First Vice Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of the DPRK Kang Sok-chu, head of the delegation 
of the DPRK side to DPRK-USA talks, issued a statement today 
regarding the ill-boding moves that the United States is 
showing, giving rise to doubt, in the implementation of the 
DPRK-USA New York agreement on the steps of simultaneous action. 
  Following is the full text of the statement: 
  As already made public, four immediate steps of simultaneous 
action for a package solution of the nuclear issue were agreed 
upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York on February 25. 
  These steps cover the questions of discontinuing "Team 
Spirit 
94" joint military exercises, resuming inter-Korean 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys and 
starting inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
for the continuity of safeguards, and the question of holding 
the third round of DPRK-USA talks in Geneva from March 21. 
  Most of the agreed steps have already entered into a stage 
of 
practical implementation. 
  Thus, new prospects have opened for bringing the process of 
a 
peaceful solution of the nuclear issue which had been derailed 
temporarily back to its original track. 
  It is lucky, indeed, that although it seems belatedly, both 
sides in the agreement confirmed again their stand to seek a 
negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue on the principles of 
the DPRK-USA joint statement and decided upon concrete steps and 
timetable of action. 
  The agreement on the steps of simultaneous action, however, 
has not been reached through a smooth process. 
  In the past, we have advanced reasonable proposals for a 
solution of the nuclear problem and made all sincere efforts to 
carry them into effect and shown a flexibility. 
  Since the second round of DPRK-USA talks we have fulfilled 
the obligations we assumed voluntarily, as far as we could, in 
the matter of negotiation with the IAEA and in the matter of 
North-South dialogue. It is well worth noting that, with a view 
to removing obstacles in the way of the talks, we put forth a 
new proposal that the nuclear issue be solved completely in a 
package deal based on the principle of simultaneous action by 
both sides. 
  If a solution of the nuclear issue had been promoted as 
proposed by us from the very outset, it would not have undergone 
such serious twists and turns in its course, and it would not 
have taken such a long time to reach a basic agreement on the 
steps of simultaneous action. 
  In fact, when we take into consideration the fact that half 
a 
century long history of confrontation and distrust has lasted 
between the DPRK and the United States, it is self-evident that 
either of them is not in a position to urge the other to show 
confidence first. 
  That is why we have held that if the sides wanted to find a 
reasonable solution to the problem on an equal and fair basis, 
they should not urge the other to move first but act 
simultaneously, and so, have repeatedly urged the U.S. side to 
respond to simultaneous action in this direction. 
  In the past, however, the U.S. side, far from sincerely 
accepting our just demand, raised unreasonable preconditions and 
resorted to delaying tactics, trying to force us to accept its 
unilateral demand and constantly seeking insidious political 
aims. 
  As is known, since it accepted our proposal regarding the 
steps of simultaneously action at the 18th DPRK-USA contact at 
the end of December last year and arrived at an agreement in 
principle, the United States openly came out in defence of the 
IAEA Secretariat which demanded we accept inspection equivalent 
to routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to the safeguards 
agreement. Only recently, it tried to solve the problem by 
pressure after setting a deadline identical with the February 
meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. 
  Such arbitrary and faithless stance of the other side toward 
the dialogue whipped all our people into fury, and we could not 
but make a legitimate self-defensive decision. 
  We expressed our firm will to take the road of our own 
choice, not bound to the promise with the United States, if it 
persisted in its policy aimed at stifling our Republic, 
reversing the spirit of agreement with us. 
  The United States requested resuming the New York contact 
before we carried this will into action. This was a good thing 
not only for a solution of the nuclear issue but for peace and 
security in the region around the Korean peninsula, we may say. 
  But the United States created new difficulties in the 
working 
out of the agreement, making it conditional on the exchange of 
special envoys between the North and the South of Korea, an 
internal affair of our nation, even after the scope of 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards was agreed upon 
between the DPRK and the IAEA. 
  We have rejected such persevering argument of our dialogue 
partner and warned them not to miss the opportunity of saving 
the dialogue from a crisis. When they withdrew the precondition 
and said yes to the text of agreement, we appreciated it 
deservedly. 
  The agreed conclusions on the steps of simultaneous action 
between the DPRK and the United States this time has created a 
favorable condition for the third round of talks and a package 
solution of the nuclear issue. 
  The DPRK and the United States, according to the formula of 
package deal agreed upon between them, must now take steps for a 
fundamental solution to the nuclear issue such as the 
termination of the U.S. nuclear threat and hostile policy 
against the DPRK, the introduction of light water reactors, the 
improvement of bilateral relations, the resumption of the IAEA's 
routine and ad hoc inspections of the DPRK's nuclear facilities, 
and put them into effect. 
  The package deal based on simultaneous action is the only 
practical and reasonable way for both sides to resolve the 
nuclear issue through dialogue on a completely equal footing, 
not through confrontation. 
  This has been clearly proved by the whole course of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks, especially by the latest contact in which the 
sides agreed on simultaneous action. 
  If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is resolved in 
a 
package deal, it would be decisively conducive to ensuring peace 
and security in the whole of the Asia-pacific region. 
  We will honestly implement the steps for simultaneous action 
agreed on recently and make every possible effort to solve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a package deal. 
  The solution of the issue now depends on how sincerely the 
United States, a dialogue partner, works to fulfil its promise. 
  It is only too clear that, no matter what reasonable 
solution 
may be adopted, if a party obliged to implement it has no 
willingness to solve the issue, it is impossible to expect any 
substantial results. 
  Though just a few days have passed since the publication of 
the conclusions on simultaneous action reached between the DPRK 
and the United States in New York, ill-boding moves have been 
reported one after another, giving rise to doubt about the 
willingness of the United States to implement the conclusions. 
  The U.S. side made an official announcement that the 
exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and 
the IAEA's inspection are preconditions for the suspension of 
the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and the opening of 
the third-stage talks between the DPRK and the United States 
  On March 3, it expressed full support for the decision of 
the 
South Korean authorities not to stage the "Team Spirit 94" 
conditional on the exchange of special envoys between the two 
halves of Korea. 
  All these are dangerous acts to endanger the implementation 
of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, which can never be justified. 
  As everyone knows, the DPRK and the United States set no 
precondition in agreeing on the steps for simultaneous action. 
  The conclusions reached at the New York contact only 
mentioned the resumption of the working contact for the exchange 
of special envoys between the North and the South as a step for 
simultaneous action. But it did not touch on the fulfilment of 
the exchange. 
  As for the exchange of special envoys, the DPRK was the 
first 
to propose it, motivated by a noble intention to put an end to 
the tragedy of national division and realise the fellow 
countrymen's desire for reunification. To make it a success is 
our consistent position. 
  The exchange of special envoys has not been carried out, 
however, because the South Korean authorities have distorted the 
significance of the exchange by contending that it is aimed only 
at the solution of the nuclear issue, and tried to balk at the 
DPRK-U.S. talks through it and exacerbate the North-South 
confrontation blaring that they "will not rule out even a 
military action." 
  Only when the South Korean authorities stop such 
unreasonable 
acts as impudently poking their nose into the discussion of the 
nuclear issue without their own political view or authority to 
discuss the matter and make a clear turnabout towards seeking 
national reunification, the exchange of special envoys between 
the North and the South will be realised. 
  We are also willing to sincerely implement the agreement on 
the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of safeguards. 
  A group of inspectors of the IAEA began its activities on 
March 1 and the competent organ of the DPRK is rendering a 
proper cooperation in its activities. 
  At a time when the agreement has entered the stage of 
implementation, however, the U.S. side has brought forward again 
the unreasonable preconditions which it had failed to include in 
the conclusions, while fully supporting the conditions raised by 
the South Korean authorities. All this cannot be construed 
otherwise than factors which may lead to collapse the full 
implementation of the conclusions. 
  We take a serious view of the fact that the United States 
has 
set inter-Korean exchange of special envoys and the inspection 
by IAEA as preconditions for the renunciation of the "Team 
Spirit 94" and the opening of the third round of talks, because 
it will obviously result in reversing again the agreed 
conclusions on steps for simultaneous action. 
  Worse still, if those preconditions are accepted, it will 
cause the grave consequence that the right of decision at the 
DPRK-U.S. talks would pass to some seditious forces which hate 
it. 
  As prescribed in the agreed conclusions, unless all the 
steps 
of simultaneous action are implemented fully, all the agreed 
points will automatically go amiss. 
  We have agreed to the inspection by IAEA and the resumption 
of inter-Korean working contact on the premise that the agency 
will not take an unreasonable attitude in the course of the 
inspection for the continuity of the safeguards and the South 
Korean side will not abuse the exchange of special envoys for 
such insidious purposes as putting brakes on the DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  It is clear that, if the agency and the South Korean 
authorities bring forward complicated matters contrary to this 
and the United States gives up halfway the decision to renounce 
the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and delay the 
opening of the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks under an absurd 
pretext, we can not satisfactorily ensure the IAEA's inspection 
that has already begun, nor can pin any more hope on the 
DPRK-U.S. talks itself. 
  It is high time that the DPRK and the U.S. faithfully 
implemented the agreed conclusions on steps for simultaneous 
action published a few days ago, conscious of their 
responsibilities and obligations in the solution to the nuclear 
issue. 
  We will watch the future acts of the dialogue partner.

Conclusions on Simultaneous Action"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- We will honestly 
implement the steps for simultaneous action agreed on recently 
and make every possible effort to solve the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula in a package deal. The solution of the issue 
now depends on how sincerely the United States, a dialogue 
partner, works to fulfil its promise. 
  Kang Sok-chu, first vice minister of Foreign Affairs and 
head 
of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
to the DPRK-U.S. talks, declared this in a statement released 
today as regards ill-boding moves of the United States giving

  [Text] According to military sources, on 1 and 2 March, the 
U.S. imperialists flew pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off 
and landing assault planes, and electronic jamming planes from 
their overseas bases in the skies over South Korea and conducted 
a provocative joint aerial war exercise for northward invasion 
with the puppets with the assistance of electronic jamming. 
  Prior to this war exercise, EA-6 electronic jamming planes 
of 
the 7th U.S. Fleet based in Japan and EH-60 electronic war 
helicopters based in South Korea flew the skies over Yongwol, 
Hoengsong, Paju, and Pochon and did full electronic jamming. 
After this, in cooperation with formations of pursuit-assault 
planes and vertical take-off and landing assault planes, which 
had taken off from the U.S. overseas bases, fighter-bombers and 
assault planes of the U.S. Air Forces occupying South Korea and 
the puppet Air Force flew by surprise to areas, where electronic 
jamming was on, and frantically conducted a bombing exercise 
simulating a surprise strike against the northern half of the 
Republic. 
  This reckless war exercise was conducted with the support of 
the OA-10 observation plane [kwanchukki], and approximately 350 
military planes of various sorts were mobilized in the war 
exercise. 
  This game of fire was conducted for military planes of the 
7th U.S. Fleet and air corps of the U.S. Air Forces occupying 
South Korea and the puppet Air Force to improve their capability 
to jointly launch surprise strikes for northward aggression with 
the support of electronic jamming. 
  As incited by the U.S. imperialists, the South Korean 
puppets 
frantically conducted war exercises for northward invasion in a 
frontline area close the DMZ. 
  On 2 March, large-caliber artillery units which are deployed 
in Yulli-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County of South Korea, and 
Hapsu-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, fired tens of cannon 
balls on areas close to the DMZ. 
  On 1 and 2 March, the armed villains of the puppet Armed 
Forces who are based in combat camps in Nosang-ri and Chomwon-ri 
of Paju County and Koang-ri of Yonchon County launched an attack 
in the direction of the Military Demarcation Line and 
frantically fired large-caliber machine guns and automatic 
rifles at random. 
  On 1 March, formations of armed helicopters and transport 
planes of the puppet Armed Forces flew the skies over frontline 
areas in Yonchon, Pochon, and Hwachon and frantically conducted 
an exercise to provide support to ground attack units and 
airlift troops and equipment to frontline areas. 
  On 2 March, tens of transport planes of the puppet Armed 
Forces conducted an exercise involving raids and special-purpose 
airlifting operations in the skies over Yanggu County, Kangwon 
Province, and promoted a warlike atmosphere. 
  The tension on the Korean peninsula is further aggravated, 
because the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are 
frantically kicking up futile war commotions against the 
northern half of the Republic one after another.

`NSL' in S. Korea" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. State 
Department reportedly reaffirmed Wednesday that the demand for 
the abolition of the "National Security Law" in South Korea was 
the official stand of the United States. 
  Commenting on the great sensation in South Korea caused by 
the remarks of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard 
urging the abrogation of the "NSL" in South Korea, its spokesman 
declared again what this senior U.S. Government official had 
said was not his personal view and what the United States 
demanded was not the revision of the "NSL" but its abolition. 
  Noting that the maintenance of the "NSL" was illogical, the 
State Department said what the United States demanded of South 
Korea was the abrogation of the "NSL" and this was the U.S. 
official stand. 
  This statement of the U.S. State Department came at a time 
when the South Korean puppet Foreign Ministry authorities met 
officials of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul and asked them to inform 
the U.S. Government of the sensation created in South Korea by 
the remarks of the deputy assistant secretary of state.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique recently threw behind bars students of Chonnam National 
University and Choson University on the pretext that the 
Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General Student 
Councils (Chongnyon) orchestrated a "violent demonstration" and 
"attempted to neutralize government power". 
  It also arrested students of Kyongbuk National University by 
invoking the "National Security Law", charging them with 
"posting an article sympathizing with the North's demand". 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: The fact that the 
Kim Yong-sam group makes patriotic students a target of ruthless 
suppression shows that they are now seeking in a more 
undisguised way dependence on outside forces, not national 
independence, and North-South confrontation, not national unity, 
and fascist rule, not democracy. 
  Nowadays the Kim Yong-sam group is invoking the "National 
Security Law" quite often, charging students with connection 
with the North. This reveals once again its wicked intention to 
follow the road of confrontation with the North to its dying 
breath. 
  The puppets' grumble about "violent demonstrations" of 
students is a ridiculous jargon reminding one of a thief crying 
"stop thief!" Students have staged peaceful demonstrations 
urging the refusal of "parliamentary ratification" and 
renegotiation regarding the rice market opening, enraged at the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's flunkeyist treachery in selling off 
the rice market. It is a duplication of the method employed by 
the military fascists of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" to 
brand them as "rioters". 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's fascist suppression will 
result in digging its own grave.

<F P=106> ["Fool's Treacherous Color Revealed Again"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam in a "special interview marking the 21st anniversary of 
the founding of the Korean Broadcasting System" Thursday said he 
"cannot be optimistic" about the contact of working delegates 
for the exchange of special envoys and that "optimism is a 
taboo," according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  This is a very rude outburst throwing a wet blanket over the 
North-South working contact for the exchange of special envoys 
now promoted as part of the implementation of the steps of 
simultaneous action agreed upon between the DPRK and the United 
States. It is also a sinister attempt to create artificial 
obstacles and block the exchange of special envoys. 
  Kim Yong-sam's talk about "nuclear card of the North" was 
aimed at isolating and stifling the North by branding it as a 
"nuclear culprit." 
  While taking an insincere attitude toward the exchange of 
special envoys, Kim Yong-sam claimed that unless a "meaningful 
exchange of special envoys" is realised, the United States would 
never hold the third round of talks with the North." This is an 
imprudent outcry of a fool. It is ridiculous, indeed, for the 
colonial puppet who has no interest in the settlement of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and has no say to 
obtrusively behave as if he were a spokesman of the U.S State 
Department. 
  This meant, in other words, that the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
ordered the United States to do this or that. But the folly of 
the colonial puppet wielding the baton at his master will make a 
cat laugh. 
  The traitor also talked about the "importance of the 
cooperation system." This revealed once again his true color as 
a dyed-in-the-wool flunkeyist and heinous traitor to the nation 
who stoops to any infamy to do harm to fellow countrymen. 
  Facts show that as long as Kim Yong-sam the fool remains at 
the "presidential" post in "Chongwadae," the Korean nation 
cannot live in peace even a moment nor can the desire of the 
South Korean people for independence, democracy and national 
reunification be realised. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group engaged in treacheries will have to 
pay for the arch crime it has committed against history and the 
people.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The ever-expanding 
anti-war, anti-nuke struggle of South Korean people is a just 
struggle for saving the fellow countrymen from a nuclear 
holocaust and achieving peace in the Korean peninsula, says 
MINJU CHOSON today. Commenting on the anti-war, anti-nuke 
demonstration staged by citizens and students in Seoul Tuesday 
after a rally marking the 75th anniversary of the March 1 
popular uprising, the analyst says: 
  These days the United States is working to arm its troops 
present in South Korea with Patriot missiles and the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique, dancing to its drum-beating, is making a 
frantic bid to introduce this sophisticated weapon even into the 
puppet army. 
  The planned shipment of Patriots into South Korea by the 
U.S. 
and South Korean warmaniacs is a crime intended to drive the 
situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
  The prevailing grave situation urges the South Korean people 
and students to turn out in the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle so 
as to remove the danger of war and defend the security of the 
nation. It is quite natural that they are vigorously waging 
this struggle. 
  The South Korean people and students will decisively crush 
the maneuverings of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique to provoke a nuclear war by invigorating the 
anti-war, anti-nuke struggle.

<F P=106> ["Joint statement" issued by political parties and public </F>
organizations in Pyongyang on 3 March] 
  [Text] In connection with the fact that the random dumping 
of nuclear waste materials into the sea has recently been 
disclosed in South Korea, DPRK political parties and public 
organizations released the following joint statement: 
  Joint statement of DPRK political parties and public 
organizations: 
  The random dumping of nuclear waste materials into the sea 
has recently been disclosed in South Korea. This greatly angers 
the nation. 
  Data show nuclear power stations in South Korea dumped into 
the sea 142 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste materials 
in 1991 and 155 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste 
materials in 1992. 
  The South Korean puppets dumped 11,000 trillion becquerels, 
or approximately 100,000 curie, into the sea in the seven years 
from 1986 to 1992. This is an unimaginable, grave crime that 
artificially destroys the ecosystem and inflicts miserable 
nuclear damage on the South Korean people, in addition to fellow 
countrymen and mankind in general. 
  Generally speaking, radiation amounting to approximately 1.7 
curie has damaged the ecosystem. It is not difficult to imagine 
the horrific, devastating consequences the massive nuclear waste 
materials, amounting to 100,000 curie that the South Korean 
puppets dumped into the sea, will bring to the ecosystem and the 
frightening catastrophes it will inflict on the South Korean 
people, in addition to fellow countrymen and mankind in general. 
  As is well known, if nuclear waste materials are dumped into 
the sea, they will contaminate or kill fish, shells, laver, 
brown seaweed, and other maritime resources and, thus, inflict 
fatal damage on the existence of the maritime ecosystem and 
people. Therefore, the London Convention bans the maritime 
dumping of high-intensity [kojunwi] nuclear waste materials. It 
also stipulates that dumping of low-intensity [chojunwi] nuclear 
waste materials in maritime areas must be over 200 miles away 
from continental shores [taeryuk yonan], where fish live, and 
over 4,000 km deep, where there are no volcanic activities and 
where man will not enter even in the distant future. It also 
stipulates that dumping in those areas is prohibited without 
notifying the International Atomic Energy Agency. A decision 
was adopted in 1993 on completely banning maritime dumping of 
nuclear waste materials. 
  The South Korean puppets' random dumping of nuclear waste 
materials into the sea is an unforgivable grave crime of 
flagrantly violating international law on respecting the natural 
environment and protecting maritime resources. Because of the 
uncouth ruling bunch, which ignores the law and destroys the 
environment at random, the South Korean sea is turning into a 
sea of death where all maritime resources are on the verge of 
extinction and the ecosystem and the people's existence are 
gravely threatened. 
  Because of the puppet clique's reckless dumping of nuclear 
waste materials in the South Korean sea, many sorts of fish have 
disappeared, fish are killed en masse, and seaweeds are dying. 
Moreover, in South Korea, women who ate fish contaminated by 
nuclear waste materials have given birth to premature or 
deformed babies, numerous people suffer from cancer and other 
incurable diseases and unidentified diseases, and fishermen's 
lives have become difficult because people will not buy 
contaminated fish. 
  This is none other than a crime of devastating the land 
where our fellow countrymen live and threatening the existence 
of our fellow countrymen. 
  Our country is called a 3,000-ri land of beautiful mountains 
and rivers because water is clear and because the scenery is 
beautiful, and it is all the better to live in because the land 
is fertile and because maritime resources are abundant for the 
land is surrounded by the sea on three sides. How can Korean 
[Choson] people who have a national spirit tolerate this utterly 
unforgivable crime of turning such land into a land contaminated 
by nuclear waste materials where man cannot live and how can 
people of the world who have conscience turn a blind eye to 
[panggwan] this crime? 
  The Workers' Party of Korea and all other political parties 
and public organizations on the northern half of the Republic 
sternly denounce the Kim Yong-sam ring's dumping of nuclear 
waste materials in the name of all fellow countrymen, describing 
such dumping as an antinational crime of severing the lifeline 
of the South Korean people and all fellow countrymen in general 
and of turning our country into a barren land [pulmojidae] 
contaminated by nuclear materials and as a flagrant violation of 
the international law and convention on protecting the natural 
environment and banning the dumping of radioactive waste 
materials. 
  The South Korean puppets' dumping of nuclear waste materials 
is unthinkable apart from the secret maneuvers to develop 
nuclear weapons in South Korea. The South Korean puppets' 
maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons which started in the early 
seventies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella have reached a very 
grave stage today. 
  The puppets raise our nonexistent nuclear issue and 
viciously 
conduct an anti-Republic smear campaign. One of the reasons for 
this is to divert attention at home and abroad to the North and 
accelerate their maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons. Traitor 
[yokto] Kim Yong-sam himself told a news conference on the first 
anniversary of his inauguration a few days ago that the North 
has no nuclear weapons. In this way, he himself admitted that 
their anti-North nuclear commotions were a false smear campaign 
to harm their fellow countrymen and hide the truth of their 
nuclear development. 
  Even while pursuing nuclear development, the Kim Yong-sam 
ring babbles about even military countermeasures [kunsajok 
taeung] against someone else. Because it is so mean and 
shameless, the Kim Yong-sam ring unhesitatingly dumps nuclear 
waste materials, an antinational act against humanity [pan illyu 
chogin]. 
  Even after running amok in toadyism, treachery, fascism, 
anti-North confrontation, and divisionist maneuvers, traitor Kim 
Yong-sam even kicks up maneuvers to dump nuclear waste 
materials. If traitor Kim Yong-sam is left intact, no one can 
expect independence and democracy in South Korean society or 
peace in the country and its peaceful reunification, and our 
fellow countrymen will not be able to escape from the danger of 
nuclear disasters [haekchenan]. 
  The South Korean ruling bunch must immediately disclose its 
past dumping of nuclear waste materials and apologize to all 
fellow countrymen. If the South Korean authorities continue 
dumping nuclear waste materials and secretly pursue nuclear 
development, they will not be able to escape from the stern 
judgment of all fellow countrymen and history. 
  It is the South Korean people who will suffer the greatest 
damage from the nuclear waste materials that have flowed into 
the South Korean sea and who will be sacrificed first. The 
South Korean people must wage a popular struggle against the 
puppet ruling bunch's dumping of nuclear waste materials and 
develop this struggle into an anti-U.S. and antigovernment 
struggle by closely linking it to the antiwar and antinuclear 
struggle. 
  The South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to dump nuclear 
waste materials are a crime against humanity [panillyujogin 
pomjoe haengwi], which harms not only our fellow countrymen but 
also countries in our vicinity and various regions in Asia and 
the world. On this opportunity, we expect that political parties 
and organizations of various countries of the world, 
international organizations, and people of all countries that 
love peace and aspire for social justice and progress will pay 
due attention to the South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to 
dump nuclear waste materials, raise their voices against such 
maneuvers, and take appropriate measures to stop them.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Rulers Urged To Open To Public Nuclear Waste </F>
Dumping and Apologize for It" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The Workers' Party of 
Korea and other political parties and public organisations of 
the northern half of Korea in a joint statement today demand 
that the South Korean rulers immediately open to the public 
their nuclear waste dumping and apologize to the whole nation 
for it. 
  Noting that the nuclear waste dumped into the sea by the 
South Korean authorities in seven years, from 1986 to 1992, 
amounted to 11,000 trillion becquerels (about 100,000 curies), 
the statement brands this as an anti-national crime to throttle 
the South Korean people and the whole nation and reduce the 
country to a barren land contaminated with nuclear substances 
and a crude violation of the international law and convention. 
  "The nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean puppets today 
is unthinkable apart from the nuclear development which is being 
promoted in secrecy in South Korea. Their nuclear development 
which began in the early 1970s under the `nuclear umbrella' of 
the United States has entered a very grave stage at present," 
the statement says, adding: 
  "The puppets, taking issue with the fictitious `nuclear 
problem' of the North, have launched a malicious anti-DPRK smear 
campaign. One of its purposes is to divert to the North the 
attention of the home and foreign public and then step up their 
nuclear development". 
  The statement continues: 
  "The traitor Kim Yong-sam is steeped in flunkeyist 
treachery, fascism, confrontation with the North and splittist 
moves and, as if it were not enough, is committing even 
radioactive waste dumping threatening the existence of the 
nation. With him left alone, the independence and democracy of 
the South Korean society and peace and peaceful reunification of 
the country cannot be expected nor can our nation escape the 
danger of nuclear holocaust. 
  "The South Korean ruling quarters must immediately open to 
the public their past nuclear waste dumping and apologize to the 
entire nation for it. 
  "If they continue dumping nuclear waste and promote nuclear 
development in secrecy, they will face a stern judgement by the 
entire nation and history." 
  The statement expresses the hope that the political parties 
and organizations and peoples of all countries and international 
organizations that love peace and aspire after social justice 
and progress, will lift up louder voices of condemnation, paying 
a due attention to the South Korean rulers' dumping of 
radioactive waste, and take necessary measures to check it.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Reactionaries Must Stop Running Riot" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The more desperately 
the Japanese reactionaries obstruct a solution to the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula the faster it will precipitate 
their doom, warns NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The analyst says: 
  Recently, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone 
claimed that if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
refused to accept a "special inspection," the United Nations 
Security Council must not rule out possibilities of "economic 
sanctions." Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata urged the 
DPRK to take "steps to remove the suspicion of nuclear arms 
development," saying that "pressure for an inspection of the 
DPRK's military sites" would increase. 
  Such remarks can be made only by wicked fellows. Japan has 
no justification to poke its nose into the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The way for the solution to the nuclear issue through the 
DPRK-U.S. talks is now open. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can be resolved 
only by the DPRK and the United States. 
  The recently published conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact in New York includes no word of "special inspection." 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are impudently 
crying for a "special inspection" and "sanctions" by the United 
Nations Security Council. This is nothing but a move to impede 
the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost by admonishing 
the United States and putting pressure on it. 
  This is aimed at stifling the DPRK by setting in motion even 
the UN Security Council. 
  While slandering the DPRK, the Japanese reactionaries are 
also seeking to find a pretext for Japan's nuclear armament. 
Japan intends to use the DPRK's "nuclear issue" as a playing 
card for stepping up its nuclear armament and soothing the 
worldwide concern over it. 
  Such a foolish act of Japan, however, cannot work. 
  We cannot but keep heightened vigilance in coping with the 
strained situation created by the full-scale acceleration of the 
nuclear armament of Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- March 1 is the first 
anniversary of the publication of "Abuses of Socialism are 
Intolerable", a historical work of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work exposed the reactionary 
nature of all abuses of socialism and their falsity and gave 
scientific answers to the questions of principle arising in 
defending the cause of socialism and carrying it to 
accomplishment. 
  The work has evoked widespread repercussions upon the 
political, public and press circles of the world in the last one 
year since its publication for the invincibility and profundity 
of its contents. 
  Former journalist of the Russian paper IZVESTIYA Ivan 
Robodap 
who had read the work said in an article titled "Hard Blow": 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il, with a clear-cut analysis, dealt a 
crushing blow to the attempts to hamstring and reverse the true 
significance of the contents of socialism, labelling it as 
`totalitarian', `barracks-like' and `administrative and 
commanding'. He completely unmasked the slanderers and renegades 
of the people's cause." 
  The revolutionary parties of the world are unanimous in 
saying that the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il gives perfect 
answers to the questions raised by the present times and serves 
as a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon for all the 
progressive political parties aspiring after the building of a 
new society. They adopted the work as their must book or passed 
decisions supporting it. 
  A meeting of the Political Bureau of the new Communist Party 
of Great Britain adopted the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il as a 
must book of the party and distributed it within the party, 
while the people's front of workers, peasants and students of 
Peru discussed the work at its political committee and adopted a 
resolution supporting it. 
  Seminars on the work were held by the group for the study of 
the chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in Austria, the Burkina 
national group of the chuche idea, chuche idea study groups and 
organisations for friendship and solidarity in Nepal, Tanzania 
and other countries. 
  The Rwandan committee for the study of the chuche idea made 
public a statement supporting the work and mass media of 
different countries including "BOLSHEVIK", the magazine of the 
All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, carried articles 
introducing the work. And figures of political, public and other 
circles issued statements explaining the importance and 
significance of the work. 
  Director General of the International Institute of the 
Chuche 
Idea Shuhachi Inoue who is the first winner of the 
"International Kim Il-song Prize", said after reading the work: 
  "Socialism collapsed in some countries. But this cannot 
change the trend of the time. Today, mankind sees Korean-style 
socialism, the tower of success of socialism which stands in 
bolder relief, and gains confidence in socialism and its 
prospect from it. Frankly speaking, socialism is immediately 
Korea and vice versa today." 
  Eric Trevett, general secretary of the Central Committee of 
the New Communist Party of Great Britain, said that the work of 
Comrade Kim Chong-il is a highly important work which deals a 
telling blow to the imperialists, world reactionaries and 
revisionists and inspires the revolutionary peoples of the world 
with hope and courage. 
  The work of Comrade Kim Chong-il is a powerful ideological 
and theoretical weapon which gives a decisive blow to the 
counterrevolutionary moves and dastardly sophism of the 
imperialists and the foes of socialism and powerfully propels 
the socialist movement in the present times.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The publishing house of 
the Communist Party-KPML (R) [Communist Party of 
Marxist-Leninist Revolutionaries] of Sweden issued a booklet 
"Korea, a Divided Country". 
  In the preface the booklet notes that a fine socialist 
system 
has been established in North Korea, but fascist dictatorship is 
rampant in South Korea. 
  The preface says the South Korean authorities, with a view 
to 
keeping the country divided forever, built the largest ever 
concrete wall under the aegis of the United States and have 
ceaselessly staged provocative military exercises against North 
Korea. 
  Saying North Korea put forward a proposal for reunification 
through a confederacy based on one nation, one state, two 
systems and two governments, the preface stresses this proposal 
is the best way of achieving the reunification of the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang mass rally 
was held at Kim Il-song Square today with the attendance of more 
than 100,000 people to thoroughly carry out the highly important 
tasks set by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his 
historic letter to the National Agricultural Conference. 
  Present there were Premier of the Administration Council 
Kang 
Song-san and Vice-President Yi Chong-ok who are Politburo 
members of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] and other senior party and state officials. 
  Kang Hyon-su, member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
WPK, chief secretary of the Pyongyang municipal committee of the 
WPK and chairman of the Pyongyang municipal people's committee, 
delivered a report titled "Let us accelerate the ultimate 
solution to the socialist rural question under the leadership of 
the party." 
  He said the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his 
historic 
letter "For the ultimate solution of the rural question under 
the banner of the socialist rural theses" addressed to the 
National Agricultural Conference, reviewed with pride the 
decisive victory won in the implementation of the socialist 
rural theses and clearly indicated tasks to finally solve the 
socialist rural question and ways for their fulfilment. 
  He stressed that the letter of the great leader is a 
militant 
banner of weighty historic significance in triumphantly solving 
the socialist rural question and thus consolidating man-centred 
socialism of our style and further exalting its might and 
successfully discharging the noble duty we have assumed for the 
times and history. 
  The reporter called for maintaining a constant upsurge in 
rural construction and agricultural production through 
energetic efforts for the thorough implementation of the highly 
important tasks laid down in the letter. 
  He laid emphasis on the need to develop in depth the 
ideological, cultural and technical revolutions in the 
countryside in compliance with the requirements of socialist 
rural construction on a new, higher stage. 
  "If the socialist agricultural cooperative economy is to be 
consolidated and developed still further and the conversion of 
cooperative property into all-people property is to be realised 
smoothly without any deviations, it is essential to increase 
the support of the towns to the countryside and material and 
technical assistance of industry to agriculture, further enhance 
the role of the county in socialist rural construction and give 
full play to the advantages and vitality of the chuche-based 
agricultural guidance system of our style," he said, and 
continued: 
  "Now the imperialists and reactionaries are making desperate 
efforts to isolate and stifle our Republic politically, 
economically and militarily. But all the agricultural working 
people should believe and follow only the great leader President 
Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and become 
a fortress and a shield defending the party and the leader 
politically and ideologically and with their lives." 
  Speeches were made and a resolution was adopted at the 
rally. 
  At the end of the rally hundreds of lorries loaded with 
farming materials left for rural villages around the city.

<F P=106> ["Technical Revolution, Important Way of Final Solution to </F>
Rural Question"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song in his historic letter "For the Ultimate 
Solution of the Rural Question Under the Banner of the Socialist 
Rural Theses" put forward a task to carry on the technical 
revolution energetically. NODONG SINMUN today in a by-lined 
article in this regard quotes the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song as saying: 
  "Our task at the present stage is to follow up the success 
in 
the rural technical revolution to advance the industrialization 
and modernization of agriculture to a high level". 
  The article says: 
  The promotion of the technical revolution is one of the most 
important tasks in the efforts for the ultimate solution of the 
rural question under the banner of the rural theses. The task 
of the technical revolution laid down in the letter represents a 
just policy based on a scientific analysis of the present state 
of the development of agriculture in our country. 
  This state shows that only when we consolidate and expand 
the 
achievements made in the technical revolution while accelerating 
the ideological and cultural revolutions in the countryside, can 
we steadily raise the standards of industrialisation and 
modernisation of agriculture and win a shining victory in the 
efforts to finally solve the rural question. 
  The technical revolution makes it possible, above all, to 
solidify the material and technical foundations of agriculture 
by stepping up the technical reconstruction of agricultural 
production and thus make a dramatic progress in the solution to 
the socialist rural question. 
  In the past period the technical revolution has made a fast 
progress along the road indicated by the rural theses in our 
country, bringing irrigation and electrification to completion 
in the countryside and successfully bringing into reality the 
mechanisation and extensive application of chemicals as well. 
  The technical revolution also makes it possible to push 
ahead 
with the process of organical combination of cooperative 
property and all-people property while continually enhancing the 
leading role of the latter over the former. 
  To enhance this leading role is an important demand for the 
ultimate solution to the rural question and it is definitely 
guaranteed only by solid material and technical conditions. The 
technical revolution is an important way of creating material 
and technical conditions for constantly enhancing the leading 
role of all-people property over cooperative property and 
combining them organically. 
  When we energetically accelerate the rural technical 
revolution, faithfully fulfilling its tasks set by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his historic letter to the 
national agricultural conference can we make a signal progress 
in the development of the socialist rural economy and constantly 
increase agricultural production.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 1 March editorial: "Let Us Brilliantly </F>
Embody the Party's Socialist Rural Construction Program"] 
  [Text] The National Agricultural Meeting, which was held 
amid keen interest and expectations of our agricultural working 
people and the whole nation, has concluded after the successful 
conclusion of its work. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent an historic letter 
for the ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner 
of the socialist rural theses to the National Agricultural 
Meeting and personally attended the meeting to encourage the 
agricultural workers. 
  The respected and beloved leader's letter is a program of 
socialist rural construction of our times and a militant banner 
that makes it possible to develop our country's rural economic 
work to a higher level. Agricultural workers and other people, 
bearing deep in their hearts the great glory of receiving the 
programmatic work that indicates the future road of socialist 
rural construction, are turning out in the struggle to implement 
it. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter 
consummates the theoretical and practical matters for finally 
solving the rural question, the most difficult question in 
socialist construction, by dynamically accelerating rural 
construction along the road indicated by the rural theses. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has 
taught: If we consolidate the position we have already taken up 
and launch a new battle by making more strenuous efforts, we 
will win a historic victory in the solution of the rural 
question, the most difficult question in the building of 
socialism. 
  Whether we finally solve the rural question under socialism 
or not is an important matter that affects the future of 
socialism. Through their long struggle to implement the great 
rural theses, our party and people have already solved basic 
problems in socialist rural construction. 
  We are on a high peak that affords the prospect of ultimate 
solution of the rural question. This is a great victory won by 
our party and people in their historic struggle for socialism 
and communism. The tasks of consolidating the position we have 
already taken up and ultimately solving the rural question in 
the near future lie ahead. 
  The work clearly indicates the road for intensifying and 
developing the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, 
and cultural -- will give more assistance to the rural areas, 
and will promote the overall rural economic work to meet the 
high demands of socialist rural construction. 
  Every system and content of the work embodies our party's 
firm will to complete, under all circumstances, the historic 
task for the ultimate solution of the rural question set forth 
in the socialist rural theses. Accordingly, the work is a 
guideline with which our party and people must persistently keep 
up in their struggle to protect, adhere to, and develop the 
our-style socialist cause. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic work, for 
the 
ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner of the 
socialist rural theses, has a great theoretical and practical 
meaning in our people's revolutionary struggle and the 
implementation of the overall socialist cause. 
  The work, above all, is a militant banner that instills into 
the minds of our people and agricultural workers the conviction 
of the might of the chuche-based system of the socialist rural 
economy and the invincibility of our-style socialism and that 
powerfully encouraged them in the work for consolidation and 
development. 
  Our country's rural economic system set forth by the great 
leader is a superior rural economic system under which 
agricultural workers become masters of production and management 
and which continues to develop based on the principle of 
collectivism. We have not witnessed a more superior and 
advanced rural economic system anywhere in the world. 
  In the course of struggle to implement the rural theses, the 
feature of our rural areas has changed a great deal and our 
rural economic system has been strengthened and developed in 
every domain of politics, economy, and culture to the maximum. 
  The work proudly summed up the decisive victory won during 
the course of accelerating the three revolutions -- ideological, 
technological, and cultural -- changes in farmers' material and 
cultural life, and achievements in managing and operating 
cooperative farms. It also displayed the might and superiority 
of our rural economic system. 
  In this way, the work powerfully demonstrated that our 
socialist rural economic system is the one that provides free 
and creative life to the working people and is a superior system 
that makes it possible to push ahead with the tasks to 
assimilate farmers into the working class and industrializing 
agriculture. 
  From the work, we have come to learn a precious truth that 
the chuche-oriented socialist road lead by our party is the only 
road to the agricultural workers' true sense of life, happiness, 
victory, and glory. 
  The great leader's work is a highly important guideline in 
effecting a new revolutionary turn in our rural economy and in 
all sectors of agricultural production. 
  A difficult and enormous task of an unprecedented scale is 
set for the field of socialist rural construction today. We are 
carrying out the task of rural construction on a high stage in 
an acute confrontation with the enemies. The work sets forth 
the principles, specific tasks, and method for the successful 
acceleration of this task. The work comprehensively sets forth 
the struggle guidelines reflecting the new demands of the 
construction of our rural areas, such as the guideline on 
vigorously conducting ideological work for the agricultural 
working people and imbue them with a mind toward revolution, the 
working-class, socialism, and the chuche idea; the guideline on 
enhancing the technological and cultural standard of the 
agricultural working people in conformity with the demand of 
intellectualizing the entire society; and the guideline on 
realizing the industrialization and modernization of agriculture 
on a high level. 
  In particular, the guideline on intensifying the party's 
guidance in socialist rural construction is of important 
significance in building the socialist rural base firmly 
politically, ideologically, and in terms of class. If the tasks 
set forth in the work are thoroughly implemented, the socialist 
rural construction will bring forth a new revolutionary upturn, 
vigorously accelerating the complete victory of socialism. 
  The great leader's work is also an immortal classic work 
that 
further developed and enriched the revolutionary theory of the 
working class on socialist-communist construction with new and 
original contents. Solving the socialist rural problem is a 
creative work which no one has ever carried out. The great 
leader clearly saw through the future of our rural areas with 
his wisdom of second sight and scientific insight and put forth 
original ideology and theory for the ultimate solution of the 
rural problem, thus breaking new ground for the development of 
the revolutionary theory of the working class. 
  In particular, the great leader comprehensively elucidated 
in 
this work the principles, the method, and the timing of 
transferring cooperative ownership to all-people ownership. 
This is of important significance in the development of the 
revolutionary theory on rural construction. Thanks to the 
theories put forth in the work -- such as the theory on creating 
the condition for transferring cooperative ownership to 
all-people ownership, the theory on carrying on this work by 
county as a unit, and the theory on correctly establishing the 
form and method of transferring cooperative ownership to 
all-people ownership -- the way to solve the rural problem 
ultimately without the slightest deviation has been made 
available. 
  The great leader's work has now become a powerful weapon to 
crush the imperialists' sophism that socialism cannot solve the 
rural problem and the opportunist trend which excludes the 
revolutionary principles of the working class in rural 
construction. The justness and truthfulness of the ideology, 
theories, and guidelines put forth in the work will be 
thoroughly demonstrated in our practice of socialist 
construction which vigorously advances crushing the 
antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries. 
  We should wage a vigorous struggle to effect new upsurge in 
socialist rural construction upholding the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song's programmatic work, "For the Ultimate Solution of 
the Rural Problem Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural 
Thesis." All party members and working people should, above 
all, intensively study and assimilate the profound ideology and 
theory contained in the great leader's work. Important here is 
to deeply learn the wisdom of the leadership of the respected 
and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the greatness of his 
achievements. 
  The great leader attached great importance to the problem of 
peasants and agriculture long ago and has made energetic efforts 
for its solution, and has led all sorts of work, large and 
small, arising in the development of rural economy. The work 
sums up the great leader's guidelines of rural construction, 
which he put forth and verified their might, and comprehensively 
incorporates the grand idea of rural construction which the 
leader [suryong] formulated. We should deeply cherish the great 
pride in accelerating socialist rural construction under the 
leadership of the great party and the leader [suryong]. All the 
functionaries and working people of the agricultural sector 
should deeply study the work in close connection with the 
specific reality of their county, their farm, and their work 
team, so that they can further deepen the work of adding luster 
to the great leader's leadership achievements. 
  To thoroughly implement the task presented in the work it 
is important for all the people and agricultural working people 
to firmly believe in the superiority of the chuche-oriented 
socialist rural economic system and the correctness of our 
party's socialist rural construction program. Historic lessons 
of socialist construction teaches that defending socialism 
results in victory and renouncing it brings about death in rural 
areas. 
  We should have the firm faith that the popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own style is the best and make 
all possible efforts to safeguard, defend, and glorify these 
noble gains. At the same time, we should implement our party's 
great rural construction program with the firm faith that we can 
realize without fail any difficult tasks in rural construction 
due to the single-hearted unity of our people around the party 
and the leader [suryong] and the mighty self-reliant national 
economy, which has the chuche-oriented industries as its pillar. 
  Further deepening and developing the three revolutions -- 
ideological, technological, and cultural -- in conformity with 
the demands of the new high stage of socialist rural 
construction is one of the important tasks presented in the 
work. We should define the ideological revolution as a most 
important and indispensable requirement for safeguarding, 
defending, and consummating the socialist cause and should 
vigorously wage ideological work among the agricultural working 
people. We should conduct in-depth indoctrination in the chuche 
idea by closely combining it with the indoctrination in the 
party's policy, the indoctrination in the revolutionary 
traditions, the indoctrination in socialist patriotism, and many 
other forms of ideological work, while putting primary emphasis 
on the indoctrination in the principle of the chuche idea. In 
particular, we should concentrate greater efforts on 
strengthening the indoctrination in class and the indoctrination 
in collectivism. 
  By strengthening the cultural revolution in rural areas we 
should constantly enhance the technological and cultural level 
of the agricultural working people, should thoroughly establish 
their tidiness in production and life, and should do away with 
the disparity in the conditions of their cultural life between 
urban and rural areas. 
  The task that we should carry out in the field of the rural 
technological revolution is vast. We should further consolidate 
the success in irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and 
chemicalization that has already been achieved and should 
further expand and develop it so that we can constantly enhance 
the level of industrialization and modernization of agriculture. 
In particular, we should develop the comprehensive mechanization 
and chemicalization of the rural economy into a high level. 
Along with this, we should develop agricultural science, 
actively utilize its success, and thoroughly implement our 
party's chuche-oriented farm method. Thus, we should make 
agricultural production more scientific. 
  To carry out the difficult and vast tasks arising in 
socialist rural construction today it is important to strengthen 
urban support for rural areas. We should further enhance the 
working class' revolutionary spirit, organizational spirit, and 
cultural level and, thus, should see to it that the working 
class further strengthen their leadership role in rural 
construction. At the same time, we should guarantee by all means 
industrial material and technological support for the rural 
economy. 
  All industrial sectors should give priority to producing and 
supplying fuel, energy, equipment, and materials required in 
agricultural production and rural construction in conformity 
with the demands of our party's agriculture-first policy. We 
should brilliantly carry out the historic task of eliminating 
the disparity between industry and agriculture in economic 
management activities and of gradually converting ownership by 
cooperative into ownership by all of the people on the basis of 
the success gained in the three revolutions -- ideological, 
technological, and cultural. 
  Practical experiences in our country clearly show that the 
party's leadership becomes the lifeline of socialist rural 
construction and overall socialist construction. 
  All party organizations should pay deep attention to rural 
problems and vigorously organize and mobilize party members and 
the working people into the struggle to implement our party's 
great rural construction program. All rural party organizations 
should substantially carry out the work of deeply explaining and 
inculcating among party members and the agricultural working 
people the profound ideologies and theories elucidated by the 
great leader in his work. 
  An infinitely bright vista is being opened for our socialist 
rural construction. We have the most correct socialist rural 
construction program and the wise leadership of the party and 
the leader [suryong]. 
  Let all of us vigorously advance for the final solution of 
the socialist rural problem and for the victory of socialism of 
our own style by upholding the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's historic letter and with the overflowing faith in 
victory.

  [Text] Washington, March 3 (YONHAP) -- A senior State 
Department official, declaring that "legal flexibility" is 
needed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, urged the U.S. 
Congress not to adopt any more legislation that would impose 
additional legal barriers to lifting existing economic sanctions 
against Pyongyang. 
  The United States is prepared to move toward improved 
political and economic relations with North Korea, said Lynn 
Davis, undersecretary of state for international security 
affairs. "To implement this approach," she said, "we will need 
legal flexibility to use both inducements and potential sticks' 
to influence the North," Davis said. 
  "Therefore, we do not favor any legislation that would 
impose 
additional legal barriers to lifting existing economic sanctions 
(against North Korea," she said. Speaking at a Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee hearing Thursday, Davis said, however, that 
North Korea must make a clear commitment to resolving the 
nuclear issue in the near future. "It must demonstrate in 
actions, not just words, that it is renouncing a nuclear weapons 
capability," she said. "That means the North must remain a 
member of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) and 
implement its IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) 
full-scope safeguards agreement, including special inspections 
and any other measures needed to clear up past discrepancies," 
she said. In addition, she said Pyongyang must work with Seoul 
to fully implement the North-South denuclarization declaration. 
  "If the North executes the agreement we reached in December, 
and its recent understanding with the IAEA on inspections needed 
to maintain the continuity of safeguards, the way will be open 
for a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks," Davis said. But 
if North Korea fails to implement the agreement, then the issue 
will be returned to the U.N. Security Council for further 
action, including sanctions, she said. In the meantime, Davis 
said the United States and South Korea have continued to take 
prudent measures to ensure that "our defenses" remain strong. 
  "At the request of the U.N. commander of U.S. forces in 
Korea, General Luck, we have been considering a decision to 
deploy a Patriot missile battalion in South Korea," she said. 
This would be a defensive deployment in response to North 
Korea's missile capability, and is a prudent military step in 
light of the prevailing tension on the Korean peninsula, she 
said. "We are continuing to consult with South Korea on this 
matter, with the predisposition that we will go ahead when the 
time is right," she added.

  [Text] Seoul, March 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu expressed regret Friday over U.S. 
officials' recent negative comments about Seoul's national 
security law, regardless of their innocent intentions. 
  Han, meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney, 
complained that such references create the impression that South 
Korea has human rights problems despite its democratic progress, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Laney, handing over a written statement of explanation, 
apologized for U.S. officials' having unintentionally hurt the 
feelings of South Koreans with their remarks. 
  Laney's statement said Washington is fully aware of Seoul's 
great strides in democracy and human rights, and "unequivocally 
recognizes the fundamental shift in attitude and policy of the 
Kim Yong-sam administration towards human rights," as 
acknowledged by the 1993 human rights report. 
  The controversy started when U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of State Tom Hubbard told a seminar last week that Washington 
wants to see Seoul repeal its national security law. 
  The comment sparked immediate protests that it was undue 
interference in South Korea's internal affairs, while raising 
suspicions that the issue had been discussed with North Korea 
since Hubbard was chief U.S. working-level nuclear negotiator 
with Pyongyang. 
  Indeed, Hubbard was in the middle of last-minute bargaining 
with North Korean officials when he made the remark last week. 
  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Thursday that the 
United States hopes the "Korean Government and the Korean people 
might find it appropriate to no longer have that law in effect" 
because it is "subject to abuse and a reflection of an earlier 
time." 
  Laney said the U.S. officials' comments should be seen "as 
remarks of close friends and democratic peers." 
  "I have unqualified confidence in (South Korea's) human 
rights practices and its respect for the rule of law," said 
Laney in his statement. 
  Han, while calling the remarks ill-timed, said he personally 
believed they came out "accidentally." 
  "The security law is now revised but at the U.S. 
working-level, images of the past apparently remain and that 
tends to show up in high officials' speeches and press 
briefings," he said after meeting Laney. 
  "We think the comments were accidental, but we still needed 
to drive home a strong message to prevent a repetition of 
similar remarks that could be made due to lack of understanding 
of the current security law," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "US Meddling"] </F>
  [Text] A senior U.S. State Department official's remarks 
last week expressing a desire to see South Korea abolish its 
National Security Law have not been generally welcomed here in 
Korea. The remarks, contained in a key-note speech delivered by 
Thomas Hubbard, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
East Asian and Pacific affairs, at a seminar on U.S.-South 
Korean relations in the Pacific era sponsored by American 
University, in fact have touched on a raw nerve in many quarters. 
  Though Seoul wants to play the dispute down, this is the 
first time that any senior U.S. government official has publicly 
expressed a desire to see the controversial Korean law repealed. 
We particularly wonder what motivated the chief U.S. delegate 
to the working-level contacts between Washington and Pyongyang 
on the North Korean nuclear issue to express this desire, 
whether officially or privately, just before inter-Korean 
dialogue was due to start. Even if the remarks were made as a 
bona fide suggestion to a close ally, they can be criticized as 
interference in the domestic affairs of a foreign country. 
  Needless to say, the National Security Law, which was 
enacted 
immediately after the Republic of Korea was founded in 1948, is 
a by-product of the tragic Korean division into South and North. 
The law from that time contributed greatly to the protection of 
South Korea's system of free democracy and to deterring the 
North Korean communists in their continuous attempts to 
infiltrate into and subvert the South throughout the 1950-53 
Korean War triggered by Pyongyang. 
  On the other hand, the law has long been disputed by critics 
who claim that with its excessively comprehensive and ambiguous 
punitive provisions against anti-state acts and "acts benefiting 
the enemy," it contravenes the general rule of law and the 
principle that crimes and the punishment due them must be 
specified concretely. Besides that, the security law was abused 
to suppress anti-government elements by the previous military 
governments. 
  Consequently, notably after the June 29, 1987 
democratization 
package was declared, the opposition forces began to strengthen 
their calls for the abolition of the law in the cause of 
democratization and the protection of human rights. They cited 
the fact that the situation has changed significantly since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc in Eastern 
Europe, South Korea's establishment of diplomatic links with 
Russia and China and the adoption of the historic inter-Korea 
agreement to simultaneously join the U.N. 
  For its part, the Seoul government has maintained its stand 
that it should not abolish the controversial domestic law as 
long as North Korea continues to stick to its policy of seeking 
to communize the South by force as provided for in the preamble 
of the Workers Party charter and Article 11 of its new socialist 
Constitution. At the same time, the government is prepared to 
reduce the scope of acts subject to the law substantially. We 
should remind ourselves the north Koreans have persistently 
demanded for more than two decades that Seoul repeal the law 
which it has denounced as a tool to suppress human rights. 
  We find it strange that a ranking U.S. official should be 
speaking for Pyongyang in connection with human rights in South 
Korea, and not taking issue with the terrible violations of 
human rights in North Korea. No one can overlook the grim fact 
that the North Korean criminal code has provisions for death 
sentences and property confiscation in punishment of a wide 
range of anti-state offenses including simple dissidence and 
political opposition. 
  The security law in the South must be only a temporary law, 
but it should be abrogated if and only if North Korea truly 
abandons its plot to communize the South, irrespective of 
whether the two Koreas are unified or not. In the meantime, it 
is also hoped that the security law will be amended to more 
restrictedly apply in such a way that safeguards both human 
rights and the nation's security at the same time. Only in this 
way can the basic order and free democracy be kept intact. This 
kind of law amendment is suggested on the basis of a national 
consensus, namely through a compromise between the ruling and 
opposition parties. But now it is premature to abolish the law. 
  We presume that the U.S. official may have uttered his 
suspicious remarks in response to an adamant call in the 
U.S.-North Korea nuclear contacts that it do so. Our government 
should urge the U.S. to request Pyongyang that it change its 
horrible criminal law and discontinue its Stalinist despotism 
before expressing a desire to see an ally scrap a security law.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Demand for Abolition of the National </F>
Security Law"] 
  [Text] The old issue of repealing the National Security 
Law has emerged again to be a matter of great concern, according 
to remarks by a senior U.S. Government official. Tom Hubbard, 
U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and the 
Pacific affairs, said in a speech delivered at a university: 
"The ROK has successfully established democracy, and the human 
rights situation has considerably improved. The U.S. 
Government, however, still hopes the ROK Government will repeal 
the National Security Law." 
  Answering a question regarding this at the National 
Assembly, 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that the ROK has never been 
informed of the U.S. Government's official position in 
connection with the demand for abolition of the National 
Security Law. I think, however, Mr. Hubbard's remarks reflect 
the U.S. Government's intent, in view of the U.S. State 
Department's criticism in its annual "Human Rights Report" 
released on 31 January pointing out "the National Security Law 
is still used to repress the freedom of expression, gathering, 
and travel." 
  The U.S. view elicits our agreement as we have repeatedly 
urged the abolition of the National Security Law. Nevertheless, 
it is unpleasant that such insistence basically equals 
intervention in domestic affairs [naejong kansopsong chujang]. 
If the government's inflexible negative [pujongjok] position on 
repealing this law is still steadfast, I would like to ask the 
government if it is willing to officially protest to U.S. 
Government. In order to undergo [sohwa] the affront [moyok] to 
us by the United States, who we have considered a friendly 
nation, our government should review several things coolly. 
  The government should review, above all, whether the 
situation of human rights in the ROK has sufficiently improved 
befitting a civilian government. The guarantee of human rights 
at the level in Western countries must become our ultimate and 
this is what the United States desires. The human rights 
situation in our country still lags behind the level we have 
tried to restore since the military dictatorial regime. Many 
conscientious prisoners are still suffering hardships behind 
bars, and the government does not have a deep interest in their 
release. This is one of the factors that prove the above. How 
can the government explain the inconsistency that it is pushing 
ahead with the South-North dialogue and summit talks while 
considering North Korea an antistate body [pan kukka tanche]? 
  The government also needs to closely examine if this 
incident 
[satae] is a sign of delicate changes [mimyohan pyonhwa] in the 
U.S. Government's policy on North Korea. It does not have to 
pay attention to the fact that Mr. Hubbard has been the chief 
delegate to North Korean-U.S. contacts in New York, or to his 
expected role in the forthcoming third round of North 
Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The government must remind itself 
of the fact that it is the first time a U.S. high-ranking 
official has openly mentioned the abolition of the National 
Security Law, although the United States has recognized that 
this law is being used to repress people's human rights, as 
revealed in the annual "Human Rights Report." We now need to 
have enough keen insight to understand that the United States 
cannot help but make some changes in its policy toward North 
Korea to improve relations and to predict what those changes 
will be. 
  It is needless for us to explain again why the National 
Security Law -- which, backed by anticommunist ideology, has 
been abused as a means of infringing upon human rights -- must 
be abolished. I would like to stress again, however, that 
various issues can be resolved at the same time upon the 
abolition of this law.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ha Chun-u: "Suspension of `Team Spirit' </F>
Exercise--`A Military Concession' for Nuclear Inspection of the 
North"] 
  [Excerpts] The announcement of the suspension of the Team 
Spirit exercise -- a joint mobilization training exercise 
between the ROK and the United States -- was a concrete step of 
concession by the ROK and the United States in connection with 
the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Ever since the Team Spirit exercise started, North Korea 
demanded its suspension, defining it as "an offensive training 
exercise intended for a Northward invasion," and put forward its 
suspension as a precondition for the resolution of the nuclear 
problem. 
  The ROK and the United States created an atmosphere 
favorable 
for enhancing North Korean nuclear transparency by accepting the 
North Korean demand, although with conditions. [passage omitted 
on nature, background of Team Spirit] 
  Since the Team Spirit exercise has been used as a 
negotiating 
card up to now, it is likely that North Korea will continually 
put forward a demand for additional military concessions, 
including the complete suspension of the Team Spirit, at 
negotiations. 
  However, relevant military officials expressed their 
position 
that the Team Spirit exercise, which is one of three elements 
supporting the ROK-U.S. joint defense system, in addition to the 
U.S. Forces in the ROK and ROK-U.S. joint command system, should 
no longer be the target for negotiations. 
  Thus, the military raised voices expressing concern about 
the 
possibility of Team Spirit, which is not related to the nuclear 
issue, being delayed and becoming nothing but a name, due to the 
North Korean delaying tactics. 
  In particular, the United States proposed that the Team 
Spirit be conducted every other year on the pretext of reducing 
security expenses and the scale of the exercise, including the 
participating troops, be reduced. In view of this, the military 
officials are worried that the United States may make additional 
concessions pertaining to the Team Spirit exercise. 
  This being the case, the relevant military officials 
maintain 
that as long as North Korea continues an arms buildup, not 
giving up its will for war, even after it abandons nuclear arms 
development, alternative steps should be taken in a bid to 
supplement the temporary suspension or reduction of Team Spirit 
so that the ROK- U.S. joint defense system remains consolidated.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports, articles, and editorials from the ROK's vernacular 
press published on 4 March regarding the 3 March North-South 
working-level contact held at Panmunjom to discuss the exchange 
of special envoy issue. 
  The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 
1,300-word editorial under the headline "North Korea's Endless 
Demands." The paper notes that during the 3 March working 
contact, North Korea demanded that Patriot missiles not be 
brought into South Korea and that President Kim Yong-sam 
remarks' saying that "we will not shake hands with people with 
nuclear arms" be "canceled officially," in addition to its 
previous demand for the suspension of Team Spirit and the 
abandonment of the international cooperative system. 
  Stressing that "pending North-South problems" can be 
discussed through the exchange of special envoys and that "more 
difficult problems" can be handled by holding a North-South 
summit, the editorial points out that the North Korean demand 
illustrates that "it is not interested in the envoy exchange," 
and urges Kim Il-song to "apologize" for having triggered the 25 
June "southward war of aggression" before North Korea demands 
the "cancellation" of President Kim's remarks. 
  Denouncing the North Korean "haughty attitude," the 
editorial 
asks: "For what weak points should we always be dragged and 
ridiculed by the North Korean authorities?" 
  Predicting that North Korea will show only the "least false 
sincerity" in an attempt to realize a third round of U.S.-North 
Korea high-level talks slated for 21 March, the paper condemns 
the North for always putting forward "difficult conditions" 
after reaching an agreement in principle, referring to our 
"experience" in the past North-South dialogue. Pointing to "many 
more difficulties and obstacles" laid on the road toward the 
settlement of North-South problems, the editorial calls for an 
"essential reform" in our attitude toward the North-South 
dialogue and for refraining from "making public" our targets for 
the dialogue and other plans pertaining to North-South 
relations, including public references to a North-South summit. 
The editorial urges our side to come to the contact with the 
North with "a fair and square attitude" and to employ even "the 
strategy of boycott" if the situation does not turns out as we 
wish. 
  The moderate daily TONG-A ILBO publishes on page a 
1,300-word 
editorial entitled "Preposterous North Korea." Noting that North 
Korea uses "negotiation strategy" intended to "disregard" the 
South Korean allegation, the paper points out that North Korea 
has not changed this strategy in the recent contact for envoy 
exchange, and that its demand for the cancellation of President 
Kim's remarks and for the abandonment of the plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles is "preposterous" and "embarrassing." 
  The editorial says that since the U.S. delegate to the 
negotiations talked about the "abolition" of the South Korean 
National Security Law, North Korea will not remain "silent" on 
this issue. North Korea will further attempt to "gain more 
concessions" while repeatedly putting forward its previous 
conditions. Warning that we are apt to regard North Korea as 
"easy negotiation partner," the editorial points out various the 
"misjudgment" made by our government in the past in dealing with 
North Korea, and urges the government and people "not to be 
insulted" by the North Korean attitude any longer. 
  The government-supported daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on 
page 
3 a 1,300-word editorial under the headline "North Korea Should 
Keenly Realize the South Side's Intention To Suspend Team 
Spirit." The paper says that as the result of the beginning of 
the nuclear inspection of North Korea by International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], a North-South working contact was held for 
envoy exchange and that the South side announced the 
"suspension" of the Team Spirit exercise with a view to urging 
the North to accept the inspection and come to North-South 
dialogue with "sincerity." Stressing that now is the time for 
North Korea to work for ensuring "nuclear transparency" and for 
"improving North-South relations," the editorial calls on North 
Korea to accept a "special inspection" of the two undeclared 
sites on which "suspicion of nuclear development" has been 
concentrated and to accept "mutual inspections" between the 
North and the South. Recalling the North Korean "stereo-typical 
strategy" and "preposterous demands" during North-South 
negotiations, the paper warns that if North Korea "stubbornly 
adheres to such strategy," the Team Spirit exercise will be 
"immediately" resumed. The editorial calls on the North Korean 
authorities to be "keenly aware of the significance" of our 
government's announcement on the suspension of Team Spirit. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 5 a 2,000-word 
article by Chon Chong, deputy editor-in-chief of CHUNGANG ILBO, 
under the headline, "`Experimentation' by Scholar-turned 
Diplomatic and Security Affairs Team." 
  Pointing to the "negative view" of the people toward North 
Korea- U.S. negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue and 
toward our government's countermeasures, the article points out 
that from the outset, people were concerned with the 
"scholar-turned diplomatic and security affairs team" of the 
civilian government and that the people are now aware that "Kim 
Il-song is waging a wild game with the United States using the 
nuclear issue as his bargaining card." The article stresses that 
North Korea's final goal is to establish diplomatic relations 
with the United States, because North Korea believes it must 
improve these relations if it is to avoid "international 
isolation" and "economic crisis," and maintain its political 
system. 
  The article notes, however, that while the United States is 
aware of North Korea's delaying tactics, it has been unable to 
circumvent North Korean "stubbornness." Commenting on our 
government's sandwiched position between the U.S. and North 
Korea, the article says that high-ranking diplomats and 
government officials are showing increased skepticism on our 
"stick and carrot" foreign policy on North Korea and on Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu's "optimism" on North Korea-U.S. talks and 
other North-South issues. Thus, the people "undisguisedly" 
indicate that there are "problems" in the "strategic concept" of 
our scholar-turned security team, including Minister Han, in 
diplomatic negotiations. Referring to remarks of a high-ranking 
U.S. delegate leading dialogue with North Korea that, "I can 
never understand the North Korean intention. North Korea is, 
indeed, a shuddering partner," the article warns that adherence 
to an "appeasement policy" creates "strategic problems," and 
calls for "cool observation" of public opinion. 
  The moderate MUNHWA ILBO publishes on page 2 a 1,500-word 
editorial under the headline, "We Should Look at the Future." 
Explaining the process in the past North-South working contact, 
the paper says that the stalemate in talks can be attributed to 
the South's "passive attitude" and the "insincerity" of the 
North Korean authorities' in evading the talks. Pointing out 
the significance in the resumption of contacts, the editorial 
urges the government to address North-South relations "in an 
independent, more positive manner."

  [Text] Seoul, March 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has protested 
the United States' decision to revive the Super 301 trade 
provision, demanding that Washington adhere to world trade rules 
rather than resorting to unilateral action. 
  "The South Korean Government regrets that the U.S. 
administration decided to revive the Super 301 provision on 
March 3, at a point when the Uruguay Round multilateral trade 
talks had been concluded after seven years of negotiations and 
when the world trade organization is to be formally launched 
from 1995 after an official signing next month," a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said. 
  The spokesman reminded that Seoul had repeatedly stressed in 
South Korean-U.S. economic talks that trade disputes should not 
be dealt with through the domestic procedures of any single 
nation. 
  Seoul re-emphasizes its belief that disputes "should be 
resolved through the strengthened and supplemented settlement 
procedures of the world trade organization," the spokesman said.

  [Text] The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy today 
pointed out that the U.S. revival of the Super 301 trade 
provision conflicts [ogunnanun kosirago] with the Uruguay Round 
spirit and expressed concern that the U.S. action may hamper 
[chohae] the newly established world free trade order. 
  Urging the United States to exercise control in invoking the 
Super 301 clause of its own volition [chauijogin supo 301 
paltongul chaje], Han Yong-su, director of the ministry's Trade 
Cooperation Division, said: I do not think the U.S. action will 
immediately effect ROK-U.S. trade relations fundamentally 
[kunbonjogin] because ROK-U.S. trade is currently fairly 
[pigyojok] balanced and because the two countries are headed 
towards resolving matters of mutual interest through 
consultation channels. 
  Director Han said: If the United States takes action 
regarding the ROK, we will solve problems that arise from U.S. 
actions according to dispute-settlement procedures of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade 
Organization. 
  He also said: The government will utilize various channels 
to prevent incorrect or false information on the ROK from making 
its way into the annual U.S. report on each country's trade 
barriers. At the same time, it will support active dialogue 
between ROK and U.S. businessmen through ROK-U.S. industrial 
cooperation channels in nine areas which include the computer 
and semiconductor sectors.

  [Text] Seoul, March 4 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Thursday defined inter-Korean trade as internal 
dealings by the Korean people based on racial self-determination 
as provided for by international law. 
  In a document submitted to the National Assembly, the Trade, 
Industry and Energy Ministry noted that the Republic of Korea's 
Constitution stipulates that the Republic shall consist of the 
Korean peninsula and its adjoining islands: That the basic 
inter- Korean agreement put into force in February 1992 provides 
for economic exchanges and cooperation between North and South 
Korea such as joint resources development, merchandise trade as 
internal transactions of the Korean people and joint ventures; 
and that the U.N. Charter expressly permits racial 
self-determination. 
  When West Germany subscribed to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, the GATT recognized inter-German trade as an 
internal matter of the German people, the ministry said. The 
German case set a precedent for the two Koreas, and there is no 
need for GATT recognition of inter-Korean trade as internal 
business dealings of the Korean people, it added. Some foreign 
countries are moving toward regarding inter-Korean trade as 
international trade subject to tariffs.

  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korean 
businessmen's interest in North Korea has risen sharply since 
Pyongyang decided on Feb. 16 to permit International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of its seven declared nuclear 
sites. 
  The number of National Unification Board-approved 
applications for contacts with North Koreans almost doubled from 
14 in January to 27 last month, according to the Trade, Industry 
and Energy Ministry. 
  The increase was particularly conspicuous in the week 
starting Feb. 18, with 11 applications filed, indicating that 
the North's acceptance of IAEA inspections has raised southern 
businessmen's expectations on improved inter-Korean ties, 
including better business relations. 
  Of the 27 applications approved in February, 17 concerned 
forming trade relations with North Korean businesses and the 
remaining 10 covered investment in joint ventures with North 
Korean partners. 
  Of the 11 applications approved after Feb. 16, however, only 
two were for establishing trade relations and nine for 
investment in joint ventures. 
  An application filed by the Hanhwa Group in the names of 
five 
group executives, including chairman Song Nak-chung of Kyong-in 
Energy, after North Korea's inspection decision covered 
joint-venture investment in constructing oil storage facilities 
and petrochemical factories along the west coast of North Korea. 
  Hyosong Corp. applied to contact a North Korean firm on 
setting up a joint-venture knitwear factory, while Cheil Food 
&amp; 
Chemicals sought a joint-venture food processing factory. 
  Of the 233 applications filed last year, only three were 
turned down, ministry officials said. Total applications this 
year will more than double the number filed last year, they 
added.

Personal Connection in North Korea"] 
  [Excerpts] Since 1989, departments in charge of North 
Korean affairs or relevant employees responsible for North Korea 
affairs concerning new business development projects and 
overseas development sections of the conglomerate groups have 
been meeting with North Korean officials in third countries such 
as China, Hong Kong, and Macao, with the authorization of the 
National Unification Board. These meetings with North Korean 
officials are intended to maintain contacts with the North 
Korean team, which wants economic cooperation with South Korea, 
in preparation for the settlement of the North Korean nuclear 
issue. [passage omitted] 
  Although business circles are interested in the role of Hong 
Sok-chong, who succeeded Kim Tal-hyon as chairman of the State 
Planning Committee, they attach more importance to the role of 
Kim Chong-u, vice chairman of the External Economic Committee 
and chairman of the committee to promote the External Economic 
Commission, who is part of the so-called "opening trio" along 
with Premier Kang Song-san and Deputy Premier Kim Tal-hyon. 
[passage omitted] 
  A figure who is in charge of North Korean affairs for a 
conglomerate group said that "it is difficult to earnestly 
approach the North Korean team -- which wants to promote 
economic cooperation with South Korea -- led by Kim Chong-u, 
because the North Korean nuclear issue has not yet been 
completely resolved and its economic team has not been 
reorganized." He added that "some progress has been made as a 
result of ROK enterprises' constant attempts to make a personal 
connection with Kim Chong-u." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by So Yang-won: "North Korean Economy Turned to </F>
Opening--Analysis of Trends in Second Half of 1993 by National 
Unification Board"] 
  [Text] It was revealed that the North Korean economy 
recorded negative growth for the past four consecutive years, 
and is still in "a vicious circle of poverty." 
  "The Trend of North Korean Economy for the Second Half of 
1993," released by the National Unification Board [NUB] on 28 
February revealed that agricultural production in North Korea 
showed a 15 to 20 percent decrease from the previous year due to 
damage by cold weather; and the mining and construction 
industries maintained only the production level of the previous 
year due to supply shortages of energy and raw materials. 
  Cho Kon-sik, an intelligence analysis officer in the NUB, 
said that "the plant operation rate in North Korea last year 
remained merely 40 percent of that in 1992, thus showing no 
improvement. This level is very close to the lowest productivity 
limit in North Korea. Therefore, we may say that the North 
Korean economy has achieved no more than 'zero-point growth,' no 
matter how generously one may evaluate the situation." 
  Viewing the result of North Korean external trade, it is 
true 
that trade with China has increased. However, trade with Russia 
and Japan decreased. As a result, the trade amount remained 
$2.7 billion--the level of 1992. 
  According to a latest statistic of the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corporation, North Korea's export of steel, iron, and cement to 
China was very active, while its import of grains and oil 
drastically increased, thus marking a trade amount of $90 
million -- a 29.2 percent increase from the previous year. 
  Meanwhile, border trade of daily necessities has been brisk 
between small-scale businessmen and local governments in North 
Korean-Chinese border areas. Such trade amounted to 
approximately $70 million last year. 
  As North Korea has not been able to overcome such economic 
difficulties, it applied laws and regulations pertaining to the 
opening of Najin and Sonbong free economy and trade zone, and 
has now launched full-scale economic cooperation with China. 
  Nevertheless, North Korea still tightly controls its 
citizens, counter to the policy of opening. As a result, two 
contradictory situations, namely "opening" and "maintaining the 
system," coexist in North Korea. 
  In fact, North Korea concluded 11 agreements on economic 
cooperation with China, Cambodia, and Finland during the second 
half of last year. 
  Taking a step forward from merely receiving Chinese trade 
investment delegations, North Korea dispatched a Nampo municipal 
trade delegation on 11 October; a Chonjin municipal friendship 
delegation on 1 December; and a North Hamgyong Provincial 
economic delegation on 13 December, to three provinces in the 
northeast China and to Yonbyon autonomous district, thus showing 
the active will for opening. 
  It is believed that North Korea's positiveness in opening 
will gradually become more visible with the ultimate change in 
the political situation, including the inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and progress in the 
North-South dialogue.

for effective utilization of 102 staff workers now working in 
this studio.

  [Text] Seoul, March 4 (YONHAP) -- A shipping firm in 
Yanbian autonomous district for ethnic Koreans in northeast 
China is promoting plans to open a direct sea route between 
North and South Korea, business sources said on Thursday. 
  Yanbian Shipping Co. is negotiating with the South Korean 
Government via its Seoul agent, Korea Special Shipping Co., 
about its plans to have a 499-ton container ship sail between 
South Korea's Pusan and North Korea's Chongjin once a week. 
  Foreign ships operating irregularly between North and South 
Korea now carry goods as there is no regular shipping service 
linking the two. 
  If the route is opened, the Chinese shipping firm will use 
it 
to transport goods chiefly between South Korea and Yanbian, 
rather than between the two Koreas, as there are rail links 
between Chongjin and Yanbian, the sources said. 
  An official of the Korea Maritime and Port Administration 
said his office had not yet received an application for opening 
a sea route between Pusan and Chongjin from the shipper. 
  "When we receive the application, we'll decide on it after 
consulting with related government ministries," he added.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with President Kim Yong-sam by Korean </F>
Broadcasting System, KBS, anchorman Yi Yun-song at the 
Chongwadae, presidential office, in Seoul on the 21st 
anniversary of the founding of KBS, date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Yi Yun-song] How are you? When I was entering 
the Chongwadae presidential office I felt spring had arrived. I 
understand you do jogging every morning. What do you at dawn? 
  [Kim Yong-sam] It is still chilly at dawn. It is March, so I 
can feel spring is coming. [passage omitted on jogging habits] 
  [Yi] Mr. President, thank you very much for your response to 
our request for this interview despite your busy schedule. The 
date 25 February marked one year since you took office. You are 
now entering the second year. Most of the people know the 
method, content, and style of your management of state affairs 
through the mass media. The purpose of my visit here today is 
to hear more of them directly from Mr. President; for instance, 
the background in making policy decisions, managing state 
affairs, and so forth. Mr. President, what were your plans and 
objectives in managing state affairs during the past year? 
  [Kim] We cannot say the previous governments were strong 
governments because they failed to enjoy the people's support 
and because they were not the governments that were entrusted by 
the people. On the other hand, however, the present civilian-led 
government is a government entrusted by the people and a 
government chosen by the people. Therefore, the present 
civilian-led government can dignifiedly carry out politics for 
the interest of the country and the people as stipulated in the 
Constitution. In other words, the present government is a 
legitimate government, so it can dignifiedly ask the people to 
do what they should do. It accepts our people's demands, if they 
are considered to be reasonable. 
  To make a clean and honest government is a very important 
task. I think only such a government can become a strong 
government and enjoy the people's support and love. 
  [Yi] Inspection activities continued last year in order to 
eliminate all sorts of old social and political corruption and 
irregularities. These activities enjoyed praise from people at 
home and abroad. However, there were also voices of resistance 
and complaints from some former privileged people. How do you 
assess the past year? 
  [Kim] I have said that the past year felt like 10 years or 
so. I think that during the past year I have done a lot of work 
in eliminating all sorts of past corruption and irregularities. 
One of the most important tasks the previous governments failed 
to implement, which our civilian-led government has 
accomplished, is the adoption of the real-name financial 
transaction system. With the adoption of this system, the people 
can receive due compensations for what they have done -- 
shedding sweat. Another important task that our government has 
accomplished was the adoption of the system of revealing the 
private property of public servants, including myself. With the 
adoption of the system, those who have accumulated property 
through illegal means had to leave their posts. This system will 
be enforced in the future, too, on a continuous basis. This kind 
of reform is unprecedented in our history, and, therefore, is a 
revolutionary event. 
  I stress here that my plan for reform and change will 
continue. It is very difficult to complete the work of reform 
and change in one year. However, the effectiveness of our work 
for reform and change is presently being witnessed in our 
society. In other words, our society is now in the process of 
reform and change. Many changes have been implemented among both 
upper and lower grade public servants. I think we should 
concentrate more efforts on carrying out reform and change among 
lower grade servants. 
  [Yi] What difficulties have you had in carrying out your 
work 
for reform and change during the past year? 
  [Kim] I was well aware of the president's duties and 
responsibilities because I had a long career in politics. After 
I took office, however, I came to realize that my prior 
understanding of the president's duties and responsibilities was 
limited. I know some people hold that I am enforcing one-man 
politics or a one-man dictatorship under the civilian-led 
government. This is indeed a wrong assertion. Under the 
presidential government system, the president should assume 
responsibility for all things. So, it is wrong to say that I am 
enforcing dictatorship under the civilian-led government. I am 
just performing responsibilities assigned by the people. When I 
make serious decisions I am often engulfed in agony and feel 
lonely because I have to make a final decision alone without 
consulting with other people. 
  [Yi] These reforms and changes are efflorescing in our 
society. Yet, there is still a field where the work of reform 
and change has not been smoothly carried out. It is precisely 
our political field. What do you say about the reform movement 
in the political field? 
  [Kim] Changes in the political field are very important. 
Politics should change. Our politics have never changed, still 
the same as the politics of 20 years ago, 30 years, and 10 years 
ago. Whenever an opportunity presented itself, I stressed the 
need for reform and changes in the political field. 
  To achieve reform and changes in the political field, 
elections should be clean. So, the bills which have been 
submitted to the National Assembly this time for deliberation 
are in fact revolutionary bills. I mean the bills on elections. 
If these bills are passed at the National Assembly the politics 
of our country will become advanced ones. As long as political 
corruption and corrupt elections exist, our country cannot 
become an advanced country. I know a country where political 
corruption and illicit elections have been perpetrated. Of 
course, I would not identify the name of the country here. 
Anyway, political corruption and illicit elections are indeed a 
misfortunate phenomenon. That country is undergoing 
difficulties these days. This is because of the lack of clean 
politics and clean elections. Only when clean politics and 
clean elections are conducted can people's awareness of genuine 
politics be changed. Illicit elections are to drive people into 
depravity and ruin. 
  [Yi] Last January you met the three former presidents. 
Afterward, many Sixth Republic figures were released from 
prison. Witnessing this, many people have raised the voices of 
worry that your will for reform is being enfeebled. What do you 
think of this? 
  [Kim] It is entirely different from facts. Of course, the 
assessment of the three former presidents may be various. Among 
them are the presidents who were not directly elected by the 
people. However, meeting the former presidents as the president 
of the civilian-led government is also meaningful. 
  The release of Sixth Republic figures is a matter on the 
rights of the Judical Branch. So, we cannot argue on this 
matter. We should not link the meeting of the three former 
presidents to the release of the abovementioned figures. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Yi] Last year, many foreign heads of state visited our 
country. You met many heads of state at the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting. Also, you had summit talks 
with U.S. President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister 
Hosokawa. While traveling overseas what image did you witness 
foreign countries had toward the ROK? 
  [Kim] The establishment of the civilian-led government has 
completely changed the image of the ROK. In a nutshell, I think 
that democracy is the supreme value. Under the previous regimes 
our diplomacy was not properly and smoothly carried out. The 
strongest power in diplomacy is precisely democracy itself. At 
the meeting of heads of the ROK missions in the Asia, Pacific, 
and American regions held in Seoul I told them that they should 
become salesmen. I urged them to make their best to increase our 
international competitive power. 
  The United Nations publishes a report on human rights once a 
year. The ROK has been a target country of this report. 
However, since the civilian-led government was established, our 
country has become a human rights screening member country in 
the United Nations. The position of our country has changed 
completely. 
  [Yi] I understand you are scheduled to visit Japan and China 
this year for summit diplomacy. What are your expectations? 
  [Kim] The importance of these two countries is very great in 
today's pan-Pacific era. In terms of our security, the two 
countries are also important. Japan and China are among our 
three major trade partner countries. So, my visit to these two 
countries will be closely related to our future economic 
development. Deep and detailed discussions will be held for 
bilateral economic cooperation. I think that my visit to the two 
countries will become a great turning point in respective 
bilateral relations. The two countries participated in the APEC 
meeting. This fact also gives more significance to my planned 
visit. 
  Of course, Russia, which is one of our neighboring 
countries, 
is very important to us. We cannot disregard the importance of 
Russia. I cannot make a visit to this country at this time. 
  Anyway, if economic cooperative relations are smoothly 
achieved, our country's future will be very bright. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Yi] The greatest pending foreign policy issue is the 
inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities. The North 
Korean nuclear issue is a problem which we are directly 
concerned with, and it is a difficult problem to solve for the 
world as a whole. Fortunately, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspection team has entered Pyongyang to conduct 
official inspections. In Panmunjom, a working contact is being 
held for the exchange of special envoys. How do you think this 
problem will be solved? If it is not solved, what measure do 
you think will be necessary? 
  [Kim] The North Korean nuclear program should be stopped by 
all means. This is necessary not only for the survival of the 
70 million fellow countrymen but for peace in Northeast Asia and 
the world. This is a problem directly connected with our 
survival and for peace on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, I 
think we should mobilize all means possible to solve this 
problem. 
  Fortunately, the IAEA inspection has started. The working 
contact for the exchange of special envoys is being held. We 
cannot be too optimistic at this stage, for we have undergone 
numerous critical stages in our relations with North Korea. We 
cannot expect that everything will be settled smoothly. We will 
have to overcome some more critical points. However, now that 
North Korea is permitting the nuclear inspection, the so-called 
nuclear card has left the North Korean hand. I think the 
inter-Korean dialogue, therefore, has to make considerable 
progress. The United States has promised us that it will not 
hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea unless 
there is significant progress in the exchange of special envoys. 
North Korea has also officially announced it will do so. 
  What is most important at the present stage is that we are 
handling every matter in close cooperation with the United 
States. The United States has always consulted us on their 
contacts with North Korea. At times, the United States even 
halted the talks with North Korea to have time to discuss 
matters with us. 
  I think what is most important to the ROK is maintaining 
such 
a close cooperative system with the United States. If the 
exchange of special envoys and inter-Korean dialogues proceed as 
we intend and North Korea's nuclear development program is 
hindered, we could promote relations with North Korea in 
various areas, including the economic sector. 
  I think North Korea should acknowledge the fact that the ROK 
is in a position to actively help it improve relations with the 
United States. It would be foolish of North Korea to think that 
it can discuss this issue without the ROK. 
  [Yi] In a recent news conference, you said that the 
precondition for the exchange of special envoys is holding a 
summit. You even said that you would meet with the North Korean 
president when you believed it conducive to keeping North Korea 
from developing nuclear weapons. When do you think it will take 
place? 
  [Kim] It is hard to predict now. I will have to judge the 
timing by watching the development for the exchange of special 
envoys. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chinhae, March 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Friday that South Korea should look to the Pacific Ocean in 
helping to open a new Pacific era along with advanced nations. 
President Kim made the remark while delivering a speech at the 
commencement ceremony of the Korea Naval Academy's 48th class in 
Chinhae, South Kyongsang Province. 
  "The people who exploited the sea have prospered and, in the 
economic war era of `survival of the fittest,' it is even more 
important to exploit the sea," Kim said. The central stage of 
world history is moving to the Pacific Ocean, Kim added, and 
exchanges and cooperation in the Pacific region are increasing 
rapidly. 
  "Your mission of protecting the sea is becoming more and 
more 
important," Kim said. Kim noted that the military has been able 
to fulfill its mission as a military of the people and as their 
final fortress. 
  "I hope that you will lead change and reform in the military 
as the new generation, and I ask you to make personal sacrifices 
to build a credible Navy." 
  "I myself will make strong efforts for better treatment and 
promotion of your prosperity, so that you can concentrate on 
your mission. I will see to it that professional soldiers feel 
they are performing an honorable job for the state and the 
nation."

  [Text] Seoul, March 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on 
Friday morning visited a military hospital where the bodies of 
Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Cho Kun-hae, his wife and four 
others killed in a helicopter crash on Thursday lay in state, 
offering condolences to their bereaved families. He was 
accompanied by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Chief 
Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong. 
  Kim told Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Choe 
Tong-hwan and other Air Force leaders to make thorough 
preparations for the victims' funerals, which the government 
will hold as an Air Force rite. The Ministry of Patriots and 
Veterans Affairs has decided to pay the victims' bereaved 
families compensation totaling 280 million won (350,000 U.S. 
dollars). 
  Gen. Cho's family will receive 109 million won, Maj. Kang 
Song-yun's (pilot) 51 million won, Capt. Yu Yong-chae's 
(co-pilot) 34 million won, Capt. Yi Sang-hun's (Gen. Cho's aide) 
40 million won and Msgt. Chon Hae-won's (navigator) 46 million 
won. The government will honor them all, providing a decoration 
for Gen. Cho and special promotions for the other. 
  Meanwhile, an Air Force team investigating the crash found 
the helicopter's voice recorder late Thursday night and turned 
it over to the National Scientific Investigation Institute for 
closer examination. Partially damaged, the recorder contains 
taped communications between the pilot and the flight control 
officer, which is expected to reveal the cause of the crash. 
  The Air Force is considering two reasons for the crash: 
Engine failure due to poor maintenance and the pilot's failure 
to cope with a sudden weather change.

  [Text] Seoul, March 4 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly, on 
the last day of its special session Friday, is to adopt revised 
election bills providing legal and systematic grounds for the 
political reform advocated by President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Negotiations on revision of the election law, the political 
fund law and the local autonomy law resulted in an eleventh-hour 
compromise between the ruling and opposition parties earlier 
Friday. 
  The revised legislation is expected to stand as a turning 
point for the establishment of "a new political culture" in this 
country, where politicians could engage in activities "that do 
not need money," as the slogan of the Kim Yong-sam 
administration goes. 
  In a nutshell, politicians on both sides could compete on an 
equal footing from now on, unlike in the past when 
pro-government politicians enjoyed abundant campaign funds and 
strong organizations while oppositionists had to resort to 
demagoguery. 
  In an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) 
Thursday night, President Kim described the new political laws 
as "revolutionary" and said they are needed if Korea is to join 
the ranks of "advanced" nations in the true meaning of the term. 
  The new election law provides punishment for parliamentary, 
gubernatorial, mayoral and local assembly candidates who spend 
more than the legally mandated amount during the permissible 
period of campaigning. 
  The spending limit for a presidential candidate is 22.5 
billion won, down from 36.5 billion won. A candidate for the 
National Assembly can spend up to 53 million won, down from 120 
million won. The amount is smaller for candidates running for 
local office. 
  An election will be nullified if a candidate spends more 
money than legally allowed or if a candidate's family or 
campaign workers are found to have violated the election law. 
  Candidates convicted of violating the election law will be 
banned from running for elective office for 10 years. 
  The new law abolishes the system of paid campaign workers 
and 
prohibits political parties from holding rallies during 
campaigning periods. Such rallies had served as occasions for 
bribing voters in the past. 
  All candidates are required to disclose their personal 
assets. They are also allowed to make as many outdoor campaign 
speeches as they want. 
  The political fund law allows an individual to contribute up 
to 150 million won to political parties, up from the current 
limit of 100 million won. The government's subsidy to political 
parties will rise to 800 won from 600 won per eligible voter. 
  The revised local autonomy law stipulates that all four 
local 
elections be held at the same time. It also calls for increased 
allowances for local council members and their aides paid by the 
state.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Sin Hyong-chun: "An Issue of </F>
Professionals Rather Than Progress"] 
  [Text] "Do most Kwanak members know several methods of 
contraception? Do they know the method appropriate for 
themselves? About 30 percent of Kwanak members have had a 
sexual experience. However, have they ever been educated about 
sex, contraceptives, or even falling in love?" 
  This is part of the article "The Third Generation," a 
collection of policy materials written by Kang Pyong-won (a 
23-year-old senior majoring in agricultural economics). Kang 
was elected General Student Association president at Seoul 
National University [SNU] on 26 November. 
  The Kang camp stated that the student movements of the 60's 
and 70's, which followed students' consciences, were first 
generation student movements, and the ideology-based movements 
of the 80's formed the second generation. They then proclaimed 
themselves the third generation, which dreams of the 
"progressive professionals" of society. 
  The student movement is changing. Actually, the change in 
the student movement is not new. It is natural that the 
old-style student movement cannot survive the waves of change 
that have followed the collapse of international socialism and 
the progress of democratization in every facet of society. 
However, the magnitude of change that emerged during the 
elections for student association president at universities last 
November was beyond expectations. 
  Yonsei University showed this most clearly in its student 
association president elections held on 24, 25 November. Son 
Yang-chol, a 25-year-old student who was considered a 
"non-student movement candidate," defeated the NL (National 
Liberation faction, whose main faction is the Chupasa faction) 
candidate after a fierce contest requiring two rounds of 
balloting. During the campaign, Son surprised his audience with 
his bold assertions about the "abolition of Marxism" and the 
comment that "inciting students through propaganda is nothing 
more than a religion." 
  According to the Ministry of Education, following the 
student 
association president elections in November, as many as 37 other 
universities have a student association president who does not 
belong to the student movement. However, in 1992 there were 36 
universities that elected presidents from non-student movement 
circles, and so Yonsei and Kukmin Universities were the only 
"major universities" to produce non-student movement presidents 
during this election. Thus the rapid progress of the 
non-student movement circles is not that important. 
  The most important point is not the advance of the 
non-student movement circles, but the change in the characters 
and pledges of candidates. During the campaign, candidates 
consistently stressed university problems, such as education 
quality, rather than social problems, such as class or ethnic 
conflict. The organization of the "Committee for School 
Development in the 21st Century" and the introduction of the 
"system for evaluating professors' lectures" are some examples. 
The fact that the "Progressive Student Alliance for a Reunified 
Korea in the 21st Century" (the "21st Century Alliance," for 
short), which claims to be a new student movement, produced 
president elects at SNU, Sangmyong Women's University, and 
Hansong University, and the good showing of the "Kyongsilyon 
Student Association" in elections at SNU and Chonnam University 
are remarkable in connection with the change of character in the 
student movement. 
  The "Kyongsilyon Student Association" was founded in the 
middle of last April and fielded candidates at SNU, Chonnam, 
Chungang, and Choson Universities, and at the Ansan Campus of 
Hanyang University. During the 25 November race at Chonnam 
University--an "NL stronghold"--the Kyongsilyon Student 
Association candidate ran a close race against the NL candidate, 
and was defeated by a narrow margin of 50 or so votes. In the 
SNU election, even though the candidate won 1,567 votes out of 
the 12,200 or so cast and finished fourth among a field of five 
candidates, he was judged to have finished very well for a 
first-time candidate. 
  The "21st Century Alliance," which produced a 
president-elect 
at SNU--considered the "headquarters of the student movement," 
was founded on 9 October by 500 students from SNU and Yonsei, 
Korea, Songgyungwan, and Sokang Universities. The various 
factions, feeling that the student movement could no longer 
survive by following the styles of the NL or PD (Peoples 
Democracy) factions, met and founded this organization. 
  The "21st Century Alliance" has a goal of creating 
"third-generation universities" that train progressive 
professionals. It claims that the colleges have remained 
unchanged and are not keeping up with society as it becomes 
democratized and professionalized. Members of the group said 
creating "progressive professionals" is their goal, but that 
"professional" was more important that "progressive." 
  Kang Pyong-won, a member of the "21st Century Alliance" who 
was elected student association president at SNU, said: "If 
education were liberalized and Harvard University opened a 
branch in Korea, SNU--which barely ranks among the top 200 
universities in the world--would not survive." He also stated 
he would "concentrate first on reforming college education." To 
reach this goal, the university should lower the number of 
credits required for graduation from the current 140 units to 
120. It should strengthen the links between the disciplines and 
raise the quality of education by instituting a departmental 
system within each college. 
  Son Yang-chol, elected student association president at 
Yonsei University, aroused interest both inside and outside of 
the university by insisting on a "union-like student 
association." Son said: "The student movement still keeps the 
illusion of a bureacratic system, even though the trend of the 
times is for the dissolution of a rigid bureaucratic system and 
for the direct participation of individuals and organizations. 
It is sufficient for the student association to have a `union' 
role for the sake of regulating individuals' interests." 
  Son said: "The fact that the student association fights only 
social and political issues while there are still various 
desires on campus is a dereliction of duty." He explained, "The 
`movement' will be lead by leaders of the `movement,' and not by 
the student association." 
  He suggested several concrete tasks to carry out, such as: 
Having faculty and staff use name tags, to give better service 
on campus; allowing only amateur athletes to participate in 
matches between Yonsei and Korea Universities--currently 
professional athletes participate; and collecting students' 
opinions using on-campus personal computer networks. 
  In elections for student association president at Korea, 
Sokang, and Ehwa Women's Universities, radical political solgans 
disappeared, and pledges to "start a campaign to gaurantee a 5 
percent education fund," "increase the seating capacity in 
library reading rooms," and "increase the number of faculty 
members" appeared. 
  At Ehwa, one candidate called for the "disclosure of 
election 
expenses so that there could be student association elections 
that do not cost money." Two candidates revealed that they had 
spent 3.4 million won and 4 million won each. "Environmental" 
issues were a major topic at some universities, and some 
candidates used recycled paper for their leaflets. 
  How will the change among the student associations alter the 
face of the university community next May? Will the months of 
April and May, previously filled with tear gas and fire bombs, 
recover the splendor of spring? 
  "It depends on the situation, but I think that the time for 
us to resort to fire bombs has passed. We must act so that our 
demonstrations win people's sympathies and earn comments that 
what we are doing is satisfactory and good." (Kang Pyong-won, 
SNU) 
  "I will guarantee the voice of fellow students when it comes 
to political problems. However, I do not want the student 
association to lead on political problems. Moreover, if outside 
organizations such as Hanchongnyon [Korea Federation of 
University Student Councils] choose Yonsei University as a 
meeting place and the majority of students here are against it, 
then that meeting cannot be held here. The student association 
at Yonsei has no interest in the concerns of outside political 
organizations." (Son Yang-chol, Yonsei University)

<F P=106> [Interview with Yo Yun-chae, alias name for leader of the </F>
Socialist Workers Alliance, by unidentified reporter in Seoul, 
date not given; first paragraph is the editor's note] 
  [Text] The Sanomaeng [Socialist Workers Alliance, pro-DPRK, 
anti-government in Seoul] had planned to conduct a separate 
socialist rally with the other socialistic political 
organizations while the laborers' rally was going on at the 
Hyochang sports arena on 30 October, but issued a joint 
statement only because there was not enough time. This 
interview was possible because the SISA JOURNAL made a 
counteroffer to the Sanomaeng when it requested us to report the 
movement for the legalization of the Sanomaeng taking the 
opportunity of this rally. The SISA JOURNAL planned this 
article to contribute to the public interest by reporting as 
accurately as possible the intention and the development of the 
Sanomaeng. 
  It took exactly five hours to meet him at a restaurant in 
Yongdungpo. He insisted that it was a necessary process in 
order to avoid the eyes of intelligence agencies that might 
chase them. They call it "sterilization." A member of 
Sanomaeng was with the reporting team all the time, but he did 
not know when the sterilization would end. 
  We changed taxis four times. I suspect that the other member 
of the Sanomaeng checked our moves somewhere near the assigned 
place. The sterilization that started in Kwangwhamum at 1400 on 
9 November finally ended at Yongdungpo after passing the 
Tongyodong intersection, Kungmin Daily News building, and 
Kungmin Bank building, Kongdokdong. It was 1830. Another 30 
minutes had passed when a man showed up and introduced the 
Sanomaeng. This is how a reporter of the bourgeois news media 
(Pak No Hae once called SISA JOURNAL this in a magazine) and a 
socialist met. He has a much more polished outstanding 
appearance than I expected. His name was Yo Yun-chae, but it 
was an alias. He answered questions with the logic of a leader 
befitting a political organization classified as an antinational 
organization by the security agencies. He allowed taking 
pictures as long as his face did not show. 
  [Reporter] Who are you? 
  [Yo Yun-chae] Because of the National Security Planning 
Agency [NSP] has not figured me out, it is not good to expose 
myself entirely. If my identity is known, my activities will be 
limited. All I can say (about myself) is that I entered Seoul 
National University and studied there from the end of the 1970's 
to the early 1980's and I planned to put all my efforts into the 
farmers movement, but I decided to devote myself to the 
Sanomaeng due to the change of environment. 
  [Reporter] Can you represent the Sanomaeng? 
  [Yo] I am a central committee member and chief of policy 
making of the Sanomaeng. Now, our organization is run by the 
collective leadership. We had our interim discussion before I 
came. Accordingly, my words reflect the thought of the central 
committee members and, I think, I can represent the Sanomaeng. 
  [Reporter] How many central committee members are there? 
  [Yo] I can say there are fewer than ten. 
  [Reporter] It is known that the Sanomaeng was in fact 
dissolved after Pak No-hae and Paek Tak-wung were arrested. At 
this moment, how much has the Sanomaeng restored the 
organization? 
  [Yo] Naturally, there was a time when, in fact, the 
organization did not work after the two `accidents' (he 
expressed it this way). Those were critical blows. However, we 
put much effort into restoring the organization ever since, and 
now full members of our organization have reached 90% of 
the 
number of members in the past. But we lost supporters and 
collaborators. The restoration of the organization was 
accomplished within two months after the accidents. The 
question is whether or not we can secure political leadership. 
In the past, we judged power according to who could mobilize 
more people in mass rallies, but now times have changed. At 
this moment, the local organizations are located in Honam 
Province, Central area, and Yongnam Province. 
  [Reporter] Socialism has collapsed internationally, and the 
influence of the opposition groups has diminished within the 
country. Do you believe that socialism can indeed be carried 
out in South Korea? 
  [Yo] The collapse of socialism was the most difficult 
experience for us. The Sanomaeng has carried out a critical 
examination of socialist ideology ever since. After all, it was 
the problem of a country. Marx regarded communism as the 
extinction of countries through the extinction of classes, but 
Stalinistic socialism, on the contrary, pursued the 
reinforcement of a country. That was Leninism that Lenin did 
not like. We insist on socialism that restores the communistic 
point of view. In the future, the Sanomaeng will have its basis 
in the mass movement and will realize socialism through fair 
competition in the capitalistic society. Despite the merits of 
capitalism, there are some people who feel that `this is not 
it.' This is the reason for us to transform our organization 
from the centralized pyramid style of the past to the 
network-style organization that connects positions in all 
fields. With this renovation of the Sanomaeng and under 
conditions of fair competition, I am confident of victory in the 
election. 
  [Reporter] The Sanomaeng was rather evaluated as a political 
organization that does not have a power base among the people. 
There is also a criticism that they are `socialists inside the 
flags'... 
  [Yo] I accept that. The Sanomaeng approached the people not 
by taking root in organizations among the people but by 
depending heavily on some `stars' and the method of distinct 
propaganda and instigation. We were accustomed to barricading 
and confronting enemy face to face. But we will use tactics of 
positions from now on. We will penetrate into movements in all 
fields such as labor, students, citizen, and religious 
movements. Recently, the labor movement in the Ulsan region 
lends optimism. The Sanomaeng will not be a far away 
organization but will be a trustworthy organization. The most 
important point is the connection of all positions by political 
leaderships. After hardening the power base like this, we will 
make a socialist workers' party. 
  [Reporter] Recently, Pak No-hae called the Sanomaeng `my 
illigitimate child' in an interview from prison with a magazine. 
What is your opinion about that? 
  [Yo] It is true that there are many stories about comrade 
Pak. But he is not free. He is serving a life sentence in 
prison. I have heard about his agonies through the news media, 
but I think it is a process for him to grope along the way of 
human liberation under the changed circumstances. It will be 
more clear when he, who is still a central committee member of 
the Sanomaeng, is set free and becomes a free man. 
  [Reporter] When will you form a party? Is it possible? 
  [Yo] We believe the time will be either the end of 1994 or 
the beginning of 1995. The Sanomaeng should be legalized before 
we start the party. Because we have been under concentrated 
attack by investigation agencies, we have maneuvered via both 
legal and illegal tactics (it is called simultaneous 
construction theory in their terms). But we will launch 
struggles for legalizing the Sanomaeng directly from now on. We 
plan to start full-scale open activities in the near future. 
Even though it is not known to the public, socialist power is 
building within the labor movement now. Labor union movements 
in South Korea have not yet conducted a political campaign. If 
labor unions can conduct a political campaign, they will rise to 
become a socialist power. We are building a party that is based 
on the solidarity of socialistic powers and labor unions. At 
the same time, the People's Political Union (Professor Oh Se 
Chol of Yonsei University is the head) openly proclaims that 
socialism is active. Many people, including some former members 
of the Sanomaeng released from prison, are involved in this 
organization. 
  [Reporter] If so, is the People's Politic Union a legal 
political organization that the Sanomaeng launched in advance? 
  [Yo] Absolutely not. We will just maintain a close 
relationship because we have same direction. 
  [Reporter] Funding will be needed to wage a full-scale 
struggle for legalization. How can you provide that? 
  [Yo] It is run with the help of some patrons around us and 
membership fees from employed comrades. Sometimes we collect 
several 10 million won by holding a supply drive when we plan a 
big event. However, that is not enough. After all, forming a 
political party is costly, isn't it? It is yet in the planning 
stage, but we plan to run businesses by making the most of our 
members. We concentrated on running seminars for mental 
arithmetic in the past, but we will concentrate on manufacturing 
businesses this time. Then, we can build the fund consistently. 
  [Reporter] Are there any plans for legalizing the Sanomaeng? 
  [Yo] The election for the local government system in 1995 
will be an important opportunity in our socialism movement let 
alone this administration. I think that the Kim Yong-sam 
administration will build the base for two-stage political 
reform by the revised election law. The socialist movement will 
be the first political challenge since the civilian government 
took office. What happens now will form the foundation of the 
Sanomaeng's future. We plan to ally with the progressive power 
and suggest `a combined meeting of labor unions and progressive 
organizations for the innovative local government system' and to 
respond with all our efforts. 
  [Reporter] What relationship do you have with the other 
socialist political factions? Do you want only the Sanomaeng 
legalized? 
  [Yo] For example, `international socialists', `short-term 
laborers' alliance', and `revolutionary socialist laborers' 
exist already as a socialist power. The government firmly 
defines these groups as illegal organizations. Eventually, the 
struggle for legalizing the Sanomaeng will achieve the freedom 
of ideology. We have to work together. South Korea is the only 
country that does not allow the socialists power on earth. 
These moves such as the revision of the National Security Plan 
law and the repeal of the National Security Law are optimistic 
signs. 
  [Reporter] Isn't it in vain if the government does not 
recognize it? 
  [Yo] If the government does not recognize us, we cannot 
legalize it with our power only. We plan to negotiate with them 
on the legalization. We can do it by responding according to 
the situation.

notes and 50 Pyas bank note, bearing the king lion motif, on 27 
March 1994. [passage omitted on description of notes] 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 1245 GMT on 3 Mar, in a similar 
report adds: "The currency announcement came amid widespread 
rumours that the 100 kyat bank-note, introduced in 1990 with the 
90 kyat note, were to be replaced. Introduction of the new 
bank-notes will have no direct impact on inflation as they would 
replace old notes as they were destroyed, a senior bank official 
said. 
  "The official put the volume of currency in circulation at 
about 52 billion kyats as of March 31, 1993, with an inflation 
rate of 31.6 percent. 
  "In the meantime the volume of foreign exchange certificates 
(FEC) introduced a year ago to help promote tourism, had reached 
15 million dollars, with an estimated 30 percent in the hands of 
the public, Win Tin said. While declining to give specific 
figures of Burma's present foreign exchange reserves, he said it 
was `very healthy' and that there was no cause for concern."]

  [Text] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said 
the British media made all sorts of false allegations against 
the Malaysian leadership because it wanted to undermine 
Malaysia's credibility in its efforts to solve world problems. 
They hoped that by giving a bad impression of the country's 
leadership, Malaysia's voice in the international arena would no 
longer be respected. 
  The prime minister said he could not determine their 
intention, but the fact that the attacks mounted by the 
newspapers against Malaysia and its leadership could have the 
effect of reducing people's trust against Malaysia. [sentence as 
heard] He said this after attending a dialogue session with 
federal officials in Kota Baharu, the capital of the east coast 
state of Kelantan. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that Malaysia must be 
economically strong to prevent the country from being indirectly 
colonized by big powers. He points out that though the country 
has achieved considerable progress since independence, it is 
still far away from the target set for Vision 2020. As such, 
all sectors must do their best to ensure political stability so 
that the country can continue to march forward for greater 
achievements. He said Malaysia is fortunate that it can now 
survive without aid from others.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Tues -- The National Automobile 
Manufacturing Industry Limited is confident the government's 
decision to deny new contracts to British firms will not 
influence its customers in the United Kingdom. Its public 
relations manager, Nik Kamariah Nik Abdul Rahman, said today 
Proton's [Malaysian car] involvement in the United Kingdom 
market was solely a business venture. 
  The Proton cars have received strong response in the country 
because of their quality and value coupled with the aggressive 
marketing strategy adopted by the distributor, Proton Cars (UK) 
Limited. She said Proton would countinue to support its 
distributor's commitment on services and warranty. 
  Proton has exported 70,491 cars to the United Kingdom since 
1989. The company expects to export 17,580 units this year. It 
was reported today Proton cars (UK) had told its customers and 
buyers not to be unduly concerned over the Malaysian 
Government's decision to stop awarding new contracts to British 
companies.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Tues -- Defense Minister Datuk Sri 
Najib Tun Razak says there is a need to boost the capabilities 
of the armed forces to ensure political stability and economic 
development. He said today the government had set aside funds to 
modernise the armed forces to deter any prospective aggressor. 
"With the armed forces' improved capabilities, an aggressor will 
think twice about testing our defence," he added. 
  Najib said this when interviewed on the TV3's inaugural 
Malaysia Hari Ini [Malaysia Today] morning talk show. He also 
said the government was reviewing the national defense policy to 
keep it in line with the changes and challenges facing the armed 
forces. He said the higher defense spending should not be seen 
as an attempt by Malaysia to join the arms race. However, this 
was to keep up with developments in defense technology to ensure 
the armed forces had modern equipment and for continuous 
economic development. 
  During the special programme, Najib also answered public 
enquiries and suggestions through the toll-free telephone lines. 
  To a caller's question, Najib said the armed forces did not 
plan to include nuclear arms as part of its modernization 
programme. There was no need for such weapons in the region 
since the end of the Cold War had removed superpower rivalry in 
the region, he explained. 
  To another question, Najib said Malaysian troops were safe 
in 
Bosnia despite the Serb forces' recent threat to retaliate 
against the air strike threat by NATO. NATO had threatened to 
carry out air strikes if the Serb forces did not pull back their 
heavy guns from the hills around Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Reports by Felix Soh] </F>
  [Text] The prospect of an arms race developing between 
Japan, India and China depended largely on whether the U.S. 
would continue to be engaged in the region, said Singapore 
Defence Minister Dr Yeo Ning Hong. He was responding to a 
question by Asian Airline and Aerospace, a publication produced 
during the Asian Aerospace 94 show which ended last week, about 
the perceived emergence of an arms race between the three 
countries. The minister said that an abrupt or significant U.S. 
withdrawal may lead to these countries feeling more insecure or 
wanting to fill the vacuum. 
  According to the International Institute for Strategic 
Studies, China has the world's largest armed forces with three 
million troops while India has 1.2 million. Compared with these 
two giants, Japan's armed forces of 238,000 is miniscule. 
"Either way, it will mean that they will build up their military 
capabilities," Dr Yeo pointed out. "And if any of them becomes 
assertive, the result will be tension and instability in the 
region." 
  He explained that the "restraining presence" of the U.S. 
meant that countries need not be as worried about their 
potential enemies and can focus their attention and resources on 
economic development rather than building up their military 
capabilities. 
  Asked about the region's two hot spots -- the Spratlys and 
the Korean Peninsula -- he said that the potential for conflict 
in the South China Sea would be greatly increased if oil and gas 
were discovered. 
  "However, so long as the countries involved are willing to 
abide by internationally accepted codes of conduct in resolving 
this territorial dispute, it was less likely that there will be 
open conflict in the region," he said. 
  On tension in the Korean Peninsula, he commented that an 
arms 
race could be triggered off in north-east Asia if Pyongyang 
developed a nuclear bomb. "Japan could feel so threatened that 
it proceeds to develop a nuclear capacity of its own," he said. 
Such a turn of events would in turn prompt China and the two 
Koreas to accelerate their military build-up. "An arms race in 
northeast Asia will create tensions that could destabilise the 
entire Asia-Pacific," he noted. 
  The minister said that because of the uncertainty in the 
region in the post-Cold War era, "security is something we 
cannot take for granted". He said: "Singapore believes that the 
best means to maintain peace and stability is to develop an 
understanding among the countries here as well as those 
countries which can make an impact on our security, such as the 
U.S., China, Russia, Australia and Japan." 
  This was why the Republic strongly supported the Asean 
Regional Forum (ARF) which provides the framework for 
multilateral discussions of security issues on a regular basis. 
It would also enhance the close defence relations and 
cooperation which had been built up over the years, he said. 
  Touching on Singapore's role in the discussions of security 
issues on a collective basis, he said that being small, it could 
not influence the course of events. "But by acting together with 
other Asean countries, we have a role to play in cooling down 
any potential conflict which may arise in the region."

  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, March 3 KYODO -- Cambodia's First 
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Thursday he has 
given up trying to achieve an accommodation with the Khmer Rouge 
faction through dialogue. Ranariddh, speaking to Japanese 
reporters ahead of a visit to Tokyo next week to attend an 
international meeting on aid to Cambodia, said he undertook two 
secret missions to Bangkok "to try to have a dialogue. But now 
finish," the Royalist Party leader said. 
  Saying economic reconstruction is now Cambodia's top 
priority, Ranariddh downplayed the threat posed by the Khmer 
Rouge group. He said the government's offer to allow the Khmer 
Rouge to take part in the government will be withdrawn if the 
faction continues its resistance. "If they continue to be 
unreasonable, my people will continue the way they continue 
today," he said. 
  Ranariddh spoke as Cambodian Army commanders reportedly 
announced plans to recapture the northern Khmer Rouge base of 
Anlong Veng within 10 days. Khmer Rouge guerrillas took it back 
at the end of last month. [passage omitted] 
  Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen will be 
attending 
the second meeting of the International Committee on 
Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) set for March 10 to 11 in 
Tokyo. He said Cambodia needs additional aid to help clear 
unexploded mines, estimated to number as many as 10 million 
throughout the country.

  [Excerpts] According to sources in Tokyo, in a message sent 
from Beijing, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk says that he 
will return to Phnom Penh on 8 April, six days before Cambodia's 
traditional new year, although he has to continue his medical 
treatment. After his arrival in Phnom Penh the king will 
organize a ceremony to mark the 90th anniversary of his late 
mother, Queen Sisowath Kosomak, to be held in the royal palace 
one day after his arrival. 
  In this message the king says that he plans to meet with 
Cambodian Government leaders and the Throne Council. Apart from 
this, the king will remain in Cambodia in order to receive 
credentials from various ambassadors, who were recently 
appointed, such as the envoy from Great Britain. 
  The king will also stay on to take part in the new year 
celebrations, a tradition of the Cambodian nation. Apart from 
this, the prince father will also receive an important guest. 
This is the state visit by the prime minister of Malaysia, who 
will shortly visit Cambodia. [passage omitted] 
  Before returning to Phnom Penh in early April, the king will 
leave Beijing for Pyongyang, North Korea, for a three- or 
four-day visit and then leave from there for Phnom Penh. 
  The king, however, says that Chinese doctors have asked him 
to return to Beijing in June to continue his medical treatment. 
The king notes that: "I am a lot better from the cancer in the 
bone marrow in my back." I am far from being cured as concerns 
the cancerous marrow bone in my back. [preceding sentence in 
English] 
  King Norodom Sihanouk specifies that he can no longer 
continue his writing or his other literary activities because "I 
have become an old man who is sick, weak, and very fragile." It 
is to be noted that King Norodom Sihanouk underlines the words 
very fragile [preceding two words in English]. 
  The essence of this message was excerpted and printed in the 
CAMBODIA DAILY BULLETIN published in Phnom Penh in three 
languages. This bulletin also reveals that a palace official in 
Phnom Penh affirmed on 28 February that the king plans to return 
to Phnom Penh on 8 April. This official, however, did not give 
a schedule of King Norodom Sihanouk's visit to Pyongyang. He 
only said that "it is a tradition for the king to travel to 
Pyongyang close to 15 April, a date which coincides with the 
birthday of Kim Il-song."

  [Excerpt] Khieu Rada, under secretary of state for trade, 
said that after the United States opened its door to Cambodia as 
one of the Most Favored Nations (MFN) early last month, many 
foreign investors have expressed interest in doing business in 
this country. Among them are some Hong Kong Chinese who have 
contacted us and said they wanted to set up garment factories 
for export. Their main market, of course, will be the lucrative 
and low-tax United States. 
  The under secretary of state went on: When the Hong Kong 
investors came to meet us, we were always glad to welcome them. 
The under secretary of state said that we need both local and 
foreign investors for Cambodia. We advised them to get ready to 
invest in the garment industry and we told them to make advance 
arrangements with American trading counterparts pending the 
signature of the agreement between the Cambodian and American 
sides, which will take place in the next two to three months. 
  The Hong Kong Chinese are not the only ones to have 
expressed 
the desire to invest in the garment sector. Investors from the 
PRC and from other countries also have expressed interest. Each 
garment factory, according to the investors, would require a 
large labor force numbering in the hundreds or thousands. So, 
it would help absorb the now mostly idle excess state-employed 
personnel, as well as provide employment for the general public. 
  The under secretary of state emphatically rejected remarks 
made by some administration officials who mistakenly feared 
economic colonization of our country by the United States 
following Cambodia's introduction into the Generalized System of 
Preference (GSP) and its acquisition of MFN status. He pointed 
out that in granting GSP and MFN recognition to economically 
weaker nations like Cambodia, the larger and stronger countries 
are the ones who assist the former by making many concessions to 
them, while the smaller and weaker countries will not be 
expected to return any favors. 
  In Cambodia's case, the United States will impose the lowest 
taxes on more than 4,000 types of products that could be 
imported from our country. As for goods from the United States, 
our government will be asked to levy taxes equal to but not 
higher than those imposed on goods imported from other 
countries, such as Japan or Singapore. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Indonesia has asked the UN Security Council to pay 
serious attention and not neglect its responsibility in 
Israeli-occupied Palestine territory following the recent 
massacre of more than 50 Palestinians. (Isa Slamet Sudarga), 
deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said 
Indonesia hopes the Security Council will not only end such 
atrocities against the Palestinians, but also make efforts to 
find a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the Middle East 
conflict. 
  Therefore, along with Palestine, Indonesia called on the 
Security Council to take concrete actions to ensure that Israel 
performs its duty to protect Palestinian citizens in accordance 
with the Geneva Convention. Indonesia also fully supported the 
resolution adopted by the Organization of Islamic Conference 
which called on the UN Security Council to discuss the massacre 
so as to end the Israeli oppression and safeguard the safety of 
Palestinians through the presence of international observers.

  [Text] Jakarta, March 4 (ANTARA) -- Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Siladjzic hoped that Indonesia in its capacity as chairman 
of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] would exert more political 
influence on the United Nations in an effort to create peace and 
sovereignty in the war-torn Bosnia. Bosnia hoped for Indonesia's 
full and ceaseless support as NAM chairman, he told the press 
here on Friday. Siladjizic, who arrived from Washington, said he 
also hoped that countries which had so far supported Bosnia in 
the UN to maintain its supports. 
  At Sukarno-Hatta Airport, the Bosnian leader was welcomed by 
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, Chief Executive Assistant to the 
NAM chairman NANA Sutresna, and NAM's roving ambassador for 
Europe, Akhmad Taher. He said that the future developments in 
Bosnia depended on the UN agreement and Bosnia was convinced 
that NAM could voice its supports and play its active roles in 
the UN. Bosnia will, meanwhile, make use of any conducive 
momentum by approaching Russia, he added. 
  Previously, the Indonesian Embassy [as received] in New York 
had been notified about the wish of the Bosnian prime minister 
to visit Indonesia. 
  He said that in his two-day visit, he will discuss with 
Indonesian side the latest developments about the Washington 
accord and the future steps to be taken by Bosnia. Siladjzic, 
who is former foreign minister of Bosnia, was in Washington DC 
for peace talks between Bosnia and Croatia. In the meeting, 
both sides agreed to form a framework for the establishment of a 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  They also discussed the possibility of Bosnian Serbs forming 
a confederation with the Republic of Croatia. The establishment 
of federation and confederation is expected to stop the 
aggression against Bosnia and give priority to a plan to 
reorganize the internal structure of the war-torn Bosnia. 
  On the possibility of forming a confederation with Serbia, 
Siladjzic said that it depends on the initiatives from some NAM 
members and several "friends" in the West, especially from the 
Government of Russia. "I will meet Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow to discuss the peace process and a 
possibility of inviting the Bosnian Serbs to the peace 
agreement," said Siladjzic who is going to visit Moscow mid of 
this month. [as received] He believes that Serbia is the one 
that must give territorial concession because Serbia is the 
aggressor of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Bosnian prime minister said that diplomatic ties between 
Bosnia and Indonesia will be established soon at the right time 
when some problems are solved.

  [Text] Solo, Central Java, March 4 (ANTARA) -- The 
government remains firm on its view that the Indonesian 
Sejahtera Workers Union (SBSI) is illegal and will never be a 
recognised organisation, Diponegoro Central Java Military 
Regional Commander Major General Suyono said here Thursday. 
"SBSI is an illegal organisation. If workers wish to forward 
complaints, they should do so through the SPSI," he said, 
referring to the country's only recognised labour organisation, 
the All-Indonesia Workers Union. 
  Suyono, speaking to reporters during a meeting with 
Tyfountex 
Co. Ltd. employees in Sukoharjo district, said workers should 
consult the legal SPSI in the event of any disputes. "If there 
is any dispute between you and your company, you may lodge your 
complaints through SPSI who should respond immediately," he 
urged the company's workforce who went on strike on February 11 
to protest against working conditions. Tyfountex, meanwhile, 
has not given the workers any assurance. 
  Suyono reminded employers to meet all regulations of 
workers' 
rights in order to improve productivity. "Employers should meet 
all the rights of the worker in accordance with regulations so 
that they can improve on their job performance." 
  During his visit, the military commander also stopped over 
at 
Batik Keris Co. Ltd., who similarly faced a strike a few days 
ago. Batik Keris director said the company had settled the 
dispute with its workers. "All our employees have gone back to 
their work," he said. The company employs some 25,000 workers.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Human rights activist Nuku Soleiman 
was sentenced to four years in jail yesterday fo defaming 
President Suharto. The Central Jakarta District Court found the 
30-year-old Nuku guilty of producing and distributing stickers 
insulting to President Suharto. The sentence was less than the 
maximum allowed by law and sought by government prosecutors. 
Nuku faced the sentencing alone since his lawyers have boycotted 
the trial in protest over the court's refusal ta allow them to 
call witnesses to testify on Nuku's behalf. 
  For his part, Nuku remained silent throughout as he 
continued 
his silent protest which began two sessions earlier, also over 
the court's refusal to hear the testimony of his witnesses. 
  Nuku, who chairs the Pijar Foundation human rights group, 
was 
arrested during a demonstration at the House of Representatives 
last November. Police claimed he was distributing stickers 
offensive to the president. 
  "This court finds Nuku Soleiman guilty of all charges and 
sentences him to four years in prison," said Presiding Judge 
Nurhayati. The panel of judges said they could find only one 
mitigating factor when passing the sentence, Nuku's relative 
youth. They cited several factors that worked against him, 
including the lack of respect he showed the court during the 
trial, two previous convictions, and no evidence of remorse. 
They also deplored the harsh language employed by Nuku during 
the trial. 
  The judges later asked Nuku whether or not he would appeal 
the sentence. The defendant, still maintaining his silence, 
walked up to the judges and presented a written statement which 
his close friends confirmed as a note claiming that he will 
appeal. 
  The courtroom was packed with the defendant's supporters, 
mostly clad in the green jacket of the National University, 
Nuku's almamater. They yelled at the judges and challenged them 
to pass a heavier sentence. Also present in the public gallery 
were opposition figures, including Ali Sadikin and Chris Siner 
Key Timu. Adnan Buyung Nasution, chairman of the Legal Aid 
Foundation, which organized Nuku's defense, was also present. 
  As Nuku was being escorted out of the courtroom, his 
supporters yelled encouragement and sang the patriotic song 
Padamu Negeri (For You the Nation). 
  Buyung later termed the verdict a tragedy for the nation 
because punishment was meted out to someone who merely acted out 
his constitutional right. "This shows that free impartial 
movement is no longer guaranteed, he said. He said that courts 
of law in Indonesia are controlled by the government and that 
judges could not be impartial when presiding over politically 
sensitive cases such as Nuku's. "Under such a suppressive 
atmosphere, it's difficult to find an idealistic judge. The 
judges had taken their stand against the defendant from the very 
beginning," he said. Buyung labeled this trial worse than the 
mid-1980s political trial of dissident leader Lt. Gen. (retired) 
H.R. Dharsono whom he helped defend. 
  Nuku's friends later distributed to reporters a five-page 
typed statement he crafted while in detention, which said he had 
made no attempt to defend himself because he did not believe in 
the impartiality of the court. "A strong and powerful force from 
outside the court has arranged the trial and the verdict has 
been rendered long before the trial began," said Nuku in the 
statement.

<F P=106> [26 February PASASON editorial: "Let Our Entire Army Strive </F>
To Fulfill National Defense Duty for 1994"] 
  [Text] Respected listeners: In the armywide conference of 
cadres for 1993-94, the participants discussed and profoundly 
studied national defense direction and duty for this year as 
presented by the National Defense Ministry. The guidelines 
derived from the conference are aimed at enabling Armed Forces 
of all units and localities to creatively adopt plans in a 
spirit of responsibility to be in conformity with their 
respective practical conditions and specific points with a view 
to guaranteeing fulfillment of the tasks of defending the 
country, maintaining public security, and building and 
consolidating their units and localities to be strong in all 
respects. The national defense direction and tasks for this year 
are as follows: 
  Continue to consolidate national defense and public security 
maintenance work in all respects and combine it with 
socioeconomic development work and expanding relations and 
cooperation with foreign countries; determinedly check and 
overcome all subversive and sabotage schemes and acts of bad 
elements to basically bring to the entire country a tranquil 
situation, political stability, and social order; pay attention 
to firmly consolidating, building, and strengthening Armed 
Forces in all respects by emphasizing improved quality of work 
in the political field while attaching importance to serving and 
raising the quality of combat work; and build the Armed Forces 
to be strong, maintain a revolutionary nature, and stick to 
rules and regulations on the march forward to becoming a modern, 
well-organized Army. 
  Another significant duty of the Army is to continue 
coordination with local administrations in building the grass 
roots to be firm and strong in all fields by building and 
combining the entire people's field position of national defense 
and public security work with rural development. Along with 
this, it is also necessary to continue to step up emulation 
campaigns in building all-around strong units and all-around 
leading party units. 
  The objectives are that all local units must strive to set 
up 
one or two model units; pay attention to organizing military 
training for combatants to enable them to achieve competence in 
combat tactics and strategy and gain experiences in using 
weapons available in their units; and enthusiastically and 
continually boost crop cultivation and livestock breeding 
movements in organizations, units, and localities in all 
seasons. Regarding this, first and foremost, attention must be 
paid to growing vegetables for their daily meals. In addition, 
attention must be paid to planting perennial fruit trees in 
order to build green units. An endeavor must be made also to 
create all favorable conditions as possible to plant 
goods-oriented crops to serve the requirements of the markets in 
order to gain more revenues for the units. Favorable conditions 
must also be created for promoting poultry and fish breeding. 
  To successfully fulfill the aforementioned tasks, first and 
foremost, party committees and command staffs at all levels must 
pay attention to educating and training all cadres and 
combatants to enable them to understand the glorious traditions 
of the nation, the Army, and their own units, and to profoundly 
understand the restructuring line of the party and duties of the 
Army as well as of their respective units and localities. All 
cadres and combatants must be educated and trained to maintain 
appropriate attitudes and raise to a higher level their spirit 
of political responsibility. Attention must be paid to building 
the contingents of cadres and party members with appropriate 
qualifications, competence, and experiences in organizing, 
leading, and commanding units; enhancing the unique solidarity 
in the ranks of party committees and command staffs as well as 
the solidarity between cadres and combatants and their 
solidarity with the multiethnic people; maintaining the Army's 
political way of living; and promoting and expanding good, 
positive points of units and localities. Each unit and locality 
must organize to regularly review its achievements won in 
implementing the duties in each period. They must also pay 
attention to learning good lessons from other units or 
localities. Simultaneously, they must be determined to check 
and settle their weak points and remaining problems in a timely 
manner in order to enable their units and localities to continue 
to enthusiastically carry out movements to fruitfully fulfill 
the national defense direction and tasks for this year.

  [Text] The Philippines yesterday condemned the massacre 
last Friday of Palestinian worshipers by an Israeli-American 
settler in the occupied territory. It called on Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization to continue their multilateral 
peace talks in Washington. 
  Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo announced this amid reports 
that three Arab delegations were suspending participation in the 
talks following the Hebron massacre, where a Jewish setler 
opened fire inside the Ibrahim mosque and killed at least 43 
Muslims and wounded many others. Romulo yesterday met with 
Palestinian Ambassador Musa Amer Odeh [as published], who asked 
the Philippine Government to formally condemn the massacre. 
Odeh sent a formal request to President Ramos through the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). 
  Odeh said Israel's "official terrorism" cannot continue if 
the United States and the United Nations or the whole 
international community would really want to stop it. He said 
countries may impose trade and economic sanctions on Israel 
through a UN resolution. 
  "But any despicable act should be condemned in no uncertain 
terms by everybody," Romulo said, in response to reports that 
the UN was being asked to issue a resolution condemning the 
massacre. Romulo said the Philippines also welcomes announcement 
by Israel that it would take steps to disarm some 120,000 Jewish 
settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said the DFA is in 
a "unique position" as it can coordinate with the Palestinian 
and Israeli ambassadors in Manila to encourage the continuation 
of peace talks among parties concerned. 
  Odeh described the crime against Palestinians by the Jewish 
settler as "a time bomb which may explode any minute," and that 
this could endanger the ongoing peace initiatives between two 
peoples. He said that for years the settlers have been allowed 
by Israel to carry weapons to terrorize the Palestinians. Since 
1967, this issue has been addressed several times by the UN 
Security Council in numerous resolutions which considered 
settlements as illegal and have to be dismantled. He told Romulo 
that is is about time that security needs of Palestinians be 
addressed by every country.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Foreign Secretary Roberto 
Romulo yesterday said that economic cooperation is the main item 
on the agenda of the Philippine-Vietnam consultations to be held 
in Manila on 10 March. Romulo said the panels will discuss "how 
the Philippines will be able to support Vietnam go into a 
free-market system from a centrally planned economy." 
  Romulo said the Philippines has a lot of agriculturists and 
economics professors and practitioners. Under a "trilateral 
cooperation" arrangement, they can provide expertise to 
developing countries funded by a developed country like Japan. 
Romulo said such an arrangement is already in effect in Cambodia 
where a number of Filipino agriculturists are helping Cambodians 
under a program funded by Japan. 
  Other areas where Filipinos could lend expertise are 
banking, 
business management, fishing, and ceramics manufacturing. 
Another area the Filipinos are good at is implementation of 
official development assistance, Romulo said. Romulo said 
Vietnam, with more than 70 million people, is a rich market for 
the Philippines once the purchasing power of its population goes 
up. [passage omitted] 
  The 10 March bilateral consultation precedes President 
Ramos' 
state visit to Vietnam tentatively scheduled on 28 to 31 March.

  [Excerpts] Cotabato City -- The government and the Moro 
National Liberation Front (MNLF) peace panels have created here 
a joint cease fire sub-committee to monitor possible violation 
of the MNLF-GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] 
truce in Maguindanao where the military was earlier accused of 
"partisan" role. 
  Army Col. Rudolfo Lorayes, 603rd Infantry Brigade chief, was 
named as chairman with Capt. Filemon Saria and Sgt. Filemon Rowe 
as members representing the government in the Maguindanao Joint 
Cease Fire Subcommittee (MJCS). The MNLF counterparts are rebel 
Colonel Hamid Piang, chairman, Major Abas Kalipha and Mustapha 
Abdulwahab, members. 
  The MJCS, housed at the provincial capitol complex in Sultan 
Kudarat town, was formed on 21 February, two days after the 
MNLF-GRP main cease fire committee came here to probe the 
renewed armed rift between Moro rebels and logging firm guards 
in Maguindanao. The planned probe, however, has been stalled due 
to the non- arrival here of some Indonesian Embassy officials 
from Manila to represent the Organization of Islamic Conference 
in the probe, local MNLF sources said. 
  It was not known whether the MJCS will be the one to pursue 
the stalled probe as members of the GRP-MNLF main joint cease 
fire committees had returned to Zamboanga after the MJCS was 
formed. 
  The probe was sought by MNLF Secretary-General Muslimen 
Sema, 
who had expressed alarm over the renewed rift between Moro 
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels and guards of the 
Cotabato Timberland Company, Inc. (CTCI) in Buldon and Barira 
towns. 
  The skirmishes recurred when MILF rebels reportedly raided 
last 27 January three CTCI checkpoints and an Army detachment in 
Barira town, killing a CTCI guard and wounding another. [passage 
omitted] 
  The MILF had accused the military of being "partisan" with 
the CTCI in the rift, which stemmed from the MILF's objection to 
the CTCl's alleged intrusion into MILF lairs and watershed areas 
in Buldon and Barira towns. The military denied the accusation, 
saying its presence in the area was for "peace keeping" as 
sought by the people there. 
  The CTCI and the MILF had recently forged a peace truce with 
the intercession of some Muslim leaders. But Murad said the 
rift will remain until the CTCI leaves Maguindanao. Maguindanao 
Governor Norodin Matalan has also demanded the cancellation of 
the CTCI's timber License Agreement and its ejection from his 
province.

  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Somkhuan Saenphattharanet, 
deputy spokesman of the Royal Thai Army, met with reporters over 
the Sieng Lapresse--spokesman of the Information Ministry of the 
Phnom Penh government, Cambodia--interview with AP. Lapresse 
said that Khmer Rouge [KR] forces delivered logs to Thailand for 
sale to earn money for use in their fight against the Cambodian 
Government and they also use Thai territory as a base for their 
operations. 
  Lt.Col. Somkhuan said such a statement is groundless and 
affects the image of Thailand. If one considers the issue 
thoughtfully, it is obvious that the present Thai Government has 
a clear policy to maintain good relations with Cambodia. One 
indication is the visit to Cambodia and Phnom Penh by Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai in January this year. Another indication 
is that the Thai Government has provided Cambodia with 
assistance for rehabilitating the country in various fields. 
These are factors that assure very well the sincerity of 
Thailand. All this is because the Thai Government wishes to see 
peace established as soon as poosible in this region and if 
fighting continues in Cambodia, Thailand will suffer also.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday left for 
Manila, confirming that he would seek the Philippine 
government's view on Burma's attendance of an ASEAN meeting and 
also ways of enhancing trade between Thailand and the 
Philippines. Speaking to reporters shortly before his departure, 
Squadron Leader Prasong expressed confidence that the 
Philippines would have no objections to the idea of inviting 
Burma to the meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok in 
July. 
  Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia have affirmed that they 
would not object to Thailand extending an informal invitation in 
its capacity as host of the meeting. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Surin Phitsuwan is due to visit Brunei soon to sound out the 
opinion of the remaining ASEAN member state. But ASEAN officials 
have made clear that a formal invitation would require more 
progress in Burma and more discussion among ASEAN members. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong said he would also seek Manila's 
views on what will be the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional 
Forum -- planned for the six ASEAN states, their seven dialogue 
partners and five others, including China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos 
and Papua New Guinea. 
  Bilaterally, Sqn Ldr Prasong said he would discuss ways of 
enhancing economic relations during talks with Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos. Sqn Ldr Prasong noted that the current 
volume of trade was relatively small -- about 8,000 million 
baht. He suggested that counter-trade might be one way of 
stepping up this activity. Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday cochaired 
the first meeting of the Joint Commission for bilateral 
cooperation in trade, investment, agriculture, science and 
technology and tourism. He is scheduled to return from Manila 
tonight.

  [Text] Israel will send experts to help the Thai 
government solve the water crisis, Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday. Speaking about his 
recent trip to Israel, Suphachai said he had met with a water 
management consultancy which had agreed to dispatch a specialist 
team to find solutions to the worsening water shortage in 
Thailand. 
  He said that the company was the same one which came to 
Thailand 7-8 years ago. But its operations stopped when the 
World Bank withdrew financial support for the programme. 
Suphachai said he also asked the Israeli government to help 
Thailand in agriculture, especially technology on planting crops 
in salty areas. "I proposed that each project should be separate 
from others. For example, the Chao Phya River project is one 
project and the Nan River another," he said. 
  Supachai said the cost of Israel's assistance would be based 
on a flexible credit system. "It is likely there will be trade 
between the two countries in the future," he said. Supachai also 
said he had discussed increasing exports to Israel since "The 
private sector in Israel is also interested in the proposed 
cooperation," he said.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in 
his capacity as chairman of the International Competitiveness 
Enhancing Committee, disclosed that during its meeting yesterday 
the committee reviewed the first chapter of the Industry 
Ministry's white paper on Thailand's competitors and their trade 
and marketing strategies. 
  Suphachai quoted the white paper as saying that China, 
Indonesia, Mexico, and Korea are Thailand's major trade 
competitors. Thailand has not yet lost its market share to these 
countries, however, but certainly will in the future if it 
remains idle and makes no further improvement. 
  The meeting also discussed potential markets for Thai 
products and Thailand's dominance in different markets. 
  Suphachai talked about his recent visit to Israel and 
several 
issues that were discussed, particularly bilateral cooperation 
in third country markets. At present, Israel is the only 
country which has received trade privileges from the United 
States, the European Union, and NAFTA. Suphachai said: "Israel 
can send its goods to these markets without having to comply 
with the quota system or facing tax barriers. For this reason, 
Thailand will try to send its goods to those markets through 
Israel. By so doing, the prices of Thai exports will have to be 
increased by 35 percent."

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak 
reiterated the potential of Thailand in trade and investment 
competition as well as that of the Indochinese countries. He 
said that Thailand has made progress and enjoyed a 30 percent 
increase in its trade surplus. 
  Speaking about the trend of expanded foreign investment into 
the Indochinese market, Suphachai said this is a mechanism of 
competition in trade, but the Thai market is still attractive to 
investors. Moreover, the deputy minister notes that Thailand 
still needs to improve its trade and investment system in order 
to be able to compete with other rivals in the future. 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] In my opinion, among the ASEAN 
countries last year, Thailand had a trade surplus with ASEAN 
countries for the first time. It had never happened before. You 
cannot say we suffer disadvantages with others in ASEAN. It is 
impossible. Our export of goods to ASEAN countries increased by 
30 percent last year. That was the first such time in history, 
and we also enjoyed a trade surplus. It is not the other way 
round, I believe. We asked a number of companies why they 
transferred their investment into Indochina or China. Is it 
because our country is not attractive or because of the 
appearance of new markets? Most of them said it is because they 
have to compete with other companies in the Chinese market, not 
because our market is not competitive enough. They still 
continue to invest in our country. Because other companies have 
shifted their competition to China or Indochina, they therefore 
have to follow suit. We have to consider these points 
carefully. Our expansion of exports is second to none. [end

  [Text] Phisit Li-atham, director of the Bank of Thailand 
[BOT] Governor's Office, has said that the increase in the 
country's 1993 total exports exceeded the target. The increase 
in the fourth quarter, in particular, was 18.8 percent, compared 
to an average of 13.1 percent for the whole year. The total 
value of 1993 exports was 922 billion baht. He attributed the 
rise to the economic recovery of Thailand's trading partners, 
especially the United States; the removal of Thailand from the 
U.S. Priority Foreign Country (PFC) watchlist; and the 
appreciation of the yen. 
  Phisit revealed that the total value of the country's 1993 
imports was 1.143 trillion baht, an increase of 12 percent over 
the previous year. The value of oil imports increased slightly 
due to the fall in the price of crude oil. The value of non- 
petroleum imports was 1.0758 trillion baht, an increase of 12 
percent. The target had been 11.6 percent. Meanwhile, the 
current account balance suffered a deficit of 2.030 trillion 
baht by the middle of 1993, or approximately 6.8 percent of GDP. 
The real deficit at year's end, however, was only 1.710 
trillion baht -- only 5.5 percent of GDP -- 30 billion below the 
anticipated figure. 
  Phisit said: "The increase in exports, coupled with the 
reduced current account balance deficit, might result in the 
readjustment of the 1993 economic growth rate and the prediction 
for this year." 
  Phisit noted that the influx of capital funds was very high. 
In particular, investment capital in the stock market rose seven 
to eight times, from 14.104 billion baht in 1992 to 118.192 
billion baht in 1993. Foreigners' baht bank accounts amounted 
to 109.365 billion baht, up from only 55.275 billion baht the 
previous year. The year 1993 saw Thai private firms selling as 
much as 50.579 billion baht in debentures to mobilize foreign 
capital, up from the previous year's figure of 2.592 billion 
baht. 
  It was reported that the 7.5 percent economic growth rate 
calculated for 1993 has to be adjusted to 8.1 or 8.2 percent 
because of the increase in exports and the decline in the 
current account imbalance.

  [Text] Key opposition leaders suspect "political 
intimidation" aimed at silencing them as the reason for the bomb 
attack on the home of Social Action Party secretary-general 
Bunphan Khaewatthana early yesterday. The group reached their 
conclusion at a luncheon meeting at Princess Hotel after a hand 
grenade was lobbed into the home of the former public health 
minister off Wiphawadi-Rangsit Highway shortly before 2 a.m. 
  But the allegation was immediately rejected by Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai who said the Government was not involved. 
"I really don't know how this happened, but it is definitely not 
what the Opposition said," he said. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said: "This 
Government respects the basic right of people to criticise its 
performance," he said. "We can live with those with different 
opinions because our society is an open one. And we can use the 
same right to argue and defend ourselves. "There is no need for 
this government to resort to illegal means or violence. That's 
not the nature of this government or politicians in this 
government." 
  Yesterday's meeting was attended by Opposition and Chat Thai 
leader Praman Adireksan, Chat Phattana [CPP] leader Chatchai 
Chunhawan, SAP [Social Action Party] leader Montri Phongphanit, 
Ratsadon leader Chaipak Siriwat, Chat Thai deputy leader Sano 
Thianthong, CPP secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan, SAP deputy 
leader Suwit Khunkitti and SAP secretary-general Chaloem 
Yubamrung. 
  Mr Montri, the nephew of Mr Bunphan and a resident of the 
same compound in Soi Panni, said he was confident the bomb 
attack was intended more as intimidation than actually hurting 
anyone. He said he had recently been pointing out the 
Government's shortcomings to people during the city and district 
council election campaign. "So this is apparently aimed at 
preventing the Opposition from telling the people the truth," he 
said. "I have thought it over and I cannot see why anyone would 
ever want to hurt Mr Bunphan. We finally concluded it was an 
act of intimidation. "But I don't know who could be behind this 
act because we don't have any personal problems with anyone." 
  Mr Montri said he respected Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. 
"By 
nature, we are political enemies. We criticise the Government 
because we want it to work and it must listen to us. I am 
really sorry. Anyone who sees what happened will know how 
violent it was." The politician said he and other Opposition 
leaders would not seek extra protection during the remaining 
campaign period, but would continue to inform the people of the 
problems in the Government. 
  Pol Capt [Police Captain] Chaloem said he did not think 
police would be able to arrest anyone in connection with the 
attack. "It's just intimidation and only those who were behind 
it know who the perpetrators are," he said. "This kind of thing 
never happens to people in the Government but is frequent with 
Opposition members." Pol Capt Chaloem later told the BANGKOK 
POST at Mr Montri's home a police officer who is a younger 
brother of a senior official with the Prime Minister's Office 
and the bodyguard of a Democrat minister might be responsible 
for the attack because of Mr Montri's rude criticisms of Prime 
Minister Chuan during political activities. 
  SAP deputy leader Dusit Sophitcha, in a separate interview, 
said the bomb attack was the work of "a third hand" to distract 
the public attention from conflicts within the coalition. 
  Mr Aphisit said it was the duty of the police to find who 
were behind the attack and the Opposition should provide 
evidence if they can help investigators locate the culprits. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasthian called on the 
public to treat the Government fairly over the incident.

  [Text] A royal decree has been issued to allow aliens to 
work in the fishing industry to ease labour shortages, Deputy 
Labour and Social Welfare Minister Soemsak Karun said. He said 
the Government had also issued an order specifying steps and 
regulations in granting bail to foreigners who illegally enter 
Thailand to work in the fishing industry. The amount of bail 
has been reduced from 50,000 baht to 5,000 baht. 
  A number of Burmese have been hired to work in fishing 
industry, mining and construction. But most of them are illegal 
immigrants. 
  Mr Soemsak's remarks were made during the opening of a 
two-day seminar called "Problems and Ways to Solve the Labour 
Problem and Development in the Five Southernmost Provinces." 
The seminar ends today. 
  The seminar, attended by state and private officials at a 
meeting room of Yala Rama Hotel in Muang District, aims to find 
solutions to labour problems in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, 
Songkhla, and Satun. 
  The deputy labour minister said the Government and other 
state agencies concerned would try to upgrade the skills of Thai 
workers so that they could gain higher income.

  [Summary] Visiting Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong 
held a news conference in Hanoi on the evening of 3 March. At 
the conference, "Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong gave a briefing of 
the meetings with Vietnamese leaders at which both sides 
informed each other about the current situation of their 
country, exchanged views on issues necessary for promoting 
friendly relations and mutual understanding, and discussed 
economic, investment, and trade cooperation between Vietnam and 
Singapore in the period to come." 
  In response to a BANGKOK POST reporter's question regarding 
ASEAN membership for Vietnam, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said: 
  [Goh Chok Tong] Singapore supports Vietnam joining 
ASEAN, but it should be done at the appropriate time. When that 
will happen depends on how Vietnam can contribute to the 
activities and affairs of ASEAN. I suggest that Vietnam study 
these programs. Vietnam is presently an observer of ASEAN, and 
its membership in ASEAN is only a matter of time. ASEAN opens 
its door to Vietnam, and only Vietnam can decide when to 
join. 
  Answering a reporter of the Voice of Vietnam Radio who asked 
about the Vietnam-Singapore relations after the lifting of the 
U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, he said: 
  [Goh Chok Tong] At the moment, Singapore is Vietnam's 
largest trading partner, and the eighth largest investor. With 
the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo, we believe more American 
investment will come to Vietnam, not immediately, but maybe in a 
few years. Relations between Vietnam and Singapore have a bright 
future, though they only started three years ago. It was a 
short time, but I can affirm that our relations are excellent. 
Vietnam has sent many missions to Singapore to study our 
experience. I believe that business relations between the 
United States and Vietnam will also develop very well. 
  Asked by a NHAN DAN reporter for his impression on his first 
visit to Vietnam, he said: 
  [Goh Chok Tong] The visit to Vietnam reminds me of 
Singapore 30 years ago. I believe that Vietnam has tremendous 
potential for economic development. Singapore's investment in 
Vietnam can only develop if Vietnam achieves political stability 
and economic development. I believe that in the coming period, 
Vietnam's economy will develop strongly.

  [Text] Comprehensive development has taken place in 
relations between Vietnam and the ASEAN member countries. Trade 
and economic ties between Vietnam and ASEAN countries have 
rapidly increased. In 1992, two-way trade between Vietnam and 
the Indonesia reached $220 million. It was $158 million with 
Thailand, $100 million with Malaysia, $1.2 billion with 
Singapore, and $50 million with the Philippines. 
  By the end of 1993, about 100 projects for ASEAN countries 
with invested capital of hundreds of millions of dollar were 
licensed in Vietnam. ASEAN investment in Vietnam has increased 
10 times as against 1990, now accounting for 10 percent of the 
total foreign investment in Vietnam. More than 30 agreements on 
economic, scientific and technical, trade, payment, credit, 
aviation, and navigation have been signed between ASEAN 
countries and Vietnam. 
  In late July last year, the State Committee for Foreign 
Investment of Vietnam signed an agreement of cooperation with a 
prime company of Brunei which will see the latter invests in 
major projects in Vietnam. In late 1991 and early 1992, the 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN 
member countries. This helped the region to have a better 
understanding about the current reform in this country. 
  In visiting Vietnam, all leaders of ASEAN member countries 
demonstrated sympathy with the problems and difficulties Vietnam 
has been confronting, and promised to share experiences with the 
Vietnamese in national development. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai of Thailand is committed to 
create favorable conditions for further multi-sided cooperation 
between Vietnam and his country. President Fidel Ramos of the 
Philippines has assured Vietnamese National Assembly chairman 
Nong Duc Manh that the Philippines has always been Vietnam's 
friend, and hoped that bilateral ties would be further 
developed. It is the common voice of leaders and people of 
ASEAN member countries. 
  Most recently, during his visit to Vietnam, the ASEAN 
secretary general, Mr. Ajit Singh, informed Vietnam of the 
decision by ASEAN Secretariat to allow Vietnam to participate 
and observe in various programs in science, technology, 
environment, culture, information, public health, tourism, and 
development sources. Mr. Ajit Singh said the secretariat will 
send senior officials to Vietnam to exchange views on concrete 
issues of ASEAN's concern. 
  These developments show how much bilateral and multi-sided 
cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries has been 
increasing. At the recent foreign ministerial conference held 
in Singapore by ASEAN, ASEAN countries appreciated Vietnam's 
achievements in its renovation process, and welcomed Vietnam's 
participation in a forum on regional security. Relations 
between Vietnam and ASEAN has created a new atmosphere in 
Southeast Asia. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed once declared that 
he would be glad to contribute to national reconstruction and 
economic development in Indochina, with the confidence that 
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia would be stable and developed. It 
would contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the 
region.

beginning a visit to Vietnam as a guest of Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. This is the first visit to Vietnam by the British 
princess, which will help promote relations between Vietnam and 
Great Britain. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam gave 
a banquet in honor of the British princess. The princess 
sponsors many charity and humanitarian organizations in Great 
Britain. She visited and conducted many humanitarian activities 
in Third World countries in Africa, in the Middle East, Latin 
America, and Asia. In June 1987, she was promoted to royal 
princess by the Queen. 
  Vietnam and Britain have a long-standing relationship. The 
visit to the United Kingdom in June and July last year by 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet opened up a new stage in 
cooperative ties. When chairing the European Community, Great 
Britain made an active contribution to promoting trade relations 
between the EC and Vietnam. Now more and more British 
organizations are doing business in Vietnam, including Oil Giant 
BP. During Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to the United 
Kingdom, Prime Minister John Major committed to grant Vietnam

  [Text] HANOI, March 4 (AFP) -- Vietnam has warned a Roman 
Catholic bishop to stop his "illegal activities" and step down 
from a senior church post in Ho Chi Minh City as his appointment 
was not approved by the government, a report said Friday. The Ho 
Chi Minh City municipal government issued a statement saying 
that Huynh Van Nghi's appointment as a supervising bishop was 
"unilateral, improper and without consultation with the 
Vietnamese government." 
  Vietnam has rejected Nghi's appointment to the supervisory 
post, saying he should be given the more senior position of 
deputy and successor to the southern city's ailing archibishop 
in place of another priest who is a nephew of a former South 
Vietnamese president. City officials have denounced what they 
called "a Vatican plot" to have Bishop Nguyen Van Thuan, the 
nephew of former president Ngo Dinh Diem, become the next 
archbishop of Ho Chi Minh City in place of Nghi. The row has 
been at the centre of tensions between Hanoi and the Vatican 
over the appointment of priests to top posts, as the government 
here has insisted that it has the right to veto any selections. 
  Despite a warning last year to stop acting as supervising 
bishop, Nghi had continued in the job, prompting the city's 
People's Committee to call in the priest "to point out to him 
his infringement," the statement said. "The laws cannot be 
continuously ignored," the statement said, according to a report 
in the Saigon Giai Phong newspaper. 
  Thuan was originally appointed deputy archbishop before the 
communists took over the then Saigon in 1975. He was not allowed 
to take up the post and has been in exile in Rome since 1992. 
The Vatican however is insisting that Thuan should eventually 
take over from the octogenarian Archbishop Nguyen Van Thuan, who 
is in poor health. 
  In an interview with a Catholic newspaper published this 
week, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said the dispute with the 
Vatican centred on Vietnam's "national sovereignty" and ruled 
out a compromise on the choice of clergy. Kiet also defended his 
insistence that priests join a government umbrella organisation 
for social groups and religions, saying the authorities had the 
right to prevent religious problems arising. 
  The Church's development here under French colonial rule and 
Pope John Paul II's stand against communism have fuelled 
government suspicions of Catholics, who number around seven 
million people, or 10 percent of the population. Vatican 
officials have accused Vietnam of trying to turn Asia's second 
largest Catholic community after the Philippines into a 
state-sponsored church outside of the control of the normal 
church hierachy. 
  Protests by Buddhists in several cities have added to 
government concerns that a relaxation of controls on religion in 
recent years may lead to social unrest.

we will be able to see more clearly that the entire 
revolutionary line of our party faithfully reflects the 
Marxist-Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh Thought, the law of 
evolution of history, and the desire of the laboring people and 
all the oppressed people. That is why we must resolve to 
struggle against all distorting allegations and must properly 
apply and develop the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh 
Thought under the new situation in Vietnam. 
  2. Our party is the party of the working class. It 
faithfully represents the interest of the working class, the 
laboring people, and the nation as a whole. 
  3. Far from being abstract notions, the ideas of liberating 
the nation, liberating the classes, and making the people 
masters of their own country have been translated into life by 
our party in a very copious and vivid fashion. This has brought 
about realistic benefits for the people such as making peasants 
the owners of the pieces of land which they till, workers the 
owners of the factories in which they work, and the laboring 
people the owners of their means of production. We have 
encouraged the people to enrich themselves legally along with 
efforts to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty, carry out the 
motto of building a powerful country and a prosperous people, 
and ensure the all-people great unity bloc. 
  The resolution of the mid-term national party conference and 
other resolutions of the Seventh Party Central Committee's 
plenums have been institutionalized into laws and substantive 
policies. These are essential issues which the comrade general 
secretary asked the military delegates to firmly grasp when they 
study to fully understand the resolution of the midterm national 
party conference. 
  Comrade Do Muoi went on by pointing out successes scored by 
our country over the past a little more than two years in 
implementing the renovation policy set forth by the Seventh 
Party Congress. He also emphasized two essential points needed 
for socioeconomic development in our country: 
  1. We must effect a change in the economic structure, 
redistribute our work force, and socialize our production 
process intensively and extensively in order to mobilize to the 
fullest all social resources for development. This is to create 
a groundwork for steady development with high results for the 
entire national economy. 
  2. Industrialization must be linked with modernization by 
fundamentally carrying out gradual technological renovation, by 
seizing opportunities to shorten our development process, and by 
shaping spearhead movements to acquire the high standards of 
science and technology in the world. 
  At this conference, the comrade general secretary cited the 
many great achievements scored by the armed forces. He said 
that they have firmly defended the fatherland while effectively 
engaging in economic construction. Together with the entire 
party and people, they have helped foil all the peaceful 
evolution strategy-related schemes of hostile forces. 
  Touching on the duty of the armed forces toward the cause of 
building and defending the fatherland in the period ahead, 
Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi said: 
  Various party organizations and command echelons must 
concentrate on making the armed forces strong politically, 
ideologically, and organizationally. These things can be used 
as a foundation to increase integrated qualities and militancy. 
We must firmly grasp the enemies' schemes, together with the 
people in various localities, to maintain the initiative in 
defense under all circumstances. We must continue to step up 
building an all-people national defense and must effect a 
profound change in the thinking of each party cadre and member 
and of the people regarding the enemies' schemes in order to 
defend the fatherland and safeguard our party, state, and 
regime. We must ensure technical equipment for the armed forces 
and must increase party leadership and state management over the 
cause of national defense and security. 
  In the period ahead, we must carry out the system of 
leadership by the party and operational management by the state 
in a more close-knit and proper fashion. Various party 
committees and the party-youth union cadre affairs sections of 
various state organs must clearly realize their functions and 
duty to provide leadership and guidance in the field of national 
defense and security. 
  Various government ministries and sectors must clearly 
reaffirm and satisfactorily carry out their state management 
functions in terms of national defense and security. 
  The Ministries of National Defense and Interior must clearly 
reafirm their state management functions. They must act as an 
advisory body for the party and the state while directly 
exercising their state management functions in accordance with 
their assigned duty and powers.

  [Text] The all-army midterm conference of party 
organizations was solemnly opened in Hanoi today, 1 March. 
  In attendance were Comrade Ha Dang, member of the party 
Central Committee and head of the party Central Committee's 
Ideology and Culture Department; Comrade Nguyen Van An, member 
of the party Central Committee and deputy head of the party 
Central Committee's Organization Department; Comrade Phan Dien, 
member of the party Central Committee and director of the office 
of the party Central Committee; Comrade Nguyen Thi Xuan My, 
member of the party Central Committee and deputy head of the 
party Central Committee's Inspection Department; and 183 
delegates from various party organizations in the enitre armed 
forces. 
  Also present were representatives of various press agencies, 
radio and television stations inside and outside the armed 
forces, and specialists from certain party Central Committee 
organs. 
  After the national anthem was played, Senior General Doan 
Khue, member of the Political Bureau and deputy secretary of the 
party Central Committee's Military Commission, and minister of 
national defense, delivered an opening speech. 
  [Begin Doan Khue recording] Dear the meeting presidium: In 
compliance with the party statute and a party Central Committee 
Secretariat directive, the all-army midterm conference of party 
organizations is due to open today. The conference will be in 
session for four days, from 1-4 March 1994. 
  Although it is not a congress, the all-army midterm 
conference of party organizations is very important as it is 
designed to thoroughly study the resolution of the midterm 
national party congress, review efforts to provide guidance for 
the implementation of the national defense tasks over the past 
two and a half years, and determine the course of action, tasks, 
and an action program for the next two years -- 1994 and 1995 -- 
to, together with the entire people, implement the party 
congress resolutions successfully and move the country's 
renovation process toward new, greater successes. [end recording] 
  Afterward, on behalf of the party Central Committee's 
Military Commission, Comrade Doan Khue delivered a political 
report with some suggestions. He asked the conference to 
concentrate on thoroughly studying the party Central Committee's 
political report at the midterm national party congress. His 
report contains two parts with the first part evaluating the 
implementation of the Seventh Party Congress resolution and the 
second part discussing the orientations, tasks, and targets for 
the remaining period of the term of office of the Seventh Party 
Central Committee. 
  In the first part, after outlining the international and 
domestic situations, Comrade Doan Khue pointed out three major 
achievements that consist of: 
  1. Having overcome by an important step the socioeconomic 
crisis. 
  2. Having been able to continue to maintain and 
consolidate political stability. 
  3. Having broadened foreign relations, improved the 
prestige and position of our country in the world, and created 
favorable international environment for the cause of national 
construction and defense. Our achievements scored in the 
renovation process have further generated the people's elation 
and confidence in the party leadership and created more strength 
and stature for our national revolution to continue to make 
headway. 
  As for weaknesses and resulting problems, after pointing out 
the weaknesses in the economic, cultural, and social domains, 
his report also mentions a number of weaknesses directly related 
to national defense tasks. For instance: Although political 
stability has been firmly maintained, there still exist numerous 
complex factors we cannot ignore. Many party and state 
organizations have failed to build themselves into clean and 
steadfast organizations. Political security has not been firmly 
maintained, and public order and safety have not been guaranteed. 
  Judging from advantages and difficulties, Comrade Doan 
Khue's 
political report arrives at an important conclusion that 
although there still exist numerous weaknesses to be overcome, 
those important achievements scored have been, and are creating 
premises with which to shift the country to a new stage of 
development -- the stage in which we move toward national 
industrialization and modernization. These premises involve a 
series of factors, both strength and stature, both material and 
spiritual needs, and those economic, political, social, and 
cultural factors at home and abroad. These are a particularly 
important issue and also a new, striking point of the situation, 
and a development of the policy set forth by the Seventh Party 
Congress. 
  Regarding the orientations, tasks, and targets for the 
remaining period of the term of office of the Seventh Party 
Central Committee, after discussing great challenges and 
opportunities for the entire party, people, and armed forces, 
Comrade Doan Khue pointed out the overall targets that call for 
motivating the entire party, people, and armed forces to be of 
the same heart and mind, to exert their extraordinary effort to 
uphold their sense of independence, sovereignty, and self 
reliance, to broaden international cooperation, to practice the 
motto of industry, thrift, integrity, righteousness, public 
dedication, and detachment, to exploit advantages, dispel 
dangers, overcome ordeals, successfully achieve the overall 
targets already set, and accelerate the pace of achieving those 
targets set forth in the strategy for economic stabilization and 
development until the year 2000 in a bid to build a propserous 
people and an equal and civilized society. 
  To achieve these targets, his politial report points out 
eight essential tasks for the period ahead as follows: 
  -- effecting a change in the economic structure toward 
industrialization and modernization. 
  -- consistently carrying out the policy on multisectoral 
economic development. 
  -- uniformly building a market mechanism under the state 
management along the socialist path. 
  -- taking good care of cultural and social issues. 
  -- strengthening national defense and security. 
  -- continuing to broaden foreign economic relations. 
  -- building a law-govering Vietnamese state of the people, 
by the people, and for the people. 
  -- carrying out party renovation and rectification. 
  Dealing with the task of strengthening national defense and 
security, Comrade Doan Khue said: 
  [Begin Doan Khue recording] Against a situation where the 
enemy force is conspiring to intensify their sabotage activities 
on a large scale, we must attach importance to national defense 
and security and must satisfactorily perform our duty of 
defending our fatherland and our national independence, 
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and firmly maintaining 
political and social stability and the course of socialist 
development. 
  We must undertake a universal, all-out, and long-term 
struggle in all fields of activity to foil the schemes and 
actions of hostile forces in their peaceful evolution strategy 
and their rebellious and subversive attempts. [end recording] 
  The all-army midterm conference of party organizations will 
continue its discussions designed to thoroughly understand those 
essential issues in the political report of the midterm national 
party conference. 
  The conference will continue in session until 4 March.

<F P=106> [First of three installments of an article by Political </F>
Bureau member Vu Oanh: "Great National Unity in the New 
Situation and Tasks"] 
  [Text] On 17 November 1993, the Political Bureau issued a 
resolution on promoting great national unity and strengthening 
the unified national front. Keeping the entire party and people 
thoroughly informed of the essential points of this resolution 
and transforming the resolution into life now constitute an 
urgent and essential demand. 
  Great national unity is a highly valuable tradition our 
people have followed during their history of national 
construction and defense. The Political Bureau resolution says: 
"Taking up and developing this tradition right from its 
founding, our party has always paid attention to strengthening 
and broadening the universal national unity bloc; developing 
national strength; and combining national strength with 
international, traditional, and contemporary strengths. It is 
because of this that the party won many great victories during 
the struggle for the independence of the fatherland and the 
freedom and happiness of the people. 
  It is thanks to the promotion of great national unity during 
the struggle for national independence, construction, and 
defense that our party -- since assuming its leadership role 
over a half century ago -- has led our people to one victory 
after another. Yet this tradition has not been promoted in 
certain localities and at certain times. This is why the 
revolution has had to cope with many difficulties. This is the 
lesson learned from the reality of the revolution. 
  If we are united, we will be able to overcome any 
difficulties in any revolution, regardless of how hard they may 
be. If we are divided, we will go bust. This is a great lesson 
of experience that is illustrated by the following quotation by 
Great President Ho Chi Minh: "Unity, unity, great unity; 
success, success, great success." 
<H6>  Part One </H6>
<H3>  The Party's Renovation Policy and the Great National Unity 
as Seen in the Past </H3>
  In the situation where the party is the ruling party, its 
role in the great national unity bloc is a decisive factor. 
  Since the liberation of the south and the unification of the 
country, our country has been faced with a profoundly changing 
domestic and world situation. This has created new 
opportunities and new challenges in the cause of defending the 
Vietnamese fatherland. 
  Under such circumstances, our party has enjoyed great 
advantages. As noted in the resolution of the eight party 
Central Committee's eight plenum: "Founded and trained by 
President Ho Chi Minh, the Communist Party of Vietnam led our 
people to fight as a united body. This made it possible for the 
August Revolution; the war of resistance for national 
independence, freedom, and unification; and the struggle for 
national construction and defense to achieve successes and 
become successful. 
  "These achievements were the result of the following 
factors: 
The party had a correct political line. It had support from the 
people and a contingent of party cadres and members who, during 
the fight, associated themselves closely with the people. 
  "The close relationship between the party and the people has 
become a source of strength and a very valuable tradition of the 
Vietnamese revolution." 
  Entering the new revolutionary stage, the party has promptly 
detected and corrected the mistakes in its political leadership. 
Only a few years after the liberation of the south and the 
unification of the country, the sixth party Central Committee's 
10th plenum, held in October 1979, criticized the system of 
bureaucratic and subsidy-based centralism. It advocated 
building a multi- component economy, with South Vietnam having 
five economic components, to enable production to flourish from 
the grass roots. 
  Based on the guiding thought of the party Central 
Committee's sixth plenum resolution, the party Central Committee 
(fourth and fifth terms) has formulated a series of lines and 
policies aimed at fulfilling various set tasks. These include 
Directive No. 100 on the end-product contractual system for 
laborers in agricultural cooperatives (January, 1981); Directive 
No. 35 on implementing and developing the family economy; 
Directive No. 29 on allocation of land and forests to 
cooperatives and households; Directive No. 65 on developing the 
sea and coastal economy; Government Decree No. 25-CP on granting 
autonomy to state-run enterprises; and so forth. Afterward, the 
sixth and seventh national party congresses set forth new, 
fundamental, and comprehensive lines and policies to build the 
market-based multisectoral economy under state management and 
expand and diversify diplomatic activities. This was followed 
by party Central Committee Political Bureau Resolution No. 10 on 
renovating the management mechanism for agriculture, and many 
other resolutions of the sixth and seventh party Central 
Committees. All of these are aimed at consistently carrying out 
the renovation process from the higher down to the lower levels, 
in order to unleash the labor force and further strengthen the 
people's right to mastery. 
  In implementing the renovation process, at certain times we 
have faced acute difficulties within the party as well as among 
the people. We have also experienced clashes between the 
conservative and renovation concepts. Because our people's 
creativity and dynamism -- especially that of the peasants -- 
has been condensed and formulated into national lines and 
policies by our party, however, we have overcome numerous 
difficulties and ordeals. We have also been able to combine the 
"party concept with the people's feeling," thus creating a 
vigorous driving force for developing the rural areas and 
agriculture and resolving the most fundamental issues; namely, 
the peasants' rights to use the land and the laborers' rights to 
ownership in production and distribution. This has motivated 
tens of million of peasants to participate in the implementation 
of party policies for their own benefit, thus revitalizing the 
potential of land and labor, promoting our people's diligent 
characteristics, and producing remarkable economic results. 
  For instance, the grain shortage and the import surplus were 
two acutely difficult issues that we failed to overcome, despite 
great efforts over many years. Yet since early 1981, the first 
year we implemented agricultural renovation, we have achieved an 
unprecedented pace of development in this regard. 
  The gross grain production output during the 1976-80 period 
was 13.3 million tonnes, an average increase of 200,000 tonnes 
annually. During the 1981-88 period, however, gross grain output 
was 17.5 million tonnes, an increase of 810,000 tonnes. During 
the 1989-92 period, the output was 22.2 million tonnes, an 
increase of 1.5 million tonnes, while gross grain production 
output in 1992 and 1993 was 24.5 million tonnes annually. The 
export value also increased from $700 million during the 1976-80 
period to almost $2 billion at present. 
  The rapid increase in grain production output and export 
value has created favorable conditions for other economic 
sectors. Animal husbandry, industrial crops, forestry, and 
maritime products have developed remarkably, thus stabilizing 
and improving people's daily lives, especially in rural areas. 
This has contributed to helping the country overcome very 
dangerous ordeals while consistently implementing the renovation 
process. 
  Against the background of the complicated international 
situation that greatly effected global stability, the United 
States continued its trade embargo against our country. After 
the war, our country faced numerous difficulties as a result of 
its consequences. We also experienced difficulties caused by 
past mistakes in formulating our lines and policies. As a 
result, our renovation undertaking calls for efforts to overcome 
difficulties while correcting our mistakes. We have, 
nevertheless, made the abovementioned achievements. This is 
testimony to the fact that our party's renovation line is 
correct and our revolution is advancing in the right direction 
of maintaining national independence and ensuring freedom and 
happiness for our people in accordance with the socialist 
orientation. 
  Our country, however, is still rife with many difficulties 
and shortcomings. 
  As far as the socialist reformation and construction process 
is concerned, our party committed mistakes due to haste, 
dogmatism, and voluntarism. It did not pay due attention to the 
laws governing the formulation of action programs, failed to 
take into account the fact that ours is an agriculturally 
backward country with a predominantly small-scale production, 
and belittled efforts to make use of the strengths created by 
the tradition of great solidarity to formulate correct policies 
and lines. Prompted by the desire to quickly get rid of all 
other economic sectors, including the individual economic 
sector, and retain only the socialist and semisocialist economic 
sector, it eliminated a substantial number of talents and 
inviduals with wisdom and skills who can be used to serve the 
national construction and defense goals. 
  In implementing the party-initiated renovation line, our 
people have scored initial yet very important results. 
Nonetheless, the national economy still depends entirely on 
agriculture. The scale of industrial production remains small, 
and material and technical bases are not enormous in size. The 
level of economic efficiency is very low. There still remains 
enormous budget overspending and substantial foreign debt. Many 
people are unemployed or underemployed. Corruption, smuggling, 
and extravagance continue to develop seriously and in a 
complicated manner. 
  Only slow efforts have been made to renovate the state and 
cooperative economies. Though the private economy has 
developed, its growth rate is not high enough. The lives of the 
people, especially ethnic minority people in high altitude 
regions and remote areas, are still rife with many difficulties. 
The pace of renovation and consolidation of the political 
system is slow. Party members and the people still do not 
display a truly firm ideological stance. The situation 
concerning political stability and social security and order is 
not good. 
  Our nation is still listed as one of the poor countries in 
the world. The gross domestic product per capita is much lower 
than that of many countries in the region, and the average 
annual growth rate is even slower. The danger of lagging 
further behind compared to many countries in the region has 
exerted an adverse impact on employment, living conditions, the 
people's confidence in and support for our regime, and national 
security and defense capabilities... Meanwhile, many hostile 
forces are trying by all means to undermine our people's 
revolutionary undertaking. 
  Over the recent past, our party has made due efforts to 
resolve social problems. Nonetheless, there are still many 
shortcomings and difficulties which, in turn, have exerted a 
not-too-slight impact on the people's idelogical and political 
singlemindedness. Now that the national economy has effected 
changes for the better and the new mechanism has created 
favorable conditions for resolving social problems, let's ensure 
social justice through the distribution of production means and 
let's combine this move with efforts to adjust the income 
distribution system. It is necessary to create conditions for 
everyone (by means of land allotment, selling of shares, 
contracting, bank loans...) so they can earn their living, 
enrich themselves, and bring about prosperity in society. 
Nonetheless, economic development and the application of a new 
mechanism alone cannot provide solutions to all problems. We 
should try to resolve social problems according to the party's 
policy on human resources development under which the human 
factor is regarded not only as the target of but also the motive 
behind the national defense and construction cause. At the same 
time, we face a series of major social problems that have 
reached an alarming level both in the short and long terms. 
They include the deterioration of educational, public health, 
and cultural services and the growing development of illiteracy, 
school dropouts, diseases, moral degradation, corruption, and 
smuggling, thereby causing our efforts to cope with challenges 
to become more difficult and complicated. 
  Given the new development stage of the revolution, the 
party's leadership skills, the political background and 
singlemindedness of all party members, and the moral ethics of 
cadres and party members constitute the preliminary conditions 
for rallying the entire people around the party. 
  Thoughout history, our party recorded a very glorious 
achievement by providing leadership for national liberation and 
fatherland protection. In recent years, the party has quickly 
initiated the renovation line and led the reform undertaking, 
gaining important initial victories. However, in the new 
situation, it has shown weaknesses in keeping par with the 
revolution's current requirements. Moreover, the government's 
management role from the central to local and grassroots levels 
governments has been far too low for the demand, despite its 
successes in building a law-governed state of the people, by the 
people, and for the people; in enforcing the law; in improving 
foreign affairs work; and in controlling inflation and prices. 
  Mass organizations have been relatively quick in developing 
their economic, scientific, social, and professional 
associations to meet the new situation and duties. Traditional 
organizations have exerted many efforts to broaden democracy and 
reform their structure and working methoda. They, however, are 
still more or less in a vicious circle of stagnation, 
inflexibility, and disparity, especially at the grassroots level 
where the systems of mass organizations have not really been 
integrated and taken root in the grassroots and the public.... 
  Since the party became a ruling party in the entire nation, 
particularly since the country entered its renovation, the 
socioeconomy has been moving and progressing very quickly; 
international relations have been changing; the party's contact 
with current affairs and social realities has not been renovated 
quickly and accordingly; and the political and moral degradation 
in some cadres and party members has brought about serious 
effects to the party's fighting spirit and reputation. The 
party has not thoroughly understood the people. The people have 
not really become attached to the party. Lower level cadres do 
not dare tell the truth to higher cadres. The atmosphere of 
democracy and fair discussion to discover the truth has been 
limited. The principle of democratic centralism, which is the 
party's vitality, has not been maintained. The practice of 
bureaucracy and authoritarianism has existed together with the 
devils of indiscipline, sectionalism, and clannishness. In many 
places, the party's internal fighting has been very weak and the 
clarification of correctness and incorrectness has been 
prolonged to an extent that clarification becomes impossible. 
  If the party, state, and mass organizations do not improve 
their knowledge and if their management is not corrected to make 
them cleaner and stronger, there will be difficulties in 
gathering the intellectual essence from the party, the national, 
and the current world, leading to the weakening of their 
attraction to the public. 
  This situation arises for different reasons. But the most 
fundamental reason that needs to be clarified and corrected is 
that the party has not been absolutely correct in defining its 
relations with the national political system and with society in 
the new revolutionary condition, situation, and duties. 
  From a party of the workers' class leading the revolution to 
seize power and protect the government, our party has become a 
ruling party in the entire nation. It is leading the 
undertaking of national construction and protection in a 
multisectoral economy with a market mechanism with state 
management; with the government of the people, by the people, 
and for the people; and with the broadening and diversifying of 
multilateral international relations. This special 
characteristic requires the party to combine the strength of the 
workers' class with national strength, national strength with 
international strength, and traditional strength with temporary 
strength. The liberation of the workers' class must be preceded 
by national liberation. The settlement of sectional interests 
must be in harmony with national interests. The party's goal 
and duty must be the goal of all society as well. 
  Therefore, the party must be renovated. The party must lead 
the revolution. It must be a party of the workers' class and 
represent the interest of the workers' class and the national 
interest. It must be the vanguard team of the workers' class 
and the nation as well (with no sexual discrimination and not 
standing above the nation). It must place national interest 
above everything else to unite people of all strata and 
religions for the implementation of President Ho Chi Minh's 
spirit of the great national unity and to create a strong force 
for "the construction of a Vietnam of peace, unification, 
independence, democracy, and prosperity" (from President Ho Chi 
Minh's Testament).

ignored an appeal by two United Nations officials in Bosnia for 
the deployment there of additional troops. Yashushi Akashi, a UN 
representative in Bosnia, also joined the debate on sending 
10,000 more troops to Bosnia. Australian Defense Minister 
Robert Ray says he opposed sending troops to Bosnia. Ray said 
the government requires certain conditions to be met before it 
can consider sending any soldiers.

  [Excerpt] Canberra, Mar. 3 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin said that as long as the west continues putting 
pressure on teh Serbians, peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be 
established soon. After concluding his three-day official visit 
to New Zealand, Cetin arrived in Australia on Wednesday. 
  Speaking to the press on the situation in the Balkans, Cetin 
said that any decision which was not based on political will and 
power will not be effective. He said that NATO and the U.N. 
Security Council should clearly give an ultimatum that further 
aggressions will not be tolerated. "The Bosnian tragedy showed 
that unless there is a power behind your decisions, no one will 
listen to you," he said. "Now, a new world disorder prevails in 
our region, instead of a new world order." Cetin stressed that 
Europe had failed to maintain peace in the Balkans. "The 
agreement reached between the Croats and Bosnians is an 
indication which gives us hope," he said. "A solution seems to 
be very near if the world applies pressure." 
  Cetin and his Australian counterpart Gareth Evans held 
official talks afterward. An extradition agreement was signed 
at the end of the talks. Cetin was received by Australian 
governor Bill Hayden and Prime Minister Paul Keating. Evans 
hosted a dinner for Cetin in the evening. Cetin was welcomed 
with a ceremony befitting heads of states, in Australia.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that if the 
world, supported by a military force, puts pressure on the Serbs 
then peace can be achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near 
future. 
  Cetin, who is in Australia, has concluded his contacts in 
Canberra. Prior to his official talks in Canberra, Cetin 
visited the Ataturk monument in the city. He laid a wreath and 
paid his respects. He also laid a wreath at the unknown 
Australian soldier monument and paid his respects. He later 
visited the Gelibolu [Gallipoli] section of the Australian war 
monument. Cetin then paid a call on his Australian counterpart 
Gareth Evans. After the meeting, the two foreign ministers led 
the Turkish and Australian delegations at the official talks. 
An extradition agreement was signed after the official talks. 
  Cetin and Evans later held a joint news conference. In a 
statement at the news conference, Cetin said that bilateral and 
regional relations were taken up at the official talks and that 
developments in the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle East 
were discussed within this framework. Pointing out that Turkey 
has an important and central position among Europe, Middle East, 
the Black Sea and Central Asia, Evans concluded by saying that 
bilateral relations will be further increased.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- An international gathering 
to discuss measures to achieve environmental conservation and 
economic development in the Asia-Pacific region in the next 
century will be held in Tokyo on March 16 and 17, government 
officials said Friday [4 March]. The meeting will be attended 
by experts from Asian and Pacific countries and the United 
Nations, they said. 
  At the environment conference for Asia and the Pacific (ECO 
Asia '93) held in Chiba last June, Japan's Environment Agency 
pledged to draw up a report on such measures with the help of 
other Asia-Pacific nations and the U.N. The first meeting on 
the project called "ECO Asia 21 Plan" will decide on the date of 
release of the report while discussing concrete measures, the 
officials said. 
  Japan will tell the meeting that it wants to submit an 
interim report to a gathering of the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to be held next year 
and a final report to a special U.N. General Assembly session in 
1997, they said. The plan will propose policies, financial aid 
and international cooperation needed to maintain the environment 
and yet promote development in the region. The experts will 
draft the program after making projections for the region's 
future population, economic growth, manufacturing, agriculture, 
forestry, demand for energy, state of urban areas, and 
environmental conservation policies, the officials said.

Foreign Ministry official Darum Sukontasap: "Asean Security 
Talks Are a Tool for Prosperity"] 
  [Text] Next week, the Thai Foreign Ministry will host a 
Special Meeting of Asean Senior Officials (Special SOM). The 
significance of this meeting is that it will be the second time 
in almost two years that senior officials from Asean's foreign 
policy, military and intelligence establishments sit together, 
with a full agenda, to discuss ways and means through which 
Asean countries could enhance their security cooperation. The 
first Special SOM, which was held in Manila in June 1992, fell 
short of its intended goals and, this time, the Asean countries 
are hoping that the upcoming meeting will yield more concrete 
results. 
  Asean had from the late 1970s up to the early 1990s played a 
leading role in bringing the Cambodia conflict to the attention 
of the world community. The regional organization was also 
instrumental in the search for a durable solution to the 13 
year-old problem. Therefore, political cooperation was nothing 
new to the six-member grouping. In fact, critics often pointed 
out that Asean's strength had always been in political rather 
than economic cooperation, although the latter was the raison 
d'etre of the regional grouping when it was established in 1967. 
  However, in spite of Asean members' close cooperation in the 
political field, it was not until recently that Asean felt the 
need for a formal and exclusive framework for intra-Asean 
security consultation. The routine Asean Senior Officials 
Meetings (SOM), or the meetings of Permanent Secretaries for 
Foreign Affairs of Asean countries, which take place three or 
four times a year, discuss a wide variety of political-related 
subjects, ranging from regional political situation to economic 
relationship between Asean and third countries. Security 
issues, per se, are singled out for attention only when dictated 
by circumstances. 
  Therefore, the upcoming Special SOM in Bangkok represents 
Asean's new thinking. It signifies a clear departure from 
Asean's earlier insistence that, as a group, Asean will not 
venture into the military realm of regional cooperation. With 
the advent of the Special SOM, Asean military cooperation is no 
longer unimaginable. The question is: Does this mean that Asean 
may be in the process of transforming into a military bloc? To 
answer this question, we must first ask ourselves whether, in 
the prevailing regional atmosphere there is any need for a 
military bloc. The answer would most probably be in the 
negative. It would be anachronistic of Asean to even think 
about forming a military alliance of any sort. Asean security 
cooperation is necessary today not as an end in itself but as a 
tool for ensuring economic prosperity for the region. In order 
to secure a sustainable economic growth, countries of the region 
need trust, understanding, a predictable pattern of political 
and security relationships, as well as effective mechanisms 
through which regional disputes could be resolved quickly and 
peacefully. 
  Picking up where the first Special SOM left off, the Bangkok 
meeting will attempt to institutionalize the habit of security 
cooperation and dialogue among Asean countries. If successful, 
at the very least, more Special SOMs will follow on a more 
regular basis. 
  Influenced by the changing global security environment, the 
agenda of the second Special SOM would most likely evolve around 
two main questions: (a) How (and how far) can intra-Asean 
security cooperation be strengthened and (b) how should Asean 
deal with the metamorphosis of the current security 
configuration within the Asia-Pacific region? The answers for 
these questions would also help Asean countries prepare 
themselves for the grand event -- the Asean Regional Forum 
(ARF), which will be held in Bangkok in July of this year, 
following a meeting among the senior officials of ASEAN and 
other members of the ARF in Bangkok in May. 
  Both the Special SOM and the Asean Regional Forum are two 
important and complementing fora which could meaningfully 
contribute to Asean's effort in intensifying its internal and 
external dialogues on political and security issues. With the 
support of everyone concerned, they could serve to strengthen 
and promote political and security cooperation in the Southeast 
Asian region as well as help develop a more predictable and 
constructive pattern of political and security relationship for 
the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.

  [Text] Korea Telecom [KT] yesterday announced it will 
spend 320 billion won, or an estimated 6.1 percent of its 
revenues this year, on research and development. The state-run 
telephone company also announced the establishment of Korea 
Telecom Research Laboratories, which comprises the six existing 
research arms of the company. 
  "The reshuffle of our research efforts was necessary because 
most research projects call for close coordination between our 
research centers," said Yi Yong-kyong, who became the first 
president of KT Research Labs. 
  A spokesman said Korea Telecom will funnel 320 billion won 
and 684 researchers into 69 R&amp;D projects this year. The 
research fields will include automatic translation, intelligent 
network and integrated digital service network (ISDN) 
technologies. For each project, KT Research Labs will form a 
research team by recruiting related specialists from the 
existing research centers. 
  "We hope this process, which is already adopted by advanced 
foreign research institutions, will greatly enhance our 
technological competitiveness in the world market," Yi said. 
  The nation's largest telephone company has steadily 
increased 
its R&amp;D budget, from 198 billion won in 1992 to 277 billion 
won, 
or 4.2 percent of its annual sales, last year. The company will 
expand its R&amp;D budget up to more than 8 percent of its annual 
revenues by the year 2000, a spokesman said. 
  Most of the nation's research funds in the 
telecommunications 
sector come from the three major operators--Korea Telecom, Korea 
Mobile Telecom and Dacom. 
  In 1993, the three companies invested a combined 300 billion 
won in research and technological development. Their combined 
R&amp;D investment will increase to 400 billion won this year, 
or an 
estimated 6.5 percent of this yearly revenues [as published].

<F P=106> [Article by Yoshiyuki Shuto and Kyoko Isa of AERA's </F>
editorial department entitled: "Seven Economists Make Urgent 
Proposals on Measures the Japanese Government Should Take"] 
  [Text] "It is not too late yet. Japan has to present its 
macroeconomic `numerical targets' as reference indices that are 
not pledged to the United States." So said Isamu Miyazaki, 
chairman of the board of directors of the Daiwa Research 
Institute. 
  What macroeconomic numerical targets means is how much Japan 
as a whole intends to reduce its trade surplus, not the import 
targets of individual items. "To increase import volume, 
expansion of domestic demand is indispensable. If the contents 
of measures to expand domestic demand, including additional 
amount in public works projects, are decided, the target of 
decrease of our surplus will become visible to a certain degree." 
  Miyazaki seemed to regret the "degeneration" during the 
negotiations between Japan and the United States. 
  In the beginning, macroeconomic numerical targets were 
subjects of discussion, but they were unwittingly replaced by 
discussions limited to microeconomics, winding up with the term 
"numerical target" alone having risen to the fore. 
  Miyazaki is also opposed to setting import targets for 
individual items because it may lead to managed trade. He 
proposes that Japan return to the original point by saying, "It 
is ridiculous to deny numerical targets outright. It must once 
more recall why the negotiations between the two countries 
started in the first place. Was it not intended to trim Japan's 
trade surplus?" 
<H5>  It Is Unwise To Leave Negotiations Broken Off </H5>
  Chief researcher Masaru Takagi of the Fuji Research 
Institute 
agrees with what Mr. Miyazaki insists and said, "The five-year 
target of reduction in trade surplus should be set at around 2 
percent of the surplus ratio against GDP [gross domestic 
product]. Since it stood at approximately 3.6 percent in 1992, 
his insistence is to cut it about in half. 
  He added, "President Clinton's reference to a `trade war' 
looked like intimidation, but it is bad for Japan to engage in 
serious quarrels with the United States. Although the numerical 
targets were rejected as managed trade, they are in 
macroeconomic terms the same as `economic prospects,' the growth 
rate the government predicts. 
  As a matter of fact, the figure 2 percent against GDP 
mentioned by Takagi is quite close to the figure U.S. officials 
mentioned publicly in the beginning. 
  What these two men insisted on amounts to an opinion in 
support of so-called "cooperation with the United States," based 
on the realities of the situation. 
  They seem to belong, however, to a minority among 
economists. 
At the end of January when the Japan-U.S. negotiations drew 
closer to an end, a group of Japanese, mostly economists, made 
public a joint appeal to the effect that "Japan should 
resolutely refuse numerical targets." Prof. Kazuo Ueda of 
Tokyo University, one of the proponents, criticized the setting 
up of macroeconomic numerical targets saying, "The trade surplus 
originates, theoretically, from monetary lending and borrowing 
between countries. If that imbalance becomes an issue, such a 
ridiculous situation will take place that no more lending and 
borrowing will be allowed." 
  Those on the majority side, however, do not think it right 
to 
support the breakoff of negotiations. Prof. Ueda insists that 
now is the time for Japan to declare to the world as well as to 
the United States that differences in domestic and foreign 
prices should be reduced to the levels of advanced nations. 
  To achieve this, easing of restrictions and more opening of 
markets are necessary. When they are carried out, it is 
expected that trade surpluses will be reduced in the end and 
more than anything else consumers will benefit. "Of course it 
will be accompanied by pain to domestic forces that try to 
protect vested rights and interests. Prime Minister Hosokawa, 
who held on to his refusal of numerical targets, seems to have 
taken a step toward the point of no return." 
  As a countermeasure to the refusal of numerical targets, 
Assistant Prof. Heizo Takenaka of the Keio University, points to 
the shrinking of the price difference at home and abroad. He 
said, "To cut the difference in prices, restrictions should be 
lifted. If the share of U.S. products still does not increase, 
then the blame rests with U.S. enterprises." 
<H5>  `Important Commitment' From the President </H5>
  Meanwhile, Prof. Iwao Nakatani of Hitotsubashi University 
said a drastic symbolic policy is necessary in addition to the 
easing of restrictions. He added, "Why do you not take a kind 
of affirmative action to remedy discrimination toward 
enterprises with foreign capital? For the foreign-capital 
affiliated enterprises, Japan should take a daring stance of 
seriously dealing with the matter of opening its markets by 
exempting taxes and the like." 
  However, there is an entirely different opinion, such as the 
following: Prof. Tsuneo Iida at the International Japan Culture 
Studies Center says "the government is better not to take any 
action from a strategic or tactical point of view." It is Prof. 
Iida's view that the government, as a rule, should not intervene 
in economic affairs in the face of the current situation. "In a 
broad sense, now is the time when the U.S.-style industrial 
civilization of the 20th century has come to a deadend. It is 
wrong to think that the domestic recession, for example, can be 
remedied by measures taken by the government." In Japan, many 
people assume the current economic negotiations to be a de facto 
failure, but Prof. Yoshihiro Tsurumi of the City University of 
New York has a different view -- "Prime Minister Hosokawa has 
wrestled an important pledge from President Clinton." 
  Prof. Tsurumi, who is an old acquaintance of Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, and is said to be periodically writing or faxing 
advice to him on economic policies, points out: At a news 
conference after the summit, the President made remarks to the 
effect "I am not asking for something like the semiconductor 
agreement" and "objective criteria will not be used as a means 
of sanctions against Japan." 
  "In other words, he apparently made clear remarks that 
`numerical targets that equate to predetermined-share methods' 
will not be employed, contrary to the Japanese interpretation. 
Japan should not overlook this statement. It should 
immediately call for a resumption of negotiations to confirm the 
presidential statements." 
  Thus he advises that the best way is to work out new 
measures 
for easing restrictions by holding in check those in the U.S. 
Government who favor applying sanctions against Japan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yoshio Hatano, Japanese ambassador to the </F>
United Nations, by Motohide Yoshikawa, chief of the United 
Nations Policy Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on 7 
December 1993; place not given] 
  [Text]Five Important Problems 
  [Yoshikawa] We would like to ask Japan's UN Ambassador 
Hatano, who temporarily returned to Japan for an ambassadorial 
conference on the Middle and Near East, to spare some time for 
us and tell us about the United Nations, particularly about the 
Security Council. It is generally thought that, with the end of 
the Cold War, the United Nations has become very active and has 
begun to play a new role in world security. First of all, we 
would like you to tell us about the current problems facing the 
United Nations as you see them. 
  [Hatano] I often say that the United Nations faces five 
important problems at present: First, peace-keeping operations; 
second, refugees; third, human rights; fourth, humanitarian aid; 
fifth, the environment. These five problems have two aspects -- 
Japan can do much in one respect and can do little in the other. 
  As far as peacekeeping operations are concerned, the 
Japanese 
have the fundamental problem that they are reluctant to go to 
dangerous places. The problem we face with the issue of 
refugees is that although Japan provides aid for their 
assistance, our contribution is limited as far as the acceptance 
of refugees is concerned. 
  On human rights there is sharp contrast in values between 
Asia and the West. Asia hopes Japan is well placed enough to be 
sympathetic to its point of view, while the West hopes that 
Japan, as a developed nation, will share its point of view. On 
the positive side, Japan can mediate between the two; on the 
negative side is open to criticism from both sides. 
  On the issue of humanitarian aid, Japan provides a large 
amount of aid. But its philosophy is based on the idea that 
helping those who help themselves is good assistance. At 
present, however, those countries which can help themselves have 
mostly been helped. For those countries which are still unable 
to help themselves, Japan is often one step behind other nations 
in providing funds, even if it does so in the end. Somehow, 
Japan does not give the impression that it will provide aid of 
its own volition. 
  Only on the issue of the environment does Japan take the 
lead 
without restraint. However, there is the problem of the weight 
the country carries in the United Nations. Unless a country 
makes a considerable contribution in the first four areas, it 
will find it rather difficult to take the initiative in the 
fifth. 
  The first four problems are, in many cases, discussed in the 
Security Council when concrete, urgent countermeasures are 
needed. It might be thought that the Security Council discusses 
only security issues. Recently, however, the definition of 
security has become so wide that it has come to include human 
rights, refugees, and humanitarian aid. The original Security 
Council resolution on Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia, and on 
Somalia, was to dispatch peacekeeping forces to support the 
smooth implementation of humanitarian aid. In that sense, many 
of the important problems dealt with by the United Nations are 
discussed in the Security Council. Important UN elections, such 
as those for secretary general and judges of the International 
Court of Justice are also conducted in the Security Council. 
Therefore, the easiest way to make a contribution to the United 
Nations is to have a voice in the Security Council. If a 
country is not a member of the Security Council, it has no 
chance to give advice or put in a word no matter how hard it 
tries. 
  [Yoshikawa] The peacekeeping operations of the United 
Nations were successful in Cambodia, but they met a severe 
ordeal in Somalia. What is the current view of the United 
Nations on peacekeeping operations? 
  [Hatano] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali said that the 
United Nations had had two crises. The first crisis lasted 
until four or five years ago, during which no hopes had been 
entertained for the United Nations. In my opinion, nobody in 
the world at that time thought that the peacekeeping operations 
of the United Nations could ensure the security of the world. 
The second UN crisis which Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
referred to is the period in which undue hopes had been 
entertained for the United Nations, and it lasted until 
recently. The establishment of a just peace by the United 
Nations through the Gulf war prompted successive requests to the 
United Nations from all over the world for the dispatch of 
peacekeeping forces to their places, thus raising undue 
expectations. In answer to these expectations, peacekeeping 
forces were dispatched to various places of the world, such as 
Cambodia, Yugoslavia, and Somalia. However, the results fell 
short of our expectations, except for Cambodia. Meanwhile, the 
expenses have become so great recently that the so-called United 
Nations fatigue and a tendency toward self-examination -- the 
dispatch of peacekeeping operations cannot be continued in this 
manner; or whether it is proper to continue the dispatch -- has 
been born, to my thinking, in the United Nations and the 
Security Council. However, there are successive requests from 
all over the world for the dispatch of peacekeeping forces at 
present, and the United Nations is racking its brains to cope 
with these requests. If Japan expresses a negative view, it is 
refuted: "Although Japan promoted peacekeeping operations in 
Cambodia, is it against them when they are conducted outside of 
Asia?" 
  It is often said in the United Nations that there are two 
kinds of peace in the world: one is "peace with justice" and 
the other is "peace without justice." If the United Nations had 
not intervened in Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a peaceful 
situation might have been produced, at least on the surface. 
However, a peace of this kind would have been the product of 
Iraq's unlawful annexation of Kuwait. The idea of the United 
Nations is that it cannot tolerate such peace without justice. 
Recently there have been a large number of countries where an 
excessive violation of human rights is being practiced, famines 
have broken out, and refugees have come into existence, not to 
mention the invasion by Iraq. The insistence and 
self-confidence of the United Nations are that it must not 
remain indifferent to such a situation without justice and that 
it must actively intervene in such a situation on its own 
initiative. 
  I would like to add a few words here that there are people 
who say that in Japan every peace is peace with justice despite 
the fact that there are two kinds of peace as mentioned above. 
<H5>  Demand for Transparency in the United Nations </H5>
  [Yoshikawa] In my opinion, many readers of this magazine 
think that the United Nations is doing something very difficult, 
and they have no idea how the United Nations reaches a decision. 
Now, you have served as Japanese ambassador to the United 
Nations for the past four years, and you have also attended 
Security Council meetings every day these two years as a member 
of the Security Council. We would like you to tell us about how 
the Security Council comes to a decision, about what kind of 
role the ambassador and the permanent mission on the spot play, 
and about the atmosphere of deliberations at the Security 
Council. 
  [Hatano] It is said that the United Nations has three 
classes of members: the first class is the five permanent 
members; the second class is ten nonpermanent members (note: 
the permanent members are China, France, Russia, Britain, and 
the United States; the nonpermanent members as of the end of 
1993 are Japan, Brazil, Cape Verde, Djibouti, Hungary, Morocco, 
New Zealand, Pakistan, Spain, and Venezuela); the third class is 
the other 169 members. The customary practice is that when the 
Security Council makes a decision, first of all only the five 
permanent members of the first class hold a conference, make 
their plan, and submit their plan to a conference of the ten 
nonpermanent members for deliberation. The mutual cooperation 
among the five members is very close. At the stage of a 
conference by the five members, one or two members of them may 
oppose vigorously. But, once an agreement is reached by the 
five members, it is supported by the five members in a body both 
at unofficial and official conferences of the Security Council. 
Then the ten nonpermanent members find it very difficult to 
oppose the agreement. 
  These permanent members have a veto. In actuality, a veto 
is rarely exercised, but they exercise a right called "the 
pocket veto" in the sense that they can exercise their veto when 
the occasion demands. A proposal advanced by a nonpermanent 
member may be rejected, but the same kind of proposal advanced 
by a permanent member is accepted in compliance with its request 
so that the permanent member will not exercise its veto. Since 
these five members with special power make a plan without the 
participation of the ten nonpermanent members, the ten 
nonpermanent members can hardly oppose the plan. Japan was well 
consulted on the problem of Cambodia and most of its opinions 
were accepted in the end. However, Japan did not participate in 
the discussions conducted by the five permanent members, but 
took the form of effecting a liaison with the five members when 
they conduct discussions, from outside of the five members. 
  Concerning the ten nonpermanent members, five of them are 
nonaligned nations, which form a "nonaligned caucus" alias "the 
caucus" and adjust their opinions. The remaining five members 
are called "the non-nonaligned caucus," to use the jargon of the 
United Nations. In the caucus, there are five nations, 
including Japan, but their interests do not coincide nor do they 
belong to the same group. They belong to a group which is not a 
group in the strict sense of the word; therefore almost no 
adjustment of opinions is made among these five nations. And so 
they do not make a plan as a group or oppose other nations' 
plans in cooperation with each other. That makes them easier to 
be defeated one by one, which is of course generalization. The 
rest depends upon the ability of individual ambassadors. 
  Last, there are relations between the 15 nations which are 
the members of the Security Council and the 169 nations which 
are not members of the Security Council. The other day a 
Western ambassador said at an important meeting that in the 
United Nations there are now 15 nations that make a decision and 
169 nations that conform to the decision, and that such a system 
must be changed. To my mind, this opinion probably represents 
all the 169 nations. The non- Security Council members have 
requested that they be allowed to participate in Security 
Council meetings, even if indirectly, and that they should at 
least be informed of what is going on in the meetings. These 
are, what is called, requests for transparency, and there is a 
growing consciousness among the current Security Council members 
that improvement of the situation is necessary. 
  [Yoshikawa] You served as chairman of the Security Council 
in January 1993. Please tell us about your experiences as 
chairman. 
  [Hatano] The chairman of the Security Council works 
twenty-four hours a day. Since there is a time differential, 
the chairman must negotiate at midnight over the telephone with 
the foreign minister of a foreign country or its president when 
the occasion demands. The chairman is often awakened in the 
dead of night. During my chairmanship, there were various 
problems, of which the problem of the U.S. attack on the missile 
bases of Iraq and the problem of seating the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia in the United Nations were serious ones. 
In the end, the two problems were settled off the Security 
Council floor. It was three o'clock in the morning when I 
talked with the U.S. ambassador over the telephone about the 
attack on Iraq. I negotiated with the Iraqi ambassador a number 
of times. I had a number of conferences with the foreign 
minister of Greece, and the president and the foreign minister 
of "Macedonia" [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. I spent 
a lot of time on the elections in Western Sahara, on the 
Palestinian refugees, on the conflicts in Angola, as well as on 
former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Cambodia, and others. 
  An unofficial plenary session of the Security Council is 
held 
almost every day, and when the session begins the chairman must 
make an effort to put the ideas of all the members in order and 
to reach a consensus. However, the chairman has full power over 
whether a particular agenda item should be taken up and when it 
should be taken up if at all. If the chairman sends an agenda 
item to a meeting of the Security Council when the time is not 
ripe for action, that will only complicate the matter. In that 
sense, the harder the problems, like the problems of the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Iraq, the more likely they 
are to be solved off the Security Council floor. In short, the 
chairman is most active before an official plenary session, and 
the ability of the chairman is determined by how an adjustment 
is made over the telephone and when and what kind of tentative 
plan is shown by the chairman to persons concerned. On the 
other hand, the chairman, attempting a compromise in this way 
behind the scenes, must pay attention to the request for 
transparency. I was attentive to the relationship with the 
media. I was obliged to keep company with the television from 
all over the world for more than 30 minutes every day. If I 
failed to do that, I would end up being misreported or 
criticized. I fully realized how dreadful the media was. 
<H5>  It Is Impossible To Play the Leading Role Without Policy </H5>
  [Yoshikawa] For the past two years, Japan had been in the 
Security Council as a member of the second group. Since Japan's 
term as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council expired on 
31 December 1993, it now belongs to the third group. How do you 
evaluate and grade Japan as a nonpermanent member which 
participated in meetings held by the Security Council almost 
daily? 
  [Hatano] It is difficult to make a self-evaluation of the 
activities of Japan, but I think that Japan had always played 
the leading role in Asian problems. Although Japan did not 
directly participate in the conferences of the five permanent 
members concerning the problems of Cambodia, it spoke a lot and 
what it said was always reflected in the Security Council's 
resolutions. I do not think there was any instance in which 
Japan's will was overridden by the five permanent members. 
Although the problem of North Korea (the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea) is not yet a topic of discussion in the 
Security Council, Japan's opinion on the matter has already been 
asked time and again. 
  On the other hand, concerning problems outside of Asia, 
naturally, Japan's opinions are listened to if it is involved in 
the problems. For example, Japan has donated $100,000,000 to 
Somalia, and Japan's voice carries weight in its own way. 
Concerning areas to which Japan has not made a great 
contribution, it is making a contribution in the form of giving 
advice. In my mind, the most important thing for Japan to do is 
to establish a policy of managing each conflict. What is 
Japan's idea for solving the conflicts in Tajikistan, in 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia, Burundi, Rwanda, and Liberia? The 
most desirable thing for Japan to do is to give advice upon 
establishment of a policy of solving a particular problem after 
a close study of each problem. Unless Japan has such a policy, 
it cannot play a leading role. It would be meaningless for 
Japan, even if it could. 
  [Yoshikawa] You have pointed out that a country cannot play 
a leading role unless it has a policy. That is a valuable 
suggestion. We would like to consider problems outside of Asia 
as our own problems and establish a policy to cope with such 
problems. On the other hand, this is not a 
which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg question, but Japan is 
compelled to express its view because it is given the chance to 
do so at the Security Council. Under such circumstances, Japan 
will come to have its own views on the various problems of the 
world you have just pointed out . 
  On 3 December 1993, a General Assembly resolution was passed 
concerning the reorganization of the Security Council, and the 
problem of how to reform the Security Council will be discussed 
in earnest in the United Nations early in 1994. This is a 
matter of great concern in Japan because this is related to the 
problem of what kind of position Japan will occupy in the 
Security Council. We would like you to tell us about the 
significance of the current decision of the United Nations and 
about your view on the progress on this problem. 
  [Hatano] Concerning the which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the- 
egg question, you may be having a hard time in Tokyo. But, seen 
from New York, it is a little different. I think it is wrong 
for Japan to have its own view because it is compelled to do so. 
It seems to me that Brazil, Spain and New Zealand, which are 
currently members of the Security Council, have their own 
assertions concerning each problem mentioned above, not to 
mention the United States, Britain, and France. 
  Concerning the reorganization of the Security Council, I 
think there are two problems. The first problem is: Japan and 
Germany are the second and third largest contributors to the 
United Nations; according to the Western style of thinking -- no 
taxation without representation -- it is quite natural that 
Japan and Germany, as great political powers, should be made 
permanent members, because they are not only great contributors, 
but they are also politically influential seen from the world as 
a whole, whether they like it or not. 
  The second problem is: there were 51 member nations when 
the United Nations was established in 1945, of which 11 were the 
members of the Security Council at that time; the number of the 
member nations has increased to 184, but the number of the 
permanent members has increased from 11 to only 15; moreover, at 
first the member nations of the Security Council were mostly the 
so-called countries in "the North"; thereafter, the number of 
member nations has increased due to the joining of largely 
so-called independent nations in "the South," but the balance 
between "the North" and "the South" has shown almost no change 
since the establishment of the Security Council. Therefore, the 
second problem is how to rectify the imbalance between the North 
and the South. 
  I think that the second problem mentioned above has been the 
main force in the reorganization movement of the Security 
Council. The central idea of Japan is apt to be: "What are you 
going to do with Japan?" Although the United Nations fully 
understands the first problem, judging from the atmosphere of 
the United Nations as a whole, the solution to the problem of 
the representation of the countries of the South, which comprise 
more than three-fourths of the member nations of the United 
Nations, seems to be the main stream of the reorganization of 
the Security Council at present. 
  From the standpoint of "the South," Japan is not only the 
most important donor country, but also the friend of "the South" 
who understands the claim of "the South." And "the North" 
supports Japan not only because Japan shares the same sense of 
value as "the North," but also because what Japan says is close 
to the claim of "the North." I think that Japan is now in the 
middle of the stream of the reorganization of the Security 
Council, created by "the South." The UN secretary general says 
that Japan should become a permanent member of the Security 
Council and that would benefit the United Nations. It is not 
impossible for Japan not to become a permanent member of the 
Security Council, contrary to the current of the times, by 
refusing to be a Security Council member. But, in that case, 
Japan would be criticized for avoiding its responsibility. 
  Japan is by no means aiming for the position of permanent 
member by overstretching itself or through maneuvering. The 
position of a permanent member cannot be gained through such 
means. Japan cannot be a permanent member unless the general 
atmosphere of the United Nations expects Japan to become a 
permanent member. Since such an expectation actually prevails 
now, Japan's negative attitude toward that will only invite 
disappointment and criticism. 
<H5>  Reorganization of the Security Council Was the Pandora's Box </H5>
  [Yoshikawa] Then, can we say that the success of 
reorganization of the Security Council depends on how the wishes 
of the countries of "the South" are reflected? Various 
countries have already expressed all sorts of opinions at the 
United Nations, and it will take some time, in my mind, to put 
these opinions in order. This is a problem we have to think over 
without haste, is it not? 
  [Hatano] That is right. I think the solution of this 
problem will take considerable time. Japan's problem is not so 
serious, but there will be considerable trouble among the 
countries of "the South" in making plans for the participation 
of "the South." "The South" itself must put its opinions in 
order before "the North" expresses its opinions. 
  Looking back over the past two years, I find marked 
progress. 
Only one and a half years ago, the five permanent members used 
to say that the problem of reorganization of the Security 
Council is a Pandora's box. They had consented to open the 
Pandora's box, pick out only Japan, and make it a permanent 
member. But they had opposed this by saying that opening the 
Pandora's box would produce so many problems that they would 
become uncontrollable. I think that now all the permanent 
members take the reorganization, as well as the admittance of 
Japan and Germany to permanent membership, for granted. 
  Although things are moving relatively fast and there is a 
mountain of problems to be solved, the problem of reorganization 
may certainly move toward solution in 1995. The reason is that 
1995 is the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and many 
countries are thinking of doing something memorable and 
conspicuous on that occasion. I think it is important to place 
great value on this opportunity. 
  [Yoshikawa] In Japan, it is pointed out that an adequate 
discussion is not being conducted on the effect that Japan's 
permanent membership in the Security Council will produce on 
Japan's course and its form of existence. On the other hand, it 
seems that this problem has been taken up by the media and 
others since the summer of 1993 and has become, so to speak, a 
topic for public discussion. 
  I think that Japan should display initiative in the 
international agency called the United Nations, which has 184 
member nations of the world and which covers political, economic 
and social problems, whether or not Japan becomes a permanent 
member of the Security Council. We would like you to tell us 
your opinion about what Japan should do in the United Nations on 
the basis of your experience to the present day. 
  [Hatano] In Japan, there is a tendency to think that the 
United Nations is like a noble world federal government, that 
Japan must give its cooperation to such a government, and that 
Japan should be pleased that it has been given a chance to give 
its cooperation. Such a tendency is welcomed by those of us who 
take charge of the United Nations, and yet I think that such an 
idea is wrong. Japan is an important member of the United 
Nations, and it is we ourselves who constitute the United 
Nations. Therefore, Japan's concern is not to make its 
contribution to the United Nations, but how to make use of the 
United Nations. I think United Nations diplomacy is not for the 
purpose of making a contribution to the United Nations, but to 
make use of the United Nations. 
  Concerning the relationship with the Security Council, Japan 
would have a decisive voice in the reform and reorganization of 
the United Nations if it becomes a permanent member of the 
Security Council. In that sense, it is one idea to make a 
contribution to a reformed United Nations and to a reformed 
Security Council; but I think it can also be said that it is 
better to become a permanent member of the Security Council if 
Japan is to make reforms. For example, the ultimate nature of 
peace-keeping operations will be determined, after all, through 
a succession of Security Council resolutions. And Japan will 
have a decisive voice in the discussion of that problem if it 
becomes a permanent member of the Security Council. Therefore, 
I think it desirable for Japan to become a permanent member of 
the Security Council to reform the United Nations at the 
initiative of Japan. 
  [Yoshikawa] As you have just said, I think we should not 
forget the fact that the United Nations does not have a 
different existence from us, does not exist on the other side of 
the river, in other words, is not "an outsider," but is "an 
entity of which we are a part."

<F P=106> [Roundtable talk by Takeshi Kondo, director of Itochu </F>
Corporation's Political and Economic Research Institute; 
Atsuyuki Sassa, former chief of the Cabinet Security Affairs 
Office; and Haruhiko Shibuya, director general of International 
Information Bureau of the Foreign Ministry; chaired by 
unidentified GAIKO FORUM staff member on 20 December 1993, 
entitled: "How To Strengthen the Functions of Collecting, 
Analyzing and Communicating Information;" place not given; first 
paragraph is GAIKO FORUM introduction] 
  [Text] Information has gained more importance for Japan's 
diplomacy, because the framework of confrontation between the 
United States and the Soviet Union collapsed and international 
order has since become flamboyant. Now, once more the 
importance of informing people and of disseminating information 
to foreign countries must be recognized. At the same time 
information activities and their understanding must be altered 
drastically. 
<H5>  Background of International Information Bureau's Formation </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] It is advocated that Japan has to strengthen 
its diplomacy and that the functions of collecting information 
and the like must also be strengthened. In August 1993, the 
Foreign Ministry went through a major reorganization process 
which resulted in the creation of the International Information 
Bureau, specializing in the collection of information. Mr. 
Shibuya, you are the bureau's first director, please tell us how 
the bureau came about and its characteristics. 
  [Shibuya] As for collecting diplomatic information, there 
have been both criticism and advice from both within and 
without. The Persian Gulf war broke out at the very time it was 
thought that something had to be done about information 
collection, and the Council for Administrative Reform 
recommended in its report the strengthening of information 
collection systems. Taking that opportunity, the Foreign 
Ministry was reorganized. 
  Its main purpose was to reinforce the policymaking and 
information fields. In the policymaking field, the Foreign 
Policy Bureau, with the former United Nations Bureau as its 
foundation, came into being. In the information field, the 
International Information Bureau was established, with the 
Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau as its 
predecessor. 
  The former Information Analysis, Research, and Planning 
Bureau had three functions: collection and analysis of 
information, policy planning, and comprehensive security 
affairs. The comprehensive security affairs and policy planning 
functions were transferred to the Foreign Policy Bureau, and the 
function of collecting and analyzing information was separated 
to become an independent specialized bureau. Being newly 
established, the bureau faces various problems. But on the 
grounds that collecting and analyzing information has something 
to do with policymaking and that such collection and analysis of 
information which is helpful to policymaking is urgently needed, 
I am attempting swift and effective coordination with and 
relaying information to the policymaking field. 
  The collection and analysis of information must be dealt 
with 
in a highly technical way. A considerably large part of 
information collection and analysis is still done by medieval 
manual methods, but I will try to utilize readily available 
high-tech machines. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] I suppose that the Gulf war should have been 
an earthshaking incident for you. But, when Japan was under the 
U.S. occupation after the war and then the framework of 
confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union was 
firmly established, I think Japan seemed to have had no need of 
seriously collecting information itself. Such a trend was not 
only limited to the information field, the Japanese diplomatic 
posture was in a kind of lukewarm situation. In this 
connection, what do you think are the weak points of Japanese 
diplomacy, Mr. Shibuya? 
  [Shibuya] One of them is that part of the work of the 
collection and analysis of information, relatively speaking, is 
not systematized. And a considerably larger part of it relies 
upon individual techniques and talents. These individuals will 
leave the job sooner or later, leaving nothing to be passed on. 
In that sense, an orderly systematization of the work must be 
carried out. 
  On top of this, as you have mentioned earlier, I think Japan 
has been so accustomed to the Cold War structure in which the 
situation did not change rapidly that its sensitivity toward 
information has become stolid. What is important is how to 
revive that sensitivity to information. I have to admit my 
sensitivity has also become numb. 
  Let me tell my own experience relating to the interim 
agreement on the Middle East peace about which it was 
occasionally reported that Israel and PLO were making secret 
contacts. Although I was informed that they were having 
contacts, a small, not an all-out, effort was made to put 
feelers out extensively because the contacts did not yield any 
results. 
  As for North Korea [DPRK], Kim Yong-chu [as published] was a 
surprise in a sense in becoming a member of the Political Bureau 
of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] and the DPRK's vice 
president. I am excited about it because a man who had 
disappeared after a reported defeat in the power struggle to 
succeed Kim Il-song made an abrupt reappearance in July 1993 and 
was reinstated as a Political Bureau member and became vice 
president in December. 
  [Sassa] The same was true about Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of 
Russia's Liberal Democratic Party. Everybody failed to take 
note of him. 
  [Shibuya] Our immediate concern in the analysis of Russian 
affairs was focused on the political viewpoint of whether the 
presidential faction could muster a majority. In that sense, 
the great leap of Zhirinovskiy and his faction exceeded our 
expectations. Opinion surveys frequently conducted these days 
were to blame for it. These surveys were conducted among urban 
citizens, and their results were strongly in favor of the 
reformists and the presidential faction. It can be said that 
little consideration was given to such technical restrictions in 
the opinion survey conducted in Russia which started to follow 
the process of democratization and gulped down the survey 
results. Another point I have to reflect upon is that I paid 
little attention to the fact that the two extremes of right and 
left are most likely to gain strength in elections conducted 
under bad economic conditions. 
<H5>  Informing the People Gains Importance </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you for your frank remarks. Now Mr. 
Kondo, I suppose the life and death of business depends on a 
corporation's information collection activities, and in that 
sense private activities in the years following the end of WWII 
were serious enough, were they not? 
  [Kondo] From now on, however, it will be more serious, I 
think. For a nation, the role of information activities is 
gaining conspicuous weight more than ever now that the structure 
of the Cold War has disintegrated. In the three fields of 
information activities -- collection, analysis, and 
communication -- I feel that communicating information to the 
people will become more and more important from now on, 
especially in Japan's case. 
  It was mentioned earlier that the Japanese people naturally 
reached a consensus on Japan's diplomacy while the Cold War 
structure existed between East and West. Consequently, little 
effort was needed to build up a consensus among the people. I 
think now the time has come when the people's consensus must be 
actively sought for the state. In that connection, it seems to 
be very important to communicate information to the people. In 
a democracy, an effective diplomacy cannot be pursued, whatever 
good policies there are, unless a fundamental consensus of the 
people exists. 
  I have worked in Washington for a long time, and from that 
experience I strongly believe in the importance of such 
enlightenment of the people. My tenure began in 1987 when the 
Cold War structure started to tumble and the United States began 
to have a hard time putting together an American consensus on 
diplomacy. For example, congressional discontent with the 
Japanese response to the Gulf crisis came out in the open, 
resulting in the overwhelming support of a resolution demanding 
pulling out U.S. forces in Japan and such. It was one of the 
foreboddings that suggested extreme difficulty in building up a 
popular consensus strongly related to the base of the future 
order of mutual security between Japan and the United States. 
By the same token, I feel that enlightening the Japanese people 
on diplomatic problems will become more important from now on. 
  One more thing I have to add to the three elements of 
information I mentioned earlier is that the nation as a whole 
should not neglect to disseminate information to the outside 
world. Of course it is important for the government to send 
information to counterparts in other nations, but for future 
diplomacy it is imperative to provide the ordinary people of 
other nations with correct information. From now on, 
democratization processes will make headway in many countries, 
including Russia and China. Unless backed up by popular 
consensus, other nations cannot be expected to pursue wholesome 
policies toward Japan at all times. Therefore, I think direct 
communication with the people of other countries is an 
indispensable means of future diplomacy. 
  I firmly believe that we need to realize once more the 
importance of the two factors: communicating information to the 
Japanese people and disseminating information to the outside 
world. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] We featured in our September 1993 issue the 
subject of "How To Strengthen External Dissemination of 
Information From Japan." A reader suggested that the matter of 
news agencies also should have been included in our review. 
  [Kondo] Certainly that matter should be given consideration, 
but in my opinion as much as one half of the works of the 
Foreign Ministry should be directed toward domestic purposes, to 
put it in extreme terms. Close examination of the U.S. State 
Department reveals that it is engaged in active enlightenment 
activities in the United States. Each state has a number of 
organizations like the foreign affairs council, and the State 
Department dispatches lecturers there, sponsors symposiums to 
discuss diplomatic and international problems among government 
officials and private citizens with such organizations as the 
core, and engages in various other activities. 
  In addition, there is such an interesting system as the 
"diplomat in residence." Under this system, the State 
Department loans foreign service officials to universities or 
think tanks and even to domestic enterprises for a certain 
period of time. Likewise, the U.S. State Department has a very 
strong recognition of the importance of information 
communication and enlightenment work about diplomatic problems 
for the benefit of the people. I was greatly impressed by the 
government recognition of the fact that the basis of diplomacy 
lies in the making of popular consensus in a democracy. 
  After the collapse of the Cold War structure, Japan's 
domestic opinion is likely to waver in various phases of 
international problems. There is no entity other than the 
Foreign Ministry that can attempt to build up a consensus at the 
level of the people, in order for Japan to conduct diplomatic 
efforts in pursuance of a long-range national interest. 
<H5>  Automatic Overseas Complaints System Recommended </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] So far we have discussed wide-ranging subjects 
such as collection, analysis, communicating, and dissemination 
of information. Let me hear Mr. Sassa's views about them. 
  [Sassa] First of all, I must point out that Japan has 
extremely few information experts. In the case of the United 
States, competitive relations exist between the State Department 
and the Central Intelligence Agency, and DIA [Defense 
Intelligence Agency] cuts in between them. In spite of some 
evil effects, fierce competition in the field of international 
intelligence is waged among at least three powerful government 
organizations, the State Department, CIA, and DIA, resulting in 
sharpening and improving abilities of information collection and 
in mutual criticism. 
  For example, during the Gulf war, only CIA's analysts of 
reconnaissance satellites predicted the breakout of war, while 
the State Department was criticized for having optimistic views 
about the situation, exemplified by U.S. Ambassador Glaspie's 
taking leave. As the result, the State Department underwent 
improvement. Such competitive relations are not found in Japan. 
That is a serious problem. 
  Now, let me cite Swiss examples. Switzerland uses the 
universal conscription system and every citizen is an 
intelligence officer. As far as I know, everyone working at a 
Swiss bank or firm is a reserve officer until age 50. 
Therefore, all businessmen are concerned about politicomilitary 
affairs. Whenever I meet a Swiss banker or journalist, I am 
questioned without fail. And they write reports. It seems they 
have to write reports probably twice a year at designated times. 
And some of them even make overseas calls from Geneva to me in 
Tokyo. 
  I think the way to improve information collection abilities 
is to have multiple intelligence organizations competing among 
themselves and to make every citizen an intelligence officer. 
  I had an experience working in Hong Kong, and it turned out 
to be trading firms, not journalists who had the most correct 
information when riots broke out. Journalists come to the 
consulate-general for information and get wrong information. 
[laughter] The consulate- general has to use diplomatic 
language, so it cannot say anything offending to the host 
government. 
  I was in Saigon when the Viet Cong launched the Tet 
offensive, and everyone knew South Vietnam was beaten. When 
gunshots were heard, all South Vietnamese soldiers fled, 
throwing away their uniforms and rifles. Only the U.S., ROK, 
and Philippine soldiers were fighting the war. At night, flares 
were incessantly shot up to prevent the Viet Cong from making 
movements. I thought it was a stupid war and I told the U.S. 
consul-general what I had in mind when I came back home: "In my 
opinion, the war is being lost and it would be better for the 
United States to disengage at a proper time. Americans are 
saying so and everyone I meet says it is a stupid war." The 
U.S. consul-general was very furious and retorted that it was 
nonsense because the war was being won at the time. He has a 
kind of mentality that the war would soon be finally won. So I 
showed the films I had shot in Saigon to the CIA and FBI people 
who wanted to see them. The shots showed such a hopeless 
situation of only American soldiers seriously performing their 
duty or ammunition transport vehicles stuck in traffic 
congestion. They seemed to have agreed with my opinion and 
probably they made such reports. It will come to no good unless 
situations are covered by several organizations. 
  In Japan it is a rule that the man in charge of information 
at all government offices is rotated every two years. As things 
are, the capabilities of analysts will in no way be improved. 
So I have proposed setting up career positions in the 
information/intelligence field. Once in that position, a man in 
either administrative or appointee posts would not have to have 
subordinates. Promotions in grade and pay raises will suffice. 
Having dozens of people in the grades of information experts, 
bureau directors, and division chiefs in grade without 
subordinates will not matter. The analytical capabilities will 
not improve nor will information experts be nurtured unless a 
system is created where everybody is engaged in his specific 
duty for his career. 
  Third, as for relaying information, there is a vertical 
bureaucracy preventing horizontal communication, and in trading 
firms information will not be passed to competitors. The mass 
media compete among themselves for scoops. There will be no 
opposition to the idea that all information will end up in the 
Office of the Prime Minister. Information will not be 
circulated horizontally. 
  On July 1, 1986, Messrs. Nakasone and Gotoda made an attempt 
to strengthen the cabinet. Created were the five cabinet 
offices of internal affairs, external affairs, security affairs, 
information research, and public relations. Meetings were held 
frequently to maintain active horizontal communication. The 
five chiefs chosen by Mr. Gotoda had quite an experience of 
exchanges and broad viewpoints that resulted in smooth 
functioning. Mr. Gotoda created the cabinet liaison office of 
information to smooth the horizontal flow of information. That 
meeting was participated in by the director of the Information 
Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, 
the Security Bureau director of the National Police Agency, the 
Defense Policy Bureau director of the Defense Agency, the deputy 
director general of the Public Security Investigation Agency, 
and the director general of the Cabinet Information Research 
Office, and occasionally the director general of the Cabinet 
External Affairs Office in order to make it function. However, 
the organization has become a skeleton since Messrs. Nakasone 
and Gotoda are gone and others, including me, resigned. When the 
office was set up, antiterror measures for the Seoul Olympics 
and the Tiananmen incident were dealt with, with a smooth flow 
of information. 
  There was an absolute rule that no paperwork would be made. 
The deputy chief cabinet secretary would report to the prime 
minister and no contents of the meeting would be told to 
subordinates nor revealed to reporters. After meetings, 
reporters flooded us with questions to find out what the 
subjects of the meeting were, but we did not tell because of the 
rule. This way of handling information was carried out for one 
and a half years. This is one form of attempt. I do not mean 
this is the best way of communicating information, but I think 
it is better to report to the prime minister and then let him 
reveal the information. For that purpose, an assistant is 
needed and it can be the deputy chief cabinet secretary, because 
the prime minister is busy. He must not reveal the source of 
information and only say that it was reported. I think this way 
will do well. 
  As for disseminating information to the outside world, I 
have been advocating the creation of an automatic contest system 
since my incumbency. It is a system whereby an objection is 
automatically made. It can be explained like this. The 
International Press Division of the Foreign Ministry screens all 
foreign media reports connected with Japan. The very same 
things are being done by the domestic and foreign divisions of 
the Cabinet Research Office and briefings are given twice a week 
on behalf of the prime minister. And for example, if THE NEW 
YORK TIMES writes something absurd about Japan, a counter 
article is immediately made public. When a certain country says 
something far from the truth, an objection is raised at once. 
Japan is not used to raising objections, however unreasonable 
the things are that are said about it. But I think this action 
of raising protests amounts to the dissemination of messages 
from Japan. 
  This dissemination is not limited to protests or objections. 
When Japan receives a message, it should immediately hold 
meetings and make a reply. What is unwise about Japan is that 
it does not return calls to those who sent messages to Japan. 
It is necessary to return calls or to make protests positively 
to the mass media when required. The protestor can be anybody, 
and there is no rule that it ought to be the Foreign Ministry. 
When an absurd article is carried by THE NEW YORK TIMES, a 
refutation must be made within a week by somebody. I think 
Japan lacks in such action, leaving it at the mercy of criticism 
and bashing, suffering a great loss. I suggest the Foreign 
Ministry make up a list of those who can make such refutations 
and work out a system for immediate refutation. 
<H5>  How To Polish Information Sense </H5>
  [Kondo] In that connection, the United States makes good use 
of the abilities of private citizens. Not only in the field of 
dissemination, but also in the collection and analysis of 
information Japan should come up with a good idea about 
utilizing private abilities. Japan needs to have more 
participation by academia in diplomatic debates, and it is a 
problem that Japan fundamentally lacks in think tanks in the 
true sense. Think tanks in the true sense means that they have 
to be nonprofit, independent, and specialized in public policy. 
There are no such think tanks in Japan. Therefore they have to 
be created by all means. This matter has to be given serious 
consideration now that the structure of the Cold War has 
disintegrated. If Japan comes to possess such firmly 
established think tanks specialized in public policy, refutation 
in academic terms and theory can be made as Mr. Sassa proposed. 
  European nations and the United States are doing that very 
well. In the collection of information, attempts are made to 
make good use of private abilities such as those of college 
professors and private organizations like think tanks which are 
entrusted with such work, by allocating quite a large budget 
amount. Thus they are contributing to the dissemination of 
information. I think this is one of the future tasks Japan has 
to deal with. 
  [Shibuya] I agree with the points raised so far. Although 
not quite enough, the Foreign Ministry has been making every 
effort. As examples of the contest system, I can point to the 
fact that the consulate-general in New York writes a letter to 
the editor when it finds in THE NEW YORK TIMES articles critical 
of Japan or that the consul-general makes an appointment with 
the editor for a talk. I take your suggestions as advice that 
the Japanese Government as a whole should undertake such 
activities on a wider scope in setup and scale. I, myself, 
think such a necessity exists. 
  [Sassa] In the United States are found many public-oriented, 
independent, nonprofit information officers who are well paid 
and freely stalk the world, although it is not known who 
sponsors and pays them. 
  They are stalking because they can contact primary sources 
in 
collecting information. Whatever efforts are made to strengthen 
the international division of the Foreign Ministry, of the 
Cabinet Research Office, and the foreign news departments of all 
newspapers, pictures and written articles are nothing more than 
processed secondary information. In Japan, however, these 
information officers are troubled by a shortage of travel 
expenses and have no sponsors. 
  For everybody to get in touch with the primary source of 
information, it is necessary to have a feelers system, I think. 
For example, Clinton takes over the new government in the 
United States and Tokyo is flooded with Americans, as if all 
Washington moved to Tokyo. They boast of meeting such and such 
personalities and ask the Japanese what they think of Clinton. 
Like running a dragnet, they collect information. Democrats 
and Republicans; it makes no difference. When Republican Bush 
took over from Reagan, another Republican, a horde of feelers 
came over. 
  What Japan does in such a case is, contrary to the United 
States, to send delegations to promote the new government that 
has come into power. Or, when the new prime minister makes his 
first visit to the United States, he is accompanied by an 
entourage of about 60 people, consisting of three persons from 
each ministry. I think it would have been better for each 
ministry to have sent delegates to their counterparts in the 
United States when Clinton won the Presidency, and collected 
information and fed it back home. 
  Now is the time to send many feelers to Moscow, I think. The 
first principle of information collection is to get in touch 
with the primary source of information. That costs money, and 
private think tanks use ample funds. The government must have a 
budget for the purpose, since think tanks cannot be created in 
Japan. 
  [Kondo] I am in complete agreement with you. Sensitivity 
to information was mentioned earlier, and it is a problem for 
both the government and the public to improve it. In that 
connection, I understand the need for money well, and that must 
be provided by the government. 
  [Shibuya] In connection with utilizing private abilities, I 
can see the necessity of strengthening the contacts, exchanges, 
and cooperation with think tanks. But such efforts have not 
turned out to be useful practically, as thought to be. So it 
remains one of the future objectives of our efforts. As for the 
budget for scholarly exchanges, each and every embassy is 
allocated money for research specialists, and I hope this will 
be expanded in the future. 
<H5>  European and U.S. Style Think Tanks Needed for Japan </H5>
  [Sassa] What I also want to point out is the fact that such 
colossal family trusts as Ford or Rockefeller in the United 
States engage in academic activities as well as charities. They 
make contributions to universities and set up nonprofit and 
independent institutes specializing in public policy as 
mentioned earlier. The research institutes of Japanese 
securities companies and banks are all for the benefit of their 
own companies, are they not? 
  [Kondo] They have their own standpoints and interests, and 
sometimes they must to take into consideration the standpoints 
of their clients and specific government offices they are 
related to. In that sense, there are restrictions and they are 
not independent nor specialized in public policy. Future Japan 
absolutely needs institutes possessing the aforementioned three 
conditions. For that purpose, tax systems have to be adjusted 
to make it possible. European tax systems have such provisions, 
and they can be good reference. When such think tanks are 
created in Japan, it will become a lot easier to share 
information throughout the country. Also they can be expected to 
serve as catalysts to form a popular consensus. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] It will take a long time before such a system 
is created. So, what I have in mind is that capable officials 
in each ministry should play the role with certain general 
feelings of solidarity. 
  [Sassa] So far, they have been relied upon for their artisan 
and masterly expertise. These abilities are finished and gone 
after their deaths. That is why systematization is needed. The 
most feasible means are for the Foreign Ministry to earmark a 
large amount of overseas travel expenses and research expenses 
under a overall theme of strengthening information activities. 
As things stand now, research specialists are doing their own 
study rather than studies for the state. 
  [Shibuya] Certainly such aspects exist now. Most research 
specialists are scholars, and it is natural for them to place 
emphasis on their own study. The Foreign Ministry and embassies 
must take the initiative in questioning how they analyze 
situations. I think such exchanges are scarce. 
  [Sassa] I think so, too. Going back to the problem of the 
primary source of information, I think the most welcome service 
for people from foreign countries is providing them with the 
convenience of meeting the right persons and the persons they 
want to see. If you do this, they will let you get in touch 
with primary sources when you go to their countries. It is for 
us to say that we will let you meet the source in person. And 
we get collateral exchanges, since give and take is a rule in 
the information world. Rewards are either money, friendship, or 
grant of convenience. Like business, a deal cannot be struck 
without mutual benefit. 
<H5>  Higher Level of Knowledge of Neighboring Countries Needed </H5>
  [GAIKO FORUM] In the future collection and analysis of 
information, what area is the important one? 
  [Sassa] It is North Korea after all. 
  [Shibuya] It may be so as a matter of reality. But in a 
medium and long-range view, it is necessary to be aware of the 
problem of China. 
  [Sassa] It is a problem related to Deng Xiaoping and how 
long he will live. 
  [Shibuya] In a short-range view, it is important to watch 
how the transition will be made. 
  [Sassa] I think the gravest problem is North Korea, because 
Kim Chong-il alone could not be the only heir-apparent to Kim 
Il- song who wanted to make his son the dictator's successor. 
Something must have happened or must be taking place. The 
gravest problem of 1994 is North Korea. And what will become of 
Russia's Zhirinovskiy in the elections in 1994? It will pose a 
serious problem if a man who utters such things becomes the 
president. When we, in reading the situation, judge that 
Zhirinovskiy may win we cannot help but stage campaigns to 
defeat him. I do not think diplomacy should be only passive. 
  [Kondo] Needless to say, Japan has to make an in-depth study 
of its neighboring countries -- Russia, the Korean Peninsula, 
China, and the United States. Those countries are not 
understood well, contrary to what everybody thinks. Japan has 
to upgrade its level of knowledge about these four nations by 
all the people. Especially, unexpectedly few people really know 
about the United States although it seems that everybody 
understands that country. In recent years, it seems that the 
study of the United States in the true sense has been neglected. 
When I was in Washington, I felt that the United States was 
very active in regional studies, including Russia and China, and 
some of them had a wide scope and deep study. From now on, 
Japan has to deepen and improve its knowledge about Russia, the 
Korean Peninsula, China, and the United States, including their 
national traits with which Japanese interests are deeply 
involved. 
  Especially on the Korean peninsula, various things are 
expected to take place from now to next year and the year after 
next. With the present level of the people's knowledge, there 
is a possibility that Japan may face a very difficult situation 
in carrying out its diplomacy based a long-range national 
interests. In this connection, I hope that regional studies, 
including these areas, and activities to enlighten the people 
will be initiated as soon as possible. 
  [Shibuya] In connection with Japan-U.S. relations, I have 
experienced not knowing American things, contrary to my 
expectations. When I was working in Chicago, my son waned to 
see the Chicago Cubs play. So I bought the tickets, entered the 
stadium on the first base side and found the home team on the 
third base side. When I used this episode at another place to 
illustrate how difficult it is for Japan and the United States 
to mutually understand each other, I was told that the home team 
is on the first base side there. Thus I exposed how ignorant I 
was about the versatility of the United States. It is harmless 
as long as the topic is confined to baseball, but what will 
happen if our talks are at the level of politics and economics? 
  On the contrary, the United States seems to have much 
difficulty in understanding Japan. For example, Michael 
Crichton wrote a best selling novel "Rising Sun." On the last 
page is found a list of books that the writer read in order to 
write this novel. The bibliography is voluminous, listing books 
and academic articles written in English. He wrote this novel 
after serious study of Japan. He explained in detail what 
"keiretsu" and relations between "senpai" [seniors] and "kohai" 
[juniors] are. But when police officers in "senpai" and "kohai" 
relations are talking to each other, the book describes that 
"senpai" addresses his junior "kohai" in Japanese and tells him 
what to do. The Japanese juniors address to their seniors 
"senpai," but do not address their juniors "kohai." And that 
usage appears frequently in the novel, despite the fact that the 
senior officer is supposed to be well versed in Japanese 
affairs. If the writer had been a little modest and let a 
Japanese read his manuscript before publication, he would not 
have made such an error. I learned the lesson that a modest 
posture is necessary even in a matter I think I am well versed 
in. [laughter] 
  [Kondo] Such a thing can happen at any time. Especially in 
connection with Japan-U.S. relations, there is a general 
understanding in Japan that the United States has changed with 
the advent of the Clinton administration. But that is not true. 
With the termination of the Cold War, the United States has 
returned to what it used to be. When looked at historically, 
the United States in the Cold War structure was quite a peculiar 
country, and it has only returned to the original state. From 
now on, Japan has to maintain relations with the United States 
in its original state. With an understanding that the United 
States has changed because the Clinton administration came in, a 
correct long-range response cannot be expected. 
  This is not limited to the case of the United States. In 
handling information, one thing we have to be careful about is 
to grasp a phenomenon in the large frame of the big currents of 
history. Otherwise, mistakes tend to occur. 
  In this connection, I want to point out another difficult 
problem in eliminating presumption for those handling 
information. If you have beliefs when you are engaged in 
information activities closely related to business, you tend to 
take note of the facts in the way you hope for them to be and 
lead your analysis in that direction. Information activities 
leading to accept a fact as it is without prejudice are 
difficult for us, but it is undoubtedly one of the principles 
that we have to observe. 
  [Sassa] It is a warning against mixing understanding and 
judgment of values in the process of information collection. 
  [Kondo] A look at the information organizations of the U.S. 
Government reveals efforts to clearly separate the division that 
handles collection and analysis of information from the policy- 
making division. It shows that no presumption is allowed in 
information. 
  [Shibuya] In Japan's case, policymaking leads the way and 
information analysis is frequently influenced by policies. This 
must be corrected, I think. 
<H5>  Japan-U.S. Relations Require Incessant Efforts </H5>
  [Sassa] Assuming that Japan works out a 100-year plan, it 
should be noted that Japan is an island nation, not part of the 
continental nations. Therefore, in its 2,000-year history, 
Japan has never concluded an offensive and defensive alliance 
with China, the ROK, or Russia. It was always with the United 
States. So the future diplomatic keynote entirely lies in 
Japan-U.S. relations. 
  In that connection, what Mr. Kondo said is perfectly correct 
in that the United States has never liked Japan. It only 
pretended to like Japan because the strong adversary, the Soviet 
Union, existed. And now it has returned to its original place. 
It is a big mistake to think that things will become better 
when the generation that was at war is replaced by the next one. 
Hatred and prejudice are reproduced. Therefore incessant 
efforts are needed to prevent the very vulnerable Japan-U.S. 
relations from breaking up. In that sense, there is a need to 
make refutations. Misunderstanding can be avoided by making 
persuasive refutation, not a sensational one. I was 
specifically referring to the United States when I made the 
suggestion of a contest system. The spreading of news by word 
of mouth is astoundingly fast in the United States, and most 
Americans know that a Japanese prime minister made 
discriminatory remarks about race. Bad things, however minor, 
spread in no time. I visit the United States frequently, and a 
female immigration officer surprised me by saying, "A prime 
minister should not say such things. It is bad to say somebody 
is uneducated and lazy." On another occasion a taxi driver said 
to me, "We are lazy, as you know." I do not know where they 
picked up such information, but it is certain that such 
destructive information spreads in no time. 
  [Kondo] In that sense, we have to make logical refutations 
and at the same time make a strong point in relaying messages to 
the common American people that Japan and the United States 
share a common sense of values and common national interests 
when making refutations. And that message should be relayed 
repeatedly. 
  [Shibuya] Another necessary point in making complaints is to 
take considerate care of the feelings of the other party. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] One of our conclusions is that we do not know 
the United States as we are expected to and that the Japan-U.S. 
relations are more important than serious situations in Korea, 
Russia, and China. 
  [Sassa] Through dissemination of international messages, 
both Japan and the United States are required to exert efforts 
to dispel misunderstanding. The Japanese people are less aware 
of the other party, contrary to what is expected of them. So, 
domestic public relations become necessary. There is 
information not found in newspapers and the other side of the 
story and good stories. Such stories should be told as 
information and in public relations. In other words, attempts 
should be made to upgrade the people's understanding. 
  [Shibuya] Looking from different angles, the Foreign 
Ministry and the Japanese Government intently spoke of 
internationalization several years ago. And to a certain 
degree, Japanese society has been internationalized. The people 
have come to be interested in world situations and acquired 
knowledge. Naturally they will look at foreign policy with 
severe eyes, and some people may think that they can do the same 
thing. For them it is necessary to give correct information. 
<H5>  The Problems of Belittling Human Intelligence </H5>
  [Sassa] It was mentioned earlier that information should be 
read in the currents of history. Information can also be 
divided into electronics intelligence and human intelligence, 
but human intelligence has begun to be neglected. 
  The best example can be found in December 1979. At dawn, 
56,000 Soviet troops pushed into Afghanistan. Everybody missed 
it, and the United States asked us if we knew the name of the 
Soviet commander. We had been totally dependent on the United 
States for information, how we could know. In those days, 
President Carter was at odds with the CIA, insisting that no 
intelligence officers were needed because reconnaissance 
satellites were at work. Thus the United States could not 
predict the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan nor the Vietnamese 
invasion into Cambodia. Satellites could reveal that 50,000 
Soviet troops and so many tanks were in Afghanistan, but the 
United States could not give the name of the Soviet commander 
because it had no human intelligence. It makes a big difference 
who commands the troops, Rommel or Rundstedt? Therefore, the 
name of the commander is first-grade information when military 
conflicts break out. This can be picked up through human 
intelligence, not by satellites. 
  [Shibuya] In that connection, when the Soviet troops invaded 
Afghanistan I was chief of the Analysis Division and was told by 
an able diplomat of a certain nation that there was little 
possibility of invasion by the Soviet Union. He backed up his 
prediction saying PRAVDA had carried an article in praise of 
Afghan President Amin for his policy of nonalignment. Taking 
note of this, I did my own analysis at about six o'clock in the 
evening. That evening I had a meeting, so I decided to send a 
telegram the next morning, and after attending the meeting I 
went home. The next day the Soviet troops invaded and I 
survived the mistake of sending wrong information because of my 
laziness. 
  And as was mentioned earlier, machines cannot read human 
minds. During the Iran-Iraq war, an American diplomat came to my 
office and spent three or four hours talking about this and 
that. So I asked him, "I do not have any information, but you 
should have. Why do you waste your time having lengthy chats 
with me?" His answer was, "I have information, all right. But 
when a prediction is made that a certain city under siege by 
either Iranian or Iraqi troops is to fall the next day, the next 
morning the besieging troops are gone somewhere else." In other 
words, troop movements could be detected by satellites, but he 
could not read their minds. He was at a loss as to what Teheran 
or Baghdad were thinking, but his chat with me was helpful, he 
said. It was an encouraging word for me. That sort of 
situation existed at that time. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] These days information is regarded as 
something floating in the air, but it is useless if not 
accompanied by human contacts. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Interview with Komeito General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa by </F>
unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Why is a cabinet reshuffle being 
discussed now? 
  [Ichikawa] If we look back over the past seven months, we 
must admit there have been many conflicts among the ruling 
parties and between the government and the ruling parties. 
These have involved such issues as the partial opening of the 
rice market, political reform, tax cuts, and making financial 
arrangements to cover the losses arising from such tax cuts. 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, for instance, has 
said one thing while Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has said 
another, and both were expressing views on matters about which 
the government and the ruling parties were only about to start 
discussion. 
  It has been like having two prime ministers in the same 
office. However, the government can be said to have cleared a 
big hurdle now that some major issues have been resolved, and 
Prime Minister Hosokawa thinks it is about time he did something 
to improve unity in the cabinet. 
  [Correspondent] When do you think the reshuffle will come, 
and how extensive will it be? 
  [Ichikawa] I think the reshuffle will probably come after 
the revised political reform bills are passed. This reshuffle 
should be considered the coalition government's finishing touch. 
The size of the reshuffle will depend on what the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] wants. If it decides none of 
its current six ministers should be changed, it will be a minor 
reshuffle. As far as Komeito is concerned, we have no plans to 
change our existing cabinet members. However, if other parties 
in the coalition decide to change their people, we might think 
about realigning the Komeito party lineup as well. 
  [Correspondent] Some coalition members have complained about 
your alliance with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General 
Secretary Ichiro Ozawa -- the so-called "Ichi-Ichi" duo -- which 
they see as leading the coalition. What do you have to say to 
them? 
  [Ichikawa] We had hoped that the SDPJ, the largest party in 
the coalition, and the Sakigake-Japan New Party alliance, from 
which the prime minister and chief cabinet secretary were 
chosen, would become the axis of the coalition. But they have 
failed to fulfill that leading role over the past seven months. 
As a result, Shinseito and Komeito have had to play major roles 
in leading the coalition. Ruling parties simply cannot put off 
taking action on pending issues and then pretend these issues 
have been resolved. So, Mr. Ozawa and I have had to make 
decisions. Of course, we have also tried to take care not to 
hurt the SDPJ too much. 
  [Correspondent] Within the coalition, people are talking 
about a tripolar political power structure, which means drawing 
a clear line between Shinseito and Komeito on the one hand and 
the rest of the parties on the other. What do you think of that? 
  [Ichikawa] I think the idea suggests that Mr. Murayama, the 
SDPJ chairman, and Mr. Takemura want the SDPJ and Shinto 
Sakigake [Harbinger Party] to take the lead in running the 
coalition and the process of political realignment. If Sakigake 
and the SDPJ are willing to use their leadership and not to run 
away from issues, we will be happy to follow them. But, in 
order to exercise leadership, they must first undergo internal 
reform so that they can agree on and adopt policies appropriate 
for members of the coalition. I think the SDPJ should first 
reform itself if it wants to bear the responsibilities of a 
ruling party, rather than talk about a tripolar political system 
or a realignment of political parties. 
  [Correspondent] When will full-scale political realignment 
start? 
  [Ichikawa] It depends on the following three factors: A 
strategy on how to organize political forces to fight the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; the selection of candidates to 
run in the 300 single-seat electoral districts; and the date of 
the general election. If the ruling parties fail to agree on a 
future strategy to deal with the LDP, political realignment will 
be delayed. If realignment proceeds without agreement within 
the coalition parties, the coalition will collapse. We are now 
in a dilemma. But by spring, when the new election law is 
enacted and the zoning of electoral districts is settled, 
negotiations to select candidates will start and at that time we 
may be able to reach a cooperative agreement. 
  [Correspondent] What will be the main basis for the 
cooperation? 
  [Ichikawa] It will be neither a choice between conservatives 
or liberals, nor a preference for small government rather than 
large. Instead, it will be the maintenance of the reform policy 
line. Now that we have a new electoral system, we have the job 
of giving life to the system and of seeing if it produces 
representatives suited to government. However, there is more 
reform work to be done, such as breaking collusion among 
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, and changing the way 
the Diet functions. 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How will the ruling parties deal 
with the simultaneous elections next year for local assemblies 
and the House of Councillors? 
  [Ichikawa] As a matter of principle, the parties should 
compete independently. In local elections, the voices of local 
electors should be respected. In the House of Councillors 
election, electoral cooperation will be possible only if the 
parties can agree on a future strategy. In addition, the 
parties should at least share the same position on basic 
policies, such as defense and diplomacy, so as to be able to 
jointly support the administration. If the SDPJ wants to start 
talking about cooperation in the House of Councillors' election, 
we will ask it to clarify, by July or August, whether or not it 
still wants a tripolar system. 
  [Correspondent] The government was criticized for its 
concept of a national welfare tax. How will reform of the tax 
system be promoted in the future? 
  [Ichikawa] For one thing, discussion should be held openly. 
We failed to do that this time, with the failure largely the 
result of actions by a certain party. We will be criticized 
once again for being abrupt if we do not hold open discussion of 
this issue next time. As there is now, at the request of the 
SDPJ, an agreement to set up a consultative body to discuss the 
matter and reach a conclusion this year, the rest is up to the 
SDPJ. If it opposes a new tax system or an increase in the 
consumption tax, there will be no tax cuts.

  [Text] The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy [MTIE] 
on 4 March issued a statement reporting: "If the United States 
seeks to impose Super 301 trade-sanctions on the ROK, the ROK 
intends to refer the issue to the World Trade Organization 
[WTO], which is slated to begin in 1995 for the settlement of 
disputes." 
  In the statement entitled "the MTIE's position on the 
revival 
of Super 301 authority on trade-sanctions," Kim Chol-su, 
minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy, said: "The MTIE calls 
on the United States to restrain from invoking the authority 
arbitrarily [chauijogin]." 
  The minister also warned that: "The reinstatement of the 
Super 301 provision runs counter to the spirit of Uruguay Round, 
which concluded at the end of last year. We express concern 
that this may hinder the world's free trade order at a time when 
the WTO is about to begin."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yu Kun-ha] </F>
  [Text] With the U.S. administration's reinstatement of the 
Super 301 trade provision, Korea is likely to feel additional 
heat for market opening from its largest trading partner. 
Although the primary target of the U.S. action is obviously 
Japan, trade experts point out the United States may also beef 
up pressure on other countries including Korea which it believes 
still uses unfair trade practices against it. 
  Officials at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy 
(MOTIE), however, ruled out the possibility of Korea being 
picked as a priority foreign country (PFC) by the U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) for investigation of alleged unfair trade 
practices. 
  As grounds, they cited the balance in trade between the two 
countries, the existence of a well-functioning official channel 
for dialogue and Korea's accommodation during the Uruguay Round 
talks of most of the U.S. demands for market opening. 
  Bilateral trade between Korea and United States has 
continued 
to strike a balance since 1991. Before then Korea had enjoyed 
surpluses. Trade officials from the two countries have been 
regularly meeting at the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) 
where they discuss ways to head off trade friction and promote 
industrial cooperation. 
  "In all, trade relations between the two countries have 
recently been free from any serious problems," said Chon Sang-u, 
a ministry official in charge of trade with the U.S. 
  Although the United States may not include Korea on the list 
of PFCs, the possibility still remains that it may want to apply 
additional pressure on Seoul to open its markets wider. 
  In fact, during the recently ended DEC in Washington, D.C., 
the United States demanded that Korea shorten its schedule for 
opening the telecommunications and education markets, abolish 
restrictions on investment in the distribution sector and 
improve retailing practices. 
  "Riding on the offensive momentum provided by the revival of 
Super 301, the U.S. may seek to put forward additional demands 
that Korea open wider its financial and service markets, 
strengthen protection of intellectual property rights and amend 
unfair wholesale and retail practices," said Chong Song-ki, an 
official of the Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA). 
  MOTIE officials said that although such a possibility cannot 
be ruled out, the government does not at the moment consider any 
acceleration of its original market opening schedule. 
  "There's nothing particular that we can do now about Super 
301. We will do business as usual," said Han Yong-su, 
director-general of the ministry's Trade Cooperation Bureau. 
  "Business as usual," according to Han, includes efforts to 
expand bilateral trade without altering the present balance, 
continue the ongoing drive to wipe out administrative red tape 
and beef up the campaign to "internationalize" Korean society by 
changing outdated norms and practices. 
  The Ministry's official stance is that the U.S. 
administration's revival of the Super 301 clause goes against 
the spirit of the Uruguay Round talks. 
  "We are concerned that the U.S. measure might disrupt the 
newly emerging international economic order under the planned 
inauguration of the World Trade organization (WTO)," the 
ministry said in a press release. 
  The ministry also urged the U.S. administration to refrain 
from invoking the retaliatory trade clause arbitrarily. 
  While predicting that the renewal of Super 301 will not 
fundamentally affect the present smooth trade relations between 
the two countries, the ministry, however, made it clear that if 
and when the United States does take any unfavorable actions 
against Korea, Seoul will cope with them by resorting to the 
WTO's newly established settlement procedures. 
  "Our official position has already been delivered to the 
U.S. 
through diplomatic channels," Han said. 
  Under the revived trade legislation, the USTR will make 
public by the end of this month its survey of trade barriers of 
its trading partners. 
  Based on this survey, called the national trade estimate 
(NTE), the U.S. will select specific trade practices of foreign 
countries for investigation. Thus the survey will give hints 
about which countries will be picked as PFCs. 
  The list of actual PFCs will be announced by Sept. 30 this 
year based on the outcome of investigations. 
  The list of actual PFCs will be announced by Sept. 30 this 
year after six months of investigation of priority foreign 
practices that the USTR want to correct. 
  Negotiations between the USTR and PFCs will begin within 21 
days after the list is announced and will last for 12 to 18 
months. When the negotiations break down, the U.S. 
administration can take unilateral retaliatory measures. 
  "The U.S. administration is not expected to actually go so 
far as to retaliate against its trade partners, although Japan 
may be an exception. But even for Japan, its ultimate aim is 
not to retaliate but to open the Japanese market wider," said 
KFTA's Chong. 
  Korea has experience of succumbing to the U.S. threat to 
invoke the Super 301 clause when it had been in effect during 
the 1989-1990 period. AT the time, to avoid the PFC 
designation, Korea opened its agricultural market wider than it 
wanted and softened restrictions on foreign investment in Korea. 
  According to trade experts, the revived Super 301 clause is 
more threatening than the previous one because it stipulates 
that the U.S. administration hold comprehensive negotiations 
with PFCs on their unfair trade practices.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 5 March 
carry items on the possible impact on the ROK economy of the 
United States' revival of the Super 301. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 carries an 800-word 
editorial entitled "U.S. Economic Hegemonism." The editorial 
begins: "The U.S. Clinton administration revived `Super 301,' 
the foreign trade retaliation law, despite the world's 
consistent opposition to it. We cannot help expressing grave 
concern over this unilateral trade strategy taking the world 
free trade hostage. The United States and Japan, which led the 
situation to this consequence, should feel responsible for it as 
major economic powers and resolve the dispute in a reasonable 
way." The editorial says the U.S. action runs counter to the 
multilateral Uruguay Round system, adding: "The Uruguay Round 
system is faced with a crisis of withering to death even before 
its official signing." The editorial then notes: "The Super 
301 is aimed at Japan and may cause little impact in view of the 
fact that ROK-U.S. trade is balanced and there are few pending 
issues between the two countries. However, in the long run, it 
can be used as a weapon to pressure us to open our goods and 
services market wider. Moreover, this `economic hegemonism' can 
incapacitate multilateral negotiations and curb the world's free 
trade development, bringing about considerable loss for 
exporting countries like us." The editorial then says: "We can 
appreciate the super-tough position the United States is taking 
in view of the fact that the United States has a more than $110 
billion trade deficit (in 1993) over half of which comes from 
its trade deficit with Japan." The editorial then stresses that 
Japan should open its market wider, and urges the United States 
to make internal efforts to improve the deficit situation. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO on page 5 carries an 800-word 
article by reporter Yang Ki-tae entitled "What Impact Will the 
Super 301 Have on Our Economy?" 
  The article begins: "Although the U.S. Super 301 is aimed, 
in the first place, at Japan, it can cause direct and indirect 
shockwaves to our foreign trade and industries. We could even 
become an object of retaliation to the same degree as Japan." 
The article then notes: "The United States is putting 
continuous pressure on the ROK to open financial and 
distribution markets, the market areas for which the Uruguay 
Round negotiation has not reached settlement, and, therefore, 
the Super 301 could be used to pressure the ROK to make 
additional market openings." The article then concludes: "Some 
observers, however, think that the revival of the Super 301 may 
not necessarily be a disadvantage to us. Since sufficient 
dialogue is made between the ROK and the United States on 
pending trade issues through such channels as the Dialogue for 
Economic Cooperation (DEC) and since the ROK government is 
moving toward lifting restrictions in various areas and toward 
internationalization, there will be little chance of the ROK 
being subject to retaliation by the Super 301." 
  The independent, moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN on page 4 
carries an 800-word article by reporter Kim Chong-hyon entitled 
"Our Countermeasures." The article notes: "Although this Super 
301, different from that of 1989 and 1990, is limited as an 
administrative decree and is characterized as primarily aimed at 
Japan, since the `revival' itself could cause enormous shock 
wave, our government is very perplexed." The article then adds: 
"Since the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiation, the 
United States has been requesting the ROK, through such channels 
as the DEC, to more widely open the service market consisting of 
nine areas; to open the financial market earlier; to ensure fair 
competition; to eliminate discrimination against imported cars; 
and to reinforce the protection of intellectual property rights. 
Therefore, the ROK can be classified as a priority negotiation 
list country." 
  The article then adds: "If the United States takes a 
retaliatory measure with its Super 301, the government intends 
to resolve the issue through such channels as the dispute 
settlement procedure of the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
while making efforts to persuade the United States by presenting 
our internationalization program, which includes market opening 
schedules." The article then notes a remark by Han Yong-su, 
director of the Trade Cooperation Division of the Trade, 
Industry, and Resources Ministry: "Although the United States 
has a degree of complaint about its trade with the ROK, the 
United States thinks well of ROK efforts for openness, including 
our opening of the rice market. Even if the Super 301 is put 
into operation, there is little possibility that the United 
States will place the ROK on the priority negotiation list."

  [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. official who 
commented earlier that Washington wants South Korea to repeal 
its National Security Law, said the United States does not 
intend to raise the issue at a bilateral level, the Foreign 
Ministry said Saturday. 
  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard held himself 
personally responsible for the ill-timed and misworded comments 
on the South Korean security law, admitting that he was not the 
appropriate person to make such remarks, Ministry officials said. 
  An official from the South Korean Embassy in Washington met 
with Hubbard and was told the United States does not plan to 
raise the issue as part of the bilateral agenda, they said. 
  "We believe that Mr. Hubbard made these remarks in his 
capacity as deputy secretary of state," one official said. 
  Hubbard told a seminar on Feb. 25 that the United States 
hopes South Korea will abolish its National Security Law, which 
bars any unauthorized contact with North Korea or any activities 
sympathetic to the communist regime. 
  The remarks came under immediate fire as unwelcome 
interference in Seoul's internal affairs. Hubbard drew even 
more criticism because he was chief U.S. working-level delegate 
to nuclear negotiations with North Korea. 
  At the meeting with South Korean Embassy official, Hubbard 
reasserted that his statements were in line with Washington's 
1993 human rights report, which said the South Korean law is 
subject to abuse. 
  Admitting his personal responsibility, Hubbard said he 
should 
not have made such comments in light of his capacity as chief 
negotiator with Pyongyang on nuclear affairs, officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States will discuss the North Korean nuclear situation 
next week to map out future steps after International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections are concluded. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, chief U.S. 
nuclear negotiator with North Korea, will come to Seoul on 
March 10 and meet with several South Korean officials the 
following two days to coordinate a bilateral stance. 
  Gallucci will likely be accompanied by David Brown, chief of 
the Korea desk at the State Department, and Gary Samore, deputy 
chief in charge of non-proliferation. 
  Tom Hubbard, the top U.S. representative at working-level 
negotiations with Pyongyang, is unable to accompany the 
delegation because he is acting as assistant secretary in lieu 
of Winston Lord, who is on a trip to Asia. 
  Seoul and Washington will draw up measures expected after 
the 
IAEA team, currently in the middle of inspections, successfully 
concludes its monitoring of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities in 
another week or so. They will discuss the agenda and principles 
for the next round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, set 
for March 21 in Geneva. 
  A key point concerns their demand for an inter-Korean 
presidential envoy exchange before the high-level talks can open. 
  North Korea has yet to indicate that it will meet this 
demand. Seoul and Washington are expected to reconfirm their 
position that substantive inter-Korean dialogue is a condition 
for the March 21 meeting. 
  Gallucci plans to hold a press conference on March 12 and 
leave the following day.

  [Text] North Korean President Kim Il-song is expected to 
visit China during ROK President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China 
scheduled for 26 March, sources in Beijing said on 5 March. The 
sources reported that the Chinese side, therefore, is very 
likely to arrange inter-Korean summit talks in Beijing, adding 
that China has secretly pushed ahead with these arrangements. 
  The sources said that it was part of this plan that Li 
Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the 
Communist Party of China, visited Pyongyang on 24 February, met 
Kim Il-song, and delivered an invitation to visit China in the 
name of Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary and Chinese president. 
  Meanwhile, a ROK Government source on 5 March reported: "It 
seems true that China invited President Kim Il-song to visit 
China, but there is no possibility of inter-Korean summit talks 
being held in China." 
  The source added: "We understand that China invited 
President Kim Il-song to visit in April. Therefore, the summit 
talks are impossible due to the timing. Even if the two 
presidents were to visit Beijing at the same time, inter-Korean 
summit talks in Beijing would be an awkward arrangement in view 
of the nature of the talks."

  [Text] Seoul, March 7 (YONHAP) -- Presidential spokesman 
Chu Ton-sik on Monday denied foreign press reports that an 
inter-Korean summit meeting may be held in Beijing when South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam visits the Chinese capital in late 
March. 
  "There is no possibility of a South-North summit in Beijing 
during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China," Chu said. 
  "An inter-Korean summit is not such a simple matter as to be 
realized just because the two leaders are visiting Beijing 
nearly at the same time," Chu said. 
  In order for Seoul and Pyongyang to hold a summit, extensive 
consultations and preparations must take place, Chu said. At 
present, there is no possibility that Presidents Kim Yong-sam 
and Kim Il-song will visit Beijing at the same time, Chu added. 
  Reliable sources in Beijing said Monday that the North 
Korean 
president would visit China in May at the latest.

  [Text] Seongnam, Kyonggi Province, March 5 (YONHAP) -- 
Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang urged North Korea on Saturday to 
achieve nuclear transparency and remove all obstacles to peace 
and unification of the Korean peninsula. Yi conveyed the 
message while speaking at the commencement ceremony for the 
reserve officers' training corps held at the students' Central 
Military School in Seongnam, a satellite city on the outskirts 
of Seoul. 
  He said, "North Korea should solve the common problems of 
South and North Korea by showing a more sincere attitude." 
  The North is delaying progress in inter-Korean talks 
intentionally, asking for things having nothing to do with the 
heart of the talks at a recent working-level contact on 
exchanging special envoys, Yi said. 
  "In order to win the unlimited competition in the world, all 
Koreans should concentrate on strengthening the nation's 
international competitiveness. For this, it is most important 
for the military to keep a water-tight national security 
posture."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi Yong-tok voiced confidence Saturday that North Korea 
would eventually agree to exchange special envoys, possibly 
before the Pyongyang-Washington high-level meeting on March 21, 
because it knows the exchange is a must for the talks with the 
United States. 
  In an interview with Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, Yi, 
concurrently national unification board minister, said the 
Seoul-Pyongyang summit proposed by President Kim Yong-sam is 
possible anytime once the exchange is realized, hinting that 
South Korea is making necessary preparations. 
  If North Korea does not meet one of the prerequisites to a 
third-level meeting set by the United States -- full 
implementation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections and an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys -- it 
will have difficulty realizing the March 21 talks in Geneva, Yi 
said. 
  Seoul and Washington have agreed to put off the March 21 
meeting if Pyongyang fails to meet the two conditions, he added. 
  "It is hard to predict the North's attitude," Yi said, 
commenting on the collapse of inter-Korean working-level 
dialogue on Thursday. "But we expect great progress on March 
9," he said. South and North Korea, without attaining tangible 
results on Thursday, agreed in principle to the envoy exchange 
and to meet next week for further discussions. He reiterated 
that Seoul wants to see visits by president-designated envoys 
from each side take place before March 21.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Pak Sung-yong] </F>
  [Text] The border contacts resumed by South and North Korea 
after a break of four months on Thursday have produced few 
results, only endangering the possibility of envoy exchanges 
taking place before March 21 when the third round of 
Washington-Pyongyang high- level talks is supposed to be held. 
  At the working-level talks, the North, on one hand, 
positively responded to the Southern demand that presidential 
envoys be exchanged as early as possible. 
  As for the procedural decision, on the other hand, the 
communist country showed little desire to act, saying, "Since 
there are few differences on the issue, both sides can reach an 
agreement at any time." 
  Accordingly, the South had to be satisfied only with 
securing 
continuity of inter-Korean dialogue by agreeing to meet again at 
10 a.m. at Tongil-gak on the Northern side of the truce village 
of Panmunjom, failing to make up for the four months of 
inactivity since the last contact was made on Oct. 25 last year. 
  Until the South Korean delegation came to the border village 
of Panmunjom, Seoul had expected the Thursday meeting to make 
considerable progress unless Pyongyang repeated its earlier 
demands that Seoul stop "nuclear war exercises" and "seeking 
international cooperation to stop a non-existent nuclear arms 
program." 
  A clause in Tuesday's North Korean message saying that it 
recognized South Korean proposal for resumption of inter-Korean 
dialogue as acceptance of its earlier demands was especially 
taken as grounds for optimism. 
  Based on this judgment, the South prepared a draft agreement 
which made concessions on which side will visit which first and 
on what the envoys can negotiate, among other things. 
  The 13-point draft, which Vice Unification Minister Song 
Yong- tae, Seoul's chief delegate, presented at the contact, 
pointed out five aims of special envoys. 
  This was reflection of a strong will on the part of the 
South 
that the envoy exchange issue be concluded at the contact since 
it had virtually accepted what the North had demanded as envoys' 
missions in the last three working-level meetings. 
  At the Panmunjom contact, however, the South could not even 
discuss the details of procedural questions because the North 
erected a new hurdle by demanding Seoul scrap the plan for 
deployment of Patriot anti-missile batteries on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Pyongyang's head delegate Pak Yong-su also required an 
explanation of the two of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's 
statements in news conferences. 
  Kim's remarks which the North took issue with were one 
saying 
that he could not "shake hands with anyone possessing nuclear 
arms" in a press conference marking the 100th day of his term 
and the other saying that there is no substantial proof that the 
North has an atomic bomb in a recent press meet. 
  Along with the new complaints, the North repeated its 
earlier 
demands. 
  According to Vice Minister Song, the Northern side said, 
"Without resolution of these issues, the envoy exchange is 
unlikely to take place," adding that the Southern answering of 
the four complaints "is indispensable" for the envoy exchange. 
  Many government officials take the North Korea's 
intransigent 
stance as a sort of tactic to gain the advantage in the process 
of exchanging presidential envoys, delaying the exchange a 
little bit. 
  "Pyongyang is well aware that the envoys must be exchanged 
before March 21 when the third round of high-level talks between 
Washington and Pyongyang is scheduled," said a ranking 
government official, adding that the North's attitude can be 
taken as a "transient action." 
  This rather optimistic viewpoint predicts that the South and 
the North will agree on the process of envoy exchanges in the 
next border contact slated for next Wednesday [9 March] and that 
the envoys will be exchanged before March 21. However, as 
Seoul's chief delegate Song pointed out after the Thursday 
contact had failed, "North Korea's will to realize the envoy 
exchange in an early date is not strong," the timetable South 
and North Korea and the United States have prepared for eventual 
solution of the nuclear issue is unlikely to be kept, other 
government officials said.

  [Text] In connection with the press statement by Kang 
Sok-chu, North Korean vice foreign minister, that the exchange 
of special envoys is not a precondition for the third round of 
the U.S.-North Korean talks, a senior government official today 
stressed that the government position that the exchange should 
be made before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks 
remains unchanged. 
  The official said that although North Korea seems to be 
making this assertion on the basis that the exchange of special 
envoys was not specified in the U.S.-North Korean written 
agreement in New York, the exchange of special envoys was agreed 
upon internally between the United States and North Korea, 
though the United States acceded to the North Korean demand not 
to include it in the written agreement. 
  The official said that, therefore, Kang Sok-chu's allegation 
that the text of the New York agreement mentions only the 
resumption of the working contact and that it does not make any 
reference to the realization of the exchange of special envoys 
is an absurd allegation aimed at overturning the explicit 
agreement between the United States and North Korea.

inter-Korean processing-on-commission trade [witak kagong muyok] 
has amounted to $2.78 million in the first two months of this 
year, recording 63 percent of the 1993 yearly total of this mode 
of trade. 
  According to the "Trend of Inter-Korean Trade in February" 
released by the National Unification Board on 5 March, the 
processing-on-commission trade during January-February period 
this year consisted of 160,707 men's jackets, 172,996 pairs of 
men's trousers, and 200,000 suit-covers on an approval basis, 
accounting for 63 percent of the total processing-on-commission 
trade amount of $4.38 million last year. However, the approval 
amount of inter-Korean trade during the same period was $24 
million, registering only a two percent growth over last year. 
  The businesses engaged in processing-on-commission trade are 
12 companies including Daewoo, Lucky-Gold Star, Samsung, and 
Kolon.

  [Text] Beijing, March 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korea plans to 
declare on April 15, the 82nd birthday of President Kim Il-song, 
that it will open up partially by launching Chinese-style 
economic reforms, reliable Chinese sources said Sunday. After 
making the declaration, Kim Il-song is expected to visit Beijing 
in May at the latest, the sources said. 
  North Korea's communist regime will undertake the measures 
to 
overcome a grave economic crisis and alleviate mounting 
dissatisfaction among its citizens, the sources noted. 
  The Pyongyang government has established a central economic 
reform ministry within the administration and is currently 
mapping out detailed plans patterned after Chinese-style 
reforms, they said. 
  Pyongyang has already informed Beijing, its only remaining 
major ally, of its plans, the sources said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  One senior North Korean official was quoted by a number of 
Chinese observers as saying that "North Korean leaders at a 
recent meeting with President Kim seriously discussed the 
question of undertaking Chinese-style reforms." 
  The leaders have decided to proceed toward partially opening 
North Korea as a separate policy from the country's nuclear 
program, which has been the biggest obstacle to such reforms, 
the official was quoted as saying. 
  The North Korean official was quoted by a number of Chinese 
entrepreneurs who have close contact with North Korean officials 
in charge of external economy, and who are well-versed with 
North Korean affairs. 
  At the meeting, the North Korean leaders shared the opinion 
that their country would be dealt a fatal blow if another war 
broke out on the Korean peninsula because of the nuclear issue, 
the sources said. 
  They thus decided to push ahead with their current 
negotiations with the United States to normalize relations and 
obtain assurances on the maintenance of the North Korean regime 
and economic assistance. 
  In the meantime, Pyongyang will pursue economic reform and a 
policy of openness separately, the sources said. The North 
Korean leadership made the decisions mainly because the 
country's economic difficulties are approaching a dangerous 
point and the people's dissatisfaction is reaching a serious 
level, they said. 
  With regard to North Korea's economic reform policy, they 
said Pyongyang will almost completely open the Rajin-Sonbong 
area in the northeastern part of the country, as well as 
Shinuiju, Nampo, Chongjin and Wonsan. 
  Pyongyang plans to liberalize investment in these areas by 
foreigners including South Koreans, they said. 
  As a second phase, the North Koreans are studying the 
possibility of allowing "select" Chinese and other business 
enterprises to advance into areas near Pyongyang, they said. 
  In this connection, China's Tumen Trading Corp. recently 
signed a contract with North Korea on setting up a 
food-processing joint venture on the outskirts of Pyongyang 
while several other Chinese companies in Guangdong Province have 
agreed to build factories in and around Pyongyang, they said. 
  As part of its economic reforms, Pyongyang intends to reform 
agricultural policy, abolishing the current "collective farm 
system" whose productivity has been declining steadily over the 
years. 
  Pyongyang also plans to give farmers the right to cultivate 
land on condition that they pay predetermined taxes, they said. 
  At the same time, officials from the newly established 
central economic reform ministry will be sent to China's free 
trade zones in Guangdong Province to study the Chinese reform 
policy, the sources said. 
  North Korea's new economic reform policy is an "open secret" 
among residents of such big cities as Pyongyang, they said.

  [Text] Paju, March 7 (YONHAP) -- Military and police teams 
investigating weapons found along the Imjin River in the western 
section of the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ] on Sunday morning said 
the arms must have been left behind by a North Korean Army 
patrol trying to infiltrate one or two years ago. 
  Estimating the patrol consisted of around three soldiers 
from 
the Reconnaissance Battalion of the Second North Korean Army 
Corps, they said a rust-covered M-16 rifle and ammunition 
indicate the weapons had been there for one or two years. 
  The North Koreans probably disguised themselves as South 
Korean Army soldiers and tried to cross the river to observe 
construction of a freeway along its southern bank, which was 
completed more than a year ago, they observed. 
  The weapons, including a .66-caliber Soviet pistol with 17 
North Korean-made ammunition rounds, German binoculars, an M-16 
rifle with 213 rounds and two hand grenades, were found by Yi 
Hui-un, 35, of Munsan, Paju-gun, Kyonggi Province, and two 
friends along the river at 8:00 A.M. Sunday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Party Representative Na Pyong-son </F>
by reporter Kim Tang; place and date not given; first paragraph 
is source-supplied introduction] 
  [Text] Theories of a war crisis surrounding the North 
Korean nuclear issue are endlessly being put forward. In the 
stock market, however, prices are actually rising, as if 
ridiculing these ideas. How are the members of the National 
Assembly's National Defense Committee accepting these 
contradictory phenomena? We got an answer to this from 
Democratic Party [DP] lawmaker Na Pyong-son. A graduate of the 
14th class of the Korean Military Academy, Representative Na is 
an operations expert, having passed through the positions of 1st 
Army operations and intelligence staff officer, Army 
Headquarters deputy director of operations, Joint Chiefs of 
Staff operations bureau director, and 6th Corps commander, to 
transfer to the reserves as a lieutenant general. Representative 
Na is one of the newly elected lawmakers to get the most 
attention from various media for his sharp questions on national 
defense policy during this regular session of the National 
Assembly. 
  [Kim] An emergency meeting was held in the National Assembly 
National Defense Committee last November in which Kim Tok, 
director of the Agency for National Security Planning, and 
Defense Minister Kwon Yong-hae gave a situation report on DPRK 
trends. In your judgment, how much of a danger is there of war 
on the Korean peninsula? 
  [Na] To begin with my conclusion, it is not easy for 
conditions to develop that would lead to an outbreak of war on 
the Korean peninsula. When viewed geopolitically, the influence 
of the surrounding four great powers is absolute. That is to 
say, neither the North nor the South can attack the other by the 
will of its own government alone. Also, national power and the 
circumstances surrounding the Korean peninsula are now 
completely the reverse of those at the time of the Korean war. 
  [Kim] But senior U.S. officials and foreign news agencies 
continue to speak of crisis. 
  [Na] There are two external factors that could support the 
DPRK. One is forces giving ideological support, that is, the 
communist bloc. But it collapsed. The other is forces giving 
economic support, that is, allies of the DPRK. But the DPRK 
cannot depend on them either. Internally, the most important 
factors enabling a nation to wage war are military and economic 
power. However, at the time of the Korean war, South Korea [ROK] 
was not only inferior militarily, but even in economic power was 
far behind the DPRK. With factory-operation rates below 40 
percent, DPRK economic growth is unlikely. The scale of its GNP 
is one-sixth that of the ROK. In the case of military power, at 
the time of the Korean war, when ROK forces were less than 
100,000, DPRK forces were over 200,000. In tanks and guns, the 
DPRK held absolute superiority. But things are different now. 
One things that must be considered, however, is that the DPRK 
continues to build up its military. Although there may be 
criticism of its quality, the general analysis is that the DPRK 
military has numerical superiority. However, unlike the start of 
the Korean war, which saw no U.S. troops in Korea, now they are 
here by a strengthened security treaty based on the ROK-U.S. 
Mutual Defense Treaty. Thus, the combined forces of the U.S. 
military stationed in Korea and the Korean military are a 
sufficient deterrent to war. 
  [Kim] However, quoting secret U.S. Defense Department 
documents or senior officials, foreign news agencies are 
reporting very believable war scenarios. 
  [Na] Concerns about an invasion of the South or scenarios 
predicting short-term occupation of Seoul reported by the media 
are only hypothetical. They have almost no validity. According 
to the situation report, its economy is so bad recently that the 
DPRK is carrying out a campaign to eat two meals a day. This is 
intertwined with problems of the preservation of the regime and 
the transfer of power. It knows that waging war cannot be a way 
to preserve its system. A war with no chance of winning cannot 
but lead directly to its collapse. Linking the possibility of 
war with the nuclear issue despite this, while backing the DPRK 
into a corner, the American media are saying that if the DPRK is 
backed into a corner, there is a chance of war breaking out. 
This actually gives one the feeling that they are inciting this. 
This is an erroneous and dangerous logic. 
  [Kim] It is reported that in two recent surveys questioning 
whether there should be military sanctions against the DPRK 
concerning its nuclear program over half of Americans supported 
sanctions. Do you believe there is some special background to 
these surveys and reports? 
  [Na] This comes mostly from the linkage of U.S. interests 
with the nuclear issue. The prevention of nuclear proliferation 
has been a consistent U.S. strategy for world domination and was 
a Clinton campaign promise. The U.S. Defense Department recently 
announced that it set up the Defense Nuclear Proliferation 
Prevention Plan (DCI). The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) expires in June 1995. Then, it will have to be extended or 
concluded again. The disappearance of the NPT would be a 
decisive disadvantage for U.S. world strategy. If it cannot 
block DPRK nuclear development, the NPT will definitely come 
apart. Thus, for the United States, DPRK nuclear development 
must be stopped no matter what. Thus, my perspective is that the 
United States may be coming out with these theories of imminent 
invasion of the South as a means to pressure DPRK. And this is 
also used to pressure ROK. It is for stressing that the problem 
cannot be solved by appeasing DPRK, when the ROK Government 
takes an appeasing attitude or appears to do so. 
  [Kim] This is a very important analysis. Do you have grounds 
to prove it? 
  [Na] It is my understanding that even when the elderly Yi 
In-mo was returned to the North, the United States opposed this. 
With the reform-drive policy which came pressing in after the 
birth of the new administration, as policy toward DPRK, 
including the nuclear issue, began to flow somewhat in the 
direction of appeasement and change, the United States appears 
to have had misgivings that if things continued as they were, 
Korea would head in a nationalistic direction. Thus, it appears 
to come from ideas of giving these actions a declarative 
significance, with even concerns over Korean nationalism in 
mind. Otherwise, given various conditions, such as the end of 
the Cold War, the disappearance of forces supporting the DPRK, 
and the DPRK's worsening economy, how could the United States 
haphazardly talk about a DPRK invasion. Hence, the talk of an 
invasion of the South and the heightened sense of crisis flowing 
out of the United States appear to be strategic moves targeting 
both the ROK and the DPRK nuclear issue. The way I see it, 
although the DPRK may do it if it assumes the collapse of its 
government, there is no possibility of it starting a full-scale 
war which would definitely be suicidal. However, one thing I'm 
worried about is a limited war. Considering its capability for a 
protracted war, it is impossible for the DPRK to communize the 
ROK if the Korean-U.S. alliance is put into action. Since Seoul 
is close, however, the DPRK does have the offensive capability 
to do considerable damage to the capital in a short time. The 
DPRK has large quantities of chemical and biological weapons. 
Combined with artillery in range of Seoul, this means that it is 
possible the DPRK could break part of Seoul's defensive line, 
even if it wouldn't be an all-out war. Of course, I'm saying 
this militarily under the assumption the North would launch a 
surprise attack and would risk the collapse of its regime to do 
this. 
  [Kim] Then, is there no possibility that the theories about 
a 
possible DPRK invasion, stories of crisis and the opinion polls 
on sanctions against the DPRK presented by the United States are 
not only for pressuring North and South Korea to solve the 
nuclear issue, but that they also have U.S. military sanctions 
in mind? 
  [Na] Well, we can't really draw a conclusion on that, right? 
However, the industry having the greatest difficulty in the 
United States is the defense industry. Enormous defense 
industries are downsizing now. Because war or the threat of war 
vanished with the end of the Cold War, foreign demand for 
weapons is diminishing. The ROK is the U.S. weapons industry's 
greatest Asian customer. From its very beginning, the Korean 
military was founded according to the organizational equipment 
charts of the U.S. military. But, beginning in the late 1980's, 
in the course of finishing with conventional weapons and going 
to high-tech weapons, Korea moved away from being pro-American 
in its equipment and is becoming multilateral in its weapons 
purchases. Our submarines are from Germany. For our destroyers, 
we make the hulls themselves, but the other equipment is from 
the United Kingdom or Germany. For helicopters, which have 
become very important in modern warfare, we are presently using 
American-made equipment, but if something better and cheaper 
comes out, there is no need to purposely continue using it. The 
U.S. defense industry is hard-pressed right now. Furthermore, 
Russian weapons are coming out at rock-bottom prices. The 
creation of the present sense of crisis about the DPRK is not 
unrelated to the circumstances of the U.S. defense industry. 
  [Kim] Do you have actual evidence reflecting pressure by the 
U.S. military-industrial complex? 
  [Na] I have no tangible evidence. However, it is a fact that 
they are expressing dissatisfaction with Korea's 
multilateralization of its weapons purchases. They did so this 
last time when we imported submarines and destroyers. Up to now, 
weapons purchases have always followed the spread of theories of 
crisis on the Korean peninsula. Also, these crisis stories 
generally come about the time Korea's national-defense budget is 
being passed. 
  [Kim] In November, in an unprecedented move, the U.S. 
Defense 
Department published its 1993 United States Forces Korea [USFK] 
Inspection Report. Central to the report were the claim that 
ROK-U.S. Combined Forces were unprepared for an emergency and 
the suggestion that a wartime support-forces operational plan 
should be set up. Never before published because it was 
classified Secret, what is behind the publication of this 
inspection report? 
  [Na] That is an important point. It is in the same context 
as 
I mentioned before. There is no such thing as a perfect wartime 
support plan. If examined from a purely military perspective, 
every country has weaknesses. The U.S. Defense Department's 
inspection report is done not just once, but every year. And 
this is not the only year preparations have been found to be 
unsatisfactory. This was the case last year too, and the year 
before that. The way I see it, this is the inadequacy. In 
connection with the wartime support plan, in last year's annual 
Korea-U.S. security consultative meeting, a switch was made to a 
new strategic concept called the Flexible Deterrence Option 
(FDO). In actuality, however, the wartime support plan itself, 
included in the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command [CFC] 
operations plan (OPLAN 5027), is arranged in such a way as to 
require a considerable amount of time. DPRK strategy, however, 
emphasizes short-term conflict and blitzkrieg. The support plan 
is lax compared with this. The problem, however, is that it 
didn't become lax just this year; the problem has always been 
pointed out. 
  [Kim] The focus of the inspection appeared to be whether the 
Wartime Host Nation Support Agreement (WHNS),, concluded in 
November 1991, would be observed. 
  [Na] The Wartime Logistics Support Agreement is presently 
being carried out a little at a time. Generally, an agreement is 
the reinforcement and observance of a security treaty. 
Therefore, every year when the Korea-U.S. security consultative 
meeting is held, progress on this is supposed to be checked and 
furthered. So, I cannot help but view these statements, that 
preparations are inadequate and that the ROK would fall in the 
event of war, made in spite of the great progress which has been 
made compared with the past, as means for pressuring North and 
South Korea, under the premise of a crisis situation. 
  [Kim] Some point out that there are problems in the makeup 
of 
and cooperation on the FDO package. 
  [Na] The FDO concept was adopted as the new world strategy 
of 
the United States after Clinton came on board. The concept is 
one step more developed than the wartime support plan of the 
past. In the past, if a war broke out, the commitment of combat 
forces was supposed to be timed with the response stage. With 
FDO, however, this has changed: forces are to be sent to deter 
war. This means that they are already coming at the stage in 
which a war-crisis situation is forming. That is to say, let's 
prevent a war by putting forces in place. In the case of FDO, it 
is my understanding that the work is in progress of actually 
forming them and including them in the present operational plan. 
But details are secret. I can point out this, however. In the 
annual Korea-U.S. security consultative meeting held in 
November, it was agreed that during wartime, the Seventh Fleet 
would be put under CFC operational control. Then, this too must 
be included in the CFC operational plan. Of course, this work 
has not yet been completed. Of the attachment of the Seventh 
Fleet, they say it guarantees automatic wartime intervention, 
but, if war should break out at the same time in the Indian 
Ocean or the Middle East, we cannot know whether they will 
actually intervene on the Korean peninsula. I question whether 
there is a need to irritate the DPRK by publicly announcing and 
stressing the CFC attachment of the Seventh Fleet. It is 
actually of more strategic benefit to keep this secret between 
Korea and the United States. This put things the other way 
around. This kind of unnecessary public statement is telling the 
Korean military not to increase its naval forces. Concerning the 
DPRK, it is wrong in that it can be interpreted, just as the 
DPRK claims, as a threat of "nuclear blackmail." 
  [Kim] According to THE WASHINGTON POST, the U.S. secretary 
of 
defense reported to President Clinton on an emergency defense 
plan based on "USFK 5027." What is the basic concept of the CFC 
operational plan, OPLAN 5027? 
  [Na] Generally, when new tactics or strategy is developed, 
it 
is reflected in operational plans after passing through the 
process of map exercises and actual maneuvers training. The 
blind spot of the CFC operational plan is that the CFC is not 
supposed to make a first strike. Our Free World allies generally 
adopt a strategic concept of not launching a first strike. 
However, because, in accordance with our armistice agreement, 
the guilty party is determined by who fired first, the 
operational plan is set up to observe the armistice agreement. 
However, surprise attacks and first strikes are absolutely 
essential in war. First strike means that, in war, the attacking 
side has the choice of time and place. Thus, the side suffering 
a first strike is at an absolute disadvantage, particularly 
early in the war. Supplementing this disadvantageous condition 
is the air-land battle concept developed by the U.S. Army in the 
early 1980's. This was a development of operational and 
strategic ideas following the change of its weapons systems to a 
form suited for three-dimensional warfare. This approach is 
possible assuming intelligence, destructive power, and 
maneuverability. When this rapid-deployment-maneuver force 
system is in place, a deep-strike strategy becomes possible, 
whereby, when an opponent makes a first strike, his main axis of 
attack is blocked while another axis maneuvers, striking the 
enemy's rear. 
  [Kim] This strategic concept ultimately signifies a fluid 
offensive defense posture, that, when the DPRK has made a first 
strike, would move the main line of battle to the north. When 
was this included in the CFC OPLAN 5027? 
  [Na] Let's say the mid-1980's. Although not as good as a 
first strike, it keeps the spirit of the UN armistice agreement 
and is a strategy which supplements striking power against an 
opponent's attack. I think it is probably the best strategic 
concept possible under the present UN armistice agreement system. 
  [Kim] Considering the DPRK nuclear issue, I have misgivings 
regardless of whether they have nuclear weapons. The Bush 
administration withdrew USFK nuclear weapons. Has this been 
reflected in the CFC OPLAN? 
  [Na] It is my understanding that plans for the use of 
nuclear 
weapons were dropped from the OPLAN after the withdrawal of USFK 
nuclear weapons. However, as long the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces 
system exists, there is no possibility of war breaking out on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  [Kim] As a legislator who is former military, you seem to 
have a particularly progressive perspective toward the United 
States. This is a sharp question. Representatives Kang 
Chang-song, Im Pok-chin, and yourself are called the Three 
Musketeers of the National Defense Committee. Of those still on 
active duty in the military, is there anyone with thoughts 
similar to your own? 
  [Na] For those at the Ministry of National Defense directly 
responsible for the work of national defense, it is natural that 
they would concentrate on the war-deterrence capability of the 
military. If you talk with them, however, there are many, 
particularly of those responsible for national defense policy, 
who think the same way I do. But they cannot speak of this 
outright. Ultimately, it is the politicians who must indicate 
this. So I'm speaking on their behalf. Times are now changing. 
We are moving into an era in which even a superpower such as 
the United States cannot guarantee its security with its own 
power alone. However, we must continuously develop national 
defense policy in a direction that would enable us, with only 
our nation's resources, to have at least a minimum of deterrence 
capability. This is because if we have nothing, we have no 
capability to negotiate either.

  [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- North Korea saw out 
February with noisy celebrations marking the 30th anniversary of 
President Kim Il-song's announcement of a program to develop 
socialist agriculture. The program, disclosed by Kim and 
adopted by the Workers' (Communist) Party at its Central 
Committee meeting on Feb. 25, 1964, provided several approaches 
to rural woes, which were classified as agricultural problems in 
one group and farmers' problems in the other. 
  Under a resolution adopted by the Workers' Party at its 
Politburo meeting in October last year, North Korea held 
meetings, ceremonies and other functions late last month to 
observe the 30th anniversary of Kim's socialist agriculture 
program. 
  A national meeting of farmers was held in Pyongyang from 
Feb. 
25-28, along with film shows and discussion meetings across the 
country. In addition, commemorative stamps and postcards were 
issued and cooperative farms with excellent production records 
honored. On Feb. 23, Haksan cooperative farm in Pyongyang 
dedicated a monument to the program's 30th anniversary. 
  Attending the opening session of the four-day national 
meeting of 10,500 farmers were President Kim Il-song, People's 
Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u, Premier Kang Song-san, Vice 
Presidents Yi Chong-ok and Pak Song-chol, and Party Secretaries 
Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong and Choe Tae-pok. But Kim Chong-il, 
son and heir-apparent of the senior Kim, did not show up. 
  In a report lasting one hour and 20 minutes, Premier Kang 
called on all cooperative farm workers to pursue reforms and 
agricultural advances, while upholding the party's 
agriculture-first policy. "We must make an uninterrupted 
movement forward along the revolutionary path" charted in 
President Kim's socialist agriculture program, Kang exhorted. 
  Kim Il-song, in a letter to the meeting, called for 
intensified ideological reform among farmers, a switch from 
cooperative ownership of farmland to a popular ownership system 
and increased farm production, while stressing the need to 
industrialize farming and incorporate farmers into the 
proletariat. 
  Participants in the meeting spent three days discussing the 
tasks laid out by Kim in his letter and resolved to carry them 
out. 
  At the closing session on Feb. 28, they pledged their 
loyalty to Kim Il-song and his son, Chong-il. 
  North Korea's media, both print and electronic, played up 
the 
functions celebrating the 30th anniversary of the senior Kim's 
socialist farm program and the agricultural achievements of both 
Kims. 
  In a commentary aired on Feb. 25, Radio Pyongyang attributed 
the North's agricultural development in the past 30 years to 
Kim's socialist farm program and said it had been carried out 
successfully thanks to Kim Chong-il's "ideological and 
theoretical activities and sagacious leadership." 
  The Workers' Party newspaper, NODONG SINMUN, praised the 
Kims 
for their "solution of basic rural problems," while calling on 
farmers to perform the tasks President Kim mentioned in his 
letter to the national meeting of farmers. 
  In 1974 North Korea started holding an annual meeting of 
farmers in the off-season, which was changed to a meeting every 
five years in 1985. The 1995 meeting was moved up to this year 
to coincide with the 30th anniversary of Kim's agriculture 
program announcement. 
  Kim senior and junior were acclaimed during functions held 
at 
the turn of the month, as with past events in North Korea. No 
measures to develop the North's backward agriculture were 
mentioned, though farmers were urged to uphold the agricultural 
development concepts presented by Kim Il-song. 
  In spite of chronic food shortages due to several lean crop 
years, North Korea failed to present a realistic and effective 
farm development policy on the 30th anniversary of Kim's 
socialist agriculture program, instead sticking to past policies 
which have proven a dismal failure over the past 30 years. 
  While celebrating the 30th anniversary of the program, North 
Korea failed to draw up effective measures to increase farm 
production. Rather, farmers were simply exhorted to follow 
blindly the policy Kim launched three decades ago.

  [Text] It has been confirmed that North Korea is 
experimenting with privatizing cultivation rights for farmland 
in limited areas. 
  Relevant government authorities in charge of North Korean 
economic affairs on 5 March said: Since the second half of 
1993, North Korea has been instituting, on a trial basis, a 
system for privatizing land cultivation rights for farmers in 
certain areas by which the North Korean authorities take a 
certain proportion of the harvested farm produce as a fee for 
the land and the farmers privately own the remainder of the farm 
produce. 
  The government official in charge of North Korean economic 
affairs said the government authorities have recently learned 
that North Korea has been secretly instituting this experimental 
reform measure in areas such as Hoeryong in North Hamgyong 
Province, where the residents are mostly political prisoners. 
North Korea is instituting this measure secretively on a family 
basis and is thoroughly cutting off the areas from the outside. 
The government official said: "North Korea seems to be 
experimenting on capitalist market economy principles by partly 
permitting cultivation rights and maintaining the present North 
Korean system to solve its serious food shortage problem." The 
official added, "North Korea selected the areas where political 
prisoners live for the experiment in order to closely study the 
possible effect of the change on the maintenance of the present 
North Korean system through the people most critical of the 
present North Korean system." 
  Another expert on North Korean affairs commented: "This is a 
significant change as it represents signs of a North Korean 
experiment on new land reform for the first time in 36 years 
since private ownership and land cultivation rights disappeared 
in North Korea in 1958."

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
received a telephone call from Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Monday afternoon, during which the Japanese premier 
congratulated the president on the recent passage of political 
reform bills through the National Assembly. 
  Chongwadae [presidential offices] spokesman Chu Ton-sik said 
that in the telephone conversation that lasted about 10 minutes 
from 5:10 P.M., Prime Minister Hosokawa said he was extending 
deep respect to President Kim for the leadership and 
determination he displayed before the passage of the bills. 
President Kim said to Hosokawa he had emphasized on every 
opportunities that no national advancement can be attained 
without political reforms. 
  The spokesman said the president also expressed the hope 
that 
current trade frictions between Japan and the United States will 
be resolved in an instructive direction. Hosokawa, according to 
Chu, said that the two countries have diverse problems of their 
own and he would like to exchange opinions on these issues with 
President Kim during his upcoming visit to Japan. 
  This was the fourth telephone conversation between Kim and 
Hosokawa since President Kim called the Japanese premier on last 
Aug. 9 to congratulate him on his inauguration.

  [Text] Korea and Japan are seeking to establish a new 
economic relationship in the run-up to the 21st century by 
setting up a bilateral organization which will address a wide 
variety of pending issues between the two countries. The two 
countries, which will celebrate 30 tears of the restoration of 
diplomatic ties next year, will inaugurate the "Korea-Japan New 
Initiative for Economic Partnership (NIEP)" in April with its 
first meeting slated in Seoul. 
  The establishment of NIEP was agreed upon in last November's 
summit between President Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Kyongju. Officials of the two 
countries have since had a series of working meetings to discuss 
how it will be set up, what it will be called and what it is 
supposed to do. 
  "Although there have been some differences as to the 
function 
and title, we faced little difficulties in realizing the 
establishment of the NIEP," said a Korean official at the 
Economic Planning Board [EPB] who was involved in the project. 
  As shown in the title of the organization, the NIEP is 
expected to lay a solid groundwork for bilateral economic 
cooperation, looking beyond the present and reaching out to the 
21st century, Korean officials say. 
  "Basically, Seoul and Tokyo will be able to discuss 
everything within the framework of the NIEP, from the bilateral 
trade imbalance to economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific 
region," an EPB official said. 
  The NIEP appears similar to the Dialogue for Economic 
Cooperation (DEC), economic cooperation talks between Seoul and 
Washington, which the new administrations of Korea and the 
United States launched last year. But the NIEP differs from the 
DEC in that the latter is supposed to be disbanded after a 
certain period while the former will be in operation over a 
longer period. 
  Officials say both the NIEP and DEC were designed to address 
bilateral economic issues but the former will be more 
comprehensive than the latter. In the NIEP, Korea and Japan 
will tap assistant foreign ministers as their respective chief 
delegate with 10-odd officials of various ministries 
representing each country. 
  Two rounds of meetings will be held in Seoul and Tokyo this 
year but from next year, the two countries will hold meetings 
once a year in principle. What will be discussed in the 
meetings will be reported to President Kim and Prime Minister 
Hosokawa.

  [Text] Seoul, March 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
peacekeepers in Somalia will withdraw about one month ahead of 
the recently revised schedule and return home next week, the 
Foreign Ministry said Monday. The 250-man "Evergreen" Unit will 
leave the African country aboard a chartered plane on March 17 
and arrive in Seoul the following day, according to the 
ministry. The unit's equipment will arrive via ship and reach 
the port city of Pusan sometime next month. 
  The Evergreen Unit marked South Korea's first participation 
ever in a U.N. Peacekeeping Operation (PKO). It was dispatched 
to the strife-torn nation last July for a one-year tour of duty, 
but the Seoul government decided on an early withdrawal, around 
April, after scores of Western nations announced their intention 
to pull out. South Korea pushed up the withdrawal date to next 
week after similar decisions were made by the United States and 
other nations.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>
  [Text] The European Union (EU) is moving to revoke Korea's 
generalized system for preferences (GSP) on exports of 
automobiles and textile products in retaliation for alleged 
import restrictions on European cars and furs. On the other 
hand, the EU has been conducting investigations into alleged 
dumping-margin sales of Korean products in EU member nations. 
  According to a dispatch from the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corporation (KOTRA) branch in Brussels, the EU executive 
committee said in a report on the bloc's automobile industry 
that European car manufacturers have found it difficult to 
export their products to Korea due to the high tariffs and 
excise tax plus the frugality campaign aimed at curbing imports 
of luxurious foreign cars. 
  The committee claimed that Korean makers sold 90,000 cars in 
Europe compared to 532 units sold by European manufacturers in 
Korea last year. To retaliate against the alleged import 
restrictions, the EU is considering revoking the GSP for Korean 
cars from July, the KOTRA dispatch said. 
  An Association of European Automakers (ACEA) also revealed 
last week in a Belgium newspaper that they are considering 
investigating dumping margin sales of Korean car exporters, the 
Korea Foreign Trade Association said. 
  A Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry official said the major 
reason why European car sales are poor here is their high prices 
amounting to 70 million won or more a unit. He cited an 
increase of 40 percent in sales of U.S. cars last year, adding 
that Ford Sables are attractive to Korean customers thanks to 
their reasonable price of some 20 million won. 
  Aware of the EU's complaints about alleged frequent tax 
probes into owners of foreign cars because of the frugality 
drive, the official said, the tax administration chief in 
February made it clear that tax investigations would not be made 
for the reason of owning a foreign car to wipe out such 
suspicion. 
  He also said, "It's nonsense to revoke the GSP favor on 
autos 
for that reason." The official also noted that Korean 
automakers will not be hurt by the withdrawal of the GSP as they 
have already completed their exports to the EU under it. 
  The EU is also considering withdrawing the GSP favor on 
exports of Korean textiles from July in retaliation for the 
increase in tariffs on imports of European furs from eight 
percent to 19 percent for this year. 
  Leon Brittan, vice EC commissioner for external trade, 
claimed at talks with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in Seoul 
last November that the hike of tariffs violates the principle of 
the GATT and UR [Uruguay Round] accords which ban any increase 
in tariffs from the current level. 
  The EU has informally notified the Korean government that it 
will withdraw the GSP favor on Korea's textile products for six 
months, starting July 1, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
official said. The damages from such action are estimated at 
$30-50 million, he said, adding that the EU is expected to make 
a formal decision by the end of this month. 
  The EU in principle claimed that Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Korea should graduate from its GSP favors as they have outgrown 
their developing nation status, the official said, adding that 
the hike in tariffs on fur products cannot be used as a reason 
for scrapping the GSP favor on Korean textiles. But in a 
medium-term view, Korea is ready to graduate from the tariff 
benefits as it plans to join the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1996, he explained. 
  The EU has recently announced it will impose a 70.6 percent 
tariff on large-sized aluminum-made batteries being exported by 
Daewoo Electronics and five other Korean firms on grounds that 
they have sold their products at below local market prices. The 
EU launched anti-dumping investigations into them last March. 
  "European excavator makers are expected to file a suit 
against alleged dumping-margin sales of Korean products this 
month," said Na Chan-yop in charge of European trade information 
at KOTRA. 
  Korea is the third largest anti-dumping sufferer with 16 
cases under investigation or anti-dumping rulings, following 
Japan and China, Na said quoting EU statistics disclosed last 
year. 
  Na pointed out that domestic manufacturers should closely 
watch import trends in the bloc and Korea's market share to 
avoid anti-dumping rulings on their products in Europe. 
  He said, "Korea has followed Japan which showered its 
exports 
on Europe at cheap prices. China now follows Korea. As a 
result, the three countries face a large number of anti-dumping 
investigations and rulings in Europe."

  [Text] Seoul, March 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's trade with 
China made a u-turn into the red in January after 14 months of 
surpluses, the Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA) said 
Monday. Items shipped to China that boosted South Korean trade 
last year were shaky as record-breaking imports from Seoul's 
neighbor far outpaced exports, officials said. 
  China imported goods totaling 348 million U.S. dollars in 
January, a 29.3 percent increase from the same month last year 
and disappointing compared to the 94.1 percent rise for 1993. 
  Imports by Korea, on the other hand, set a new high that 
month of 386 million dollars, 56.1 percent higher than a year 
ago and a stark contrast to the 5.5 percent increase for all of 
1993. This led to a 38-million-dollar deficit with China for 
January. The last time the figure tilted in Beijing's favor was 
in November 1992. 
  KFTA officials attribute the result to China's policies on 
curbing overheated competition, which closed the door to new 
investments this year. In a bid to reduce its trade deficit, 
China is controlling imports of capital goods. 
  Meanwhile, Chinese farm products flooded the South Korean 
market in January, just in time for the new year celebrations. 
  "The astounding export increase last year to China kind of 
saturated the potential of South Korean goods," said one 
official. "Unless we find a breakthrough, like automobile 
exports, our sales to China cannot but be stunted." 
  Exports to China grew 71.4 percent in 1991 and 161 percent 
in 
1992. 
  The figure climbed to as high as 150 percent in the first 
half of last year but has fallen to 20-80 percent since then.

  [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and main 
opposition parties have agreed in the National Assembly that 
they will start working to revise or abolish the controversial 
National Security Law. The agreement came at a meeting Friday 
between floor leaders Rep. Yi Han-tong of the Democratic Liberal 
Party and Rep. Kim Tae-sik of the Democratic Party. 
  The meeting was called to discuss issues the two sides left 
out when they adopted revised political bills in a special 
National Assembly session which ended Friday night. 
  The floor leaders agreed to have the Legislation and 
Judiciary Committee undertake preliminary work on possible 
revision or abolition of the security law. 
  The National Security Law entered the spotlight in recent 
days when Secretary of State Warren Christopher and another 
senior U.S. official urged South Korea to repeal the law as part 
of efforts to improve human rights. The law, enacted to deter 
North Korean espionage and other seditious activities against 
the South, was often perceived as an instrument of human rights 
abuses by past administrations headed by retired generals. 
  "The floor leaders of the two parties have agreed to let the 
Legislation and Judiciary Committee form a subcommittee to 
discuss the National Security Law as they agreed to do so in 
principle last year," said Kim Tae-sik. 
  As a result, the committee is scheduled to hold a plenary 
session Saturday to form the proposed subcommittee. 
  The two parties agreed to discuss possible revision or 
abolition of the law last year when the National Assembly 
revised the law on the Agency for National Security Planning.

  [Text] In connection with the mention of a need to "abolish 
the National Security Law," by one U.S. Government official 
after another, the ROK Government stated on 4 March: "The 
National Security Law is an inevitable and minimum apparatus for 
defending the free democratic system in our country." Today, 
the Justice Ministry released a statement on the "Government's 
Position on the National Security Law." In the document, the 
ministry states: "Continuous mention of a need to abolish the 
National Security Law, when a delicate security situation 
prevails because of the North Korean nuclear issue, is not 
beneficial to our national interests." 
  Regarding the allegation that the National Security Law is 
abused to violate human rights, the Justice Ministry also said: 
"When this law was revised in 1991, the purposes of the 
National Security Law were specified, and the scope of the 
application of this law was restricted significantly, so that 
the law ensures that people's basic human rights are defended to 
the utmost." The ministry added: "The government will strictly 
execute the law and make continued efforts to prevent the 
violation of human rights." 
  Dissidents insist that, "The law describes North Korea as an 
antistate organization, at a time when the North-South agreement 
has been signed. Therefore, the law stands in the 
reunification's way." In response, the Justice Ministry says: 
"The National Security Law does not automatically consider 
North Korea an antistate organization. Furthermore, the laws on 
North-South exchange and cooperation positively guarantees 
peaceful exchange and cooperation." 
  Tbe ministry also said: "If North Korea abandons its 
strategy on perpetrating a communist revolution in South Korea 
and if North- South relations develop into relations of 
reconciliation and cooperation, the government will seriously 
reexamine the law."

  [Text] A high-ranking Chongwadae [presidential office] 
official today revealed there is no change in the government's 
existing position that the National Security Law cannot be 
abolished, as there was no significant change in the situation. 
  This official said that some people hold that the Security 
Law should be abolished and the pertinent articles be absorbed 
into criminal law. However, the criminal law stipulates that the 
act of espionage must be committed between nations. Therefore, 
the article in the Security Law that defines North Korea as an 
antistate organization, not as a state, cannot be absorbed into 
the criminal law.

  [Text] The government yesterday dismissed Kyonggi 
provincial Gov. Yun Se-tal over the recent scandal surrounding 
the misappropriation of public donations to charity by officials 
at some countries under his control. 
  Yi Kyong-ho, assistant minister of home affairs, will be 
named new Kyonggi governor, a government spokesman said. 
  The government also sacked O Song-su, Songnam City mayor who 
is being dismissed for his "problematic" wealth accumulation, 
and Kim Hak-kyu, Hwasong County chief, with regard to the 
charity scandal, the official said. 
  Ha Yong-su, director-general of transportation and tourism 
affairs at Kyonggi provincial government, will receive 
disciplinary measures, according to the spokesman. 
  The dismissals came after the Home Affairs Ministry 
completed 
Thursday its 10-day inspection of affiliated organizations 
including Kyonggi provincial government over the 
misappropriation of charity funds. 
  The ministry's inspection was undertaken after the Board of 
Audit and Inspection announced last week that some government 
agencies had misappropriated charity funds donated by the public 
for other purposes. 
  The dismissed governor had used donations for the poor for 
personal expenses and O was found to have forcibly collected 3.9 
billion won from construction firms as charity funds, the 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- The supreme public 
prosecutor summoned the chairman of the National Agricultural 
Cooperatives Federation (NACF), Han Ho-son, Friday night and 
questioned him overnight about allegedly embezzling part of a 
300 million won slush fund he had set aside from the budget for 
an NACF branch. 
  The prosecutor's office is expected to seek an arrest 
warrant 
for Han, 58, Saturday after further questioning him on the 
alleged misappropriation of the slush fund, its exact amount and 
its use. 
  Officials at the prosecutor's office said Han built up the 
slush fund by misappropriating NACF budgets set for local 
branches between April 1991 and October 1992. The officials 
said their investigation showed that the fund amounted to 300 
million won, of which Han allegedly embezzled 180 million won.

  [Text] Seoul, March 7 (YONHAP) -- The Prosecutor General's 
office on Monday continued questioning Han Ho-son, chairman of 
the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) who was 
arrested Saturday on suspicion of creating and misusing a slush 
fund. Prosecutor-general Kim Tae-chung also wanted to know 
whether Han received any bribes when appointing heads of NACF 
branch offices. In addition to building up the slush fund by 
misappropriating money from the budgets of NACF provincial and 
city branches, the prosecutor suspects Han, 58, may have added 
billions of won more to the fund by receiving commissions and 
payoffs from construction companies for various NACF building 
projects. 
  The presidential office at Chongwadae, meanwhile, brushed 
aside allegations that Han was being prosecuted for political 
reasons. "There was no political intention for Han's arrest," 
said one senior Chongwadae official. "It's preposterous to 
suggest that Han is being made the target of an unjust 
investigation." There has been speculation that Han, as the 
leader of the nation's powerful farm organizations, incurred the 
wrath of the Kim administration with his uncompromising stance 
on opening the domestic rice market to imports and other farm 
policies following the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. 
  The prosecutor plans to summon officials from four to five 
large construction companies, NACF accountants and heads of NACF 
provincial and city branches for questioning in this connection, 
sources said. "Apart from the 360 million won Han admitted to 
having set aside as a slush fund, we have found that he 
misappropriated about 10 million won a month from the NACF's 
budget," said one investigator at the prosecutor's office. "We 
plan to find out the exact size of the slush fund and its uses 
by tracing his personal bank deposits," he added. The 
prosecutor's office is also looking into the possibility that 
Han may have embezzled public funds from the NONGMIN SINMUN 
(farmers newspaper) and Nongmin Co. He is president of both 
companies. 
  In a related development, the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party 
[DLP] decided at a party postholders' meeting Monday to urge the 
government to conduct a thorough investigation of Han and 
possible systematic irregularities at the NACF. The NACF must be 
transformed into an organization that can act as a real 
spokesman for the nation's farmers, the DLP said. 
  "On the occasion of chairman Han's arrest, systematic 
irregularities at the NACF have to be cleaned up and the current 
investigation should not leave any trace of suspicion," said DLP 
spokesman Ha Sun-pong after the meeting. With regard to 
allegations that Han paid off more than 100 politicians, DLP 
Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said, "the party will study 
taking possible action against anyone who is implicated in the 
prosecutor's investigation." 
  The main opposition Democratic Party [DP] also urged the 
government to investigate Han and the NACF thoroughly, clear up 
any suspicions and severely punish those found guilty of 
wrongdoings. DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek said, "Since (the 
government) started this investigation (of the NACF), it has to 
do a complete job." The government should also take this 
opportunity to investigate other organizations run along similar 
lines as the NACF, Yi said. DP spokesman Pak Chi-won urged a 
thorough investigation, saying: "There was an allegation that 2 
million to 3 million won apiece had been offered to 110 ruling 
party candidates during the last parliamentary elections, and 
large amounts of political funds had flowed into the political 
circle."

  [Text] Seoul, Mar. 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean farmers have 
grown less enthusiastic about their occupation following the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round [UR] talks. An opinion poll 
taken by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation toward 
2,000 farmers at the end of last year showed on Monday that 35.1 
percent of the respondents said they would reduce their farming 
scale to a point where they could obtain food grains of their 
own need only. On the other hand, 45.1 percent replied they 
would continue to engage in farming as now even after the 
Uruguay Round agreement. 
  Those who said they would give up farming altogether 
accounted for 9.2 percent of the total and 10.5 percent said 
they would delegate their farmlands to some ones else. Those who 
said they would abandon farming were mostly those with tiny 
farmlands. Those with relatively large farmland areas said they 
would continue farming. 
  Regarding the issue of whether to allow non-farmers to 
possess farmlands, 54.1 percent favored non-farmers' possession 
in the interests of the buildup of farming competitiveness. But, 
30.7 percent of the questioned said they were against it because 
it runs counter to the traditional principle of "farmlands for 
farmers."

  [Text] Seoul, March 7 (YONHAP) -- Foreign exchange trading 
by Korean banks is surging along with the country's developing 
financial structure and wider market opening. 
  Inter-bank foreign exchange transactions grew as much as 136 
percent last year and the role of Korean banks in these deals 
has strengthened greatly, the Finance Ministry said Monday. 
  Foreign exchange transactions were worth 587.8 billion U.S. 
dollars last year, up 39.8 percent from 420.4 billion dollars in 
1992. 
  Trade volume, which was 332.2 billion dollars in 1990, grew 
9.1 percent to 352.5 billion dollars in 1991 and 19.3 percent to 
420.4 billion dollars in 1992, but last year's two-digit rise 
was chiefly attributed to the foreign exchange liberalization 
measures initiated from 1993, Ministry officials said. 
  Daily inter-bank trading averaged 1,172 million dollars last 
year, up 135.8 percent from 497 million dollars a year earlier. 
Daily volume totaled 1,859 million dollars in January and 2,134 
million dollars last month. 
  Spot transactions that stood at 344 million dollars a day in 
1992 expanded 71.5 percent last year to 591 million dollars 
while forward trading surged 279.7 percent to 581 million 
dollars from 153 million dollars. Forward exchange 
transactions that require underlying documents kept growing this 
year to total 1,013 million dollars in January, exceeding 846 
million dollars in spot dealings. 
  Forward trading reached 1,514 million dollars in February, 
compared with 1,082 million dollars in spot deals, with the 
preference for futures reflecting the Korean foreign exchange 
market's further advancement, officials said. 
  In addition, local banks accounted for 63.2 percent of 
inter-bank transactions last year, up from 51.7 percent in 1992. 
  Under a three-phase financial liberalization plan that took 
effect last October, the daily fluctuation band of the 
inter-bank foreign exchange rate was widened and underlying 
document requirements for forward contracts relaxed.

  [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's net 
external debt fell below 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 for the 
first time in three years thanks to an increase in the country's 
foreign reserves, the Bank of Korea said Saturday. Net external 
debt, the amount remaining after subtracting foreign reserves 
from total external debt, decreased from 11.1 billion dollars at 
the end of 1992 to 7.98 billion dollars last year. 
  Foreign reserves soared last year as foreigners' investment 
in stocks increased and the current account posted a surplus, 
thereby reducing the nation's net foreign debt. Foreign 
reserves, which include foreign exchange holdings and overseas 
stocks and bonds, reached 36.1 billion dollars at the end of 
last year, up 4.38 billion dollars from the year before. 
  South Korea's balance of current accounts recorded a 
450-million-dollar surplus for the first time in four years, 
while foreigners invested 5.7 billion dollars in stocks here, 
increasing the country's foreign reserves. 
  Meanwhile, total external debt rose 1.26 billion dollars to 
44.08 billion dollars at the end of 1993, from 42.82 billion 
dollars a year earlier. Long-term foreign debt rose by 760 
million dollars from 24.31 billion dollars in 1992 to 25.07 
billion dollars, while short-term debt increased 500 million 
dollars to 19.01 billion dollars. 
  South Korea's net foreign debt decreased to 3.02 billion 
dollars in 1989 when the nation enjoyed a large current account 
surplus, but increased again to 4.85 billion dollars in 1990 and 
11.95 billion dollars a year later.

  [Text] KONG KREAL, Cambodia , March 6 (AFP) -- Cambodian 
officials said Sunday the Thai military helped Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas, backed by tribesmen, recapture a major base in 
northern Cambodia which was taken by government forces early 
last month. 
  "Thai military helped fresh Khmer Rouge troops come through 
Thai soil from Pailin," General Khin Yean said referring to the 
Khmer Rouge's main headquarteres in northwest Cambodia. 
  The general said there was no doubt the guerrillas were 
helped by the Thai military in retaking the base at Anlung Veng 
which served as the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for guerrilla 
operations in north and central Cambodia. 
  "I am 100 percent sure, not 99.9 but 100 percent sure," the 
general said, speaking at this rear control base about 50 
kilometres (30 miles) west of Anlung Veng. 
  All around the base troops were carrying out repairs on 
tanks 
and bringing up supplies for what government officers said would 
be an imminent government counter-attack. The general was 
emphatic in saying he did not blame the Thai government for 
Phnom Penh's defeat at Anlung Veng. 
  "But we blame the Thai military and Thai businessmen who 
co-operate together to make money from logs," he said. 
  The fresh Khmer Rouge troops, who numbered up to 500, were 
joined by small groups of guerrillas from surrounding areas and 
by several hundred hill-tribe fighters, the general said. 
Government troops said they were frightened by the 
hill-tribesmen. "We shot at mountain people but they kept on 
coming, it's like they were not afraid to die," said one 
soldier, who retreated through the jungle for two days without 
food and water. 
  "I think the Khmer Rouge gave them some special medicine and 
they get drunk. They came at us like they didn't seem to care, 
like life was not important," private Penn Nouvat said. Some of 
the Montagnards were in Khmer Rouge uniform but others were 
dressed in civilian clothes, government soldiers said. 
  General Khin Yean said the Montagnards were from the Kouy 
tribe who came from Cambodia's remote northern and northeastern 
provinces. Ta Mok, the notorious one-legged Khmer Rouge general 
and commander of Anlung Veng, hired them as mercenaries and was 
paying them handsomely, he said. The Khmer Rouge were not short 
of money, he said, as they sold concessions to log in the rich 
forests surrounding Anlung Veng to Thai business interests, many 
of them controlled by the military. 
  A government official in the provincial town of Siem Reap 
said the Thais were helping the Khmer Rouge as they had a lot of 
money tied up in logs that had been cut but were still lying on 
the ground around Anlung Veng. 
  "There was about 150,000 cubic meters of wood lying there 
when we went in and a cubic meter (35 cubic feet) of top quality 
timber sells for around 80 US dollars," the government official 
said. Government officers confirmed reports that trucks crossed 
over from Thailand to start collecting the wood soon after the 
base was recaptured by the Khmer Rouge on February 24. 
Government officers said the guerrillas were equipped with 
sophisticated anti-tank weaponry, which they believed to be 
German made "Armburst" anti-tank missiles. 
  "I think that Thailand sold this kind of weapon to the Khmer 
Rouge because we have never seen them use it in action before," 
tank commander General Ben Hort said. But a government military 
source in Phnom Penh said the weapons may have been given to the 
royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia] forces and the 
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) 
and then sold to the Khmer Rouge who were their allies in the 
resistance war against the Phnom Penh regime. 
  The war ended with the signing of the 1991 Paris peace 
accords which paved the way for United Nations supervised 
elections and the formation of a coalition government made up of 
the Phnom Penh regime, FUNCINPEC and the political wing of the 
KPNLF.

  After having received Your Majesty's message dated 27

  [Text] I. As members of the FUNCINPEC [National United

of the FUNCINPEC Party by writing a clear letter to inform the

  II. Many days have elapsed, but we have not received even

cats or dogs. 
  III. We wrote that we were then waiting for an answer 
before making a final decision. 
  IV. It has been quite a long time now, but they have not 
given us any reply. This means that you regard us only as dogs. 
In fact, many of us died on the battlefield in serving them. 
  V. For this reason, we would like to declare here that: 
  A. We absolutely oppose Hun Sen and Chea Sim, lackeys

  B. We absolutely oppose the Vietnamese communists 
and the alliance. 
  C. We have now stopped serving as FUNCINPEC members

  VI. As of today, do not seek our service again. Beware of 
your head! If the FUNCINPEC and ANKI leaders want to wage war 
like the Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese communist puppets,

should go out to fight, fight, and fight for your masters. King 
Ranariddh, King Sereivut, and all those who are so good in 
waging war on the paper should go out to fight by themselves. 
  VII. We can find a plot of land for ourselves in the

stolen. You will never know how angry the ANKI troops and people 
are. You are just the ignorants. Go to hell! Go to hell!

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Three Khmer Rouge [KR] leaders and 
several hundred fighters have agreed to surrender to the 
Cambodian government next month, an informed source said. They 
would turn themselves in as soon as all the felled timber in the 
guerrilla-controlled areas had been dragged out by contractors. 
"It is expected that all logs will be removed by the end of 
March. Then in April they will turn themselves in," he told the 
NATION. "This includes three Khmer Rouge leaders and hundreds of 
their soldiers." 
  He declined to name these "leaders", saying only that Ta 
Mok, 
the one-legged hard-line leader of the guerrilla forces, would 
not be among them. He has reportedly abandoned his bases in 
Anlung Veng Province and moved to new headquarters at Trapeang 
Kul. The source said the three had set conditions for their 
surrender, but declined to give details. He said the U.S. 
government has agreed to provide army uniforms for guerrillas 
who defect to the government forces. 
  Khmer Rouge representatives in Phnom Penh were not available 
for comment. 
  Defense Minister Tea Chamrat and another high-ranking member 
of the government were understood to be due in Bangkok this 
weekend to discuss the surrender.

<F P=106> ["Telegram from Khieu Samphan, head of the party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea, to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
Varaman of the Kingdom of Cambodia; dated 5 March -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] With respects to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk 
Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  Your Majesty: Immediately after the UNTAC [UN Transitional 
Authority in Cambodia]-organized elections, some people hoped 
that the bloody war would come to an end and that our country 
would have achieved national reconciliation and peace and 
embarked on national reconstruction. But, the flames of the war 
continue to flare up, burn our country, and cause massive 
destruction to our nation and people. 
  Our nation and the world community have been aware that 
immediately after it was formed in July 1993, the government 
with two prime ministers began to show its force in August by 
mobilizing the forces of both the Vietnamese communist puppets 
and para [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] groups to 
attack the regions of Phnum Chhat [Battambang Province] and 
Stoung [Kompong Thom Province], inflicting untold suffering to 
the local people. Entire family members were either shot dead, 
arrested, or beaten on their heads; old and young women were 
brutally raped; hundreds of houses or villages were burned down; 
cattle were shot at and farm tools were destroyed. 
  Starting from September 1993, the government with two prime 
ministers boisterously mobilized 70 percent of troops and 90 
percent of military commanders out of their total forces in the 
country with 80 percent of their total arsenal, including tanks, 
artilleries, and multiple rocket launchers, to launch operations 
aimed at destroying the forces of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] in 
the region of Anlung Veng. 
  Foreign radio and newspapers kept reporting on this 
operation 
against Anlung Veng from mid-September 1993 through to 21 
February 1994. Some countries even have gone so far as to 
expose their arrogance because they have directly given orders 
for the launching of those large-scale military operations at 
the Anlung Veng battlefield. 
  On the one hand, the people and DK national resistance 
forces 
have held to their unwavering position to abide firmly by the 
banner of national reconciliation of Your Majesty so Cambodia 
can achieve independence, peace, and neutrality within its 
territorial integrity. On the other hand, the people and DK 
national resistance forces have kept their good grasp of the 
situation knowing that these operations to continue kindling war 
is a part of the plan and strategy of the Vietnamese communists 
and the alliance aimed a seizing Cambodia for their respective 
strategic and political interests. The people know they cannot 
evade their sacred duty and have done their utmost to resist and 
smash this strategic criminal scheme. The people and the DK 
national resistance forces, with the support of the Cambodian 
people from all walks of life both at home and abroad, have been 
able -- despite all kinds of difficulties and obstacles -- to 
inflict one defeat after another on the large-scale operations 
by the Vietnamese communists, the alliance, and the two- headed 
government after many months of arduous struggle carried out in 
wave after wave of high spirits, patriotism, and responsiblity 
toward the destiny of our nation, people, and race. This 
continued until they were totally and completely smashed on 24 
February. 
  I raise this Anlung Veng issue with only one thing in mind, 
that is, to inform your Majesty that the flames of war in 
Cambodia are still burning and seething. It is a war that the 
Vietnamese communists and the western alliance wage through the 
government with two prime ministers against the Cambodian 
nation, people, and DK national resistance forces. This is not 
a problem between Cambodians. 
  On the surface, it seems that the forces of the government 
with two prime ministers are fighting against the DK forces. 
But in fact, the government with two prime ministers is just an 
instrument of the Vietnamese communists and western alliance 
with the U.S., France, and Australia as chief perpetrators. 
They have provided money and war materiel to the government 
with two prime ministers for fighting in Cambodia in order to 
keep the flames of war burning and to block national 
reconciliation and national unity. In that way, the Vietnamese 
communists can carry on their strategy to annex Cambodia while 
the Western allies can have their hands in the internal affairs 
of Cambodia and turn it into their forum. All of this is as 
clear as day light. 
  At present, dignitaries from ill-minded countries have come 
one after another to Phnom Penh to talk only about providing 
military assistance to the government with two prime ministers. 
Chea Sim went to Hanoi at the beginning of this month and, 
using his capacity as acting head of state, signed with 
communist Vietnam the so-called military cooperation between 
Cambodia and Vietnam as in the 1979-90 period to allow communist 
Vietnam to send its troops, weapons, and ammunition to Cambodia 
in what they claim is a legal manner to continue the war for the 
destruction of Cambodia. At the same time, Hun Sen talks only 
about the plan to expand the army and attack, attack, attack. 
  The fact that the Vietnamese communists together with the 
alliance have used the forces of the government with two prime 
minister to launch large-scale operations against Anlung Veng 
and other zones in an attempt to destroy the DK forces is merely 
a dirty excuse. What is more important, however, is that deep 
down, they oppose national reconciliation, national unity, and 
peace in Cambodia. 
  The forces fighting against those major operations are those 
of our nation and people both in the countryside and in Phnom 
Penh who have been united in the struggle by all means through 
all forms, each one with his or her own possibility, because 
what everybody wants the most is national reconciliation, the 
end of the war, national unity, and the harmony of all national 
forces in all aspects. 
  In the past, that is, from the end of 1978 to 1991 or during 
the implementation of the Paris agreement, the DK party has done 
its utmost to put an end to this war as soon as possible. 
National and international public opinion have been aware of the 
political stand and attitude of the DK party. 
  Your Majesty has most graciously come up with the five-point 
proposal dated 21 November 1993. The entire Cambodian nation 
and people welcomed it. The DK party also welcomed and fully 
supported this proposal and has taken it as the political basis 
and key for resolving the Cambodian problem. 
  The DK party agrees to a cease-fire, to return all its 
liberated zones to the Kingdom of Cambodia, and to dismantle its 
own army. It calls for nothing more than the implementation of 
His Majesty's five-point guideline for national reconciliation 
and unity so our country will have sufficient forces to jointly 
solve national and social problems now and in the future. 
  Despite this, the government with two prime ministers, 
especially Hun Sen and the people's party of the Vietnamese 
communists, disagree. They have opposed the five-point proposal 
and keep demanding that the DK party fulfill the three-point 
ultimatum and they carry on the war to scorch Cambodia. 
  So far, the national problems have not been resolved while 
social problems worsen with each passing day. If this situation 
is to continue, if they continue to kindle war, what will the 
destiny of our nation and people and of our Kingdom of Cambodia 
be? 
  Cambodia will face the same fate as the frog swallowed up by 
the snake. 
  Your Majesty has already been aware of this situation and 
these problems. Your Majesty has even raised your voice for the 
benefit of our nation and people ever since December 1992. Your 
Majesty has successively paved the way for a solution, 
especially with your sacred five points. 
  Experiences in the past more than eight months have led the 
entire Cambodian nation and people to share the same view that 
under the present circumstances, Your Majesty is the only one 
who can come up with the decisive answer to remedy this 
situation by resorting to the celestial medicine that Your 
Majesty had applied in the 1952-53 period. There is indeed no 
one else than Your Majesty. Otherwise, Cambodia will turn into 
a chaotic abyss where there is only fighting and strangling at 
each other's throat under the evil claws of the Vietnamese 
communists and the allies until our nation disappears like 
Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. 
  Our nation and people from all walks of life in the 
countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad are waiting to support 
and to zealously and firmly march under Your Majesty's 
five-point banner for national reconciliation and unity which 
has now become that of our entire Cambodian nation and people. 
  Our entire nation and people are clearly aware that by 
making 
comparison of the forces, the forces of our nation and people 
with Your Majesty's five-point national reconciliation banner 
are by size the strongest that will certainly have the five 
points materialized. 
  As for the Vietnamese communists and the alliance, they are 
the foreign forces with, on their side, only a handful of 
Cambodians who are rejected and opposed by the Cambodian people 
everyday. The foreigners might have money and weapons, but they 
do not have the people. The people categorically oppose them. 
They are sinking lower and lower into the ground. 
  I would like to beg permission to sincerely submit the above 
for the consideration of Your Majesty out of a lofty sense of 
responsibility for the faith of the Cambodian nation and race 
with no consideration whatsoever of the interests and power for 
myself and my own party. 
  Please permit me and all members of the DK party to extend 
best wishes to Your Majesty for a quick recovery and perfect 
health so as to continue upholding your national salvation 
banner to achieve national reconciliation and rally all national 
forces to defend and perpetuate the Cambodian nation and race. 
  We wish the revered Queen good health so as to effectively 
stay beside the king, especially on this historic period. 
  Please forgive any inappropriateness. 
  [Dated] 5 March 1994 
  [Signed] Khieu Samphan, head of the DK party

  9. a platoon position at Dangkao Pel; and 
  10. the (Kamat) position and the regimental position at 
Prey Khpuos along the Stoeng Mongkolborei river. 
  We killed 25 soldiers of the 6th Division and wounded more 
than 50 others. We destroyed 72 barracks built with concrete, 
four bridges used by the enemies for their tanks and for the 
transport of ammunition -- namely the 25-meter-long O Kanhchos 
bridge, the 15-meter-long (Dangkao Tamang) bridge, the 
8-meter-long Bat Khteah bridge, and the 12-meter-long Ampil Pram 
Daeum bridge. 
  We destroyed five military vehicles; two 60-mm mortars; 12 
AK's; three B-41's; five B-40's; two DK-75 guns; and two 
ammunition depots, which burned for five hours. 
  We seized two 12.7-mm machine guns, two DK-75 guns, nine 
AK's, seven B-40 rocket launchers, six B-41 rocket launchers, 
over 200 assorted mines, 45 B-41 rockets, 15 B-40 rockets, 30 
60-mm mortar shells, and some medicine. 
  At that time, the people declared the dissolution of the 
state authority of the communist Vietnam's puppets and appointed 
people to administer and ensure order in six villages, namely in 
Ta Mach, Dangkao Pel, Mak Khloeur, Prey Khpuos, Anlung Kak, and 
Pongro Ti Muoy. We liberated 5,000 people.

  [Text] On the night of 25 February, the people, who were 
furious with the Vietnamese communist puppets for shipping 
troops and ammunition by trains to attack and massacre them and 
plunder their property, cut off three stretches of railroad with 
a total length of 25 meters in an area between Moung and Kouk 
Trom in Battambang Province. They also cut off four other 
stretches with a total length of 200 meters in an area between 
Prey Svay and (O Krut) in the same province.

communist 
puppets be prevented from shipping troops and ammunition to

Bosnia-Herzegovina in the United Nations. Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
also hoping for humanitarian aid from the international 
community. 
  The Bosnian guest, who arrived in Jakarta yesterday, today 
received an assistance fund from the National Committee for 
Solidarity with Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fund was handed over by 
Probosutejo, the committee chairman.

  [Text] Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic appreciates 
the spirit of Indonesian volunteers who are ready to go to 
Bosnia. He says, however, that Bosnia needs Indonesia's 
diplomatic and political support more urgently. Speaking to 
reporters after holding talks with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas 
in Jakarta this afternoon, Haris Silajdzic said he deeply 
appreciated the spirit of the volunteers. According to 
Silajdzic, the spirit of the volunteers is important because it 
reminds the Bosnians that they are not fighting alone. Bosnia, 
however, more urgently needs the diplomatic and political 
support of Indonesia as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement. 
According to the prime minister, the Indonesian volunteers will 
find it difficult to enter Bosnia because the country is in a 
critical condition.

  [Text] Medan, March 6 (ANTARA) -- Hundreds of Muslim 
University students in North Sumatra have condemned Israel and 
Serbia for the killing of Muslims in Hebron and Bosnia. The 
Muslim students from various institutions stated in a mass 
religious meeting here Saturday that they were ready to engage 
in a holy war (jihad) as volunteers for Bosnia. 
  The young Muslims also urged the government and the 
Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) to immediately prepare the 
sending of volunteers to Bosnia, expressed their support for 
Indonesia's effort to open diplomatic relations with the Bosnian 
Government and to sever diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. 
  "We also fully support Indonesia's active role as NAM 
[Nonaligned Movement] chairman in urging the UN Security Council 
to punish Zionist Israel and Serbs over the killing of Muslims 
in Hebron and Bosnia, and call on Indonesian Muslims to give 
more material assistance for the struggle of Bosnian Muslims," 
they said. 
  An executive of the North Sumatra chapter of the Indonesian 
Islamic Propagation Council, Ilham, told ANTARA that his side 
has distributed hundreds of registration forms for volunteers to 
Bosnia. 
  "I am confident that the number of volunteers to Bosnia will 
continue to increase," he said, adding that his side has managed 
to raise funds totalling 155,000 rupiahs during the mass 
meeting. At least 35 university students have registered 
themselves to become volunteers to Bosnia.

  [Text] Jakarta, Mar. 5 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia's state-owned 
domestic telecommunication company, PT [Company Limited] Telkom 
assists the Cambodian Government in making a telecommunication 
scheme for leasing a Palapa B-4 satellite transponder, president 
the company Setyanto P. Santosa said here Friday. For this 
purpose, he said, a Telkom engineer is now already in Cambodia, 
he told the press on the occasion of the current visit of 
Cambodian Telecommunication Minister [title as received] So Khun 
to Indonesia. 
  He said Telkom is drawing up a plan for the 120 channels on 
the leased transponder which would be serve as a 
telecommunication transmitter between the different towns in 
Cambodia. Telkom has also been asked to assist the operation and 
maintenance of various telecommunication means in that country. 
  The lease of a Palapa B-4 transponder by Cambodia was not 
the 
first one. Previously, Cambodia leased a Palapa B-4 transponder 
through Telstra, the Australian Telecommunication Corporation, 
according to an official of the Satellite Telecommunication 
Region (Witelsat), who preferred to stay anonymous. 
  But the lease through Telstra ended in December 1993, and 
now 
the project is directly handled between Cambodia and Witelsat 
which operates the Palapa B-4 satellite. 
  So Khun is currently in Indonesia since Thursday for signing 
a lease of one-eighth of the transponder (equivalent to 120 
channels) at a rate of 283,712 U.S. dollars per year. 
  The contract was signed in Cibinong, West Java Friday with 
So 
Khun acting for Cambodia, while Indonesia was represented by 
head of Witelsat Bambang Setiawan. So Khun said his country is 
currently very busy with development, including of 
telecommunication. In this context, his government is enhancing 
the quality of Cambodia's human resources in the field of 
telecommuncation. 
  With regard to cooperation between the countries in 
Southeast 
Asia, Setyanto said Indonesia also plans to establish a 
telecommunication cooperation with Vietnam and Myanmar [Burma] 
which now have good prospects.

  Mr. (Niko Koni Santana) issued the challenge in a videotape

Australian city of Darwin. Loraine Davies reports: 
  [Begin Davies recording] (Koni Santana) says that if, as 
Jakarta asserts, the people of East Timor have already freely 
determined their desire for integration, why is it so afraid of 
a referendum. He defies Jakarta to hold the referendum under UN 
supervision to establish the true wish of the East Timorese. He 
states the resistance undertakes to accept the outcome, whatever 
it may be, and also to give up their arms and themselves to the 
Indonesian authorities if the East Timorese vote for 
integration. [end recording]

  [Text] Spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office Aphisit 
Wetchachiwa says Thailand is closely following the U.S. move 
about using Article 301 for trade retaliation. The government 
thinks that international trade atmosphere has largely improved 
following the conclusion of the Uruguay round of trade talks. 
The APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit meeting was 
also marked by a friendly atmosphere. 
  [Begin recording] [Aphisit] We must follow it closely to 
see whether the move will be applied in general. We must be 
prepared; it is the responsibility of the government that wants 
to see a relaxed atmosphere in international trade. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is the U.S. measure meant as 
pressure on this region? 
  [Aphisit] I think it concerns a particular problem. Anyway, 
we cannot remain indifferent but have to follow the developments 
and see whether there is a tendency toward unilateral 
retaliation. As I have said, I believe there will be a 
discussion on this matter at the preparations for the APEC 
meeting. 
  [Correspondent] Will there be any discussion among ourselves 
to prepare for the U.S. move? 
  [Aphisit] The Thai private sector and government are already 
cooperating on that. It's the responsibility of Deputy Prime 
Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in his capacity as head of the 
International Economic Policy Office. There is no problem about 
our preparations to cope with the consequences; we are already 
working together on that. [end recording]

  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced 
on 4 March that the United States will revive Article 301 of the 
1988 U.S. Trade Act in bargaining with Japan. The announcement 
came in the wake of the failure of the final round of trade 
talks on 11 February between U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan. There was no 
conclusion to the establishment of numerical targets for Japan's 
imports from foreign countries and the principles in assessing 
Japanese progress in opening its market to U.S. goods because 
Japan thinks the move violates the principle of free trade, 
something Japan cannot accept. 
  On this, Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Surin Phitsuwan has 
stated Thailand's stand on the American move against Japan. 
  1. Thailand is unhappy with the American and Japanese drift 
toward a trade confrontation caused by the revival of Super 301 
against U.S. trading partners. 
  2. As the world economy liberalizes and countries push for 
the success of the Uruguay round of trade talks, Thailand does 
not want to see a strong retaliatory measure being taken against 
a trading partner. There should be an effort to push for a 
settlement of trade disputes within the framework of the 
multilateral trade forum, which is accepted worldwide. Besides, 
GATT regulations should be strictly implemented and upheld as 
the criteria for trading parties. 
  3. During the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] 
summit in Seattle, both Thailand and the United States kept 
repeating the importance of the success of the Uruguay round. 
Indeed, progress has been made at the Uruguay round. Thailand, 
therefore, is concerned that U.S. retaliation against its 
trading partner might affect the climate of international trade 
as well as the success of the Uruguay round. 
  4. Trade problems between the United States and Japan would 
affect the economy of both countries, and in turn the world's. 
The United States and Japan are respectively Thailand's first 
and second major export markets. Thailand thinks it is the duty 
of both Japan and the United States to solve their remaining 
trade problems in the best possible way on the basis of 
sincerity.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Trade Retaliation by U.S. Will Hinder Japan </F>
Recovery"] 
  [Excerpts] U.S. President Bill Clinton tightened the 
screws on Tokyo Thursday when he revived the "Super 301" 
trade-sanctions authority in an effort to force Japan to buy 
more U.S. goods. [passage omitted] 
  "Unilateral measures not in accordance with the dispute 
settlement rules of the World Trade Organization which were 
established as a result of the conclusion of the Gatt Uruguay 
Round are explicitly prohibited," said Masayoshi Takemura, the 
chief spokesman of the Japanese government. Indeed Gatt rules 
prohibit a country from unilaterally declaring a trade war on 
another. 
  Without doubt, the Japanese themselves are very concerned 
about the trade surplus with the United States because of its 
effect on their own export markets. The pricing of these 
exports in yen -- which currently is high -- is affecting the 
sales of big export products like cars and electronic goods -- 
which makes them less attractive on world markets. 
  This in turn is causing hardship to Japanese companies which 
have to meet production costs or go bust. Certainly the $59.3 
billion trade surplus is also causing problems within Japanese 
industry. 
  When U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor talked about 
taking retaliatory action against Tokyo, he did not state in 
specific figures what he considered a fair trade balance between 
the United States and Japan would be. But if the American side 
insists on zero, the Japanese reply of course would be a prompt 
"impossible". By insisting on zero, the United States would be 
expecting each Japanese to spend twice as much on U.S. products 
as each American spends on Japanese goods, because the US 
population is twice as large as Japan's. 
  Simply charging that certain U.S. products do not sell well 
in Japan while they do well in other countries or regions, and 
using that as evidence that the Japanese market is closed, is 
akin to publicizing one's insufficient knowledge of how business 
is conducted. Corporate marketing efforts determine the trade 
balance between two countries, and politics and diplomacy merely 
provide the stage props. This is elementary business logic. 
Lifestyles differ from country to country. So do customer 
preferences and customs. 
  The Hosokawa government is pushing ahead with deregulation 
to 
make its market more free. Japan has shown seriousness in 
reducing its trade surplus with the US in its latest economic 
stimulus package worth some US$200 million to get the Japanese 
economy moving. Coupled with the high value of the yen, U.S. 
products will certainly be more attractive to Japanese consumers 
when Japan pulls out of its current recession. Are some U.S. 
firms trying to reverse this direction by imposing managed trade 
controlled by the bureaucracy just for the sake of corporate 
profit? 
  Obviously, Clinton was pressured by domestic concerns to 
resort to the Super 301 action on Thursday. According to an ABC 
News/WASHINGTON POST poll released before the U.S. President 
made the decision, a record number of Americans now favor 
imposing sanctions on Japan. The U.S. President himself realizes 
that Super 301 provisions can be a thorn in diplomatic 
relations. When Super 301 was last in use in 1989, Japan, 
Brazil and India were all targeted but sanctions were never used. 
  Since the Hosokawa government is making conscientious 
efforts 
to reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States, Clinton 
might be wise to look back to 1989 and drop the threat of 
sanctions. Excessive U.S. pressure can delay Japan's economic 
recovery, which will also have an impact on the Asia-Pacific 
region, and trade retaliation is not the way to gain access to 
Japanese markets.

<F P=106> [Article by Thitichai Thanadirotkun: "Super 301 -- a Sword </F>
That Has Killed No One"] 
  [Excerpts] President Clinton's executive branch officially 
announced on 3 March that it would apply article Super 301 to 
redress the trade deficit problem with Japan. Super 301 is a 
fearsome weapon as far as the United States is concerned, and 
that country hopes that the article will force Japan to open its 
market to U.S. products. [passage omitted] 
  President George Bush used Super 301 in 1989 and 1990. Japan 
was the target of the article in 1989 and as a result agreed to 
open its supercomputer and satellite markets. 
  It is worth noting that in the two years that the United 
States used Super 301, the ultimate part of the article was 
never applied: that is, the United States has never used Super 
301 to carry out trade sanctions or retaliation against any 
country. It can be said that Super 301 is merely a threat, not 
a tool to be implemented. 
  In the latest development, the United States has declared 
that it would apply Super 301 against Japan. However, it is 
evident that there are many steps in the process: that is, on 31 
March the United States will publish a trade report which will 
identify the countries which are considered to be unfair trading 
partners. [passage omitted] 
  The important point is that there is a considerable time lag 
before the sword of Super 301 is actually delivered to the 
victim. This situation makes Japanese investors feel impervious 
to the threat of Super 301. The Tokyo stock market went up 
360.14 points on 4 March as if to challenge the U.S. 
announcement. The Japanese feel that Japan will open its market 
voluntarily before the Super 301's deadline. 
  Therefore, although U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
announced the use of Super 301, Japanese investors feel that the 
United States was merely play acting. Asian stock markets have 
also not shown that much concern about the matter. The Thai 
stock market went up 18.87 points despite recent weak trading. 
The Nikkei soared 360 points, while the Hang Seng increased 116 
points. 
  The story seems to be that Japan itself has not been 
frightened by the Super 301 issue, and Thailand would therefore 
be overreacting if it became frightened.

  [Text] Fighting broke out yesterday in Cambodia between an 
unidentified number of Khmer Rouge forces and forces of the 
Cambodian Government at O Smach Camp, close to the Thai border 
at Chong Chom Pass in Surin Province. As a result, a large 
number of Cambodian civilians have crossed the border into 
Thailand. The governor of Surin, Kopkun Thonglongya, spoke to 
the Public Relations Department correspondent: 
  [Begin Kopkun recording] The fighting broke out at an early 
hour yesterday and continued until 1100. As a result, we had to 
suspend the opening of the border passes. What caused a big 
concern for us was the influx of about 2,000 refugees from 
Cambodia. Anyway, after the fighting died down, our military, 
police, and civilian officials, as well as territorial defense 
volunteers pushed the refugees back into Cambodia. None of them 
are still in Thailand. This fighting happens every month. 
There are exchanges of gunfire and our border villagers are 
used to it by now. What we feared was that the Cambodians who 
fled into Thailand might refuse to go back. We are also 
concerned about stray shells which might hit our people, their 
homes and property. If we can prevent the two things, then we 
have nothing to worry about since we have nothing to do with 
their fighting. [end recording]

  [Text] Reporting on the survey made by international 
economic institutions and himself, in the capacity as economic 
consultant to the Lao Government, Dr. Wiraphong Ramangkun, 
secretary general of the Thai-Lao Friendship Association, told 
PRACHACHAT THURAKIT that Laos is rich in natural resources of 
all types that are spread throughout the country. Northern Laos 
is rich in lignite -- the first deposit found has a lignite 
reserve of the same amount found at Thailand's Mae Mo mine in 
Lampang Province. Yet, there are still many more lignite 
deposits in Laos believed to be larger than what has been found 
in Thailand. The assessment was made by a subsidiary of the 
Ngan Thawi Group in Hongsa of Laos whose lignite mine can 
generate power for over 60 years. Also based on the old French 
maps, Laos has iron ore deposits in Luang Nam Tha; zinc and 
copper mines in Xieng Khouang; and gems, especially a large 
amount of blue sapphires, in Bokeo. The central part of the 
country is covered with forests and water sources suitable for 
building hydroelectric dams. The Nam Ngum hydroelectric dam is 
now providing electricity for Thailand. In southern Laos, there 
are oil deposits and forests and water sources, good for the 
construction of a hydroelectric dam. There are already two dams 
there -- Nam Theun 1 and Nam Theun 2. There is a vast area still 
untapped, and it is possible that there are abundant resources 
in the area. 
  Dr. Wiraphong noted that, from assessments, the potential of 
Laos' energy production could turn the country into one of 
richest in terms of economic potential since that means the 4 
million inhabitants of Laos can export 20,000 megawatts of power 
annually, in other words, a highest per capita income. The 
country would become "a second Brunei." That is why Laos is 
focussing on investment in energy development. The program is 
incorporated in the fourth national economic and social 
development plan, which will begin on 1 January 1995. Based on 
the assessment, the best way to earn an income for the country 
and to attain an economic stability is through exports of 
energy. Meanwhile, Thailand would be a major customer of Laos, 
because Thailand can no longer expand production of energy, 
while demand is always increasing. Thailand therefore needs a 
power supply from Laos. 
  Anyway, Dr. Wiraphong said he prefers to see Thailand buying 
power from Laos for direct consumption instead of buying bunker 
oil from Saudi Arabia for power production. By importing power 
from Laos, Thailand is helping a brother country. The money 
spent will remain circulated within the region and could one day 
return to Thailand. 
  In conclusion, he said: "Whether Laos would be successful in 
economic development and become a second Brunei also depends on 
Thailand, since Thailand will be the sole country to buy 
electricity and power from Laos. Vietnam is self-sufficient in 
this area and can rely on local production; the same is true for 
China. The customer of Laos is Thailand."

  [Excerpt] According to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak, Thailand's image in the eyes of Laos is rather 
negative, resulting in Thai investment in that country to be 
monitored closely by the Lao Government. This has led to a 
reduction in Thai investment in Laos because investors could not 
tolerate Lao Government's witchhunt. The Lao Government's 
suspicions about Thai investment resulted from behavior of 
unscrupulous Thai businessmen. 
  Suphachai said the Thai Government could not gain correct 
understanding of the Lao Government in every issue involving 
Thai investment. The private sector, particularly the chambers 
of commerce in the northeastern provinces, should play a role in 
this matter. The chambers of commerce could join to form a 
"northeast business council" or a committee on Thai-Lao trade to 
screen prospective investors to find good people whose 
investment would not exploit Laos as in the past. The council 
could also set regulations governing Thai businessmen making 
investment in Laos and protect their interests when Laos changes 
its regulations. These frequent changes of Lao regulations have 
always troubled Thai investors. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mae Hong Son -- A special police task force unit 
intercepted a large cache of ammunition just as arms smugglers 
were about to deliver it to customers near the Thai-Burmese 
border yesterday. The cache included 2,500 rounds for an M79 
grenade-launcher and 20,080 rounds for an M60 medium machine 
gun. The seizure happened at about 1 p.m. when 10 policemen were 
patrolling near Ban Mae Suya. They spotted a convoy of 30 
pack-horses being guarded by a group of armed men heading for 
Burmese territory. 
  Because they were outnumbered, police decided to follow the 
gang towards the border until they accidently found a gunny bag 
believed to have fallen from a pack-horse that contained 2,580 
rounds of M79 and M60 ammunition. Police decided to call in more 
reinforcements and fired into the air to stop the convoy but 
they sped away. 
  Police yesterday morning combed the area and found nine 
horses including a dead one, abandoned in the jungle. Each of 
them was found carrying over 2,000 rounds of ammunition.

  [Text] The volume of trade between India and Thailand in 
chemicals, pharmaceuticals and dyestuff could reach 25 billion 
baht over the next five years, predicted the leader of an Indian 
delegation which visited Bangkok last week. The objectives of 
the delegation were to promote exports of India, source raw 
material from Thailand and to explore the possibility of setting 
up joint ventures either in Thailand or in India. 
  The delegation was led by Vishnu M Warke. Its six members 
represented CHEMEXCIL, India's basic chemicals, pharmaceuticals 
and cosmetics export promotion council, set up by the Ministry 
of Commerce. 
  "Chemicals, which account for 10 percent of total trade, is 
the only area in which the balance of trade is tilted in 
Thailand's favour," explained Alok Sinha, the first secretary of 
the Indian Embassy. 
  Trade between Thailand and India was 12.14 billion baht from 
January to October 1993, with Thai imports valued at 10.56 
billion baht. India along with Indonesia is the largest buyer of 
carbon black from Thailand, manufactured by Thai Carbon Black, a 
member of the Indian group Birla. The existence of joint 
ventures in Thailand such as Matangi Dyestuffs Ltd, Thai Ambica 
Chemicals Ltd, Lupin Chemcials and Ranbaxy is expected to 
increase trade in this area. 
  Members of the delegation were on the look-out for 
distributors for their products in Thailand. These ranged from 
tissue culture media to surgical dressings, chemicals for the 
pulp and paper industry and incense sticks. 
  India also wants to push its dye stuff in Thailand, a 
product 
category in which it is edged out by suppliers from Taiwan, 
China and Indonesia who offer standardised products at cheaper 
prices. 
  Agar-agar powder and raw material for the manufacture of 
incense sticks were among the products that the delegation 
wanted to source from Thailand.

  [Excerpt] Last week's agreement for Sweden, Finland and 
Austria to join the European Union [EU] could bring both 
benefits and costs to Thailand, experts say but the most 
pressing short-term issue could be trade quotas, according to 
one. Danai Dulampha, until last year Thai ambassador to Brussels 
and currently president of the Thai Tapioca Development 
Institute said Thailand should receive larger quotas for tapioca 
and other products since the EU market has been enlarged. 
However, this would depend on negotiations and to the degree of 
integration of the EU and its new members, he added. 
  A European ambassador, who asked not to be identified, 
predicted that one of the difficulties to arise from the EU's 
enlargement will be the increased complexity of the Union's 
decision-making processes because 15 countries' interests must 
be balanced instead of 12. This, he suggested, would mean that 
non-members would also face greater difficulties in negotiating 
with the EU. 
  Thai exports of textiles, garments and canned tuna to the EU 
are limited by quotas, but not those to the Nordic countries. 
Austria has some largely insignificant quotas on the small 
volume of textile products it buys from Thailand. 
  Mr Danai said Thailand must evaluate in detail the tax 
concessions provided within the Generalised System of 
Preferences (GSP). The EU and its three prospective new members 
grant Thailand different GSP concessions; therefore, benefits 
will increase or decrease if new members adopt standard EU GSP 
rates. 
  Thai agricultural products may also become subject to new 
health and sanitary standards. 
  Foreign Trade Department Director General Oranut Osathanon 
agreed that both positive and negative consequences would result 
from EU GSP standards. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Danai said some tariff rates, particularly 
agricultural items previously bound to GATT stipulations, may be 
lower than those of the EU. Integration may therefore mean 
raising tariffs. Should this occur, Thailand will be compelled 
to request compensation from the EU, he said. 
  He provided Spain as the example when that country 
integrated 
with the European community and raised its tariffs on maize to 
comply with EU rate, allowing imports of 200,000 tons of maize 
from the US to enter with low tariffs as compensation to the US 
which suffered from EU expansion. 
  Business Economic Department deputy director-general 
Aphiradi 
Tantraphon said in principal, the market for Thai products 
should expand as the EU membership expands, with a possibility 
of entering new markets such as in Eastern Europe. She said the 
Department had studied the impact of the expansion of the EU to 
include Sweden and found that the standard of imports for 
agricultural products would not be higher than current 
standards; therefore Thai products should face no greater 
difficulties in accessing that market after integration. 
  However, details of the expansion have yet to be released. 
It is simply too early to forecast accurately the integration's 
impact, she said. 
  A Business Economic Department source said the addition of 
those new members would have only a slight impact on Thai 
exports because those new members already hold membership to the 
European Free Trade Association, which is integrated with the 
European Economic Area. 
  Board of Trade of Thailand executive director Prayun 
Thaloengsi said the expansion of the EU may increase the 
difficulty of new members entering the EU market, requiring them 
to adjust standard quotas. The exporting members must adjust 
to the standards to remain competitive, he said. Mr Prayun 
opined that the bargaining power of Thai exporters with new 
members, who once were independent, may decrease after their EU 
membership. [passage omitted]

struggling to overthrow the genocidal regime. In 1978 he was 
appointed as vice president of the Cambodian united front for 
national salvation [Kampuchean National United Front for 
National Salvation]. In 1979, he was member of the Cambodian 
People's Revolutionary Council and interior minister of the 
State of Cambodia. During 12 years since 1981 he has been 
elected president of the United Front for Fatherland 
Construction and Preservation [Kampuchean National United Front 
for Construction and Defense], member of the people's council of 
Prey Veng Province and also president of the National Assembly 
of the State of Cambodia. 
  In the new period of peace and national reconciliation, 
through the general national elections held under the agies of 
the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia in 1993, 
Samdech Chea Sim was elected member to the National Assembly for 
Phnom Penh constituency. At the preliminary session of the 
National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, he was elected 
president of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  On November 9, 1993, he was offered a title as Samdech by 
His

<F P=106> [PASASON 5 March Editorial: "Wholeheartedly Welcome for a </F>
High-Level Delegation of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia"] 
  [Text] In response to the invitation of His Excellency 
Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly of the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], Samdech Chea Sim, chairman 
of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and his 
delegation will begin an official friendship visit to the LPDR 
from the morning of 5 March. 
  Regarding this important and meaningful event in the 
Lao-Cambodia relations, the people of Vientiane and all the 
multiethnic Lao people throughout the country are very pleased 
and overwhelmingly joyous. They also feel highly honored to 
have an opportunity to welcome the high-level delegation of the 
National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia. This official 
friendship visit to the LPDR by Samdech Chea Sim and his 
delegation occurs after the high-level delegations of the 
Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Government of the 
LPDR [words indistinct]. This shows that the relations and 
cooperation in various fields between the LPDR and the Kingdom 
of Cambodia in the new era are developing significantly, 
especially between the governments and the legislative 
institutions of the two countries. The party, state, and 
multiethnic people of Laos have always closely followed 
developments in the Kingdom of Cambodia, regarding it as our 
close neighbor. We all realize that Cambodia is a nation of 
energetic and courageous traditions. During the period of the 
Khmer Kingdom a world wonder was erected -- the internationally 
famous Angkor Wat. Despite hardships in the course of history, 
due to the determination of internal factions coupled with 
international support, the Cambodian people have now entered a 
period of national construction and national reconcililation. 
At present this process has reached another step. With the 
said responsible determination of various factions, the 
fraternal Cambodian people in the Kingdom of Cambodia under the 
leadership of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Voraman will 
convincingly succeed in making the Kingdom of Cambodia a kingdom 
of independence, peace, and neutrality. Together they will 
bring progress and prosperity to their country and develop 
friendly relations with other countries, beginning with their 
neighbors. 
  The traditional relations of friendship, solidarity, and 
cooperation between Lao and Cambodian peoples, have existed for 
quite a long time since the ancient days. They have been passed 
along from generation to generation from our ancestors. The Lao 
people have always firmly nourished such relations and still 
have honest and unchangeable intentions to continuously improve 
the existing good relations and make them flourish steadily. 
Nowadays, Lao and Cambodian peoples are attentively 
implementing the principles of the joint communique issued in 
July 1993 and the joint statement signed by the two governments 
in November 1993 of an agreement on economic, scientific, 
technological, and cultural cooperation between the two 
countries. The main purpose is to serve the interests of the 
peoples of Laos and Cambodia who share many similarities, such 
as cultural, traditional, and religious aspects. Suffice it to 
say the two countries deservingly enjoy their brotherly and 
neighborly relations and solidarity. 
  On this glorious occasion, all Lao people wish the people in 
Cambodia to attain a greater new victory and make a new life to 
further create national conciliation and build up the Kingdom of 
Cambodia under the monarchic leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk 
Voraman with everlasting progress and prosperity. We wish the 
visit to the LPDR by Samdech Chea Sim and his delegation 
glorious success. We are all confident that through the visit to 
the LPDR by the high-level delegation of the National Assembly 
of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the relations between the 
legislative institutions of the LPDR and the Kingdom of Cambodia 
will develop into a new stage that corresponds with economic, 
social, and cultural development of each country.

  [Text] Vientiane -- Laotian authorities are watching for 
further Thai moves against anti-Vientiane forces along the 
border after last week's request by the Supreme Command for the 
arrest of two rebel leaders, the Laotian Vice Minister for 
Information and Culture, Bounteng Vongsai said yesterday. He 
said the request was welcome, although long overdue. If 
implemented it would definitely improve bilateral ties. The 
Supreme Command has asked police to issue arrest warrants for 
Vang Pao and Gen Thonglit Chokbengboun, reputed leaders of the 
anti-communist Hmong guerrillas, and also requested that the 
United States consider taking legal action against them. 
  Vang Pao spent two years along the Thai-Lao border after the 
1975 defeat of the US-backed guerrillas by troops of the 
communist government in Laos. 
  The general then went to live in the United States and took 
up American citizenship but is reported to have returned 
frequently to Thailand. 
  The Supreme Command said issuing warrents would allow 
authorities to act against the two men immediately if the return 
again. 
  "It would be much appreciated if Thailand acted on the 
Supreme Command request for police to arrest General Vang Pao 
and General Thonglit Chokbengboun for allegedly violating Thai 
security laws," said Bounteng. 
  "Thailand should have (issued warrants) a long time ago. We 
will keep watching to see if Thailand acts in accordance with 
the request," he said. 
  Bounteng said that following up with strong action against 
rebels hiding out in Thailand would be a clear reflection of the 
strong feeling of co-operation and unity between the two 
countries, which have a long common border and close cultural 
and languages ties. 
  "lssuing arrest warrants for Vang Pao and Thonglit would be 
an explicit affirmation by Thailand of its foreign policy of not 
allowing any group to use its territory as a base to launch 
attacks on neighbouring countries," he said. 
  Bounteng believes that hundreds of Hmong living in Wat Tham 
Krabok drug treatment centre in Saraburi Province are members of 
Vang Pao's anti-Vientiane forces. 
  "The Thai government should be aware that the Hmongs in the 
drug treatment centre are not all drug addicts," he said. 
  The temple has a reputation for rehabilitating drug addicts 
from Thailand and other countries. The number of Hmongs 
entering the country without permission, reputedly to receive 
treatment, has increased in recent years. 
  National Security Council chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit has 
said the Hmongs illegally living in the temple should be 
repatriated to Laos. 
  Bounteng said Laos would welcome them back if they were 
prepared to work for the country's development. 
  The Laotian people would help authorities keep a close watch 
on the returnees and report them if they showed any intention of 
disrupting the government or the country. 
  "When the late Kaysone Phomvihan was asked several years ago 
about the number of people in Laos and the number of police, he 
answered that they are the same, about 3.5 million at that 
time," the minister said.

  IDO, Japan's major mobile phone operator, and the U.S.

against Japan, they said. 
  The sources said IDO still opposes a U.S. call for 
allocation 
of part of the frequencies presently used for Nippon Telegraph

  If both companies reach a final agreement, Japanese telecom 
trade negotiators are ready to start talks with their U.S. 
counterparts to avoid U.S. retaliation, an official at the Posts 
and Telecommunications Ministry said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Japan's Trade Ministry on 
Monday [7 March] urged U.S. flat glass makers to strive harder 
to enter the Japanese market. Japanese flat glass makers have 
done all they could to promote fair competition while their U.S. 
counterparts' efforts to do business in this country have been 
insufficient, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) said. 
  Citing the latest poll on Japanese wholesalers of flat 
glass, 
MITI said 11.4 percent of those polled handle imported flat 
glass, an increase from 5.7 percent in the previous June 1993 
survey. 
  The data does not necessarily suggest that the remaining 
88.6 
percent or 303 firms are reluctant to import foreign-made flat 
glass, MITI said, noting that most responded they had no records 
of buying foreign products just because they have not received 
any inquiries from foreign makers. Of the 303 wholesalers, only 
74 reported having had contact from foreign firms whose efforts 
were described as limited by 53 wholesalers in failing to 
progress beyond exchanging greetings or sending direct mail, 
MITI said. 
  The survey was conducted from November through December 1993 
with 385 wholesalers belonging to the nationwide flat glass 
wholesalers' group. Of the total, 342 responded. 
  A MITI official said the survey was conducted to check the 
openness of Japan's flat glass market following the enforcement 
of a variety of market-opening measures after then U.S. 
President George Bush's visit to Japan in January 1992. 
  Based on the "Tokyo Declaration on the U.S.-Japan Global 
Partnership" signed during Bush's Japan visit, MITI formulated 
an antitrust program for Japan's three major flat glass makers, 
encouraged users to step up imports and encouraged greater 
efforts by foreign makers, the official said. 
  The U.S. often describes Japan's flat glass distribution 
system as exclusive of imports but Washington's "distorted 
perception" of the Japanese market as closed should be 
rectified, the official said. 
  The MITI official said Japan's top glass maker Asahi Glass 
Co. has scrapped shady pricing systems and "a progressive rebate 
system," a practice that has drawn foreign criticism as 
exclusionary by promoting wholesale buying only from a single 
maker. 
  The two other major glass makers also unveiled a plan to 
abolish these practices from April, the official said. 
  In the latest survey, 30 of 39 wholesalers that handle 
foreign products cited further qualitative improvement as a top 
condition for increasing purchases from foreign companies in the 
future. In contrast, only three of the 39 firms cited quality 
as a reason for handling foreign products. 
  Japan's flat glass imports from the U.S. surged 27 percent 
in 
1993, the official said. 
  Imports could rise in the future if foreign makers improved 
quality, prices and delivery, the official said.

  [Text] The Ministry of Transport announced on 3 March that 
Chrysler's Cherokee, a recreational four-wheel-drive vehicle, 
would no longer require "vehicle-by-vehicle" inspection when it 
is put on sale in Japan. This is part of efforts to increase 
imports of U.S. automobiles into Japan. 
  In the Japan-U.S. economic talks, the United States 
condemned 
the Japanese system of inspecting imported cars as an invisible 
trade barrier. Under the system, every single imported car is 
inspected to make sure that it meets Japan's safety standards.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- Mazda Motor Corp. plans to 
purchase 2.4 billion dollars worth of U.S.-made auto components 
in fiscal 1997, company officials said Saturday [5 March]. 
  Mazda is among major Japanese carmakers that have been 
mapping out individual parts-purchase programs in the wake of 
the collapse in February of "framework" trade talks between 
Japan and the United States. 
  Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker, is also expected 
to unveil by the end of the month a "voluntary target" to 
purchase parts worth some 6 billion dollars in fiscal 1996. 
  Under the "voluntary" plan, scheduled to be announced in 
mid- 
March, Mazda will import 400 million dollars worth in parts from 
the U.S. and its U.S. plant, Auto Alliance International, will 
procure another 2 billion dollars worth. 
  Mazda officials said the planned purchases include 2.3 
billion dollars worth in parts Mazda had intended to buy in 
fiscal 1994 in line with its plans unveiled in January 1992 
during then President George Bush's visit to Tokyo. 
  The initial plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April, calls 
for 1.9 billion dollars worth in purchases by its U.S. plant and 
400 million dollars worth in imports by the parent Mazda. 
  Mazda decided to postpone implementation of its initial 1994 
plan, however, due to the prolonged car sales slump in Japan. 
Instead, it will put off the purchases by three years and add 
slightly to the total planned purchases, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- The government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will hold a ministerial meeting 
Wednesday [9 March] to map out voluntary market-opening 
measures, officials said Saturday. 
  The government officials said the decision was made during a 
50- minute meeting between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura at Hosokawa's official residence Saturday 
evening. 
  The ministerial session follows a U.S. decision to reinstate 
the Super 301 trade retaliation provision against countries 
deemed to engage in unfair trade practices. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton took the action after Japan-U.S. 
talks for a new framework for bilateral trade broke down last 
month. 
  The ministerial meeting is timed to coincide with a visit to 
Japan by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrives 
on Wednesday for talks the next day with Hosokawa and other 
government leaders on trade and other issues. 
  The officials said the Japanese Government plans to work out 
market-opening measures by the end of March. 
  Japan has been under pressure from the United States and 
Europe to open its markets to reduce its growing current account 
and trade surpluses. 
  The officials said Hosokawa hopes to convey Japan's market- 
opening package to Christopher at their meeting Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Announcement of some of the 
government's market-opening measures could be delayed until the 
next fiscal year, which begins on April 1, a senior Trade 
Ministry official said Monday [7 March]. 
  Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki 
Kumano 
told a press conference that it is possible that some parts of 
the four-point package, originally planned for release by the 
end of March, will be unveiled toward the July summit of the 
Group of Seven industrial nations in Naples. 
  Kumano was referring to remarks earlier in the day by Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura indicating a possible delay 
in the market-opening measures beyond the end of fiscal 1993. 
  Market-opening steps in four areas are being worked out by 
the government following the breakdown in February of the trade 
"framework" talks with the United States. The areas are 
deregulation, import and investment promotion, government 
procurement systems and competition policy. 
  The Naples summit could become a new deadline for some of 
the 
four measures, Kumano said. He declined to comment on which 
sectors might be delayed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata by newscasters </F>
Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, Keio University Professor 
Yoshiaki Kobayashi, and commentator Kenichi Takemura at the FNN 
Studio in Tokyo; from the "News 2001" program -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Video shows DPRK declaration to secede from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, followed by comments from 
Yasuhiko Yoshida, former chief of the IAEA's public relations 
department, and Hisakatsu Okazaki, former Japanese ambassador to 
Thailand, on North Korean development of nuclear weapons] 
[Matsuyama] We will now begin our interview with Tsutomu Hata 
who is deputy prime minister and foreign minister. 
  [Kuroiwa] Good morning. Deputy Prime Minister Hata, there 
are many things we would like to ask you about, such as the 
cabinet reshuffle and Japan-U.S. relations. However, first I 
would like to ask you about the issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear arms development, which was explained in the video we 
just saw. Ichiro Ozawa said earlier in this program that North 
Korea possesses nuclear weapons. What do you think? 
  [Hata] There are three suspicions regarding the North Korean 
nuclear issue: first, that it is planning to make nuclear 
weapons; second, that it has tried before to make nuclear 
weapons; or third, it already has one or two atomic bombs in its 
possession which are the same size as those dropped on Hiroshina 
and Nagasaki. Amid such suspicions, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] has begun inspections of North Korea's 
nuclear facilities. It was difficult to persuade North Korea to 
accept inspections of the seven facilities included in the list 
they submitted. The IAEA has begun the inspections thanks to 
persistent negotiations by the United States. However, the 
inspections have only just begun; their outcome is yet to be 
determined. Also, we are still faced with the issue of 
inspecting the other two facilities not included on the list. 
The United States has been saying it will not conduct the Team 
Spirit joint military exercises if North Korea accepts the 
inspections, followed by discussions between the North and 
South. Actually, South Korea proposed calling off the exercises, 
and the United States accepted. Under such circumstances, the 
IAEA has begun its inspections. The international community is 
still worried about the other two facilities, and is wondering 
whether or not the current inspections of the seven facilities 
will be carried out thoroughly. 
  [Kuroiwa] As foreign minister, what do you think about all 
this? Do you think North Korea has nuclear weapons? 
  [Hata] Well, under the current circumstances I would like to 
refrain from commenting on whether or not North Korea possesses 
nuclear weapons. 
  [Kuroiwa] What will be the basis of your decisionmaking? 
What kind of information are you going to use to determine 
whether or not North Korea possesses nuclear weapons? Will it 
be information provided by the United States? 
  [Hata] The IAEA is conducting its inspections as an official 
organization of the international community. We will make our 
decision on the basis of the outcome of those inspections. Of 
course, we will also obtain information from the United States, 
China, and other countries, not to mention the ROK. 
  [Matsuyama] As we discussed earlier, inspections will not be 
carried out this time on the other two facilities. As we saw in 
the video, many feel the effect of the current inspections will 
be minimal. In this regard, we received answers to our 
questions from the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan [Chongnyon]. According to them, the two facilities are 
military bases. Chongnyon adds that any claims about the two 
sites being nuclear facilities is intentionally fostering 
suspicion. They feel the possibility exists that all other 
North Korean military facilities will be stripped of their veils 
if inspections of these two facilities are accepted. Therefore, 
North Korea refused to accept inspections of the two facilities. 
What do you think of this response? 
  [Hata] Of course, this was discussed between the United 
States and the ROK. However, the inspections of the seven 
facilities which are included on the list will give us some idea 
of whether or not the material required for making nuclear bombs 
was removed. Therefore, the United States and the ROK agreed to 
inspect these facilities first. Moreover, they also agreed to 
call off the Team Spirit exercises. The inspections have just 
begun. On the basis of the outcome of the inspections, the 
United States and the DPRK will hold discussions again. They 
are scheduled to hold the third meeting on 21 March. We will 
make our decision on the basis of these procedures. 
  [Takemura] It is regrettable that Japan cannot take the 
leadership. This is an extremely important issue for Japan. 
Nevertheless, Japan has to rely on the United States after all. 
As I recall, former President Reagan took a very strong stance 
toward the Soviet Union about ten years ago. The Soviet Union 
deployed its SS-20 medium-range missiles. In response, the 
United States decided to deploy medium-range missiles in Europe. 
President Reagan maintained this hard stance for a long time; 
the strategy worked well, and finally the Soviet Union gave up 
the arms race in 1985, and Gorbachev eventually dismantled the 
Soviet Union. It would be nice if North Korea gave in like the 
Soviet Union did. However, the cases of the Soviet Union and 
North Korea are quite different. The United States is not 
taking any aggressive attitude toward North Korea for the fear 
North Korea may go haywire. However, American newspapers are 
saying President Clinton is a man of indecision or is weak in 
comparison to former President Reagan. I wonder what kind of 
attitude the Japanese Foreign Ministry will adopt if President 
Clinton begins to take a strong stance as Reagan did. 
  [Hata] In the meeting with Mr. Clinton or in my talks 
with the U.S. secretary of defense, we said that even though 
inspections had not started, negotiations were still underway to 
that end, and so it was best not to do anything that would 
incite North Korea. 
  As a matter of principle, if the DPRK decides to reject 
inspections or to use its negotiating position in a strange way, 
Japan should do what it can under its Constitution. 
  [Takemura] We all know there are big limitations under the 
Constitution. Besides, if North Korea becomes willing to start 
war, its nuclear warheads cannot be sent as far as the United 
States because it does not have the missiles to carry them that 
far; its missiles can, though, reach Japan and South Korea. 
That is what is decisively different from the situation that 
existed at the time of tension between Europe and the Soviet 
Union. Are we prepared to face this situation, though? 
  [Kobayashi] This is no ordinary situation for Japan. If 
North Korea continues to reject inspection of two other 
facilities, there is the possibility of U.S.-DPRK negotiations 
breaking down. 
  [Hata] It is not just the U.S.-DPRK negotiations that are 
jeopardized. The whole international community is very much 
concerned. Once North Korea is permitted to get away with it, 
the many other nations which want nuclear arms of their own will 
do the same. As such, the international community is very wary. 
In other words, everyone is watching patiently. 
  [Kobayashi] As far as the possibility of U.S.-DPRK 
negotiations breaking down is concerned, Ms. Hisahiko Okabe said 
a rift in the talks could come as early as April. As far as 
Japan is concerned, there is no other choice but to wait and see 
what will happen in U.S.-DRPK negotiations. Is that right? 
  [Hata] We are not exactly waiting only for the outcome of 
the U.S.-DPRK negotiations. As the IAEA is now conducting 
inspections, it is only natural Japan should consider its next 
moves after monitoring the progress of the inspections. 
However, we must remember that Japan's Constitution tells us 
what the country can and cannot do, so we ourselves know along 
what guidelines we can act and we can tell others as well. 
  [Matsuyama] Please look at this video footage. [video shows 
Prime Minister Hosokawa at a post-U.S.-Japan summit news 
conference saying Japan will do what it can if the UN Security 
Council adopts economic sanctions against North Korea; other 
people speak about Pyongyang's foreign money sources] 
  [Kuroiwa] North Korea thinks enforcing economic sanctions is 
tantamount to declaring a war. This means that if Japan 
participates in economic sanctions, Japan will be party to 
declaring a state of war, right? 
  [Hata] North Korea did make a remark like that. 
  [Kuroiwa] Will Japan, despite this statement, turn its 
promises into actions? 
  [Hata] It is the North Koreans who made that statement. If 
it decided to enforce sanctions and we are asked to cooperate, 
then we must play our part. 
  [Kuroiwa] Prime Minister Hosokawa said clearly that Japan 
would cooperate if the United Nations asked countries to take 
economic sanctions against the DPRK. But such action might be 
taken suddenly, so has the matter been discussed within the 
government and ruling coalition parties? 
  [Hata] Does Japan, which has for so long talked about the 
importance of the United Nations in world affairs and about the 
importance of UN-centered diplomacy, want to hear the charge 
that it has run away from its responsibilities when the time to 
play its part comes? Above all, this is a matter that concerns 
its closest neighboring country. Japan cannot do that. That is 
why Prime Minister Hosokawa said Japan will act -- within the 
limits allowed under the Constitution. 
  [Kuroiwa] So, if it is decided to adopt economic sanctions, 
Japan will cooperate? 
  [Hata] This whole matter is continuing. I do not think it 
appropriate to discuss it when inspections of the North Korean 
nuclear facilities have just started. 
  [Takemura] There is nothing wrong with Mr. Kuroiwa 
wanting to pursue this matter in depth. This is different from 
a question such as whether or not Sakigake [Harbinger] and the 
Japan New Party will merge. That kind of thing really does not 
mean much. But the topic of North Korea concerns the lives of 
our people and I think everyone watching this program has a keen 
interest in it. I believe television programs should take this 
topic seriously, so I am pleased it is one of the topics for 
discussion today. 
  Other countries see that although this is an issue about 
which the Japanese people should be most concerned, they do not 
seem to show much interest about it. That is what a foreign 
newspaper wrote -- half in derision. I want everyone to be 
aware of this. Mr. Hata was almost late for the program. He is 
busy every day, but has he been busy with the North Korean 
issue? He has been occupied by the cabinet reshuffle and other 
worthless things. 
  [Hata] I have been busy, but not as you have described. 
There are things that cannot be made public. Like information 
on... [sentence incomplete as Takemura interrupts] 
  [Takemura, interrupting] Foreign Minister Hata, you are the 
number-one man on this question. I certainly hope you will deal 
with it. It is, I think, the first most serious crisis Japan 
has faced in the 50 years since the end of World War II. It is 
about the country which lies right next to us. 
  [Matsuyama] There is another thing that worries us. Will 
you please show that video, Mr. Nakamura? This is a report 
carried by the MAINICHI DAILY NEWS late last year. According to 
this, Mr. Hata said he had heard that the Cabinet Information 
Research Office estimated the amount of money sent to North 
Korea from Japan amounts to almost 200 billion yen a year. 
  [Hata] The Cabinet Information Research Office said that? I 
think there is something wrong here. I have never said anything 
of the kind. 
  [Matsuyama] Well, that is the way the report was written, 
and we have obtained a comment from the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] on the subject. It said 
that claims of figures as high as tens or hundreds of billions 
of yen are without foundation. What do you have to say about 
that? 
  [Hata] What I want to say is that various sources of 
information allege that large amounts of money have flowed into 
North Korea from Japan -- some of them making reference to tens 
or hundreds of billions of yen. Some say the money has been 
carried by travelers in person or in their luggage, or has been 
sent via Hong Kong or China. While there has been much talk 
about the matter, to our regret we have not been able to 
accurately assess the amounts involved. 
  [Matsuyama] Is the government doing anything to discover how 
much is involved? 
  [Hata] Even though there are no diplomatic relations between 
Japan and North Korea, we have to consider human rights and 
those people whose fatherland is North Korea or who were born 
there. 
  [Kuroiwa] As Katsumi Sato said earlier, as long as these 
people cannot be stopped from reentering Japan, the money flow 
cannot be stemmed. 
  [Hata] I am talking only in terms of general principle. 
  [Kuroiwa] The problem of money transfer will remain to be 
tackled in the future. 
  [Hata] North Korea is at present isolated. Being isolated 
means that there is no information coming out of there. 
Besides, the country has a very strong power structure, and the 
nation can be moved easily by its leaders. The country has a 
very strong power structure, but is dangerous. It is for this 
reason I have been saying it is very important that the people 
of North Korea join the international community or that an 
atmosphere can be created in which true dialogue can be held. 
  [Kuroiwa] I never meant to pose the question out of 
unnecessary fear. I presented the question in the belief that 
issues related to security and diplomacy should be dealt with on 
the assumption that the worse could happen. 
  [Maysuyama] Now, we would like to ask you about relations 
between Japan and the United States. But, first, we must beg 
your pardon for saying earlier that you came late because of 
your tight schedule. It was due to our failure to contact you 
and confirm arrangements. We are very sorry. [laughter] 
  [Kuroiwa] We would like to have your comments on 
Japan-U.S. relations. When you consider the DPRK issue, you 
once again recognize the importance of Japan-U.S. relations. We 
feel the controversial Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus 
Trade Act strongly suggests Japan is being threatened. However, 
now that Tokyo has declared Japan-U.S. relations have matured, 
we believe Japan will not yield to U.S. threats and make 
concessions. What are your views? 
  [Hata] The fact is that Mr. Clinton has stated since the 
presidential election campaign that he would revive the Super 
301 provision. There were many arguments about the wisdom of 
this before the recent negotiations started. Some said it was 
inevitable that the United States would have to revive it. I 
think by showing its intention to revive the Super 301, the 
United States is urging Japan to give matters serious 
consideration. We have no intention, however, of holding 
negotiations under threat of the Super 301 provision. In recent 
GATT talks, we reached an agreement on the need to hold 
multilateral negotiations. Moreover, a new trade body, the 
World Trade Organization [WTO] is to be created. It has been 
agreed that disputes should not be settled through bilateral 
talks but through multilateral talks, and that procedures for 
settling disputes should be taken more quickly and more fully 
than before. I deeply regret that, under such circumstances, 
the U.S. Government has announced it is to revive the Super 301 
provision which will enable it to take unilateral action in 
bilateral talks. I am not saying this because it happens to 
concern Japan. 
  [Takemura] I understand the foreign minister is in a 
difficult position. The government is inevitably urged to take 
a hard-line stance. 
  [Hata] Yes, yes. 
  [Takemura] Jutaro Komura, a Meiji era diplomat, was almost 
assassinated for signing the Portsmouth Treaty after the 1904 
Japan-Russia War. And, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka 
declared Japan was withdrawing from the League of Nations by 
saying: "Japan will leave. Sayonara, Sayonara." At the time, 
the Japanese people applauded loudly. 
  [Hata] That is right. The people applauded him. 
  [Takemura] If Mr. Matsuoka had been weak and yielded to the 
demands of other nations he would have been severely criticized 
on his return to Japan. With that in mind, I am concerned that 
Japanese politicians, including Mr. Hata, will think that 
hard-line remarks are smart and become increasingly aggressive 
in their comments. The other day, I told the story of how 
Carthage was destroyed by Rome. When Carthage's negotiators 
returned from the last negotiations in Rome, the people of 
Carthage blamed them for being weak and killed them. Then the 
people rose up and the ancient nation was destroyed. I hope 
this will not... 
  [Hata, interrupting] What Mr. Takemura said now is very 
important. The fact is, during talks between me and Mr. Kantor, 
he said: Mr. Hata, the United States has experienced many 
breakdowns in trade talks with European nations and Canada. He 
also said: Although it is regrettable, we may need a break in 
the trade talks for a while because we are having difficulties 
reaching agreement on even basic points. At that time, I told 
Mr. Kantor the stories you told now. And I told him that it was 
such bitter experiences in Japan that led to World War II in 
which Japan caused much trouble. I also told him: Bearing 
history in mind, I find it a shame that the trade talks, which 
have almost been concluded, are being broken off only because of 
an argument about the results. Mr. Kantor and I were discussing 
this until early in the morning of that day. After the talks 
ended then, I summoned representatives from each ministry and 
agency to tell them they should not be optimistic. I said: 
Despite the breakdown of the talks, the point at issue in the 
talks is that Japan has a $60 billion trade surplus with the 
United States, and it is natural that the United States is 
irritated by that. I added: In that sense, we should 
voluntarily tackle this issue immediately after we return to 
Japan. I later briefed a cabinet meeting. 
  [Takemura] In that case, it is very good that Mr. Toyoda -- 
Toyota Motor Corporation chief and due to become chairman of 
Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan] -- 
recently said that Toyota, Nissan Motor Co., and Mitsubishi 
Motors Corporation need to voluntarily cut exports. The 
government cannot say that, so Mr. Toyoda's announcement was 
very nice. It is also good that Mr. Toyoda is to become the 
next Keidanren chairman because, he is the chief of a leading 
automaker and will now become the most responsible person in the 
economic sector. 
  [Kuroiwa] I think the timing of this announcement was 
possibly a little too good. Voluntary actions by Toyota and IDO 
or Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. are all very well, but I suspect 
that, behind the scenes, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry or somebody else issued administrative instructions to 
them, and they arranged not to contradict each other. I can see 
such a conspiracy. 
  [Hata] This is not true. The maturing of relations between 
Japan and the United States has been mentioned, but Japanese 
economists and the general public are adopting a maturer 
outlook. They were not cowed by the threatened revival of the 
Super 301, but they also recognized that Japan's trade surplus 
is too big. One or two days after I returned to Japan from the 
United States, I met by chance the Keidanren leader at a hotel. 
He said: Mr. Hata, I think we have to voluntarily do what we 
must to deal with this issue. We clearly understand that. 
  [Kobayashi] Some people stress Japan must not make 
concessions to the United States. I think the worst aspect of 
bilateral negotiations is that it causes agitation in both 
countries. As Mr. Kantor has recently urged Japan to buy more 
Motorola phones, I personally feel that questionable ties among 
political, business, and bureaucratic circles are even stronger 
in the United States, but it is not an appropriate opportunity 
to raise the question. The United States will have off-year 
elections this fall, and preliminary election campaigns have 
already started in some states. In a way, the United States is 
overreacting to the trade issue as part of an election campaign. 
In such circumstances, the situation may become worse if Japan 
reacts emotionally to U.S. moves. So, I would like to ask Mr. 
Foreign Minister what we should do to settle the issue. On auto 
trade, for example, Japan's possible choices are to cut exports 
to narrow the export-import gap, or to further liberalize the 
Japanese market and so continue to sell Japanese cars without 
causing trade friction. Which do way would you take? 
  [Hata] Please let me say one thing about that. As Professor 
Kobayashi just noted, it seemed the negotiations were becoming a 
verbal war when I had talks with Mr. Kantor. Moreover, they are 
becoming media wars in the sense that the mass media of both 
countries stoking public frustrations on this issue through 
agitation. Since these are making the bilateral relations even 
worse, we must take corrective action somehow. As far as 
Japan's course of action is concerned, one of the rules of thumb 
is that the Japanese private sector should voluntarily settle 
its own problems -- auto and auto part imports, for example. In 
this field, it is important to seek balanced expansion of auto 
trade between Japan and the United States, rather than cutting 
exports from one side. Another point is, in such areas as 
government procurement and insurance, imports are disturbed by 
Japanese Government regulations. In these areas, the government 
must positively promote deregulation. 
  [Kuroiwa] To settle the economic framework talks, you have 
been saying that it may be possible for Japan to accept 
numerical targets related to such macroeconomic fields as gross 
national product [GNP], instead of those on individual sectors. 
Do you intend to formally propose this to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa? 
  [Hata] The numerical target issue has been the biggest point 
of conflict in the negotiations, and the United States said it 
would impose economic sanctions if the framework talks bore no 
fruit. But it is not what Mr. Kantor really wanted. Similarly, 
both sides did not want to worsen bilateral ties through the 
talks. In such a case, it is very important for Japan to 
positively improve the current situation. Also, Japan should 
expand its domestic market through promotion of a deregulation 
policy. When better foreign-made products become available at 
cheaper prices, it will enrich the livelihood of consumers. We 
must focus on that point, rather than unwillingly responding to 
foreign pressures. 
  [Kuroiwa] Now, we would like to question Mr. Hata as the 
leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Prime Minister 
Hosokawa said it was his decision not to reshuffle the cabinet, 
and not the result of pressure from somebody else. Obviously he 
could not do so. I think the issue clarified discord in the 
coalition government. Do you think the coalition parties can 
maintain their unity now? 
  [Hata] On the day the prime minister made that announcement, 
I said we should go back to the starting point when the 
coalition government was formed last August. I also said we 
should remind ourselves that the most important point is that we 
are the ones who have changed the political framework of the 
last 38 years. When I said this everybody looked relieved, and 
I felt we were ready to restart. Every coalition party chairman 
and secretary general was there. 
  [Matsuyama] Yet, when we recently had Komeito Secretary 
General Ichikawa as a guest, he accused Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura of behaving like a second prime minister. And Mr. 
Ozawa has been urging that Mr. Takemura be fired. It seemed to 
me their feelings against Mr. Takemura were at the heart of the 
problem. 
  [Takemura] In a recent television interview, Mr. Takemura 
said he was in a difficult position, saying there was nothing to 
be gained by discussing the matter yet again because it would 
only make things worse. In fact, however, it was an awkward 
question. One newspaper later carried a weird report that I was 
going to replace Mr. Takemura, but that is nonsense. My opinion 
is that the chief cabinet secretary should serve as the closest 
associate the prime minister and, as the spokesman, he or she 
should speak out on behalf of the prime minister. On the other 
hand, a party head should represent the views of his or her 
party. It is very difficult to reconcile the two conflicting 
positions. In this sense, I said it would be difficult for Mr. 
Takemura to fulfill his duties under the current circumstances. 
This has nothing to do with his personal capability. On those 
grounds, however, everyone concerned, including Mr. Takemura, 
agreed to let him restart. And he said he would pay more 
attention to the intentions of the prime minister. 
  [Matsuyama] Do you mean it is difficult for party heads 
to serve as chief cabinet secretary? 
  [Hata] Yes, it is difficult. But he acknowledged the 
difficulties, and all of us had discussed that. He is going to 
start again on those grounds. So, I think he is ready to 
fulfill the duties of chief cabinet secretary. 
  [Kuroiwa] Do you mean he feels sorry about his past 
behavior? 
  [Hata] It is not like that. When he was appointed as chief 
cabinet secretary, there was nobody else to fill the position. 
  [Matsuyama] It is said Mr. Ozawa went underground in protest 
against the prime minister's decision. Is he angry now? 
  [Hata] I do not think so. I talked with him on the phone 
yesterday. 
  [Matsuyama] Did you talk about the issue? 
  [Hata] No, we did not. Since we enacted political reform 
and the new election system, we talked about our future course 
of action. 
  [Kuroiwa] In connection with this, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
said the cabinet reshuffle is needed to organize the 
administration to grapple with economic reform. But he gave up 
the cabinet reshuffle. Then, what would happen to economic 
reform? 
  [Hata] It appears Mr. Hosokawa planned to provide a new 
cabinet lineup with more stress on economic reform. Yet, as 
seen in the government's deregulation efforts, economic reform 
has already started. Mr. Hosokawa actually wanted a new lineup, 
but I think the current cabinet is good enough. 
  [Kuroiwa] The current cabinet was designed as a political 
reform cabinet, and it has a minister in charge of political 
reform. So, we expected something new in the lineup for economic 
reform. 
  [Hata] Concerning political reform, we only revised the 
electoral and fiscal control systems for the lower house, we 
must work next on upper house reform. We should reorganize the 
political parties under the new political reform laws, and 
reform the entire Diet. So, political reform has not yet ended, 
we have just taken the first step. 
  [Kuroiwa] Yet, the next largest subject for Japan's politics 
is economic reform. So, I have a proposal. The cabinet 
reshuffle will take place sooner or later -- probably after the 
enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget in May or June. At that 
time, I think Mr. Ichiro Ozawa is supposed to play positive 
roles. As the Shinseito head, what is your opinion of using Mr. 
Ozawa in the cabinet? 
  [Hata] I have been telling him he should play positive 
roles. But there are some problems, too. Our party is organized 
with only 62 Diet members, but currently plays the leading role 
in the coalition government since we are the most experienced 
group in the coalition. Therefore, we are expected to locate 
capable people both in the party and the cabinet. The Shinseito 
is occupying five seats in the cabinet. Under such 
circumstances, I think it is impossible for both of us to be 
cabinet members. But, his participation in the cabinet may be 
possible when I return to the party when the occasion demands it. 
  [Matsuyama] Do you mean Mr. Ozawa may join the cabinet when 
the occasion demands it? 
  [Hata] I think that is possible. 
  [Kuroiwa] You mean either you or Mr. Ozawa should take 
charge of the party, don't you? 
  [Hata] Right. But, Mr. Ozawa always says he prefers party 
management. 
  [Kobayashi] In connection with the importance of the party, 
you have just mentioned a sensitive point. What did you mean by 
reorganization of parties under the political reform laws? 
Under the single-seat constituency system, it is impossible for 
the coalition parties to beat the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
if they deal separately with elections. Does reorganization of 
parties under the political reform laws mean formation of party 
mergers among the coalition parties? 
  [Hata] In a sense, political parties have been bodies for 
politicians. We are trying to create genuine mass parties for 
the people. This principle should be implemented even in local 
politics, and political parties must be organizations which 
accept ordinary citizens. Taking into account the next election 
and the future of Japanese politics, it is also important to 
think about the merger of such reformed parties. Both Ozawa and 
I believe a strong party is needed to cope with the LDP, or we 
would be smashed by them. If we allow the revival of the 
38-year ruling by the LDP again, genuine changes will never 
happen in Japan's politics. 
  [Takemura] The presence of the Japan New Party [JNP] is 
very weak because no bigshot is left in the party. Ruling 
parties should keep some prominent leaders in party 
organizations. 
  [Hata] I agree with you. The individual Diet members of the 
JNP are very capable people, but few of them have the experience 
to manage political affairs. I think this is big trouble for 
Mr. Hosokawa. 
  [Matsuyama] Our time is up now. This program is posing one 
question to all our guests. In your opinion, how great is the 
probability of another political party realignment within this 
year? 
  [Hata] I think the probability of that taking place is about 
60 percent, maybe a little higher. 
  [Kuroiwa] You have been nicknamed Mr. Political Reform. Now 
that the issue has been settled for the time being, could you 
tell me your new catch phrase? 
  [Hata] That would be to aim at genuine politics. Since we 
started working on political reform, we have been saying that 
another party realignment will certainly take place after the 
enactment of the political reform bills, or political circles 
would fail to catch up with the dynamism of politics. 
  [Matsuyama] What about your attitude toward being Mr. 
Hosokawa's successor? 
  [Hata, laughing] That is another story. 
  [Kuroiwa] I see. Thank you very much for joining us today. 
As the foreign minister, the deputy prime minister, and the 
party head, you gave us answers to various questions. Given the 
severe circumstances surrounding Japan, I think we have to try 
our best not to send our children to the battlefields. 
  [Hata, interrupting] Absolutely right. 
  [Kuroiwa] So, we must have an eye on developments in 
political circles. Thank you again.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata warned of stern countermeasures Sunday if North 
Korea refuses further nuclear inspections or tries to abuse its 
nuclear bargaining card. 
  He said he had heard of various ways that North Koreans in 
Japan were funneling cash into North Korea, but to forcibly cut 
off such channels could raise the issue of human rights 
violations and thus required prudent consideration, he said. 
  Hata described various suspicions regarding Pyongyang's 
nuclear program in an appearance on Fuji TV, including 
speculation that it is manufacturing weapons or has already done 
so and that it possesses the same type of atomic bomb that was 
dropped on Hiroshima by the United States. 
  Japan is ready to make its own assessment of North Korea's 
nuclear development based on inspections conducted by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and information 
obtained from the United States, South Korea and China, he said. 
  North Korea still has two facilities that haven't been 
inspected, the foreign minister reminded. Depending on its 
future attitude, U.N. sanctions could be imposed, he said. 
  On reports that money sent by Chochongnyon [General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan], an organization of 
ethnic North Koreans and sympathizers, is being poured into 
Pyongyang's nuclear program, Hata said he had heard figures 
ranging from tens of million Japanese yen to hundreds of million 
yen. 
  The money is reportedly carried personally by people 
returning to North Korea, aboard freight vessels or through Hong 
Kong and China, said Hata. 
  But such funds are being sent by those who were born in 
North 
Korea and think of it as their motherland, he pointed out. 
  Forcibly cutting off the flow, therefore, could raise the 
problem of human rights violations, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan will offer Cambodia 
some 9 billion yen in grant assistance for fiscal 1994, which 
begins April 1, government sources said Thursday [3 March]. The 
sources said the decision will be formally announced at a 
two-day international conference on Cambodia to be held in Tokyo 
from March 10. 
  Japan allocated 8.4 billion yen in grant assistance to 
Cambodia in the current fiscal year ending March 31. The fresh 
funds will go toward such projects as rehabilitation of 
Cambodia's national route 6, restoration of a power plant in 
Phnom Penh and improvement of water supply and drainage in the 
capital. 
  Tokyo has invited representatives of 31 countries, the 
European Union and 12 international organizations to attend the 
second meeting of the International Committee on Reconstruction 
of Cambodia. 
  Japan pledged in 1992 to provide between 150 and 200 million 
dollars to Cambodia over a three-year period covering fiscal 
1992 to 1994. Foreign Ministry officials said Japan has since 
disbursed around 190 million dollars, making it the largest 
donor nation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- The head of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] said Saturday [5 March] 
that the party will promote ties with liberal forces in the 
coalition government to prepare for the next general elections 
to be held under a new electoral system. 
  SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said that the party, the 
largest component in the coalition, will promote cooperation 
with the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Sakigake (Harbinger) 
and the Democratic Reform Party. 
  The Diet on Friday enacted amendments to a political reform 
package which calls for introducing a combination of single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation for elections for 
the House of Representatives, replacing the current multiseat 
districts. 
  Cooperation with the liberal forces is indispensable to 
realize a tie-up of ruling coalition parties to fight off the 
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party in the elections, 
Murayama said. 
  He made the remark at a meeting of secretaries general of 
the 
party's 47 prefectural chapters. 
  "Similarities are increasing among the SDP, the DSP, 
Sakigake 
and the Democratic Reform Party on things such as political 
method," Murayama said. 
  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a core party in the 
coalition, and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the third 
largest coalition bloc, have said the governing coalition 
parties must unite to create a two-party system, sustain a 
coalition government and prevent the LDP from regaining power. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, head of Japan New Party 
(JNP), is reportedly tilting heavily in favor of the 
Shinseito-Komeito line, diverging from his initial stance of 
pursuing a moderate multiparty system. 
  Murayama rejected the idea, saying that supporting the 
governing coalition does not mean the unification of the parties. 
  SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo also referred to the 
possibility of forming a new party by the liberal forces, saying 
the time may come for the SDPJ to be born as a new party. 
  The ruling coalition is made up of the SDPJ, Shinseito, 
Komeito, the JNP, the DSP, Sakigake, the United Social 
Democratic Party and the Democratic Reform Party, a 
parliamentary group in the House of Councillors. 
  In a related development, Shinseito representative Kozo 
Watanabe said in a speech in Utsunomiya that the ruling 
coalition will strengthen its unity by the time of the upper 
house election next year. 
  "It is natural for us to consolidate cooperation among 
ruling 
parties in order to win in the House of Councillors election 
next year," he said. 
  Watanabe's remark indirectly criticized a call by Akira 
Yamagishi, head of the Japan Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), 
for formation of a united front by socialist and liberal forces 
by election time. 
  Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive in charge of election 
affairs, told reporters the election will serve as a test for 
cooperation among ruling parties in the lower house election, 
which will follow the upper house polls. 
  He hinted that the topic of a cabinet shake-up may resurface 
after the passage in May of the fiscal 1994 budget.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) President Yohei Kono urged Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Monday to hand over power, saying the 
seven-month-old coalition government has completed its mission. 
  Kono, speaking at the start of a three-day interpellation 
session at the Diet, said the Hosokawa Cabinet has piled up 
policy errors. 
  The leader of the main opposition party criticized Hosokawa 
for carrying over compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget to this 
year, revoking a "national welfare tax" plan, failing to reach 
agreement in trade framework talks with the United States and 
giving up a cabinet reshaping plan. 
  "The Hosokawa Cabinet has now finished its mission," he 
said. 
  Kono accused Hosokawa of failing to maintain a consistent 
basic political stance following changes in the balance of power 
in the seven-party coalition. 
  Kono said the Japanese people are concerned that the 
country's future may go in an unfavorable direction under 
threats from a behind-the-scenes strongman. He did not identify 
the man but was apparently alluding to chief coalition 
strategist Ichiro Ozawa. 
  The breakdown in the February summit between Hosokawa and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton led to the reinstatement of the 
"Super 301" trade provision that gives the U.S. Government broad 
powers to impose sanctions, he said. 
  Representatives of political parties are scheduled to speak 
Monday through Wednesday in response to Friday's policy speeches 
by Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers. 
  Komeito's Nobuaki Futami and the LDP's Koji Kakizawa will 
speak after Kono at Monday's plenary session of the House of 
Representatives.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on 
Friday [4 March] made into law political reform package 
amendments which feature changes in the House of 
Representatives' election system and revised regulations on 
corporate donations to political fund-raising organizations. 
The upper house approved the amendments following passage by 
the lower house Tuesday. 
  Under the amendments, 300 seats will be allocated for 
single-seat constituencies and 200 by proportional 
representation based on the popular vote in 11 electoral units. 
Currently, 511 lower house members are elected from multiseat 
constituencies. 
  The complete reform package will be enforced after enactment 
of another law identifying the locations of the 300 single-seat 
constituencies. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura has said the 
coalition government wants to submit a bill on the 
constituencies' locations to the current Diet session ending 
June 29. But the presentation may be delayed to autumn if 
legislators insist their opinions be reflected on the locations. 
  The original government-sponsored package called for 274 
single-seat districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional 
representation on a nationwide basis. The original package 
banned corporate donations to politicians and their fund-raising 
organizations, but the revised bills will allow firms to donate 
up to 500,000 yen per year during the next five years as a 
temporary provision. 
  The original package was passed on January 29 at an 
extraordinary Diet session shortly after Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and opposition Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei 
Kono agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement would be 
discussed during the current ordinary session.

  [Text] Miyazaki, March 6 KYODO -- A former Fair Trade 
Commission (FTC) inspector intends to file a lawsuit Monday [7 
March] against Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for allegedly 
violating the Constitution through a compromise over political 
reform bills in January. 
  The former FTC official, Taro Kayashima, 68, will file the 
suit at the Miyazaki district court against Hosokawa, opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono and speaker 
of the House of Representatives Takako Doi. 
  Kayashima is seeking a total of 3 million yen from the three 
and the government as compensation for the damage which he said 
was inflicted by the compromise via a backdoor deal. 
  The government-proposed political reform bills were 
initially 
rejected in the House of Councillors and the likelihood of 
enactment became slim because of disagreement over compromise 
between representatives of the two Diet chambers. 
  Doi, however, proposed her own conciliatory plan to Hosokawa 
and Kono, and the two men took advantage of the proposal as a 
chance to reach an accord in a backroom meeting. 
  Kayashima claims the actions taken by Doi, Hosokawa and Kono 
violated the Constitution. 
  The plaintiff alleges that Hosokawa, as leader of the 
government, intervened in deliberations in the conference 
committee of both houses. 
  Hosokawa allegedly violated separation of the 
administrative, 
legislature and judicial branches of the government, thus 
damaging trust in parliamentary democracy, Kayashima said. 
  In addition, Kayashima claims infringement on his liberty to 
support a political party because the political reform bills 
guarantee designated parties to receive public financial 
assistance paid through taxes. 
  The upper house on Friday made into law political reform 
package amendments which feature changes in the lower house's 
election system and revised regulations on corporate donations 
to political fund-raising organizations.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Tax revision bills must pass 
the Diet by the end of March for the government to implement 
income tax cuts planned for this summer, Vice Finance Minister 
Jiro Saito said Monday [7 March]. 
  "I request (the passage) by the end of March," Saito told a 
regular press conference. 
  He was referring to reports of a possible delay in tax cuts 
because Diet deliberations may be tied up by the opposition 
parties led by the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Under the tax scheme, the government plans to give half of 
the scheduled cut in national income tax in the pay packets 
containing the annual summer bonuses, and the other half with 
the year-end tax adjustment. 
  Saito said that implementation of the tax cuts should be 
done 
as early as possible to help the economy recover. 
  Concerning the continued rise in long-term interest rates, 
Saito repeated that he would watch "for a little while" to judge 
the trend and its economic impact, stressing "overall levels are 
still low." 
  He also indicated his intention to watch the trend in 
Japan's 
current account surplus. 
  "We can't judge only on single month...And the downward 
trend 
in volume remained intact," he said, referring to the 
politically sensitive surplus for January that showed signs of 
resuming an upward trend. 
  The January surplus posted a rise from a year earlier for 
the 
second straight month, advancing 30.9 percent in dollar terms. 
The yen-denominated figure increased 16.8 percent to mark the 
first rise in six months.

<F P=106> [Fiscal policy speech by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to </F>
the 129th ordinary Diet session -- live] 
  [Excerpts] The Japanese economy is constantly in a severe 
phase due to cyclical factors and the bursting of the bubble 
economy. However, Japan is being asked to construct a 
prosperous and vigorous economic society toward the 21st century 
to deal with the aging society. It is also being asked to play 
a suitable role in the international community. The government 
has to overcome the current economic difficulties as early as 
possible. At the same time, through the reform and opening of 
the economic society, it needs to construct a vigorous and open 
economic society in which the people can prosper, as well as to 
contribute to the international community for the sake of stable 
growth of the world economy. 
  [Passage omitted on explanation of current domestic and 
foreign economic situation] While carefully watching the 
current domestic and foreign economic situations and seeking the 
direction Japan should take toward the 21st century, the 
government intends to make an all-out effort to tackle the 
following tasks. 
  The first task is to implement measures for economic 
recovery. As I said earlier, the Japanese economy is faced with 
continuous stagnation in such fields as consumer spending and 
capital investment. Nevertheless, public investments and 
housing construction have been pushing up the economy, and 
inventory adjustment and capital stock adjustment have 
progressed. Also, the consumption of durable goods is expected 
to increase. Signs of recovery like this are steadily emerging. 
To strongly reinforce such signs of the beginning of an 
economic recovery to move our economy onto the track of a 
full-fledged recovery as early as possible in fiscal 1994, and 
to secure stable growth from fiscal 1995, we recently formulated 
an unprecedented comprehensive economic package exceeding 15 
trillion yen. The package includes plans to increase domestic 
demand, such as income tax cuts worth Y5.85 [yen] trillion and 
increased public investments, as well as measures to tackle 
pressing economic problems. The package is rich in both quality 
and quantity, thus literally a comprehensive pump- priming 
program. The government intends to implement these 
comprehensive stimulus measures as one package, and to stimulate 
the economy as soon as it possibly can with the third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget. 
I am confident that these measures will eliminate the 
pessimistic outlook and lead to an increase in domestic demand 
and consumer spending, thus contributing greatly to efforts to 
achieve a full-fledged economic recovery. [passage omitted on 
effects of lowered official discount rate on the economy and on 
need to stabilize foreign exchange rates] 
  The second task is to actively promote financial reform. The 
government has formulated several economic stimulus packages to 
shore up the faltering economy, and has reluctantly decided to 
issue more construction bonds to make up for an increase in 
expenditures for public works projects included in the packages. 
[Passage omitted on the financial structure's dependence on 
government bonds] 
  The third task is to realize tax reform before the end of 
the 
year. To make the aging society a vigorous and prosperous one, 
it is very important to establish a taxation system in which 
income, consumption, and assets taxes are well balanced, as well 
as to realize tax reform with public consent. Based on this 
view, the Tax Commission energetically discussed tax reform and 
compiled a report last November in which it showed the basic 
idea of realizing a fair and vigorous aging society. After 
receiving the report, the government and the ruling parties 
began discussions and agreed to enact legislation for tax reform 
before the end of the year. In line with this agreement, the 
government will continue to study tax reform while hearing 
opinions of people from various circles to realize tax reform 
before the end of the year. 
  The fourth task is to establish harmonious economic 
relations 
with foreign countries and contribute to the growth of the world 
economy. As world trade and direct foreign investment are 
expanding, the world economy more and more requires the system 
of mutual dependence. I believe that in such a situation, Japan 
needs to make efforts to establish harmonious economic relations 
with other countries, and to actively contribute to the growth 
of the world economy. To realize steady growth of the world 
economy with no inflation, Japan will cooperate with other 
countries in the process of formulating economic policy 
coordination at G-7 meetings of finance ministers and central 
bankers. At the same time, it will exchange views with other 
countries at the APEC meetings of finance ministers. The 
Uruguay Round trade negotiations, which lasted for almost seven 
years, were successfully concluded on 15 October, 1993. The 
success of the talks have placed confidence in the international 
economic order. Based on the results of the Uruguay Round 
talks, Japan will make efforts to maintain and strengthen the 
multilateral trade system to contribute to the growth of both 
the domestic and world economies. Concerning tariffs, in view 
of the need to open Japanese markets wider to foreign 
competition, the government plans to lower tariffs on raw sugar 
and abolish tariffs on auto parts. [Passage omitted on Japan's 
economic assistance to developing countries and former 
planned-economy nations] 
  The fifth task is to put life into the financial and 
securities markets. In order for the nation's economy to 
continue to grow, it is essential that the smooth supply of 
funds necessary for economic activities is assured. The 
recently announced overall economic stimulus package is aimed at 
enabling implementation of measures on the financial and 
securities markets along with other measures. It presents 
policies on the financial market that should make possible the 
smooth supply of funds, facilitate disposal of bad assets, 
reduce interest, and improve liquidity of credits. It also 
presents the government's basic thinking on ways of dealing with 
the bad assets of banking institutions. This thinking will 
remain the administrative guideline relating to solving the 
problems of banking institutions' bad assets. 
  With regard to the measures for invigorating the securities 
market, the government is getting ready to present to the 
current session of the Diet a bill aimed at introducing a system 
on securities transactions which will ease controls on companies 
acquiring their own companies' stocks. The government will 
continue to push for actions to simplify procedures and ease 
controls on securities market transactions, for instance by 
enabling corporations to raise capital by issuing corporate 
bonds at market prices. 
  Watching the conditions of the stock market henceforth, the 
government will also study ways of facilitating corporations' 
going public. 
  By implementing all these measures in a package, the 
government intends to secure an environment which will enable 
the monetary and securities markets to perform their expected 
functions well. 
  Now I will explain the key points of the 1994 budget to you. 
  In view of the existing very serious financial situation of 
the government and difficult economic conditions of the country, 
the 1994 budget together with the 1993 supplementary budget is 
meant to give great consideration to its role of stimulating the 
economy. On the other hand, in order to contain the issuing of 
deficit-covering bonds [tokurei kosai] which can only prompt 
worsening of the financial structure, the government has 
thoroughly reviewed the situation in order to trim down its 
expenditures. The government has also done its best to allocate 
funds to projects in priority areas, and to place emphasis on 
qualitative results in formulating this budget. 
  In the area of expenditures, the government has tried to 
economize and rationalize expenses by, for example, careful 
reviewing existing systems and policies. The government has 
thus contained the scale of the general expenditures to 
Y40,854.8 billion which is only 2.3 percent higher that the 
amount for the initial 1993 budget. [passage on containing 
employment of public officials, details on government bond 
servicing, grants to local government omitted] As a result, the 
scale of total expenditures has come to be Y73,081.7 billion, 
which is an increase of 1.0 percent over the intial budget of 
1993. 
  Now I will explain the revenues to you. In the area of 
taxation, in order to meet the given needs from economic, social 
and administrative policies, the government will implement 
reduction of income taxes and the inheritance tax, and take 
equally appropriate actions on land taxes. The government also 
intends to review and adjust -- to a more appropriate level -- 
the taxes on nonprofit foundations, review and improve existing 
special exception measures related to all taxes, and take other 
various necessary measures. As regards the overall tax 
administration, the government will continue to make efforts to 
ensure appropriateness and fairness, with the trust and 
cooperation of the public. 
  In the area of nontax revenues, the government -- in view of 
the very serious financial conditions -- is now making all-out 
efforts to increase revenues, for instance by taking the action 
of converting the special account on automobile liability policy 
into the general account. 
  With regard to government bonds, the government intends to 
issue construction bonds worth Y10,509.2 billion to secure 
financial resources to support the so-called NTT [Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Company] project reimbursement expenses. 
In addition, the government will issue deficit-covering bonds 
worth Y3,133.8 billion exclusively to meet the tax revenue 
shortfalls that will arise from the reduction of income taxes. 
[passage about deficit- covering bonds, financial investment 
plans, other details in the revenue budget omitted] 
  As far as defense expenditures are concerned, in view of the 
very tight finances, we are holding down defense spending as 
much as possible under the revised Mid-Term Defense Buildup 
Plan, while maintaining and improving the balance in overall 
defense capability. The government is doing all it can to 
maintain and improve defense capabilities, while keeping the 
overall structure of defense in balance. [passage on grants to 
local governments omitted]

<F P=106> [Economic policy speech by Manae Kubota, director general of </F>
the Economic Planning Agency, to the 129th ordinary Diet session 
-- live] 
  [Excerpts] I would like to deliver a speech on urgent 
tasks facing Japan's economy and basic views of economic 
management. Amid the unprecedented, prolonged economic slump 
caused by the bubble economy, Japan is being required to review 
the consumer-oriented economic and social structures which have 
so far supported our country. This means switching the basic 
idea of our economic society. Japan is being urged to change 
the current economic society into one which attaches importance 
to people and consumers. We have to accelerate significantly our 
efforts to reform the structure of our economic society in line 
with the trend of this new era. 
  On the international front, Japan, which is responsible for 
16 percent of the world's GNP, is required to fulfill an active 
role commensurate to its economic power. In other words, Japan 
needs to make positive efforts to voluntarily tackle the task of 
building a new world economic order. On the domestic front, 
Japan needs to promote transparency of its economic society and 
try to build a society in harmony with the international 
community. [passage omitted on a people-oriented economic 
society] 
  Moreover, such an economic society will be realized through 
changing our society. The path for realizing a people-oriented 
society may be not easy. [passage omitted on need for the 
government to tackle this issue] 
  This year we must ensure a smooth and full-fledged recovery 
of the economy, and mark the first year of successfully changing 
the economic society. [passage omitted on the world economic 
situation] 
  Meanwhile, the success of GATT's Uruguay Round talks brings 
a 
bright prospect for the future of the world economy. Generally, 
Japan's economy is in a slump, marked by a continuing slump in 
personal consumption and a decrease in the private sector's 
plant and equipment investment. The severity of employment 
conditions is noted especially in the manufacturing industry. 
[passage omitted on review of the series of economic 
pump-priming measures the government introduced in September 
last year and February this year] 
  Thanks to the effects of the economic measures, the 
foundation for economic recovery is now being created. However, 
the real growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 
1993 is expected to be about 0.2 percent, without a full-fledged 
recovery in private demand. 
  While keeping those conditions in mind, we would like to 
adopt the following basic points to tackle economic management 
for fiscal 1994. The first point is to put Japan's economy 
on-track for a full-fledged recovery as soon as possible so that 
sustainable growth in the years following fiscal 1994 will be 
ensured. To this end, we will implement maximum policies by the 
end of fiscal 1994. To continuously stimulate the economy this 
spring, which starts the new fiscal year, we soon plan to 
implement the economic pump-priming package. For example, we 
will make efforts for the smooth implementation of public works 
projects which were added in the third supplementary budget for 
fiscal 1993. [passage omitted reviewing the draft budget for 
fiscal 1994 and tax cuts] On monetary policy, I think 
appropriate and flexible management is necessary in the future 
while closely watching domestic and international economic 
movements and international currency conditions. [passage 
omitted on efforts to improve employment conditions and the need 
for stability of prices] With economic management by the 
government and positive efforts by the private sector in support 
of economic activities for voluntary recovery, Japan's economy 
is expected to be on-track for a full-fledged economic recovery 
during fiscal 1994. The GDP's real growth rate is expected to 
reach about 2.4 percent in the fiscal year. 
  The second point is that to bring about a creative and 
energetic economic society, conditions for future economic 
development should be created through such measures as steady 
implementation of structural reform. [passage omitted on need 
for efforts to create such conditions] Moreover, we plan to 
help companies in restructuring their business by promoting 
creative research programs and improving conditions to prepare 
for a highly developed information-oriented society. We would 
like to promote development of new business and creative 
business activities. [passage omitted on efforts to improve 
working conditions] 
  In connection with the tax system reform, we are expected 
to create a fair and vital society taking into account the rapid 
increase of the aged population. We intend to continue our 
study to create a tax system which gives adequate consideration 
for the balance among the people's income, consumption, and 
assets in line with the advisory report of the Tax System 
Council. In that area, we will try our best to carry out tax 
system reform within this year. [passage omitted on 
environment-friendly economy] 
  Third, we intend to shift the focus of economic policies 
onto 
consumers. This is to enrich individuals' lifestyle by setting 
the goal of the Japanese economy in fields directly related to 
qualitative improvement of the public livelihood. In connection 
with this the fiscal 1994 budget plan lays emphasis on public 
work projects for housing, sewerage, and garbage disposal 
facilities. The government intends to maintain the preferential 
budget allotment in fields related to the public livelihood. 
[passage omitted on details of above-mentioned construction, 
housing programs] 
  The disparity of commodity prices between the Japanese and 
international markets is one of the major reasons the public 
cannot actually feel their economic achievements. To ease the 
problem, we will correct and cut such causes as government 
regulations and exclusionary business practices. [passage 
omitted on women's social positions] 
  Regarding the product liability system and other measures 
for 
preventing and redressing economic damage to consumers, we would 
like to enact necessary legislation as soon as possible. In 
accord with advisory reports of the Social Policy Council, some 
bills may be submitted to the current Diet session. 
  Fourth, we would like to positively create harmonic foreign 
economic relations, contribute to revitalization of the world 
economy, and take the initiative in maintaining and reinforcing 
the free trade system. To achieve this objective, we should 
positively promote structural reform of the economy through 
deregulation so that both Japanese and foreign-national 
companies and individuals can participate in business activities 
under visible rules. Functions of the OTO [Office of Trade and 
Investment Ombudsman] have been recently strengthened. OTO 
activities and review of government procurement procedures will 
further improve the accessibility of foreign companies to the 
Japanese market. Also, we will promote imports and direct 
investments from foreign companies. With Japan's market opening 
efforts and economic recovery, its trade surplus in fiscal 1994 
is expected to become lower than the previous year. 
  The virtual conclusion of the Uruguay Round indicates the 
strong resolve of GATT member nations to maintain and strengthen 
the multilateral free trade system. Japan will steadily 
implement achievements in the GATT negotiations. 
  To ensure stability and steady growth of developing nations, 
we would like to enrich our economic assistance programs in line 
with the Official Development Assistance [ODA] guidelines and 
the fifth ODA mid-term plan. Also, we will offer appropriate 
intellectual assistance, such as technological assistance to 
smoothly implement the economic reform efforts of former 
planned-economy nations. 
  The above is my view of Japan's major economic issues and 
the 
favorable direction of economic policies. In the last seven 
years of the 20th Century, the international economy is expected 
to grow beyond current boundaries. The world economy is 
probably heading for a new order of the market economy system 
through such new trends as the rise of bloc economies and 
economic reform of former planned- economy nations. In the 
process, the Asian economy is expected to grow bigger, and Japan 
will not be able to remain unaffected by the drastic changes in 
the structure of the world economy. I believe our duty is to 
overcome such changes appropriately, and realize the bright 
future of the Japanese economy in the 21st Century. We do have 
accumulated economic power, highly-educated personnel resources, 
and a high level of technological and cultural foundations. We 
are now expected to demonstrate our creativity and ability to 
make the most of our resources in the new era. Change is a way 
to utilize the people's efforts for the future. I would like to 
try to achieve the best based on the people's choice and action. 
I sincerely hope for their support and cooperation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The cabinet of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa formally endorsed on Friday an 
inflation-adjusted economic growth target of 2.4 percent for 
fiscal 1994. The targeted growth rate, first set forth at a 
special cabinet meeting on February 10, is a rebound from the 
sluggish 0.2 percent growth envisaged for fiscal 1993 that ends 
March 31. 
  The projection is based on gross domestic product (GDP), the 
total value of goods and services produced in a country. 
  The cabinet also approved projections for key economic 
items, 
including for government spending and national income. 
Government spending is projected to rise 7.8 percent in nominal 
terms and 7.5 percent in real terms to 92.7 trillion yen for the 
coming fiscal year. 
  National income is forecast to increase 3.5 percent to 372.8 
trillion yen. Corporate earnings are projected to rise 5.4 
percent to 60.2 trillion yen, the first increase in six years.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa vowed Monday [7 March] that he will continue to lead 
efforts to make the Japanese economy more open to the rest of 
the world. 
  "Economic and administrative reforms now under way are 
indispensable in establishing an economic society open to the 
world. For that purpose, I and the cabinet as a whole will 
continue to make efforts to solve Japan-U.S trade friction, 
promote economic deregulation, and slash the trade surplus," 
Hosokawa said at a plenary session of the House of 
Representatives. 
  "Japan has been asked to play a more positive role as the 
Uruguay Round of trade talks has concluded and the world is 
shifting to new trade rules," he said at the start of a 
three-day question-and- answer session at the Diet. 
  Hosokawa was responding to Yohei Kono, president of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who said that 
Hosokawa's seven-month-old coalition government has completed 
its mission. 
  Kono criticized Hosokawa for delaying compilation of the 
fiscal 1994 budget to this year, scuttling a "national welfare 
tax" scheme, failing to reach an accord in framework trade talks 
with the United States and giving up a recent plan to reshape 
the cabinet. 
  "As a reason for reshuffling the cabinet, you said you'll 
establish an economic reform cabinet as political reform is 
nearly complete...(but) the failure of the cabinet shake-up 
means discarding the bid to promote economic reform," Kono said. 
  "Japanese society and the Japanese economy are facing 
historical turning points in every respect...The Hosokawa 
cabinet has finished its mission," Kono said. 
  Hosokawa rebutted Kono's remark, saying "the historical 
change of society and the economy need a new political power and 
the reason for the birth of the coalition government lies there. 
The Japanese people expect the coalition government to carry 
out its mission to implement a comprehensive economic reform." 
  Hosokawa launched the seven-party coalition government last 
August after dislodging the LDP from a 38-year-long grip on 
power. 
  Asked how to improve strained economic relations with the 
U.S., Hosokawa reaffirmed Japan's commitment to further opening 
its markets to U.S. firms even though the summit talks with 
President Bill Clinton early last month failed and led to the 
reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade provision that gives the 
U.S. Government broad powers to impose sanctions. 
  The government "is doing its utmost to draw up voluntary 
measures within March to further open the country's markets," 
Hosokawa said. 
  He also reiterated Japan's opposition to setting numerical 
targets to measure the penetration of imports into the Japanese 
market, saying "it will be against deregulation to force firms 
to set numerical targets." 
  The premier also said the sagging economy will be back on 
recovery during fiscal 1994. 
  On the North Korean nuclear issue, Hosokawa echoed Kono, who 
said Japan should deal with the matter in cooperation with the 
U.S. while taking into account the views of South Korea and 
China. 
  Hosokawa also expressed his intention to continue efforts to 
resume the stalled negotiations with Pyongyang aimed at 
establishing diplomatic ties. The negotiations hit deadlock in 
November 1992, when North Korea walked out over a dispute on the 
alleged abduction of a Japanese woman by Pyongyang. 
  On political realignment, Hosokawa reiterated his initial 
stand that political parties would be absorbed into a moderate 
multiparty system after several elections, thus denying recent 
speculation that he is tilting heavily in favor of a two-party 
system advocated by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and Komeito.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Confidence in the economy 
among Japan's small and medium-sized businesses slumped in 
February for the 40th straight month, Shoko Chukin Bank said 
Thursday [3 March]. The bank's survey of 800 companies produced 
an index reading of 43.9, up a tiny 0.4 point from January but 
staying below 50, the dividing line between an improvement or a 
decline in confidence. 
  Although it was the second month of modest improvement in 
still-depressed sentiment, the survey shows that the pace toward 
recovery continues to drag, said the bank, a quasigovernmental 
institution geared toward smaller firms. 
  Sales fell 4.3 percent last month from a year earlier, 
widening from the previous February's 2.5 percent year-on-year 
sales slump, according to the survey, taken in mid-February. 
  More companies continued to say sales prices were falling 
and 
to predict another fall in March. As a result, companies 
reporting worsening profitability and financing continued to 
predominate. 
  The survey's profitability index, measuring the percentage 
citing improvement minus that saying things are worsening, was a 
minus 12.1, slightly better than the minus 12.5 percent of 
January, with a minus 9.3 forecast for March. 
  The financing index was minus 5.9, slipping from January's 
minus 5.8, with a March forecast of minus 5.0. 
  Companies continued to report stock and employment excesses. 
The product inventory index, in which a minus reading indicates 
a surplus, worsened to minus 13.6 from minus 12.2, with a March 
forecast of minus 10.0. The employment index improved to minus 
4.0 from minus 5.9, with a March forecast of minus 3.9.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
said Wednesday [2 March] it will revise its long-term domestic 
energy demand-supply outlook because the nation's energy 
consumption is growing at a faster pace than the panel 
previously projected. The advisory committee for energy, a 
panel of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said 
the existing projection, worked out in June 1990, will be 
replaced in May by new forecasts for 2000 and 2010. 
  The group said energy consumption has been expanding at a 
faster pace than it projected while supply growth is expected to 
remain slow. The panel said the prospect for energy supply is 
dim because the development of alternate energy sources has 
become stagnant and the construction of new nuclear power plants 
has been hampered due to difficulty in finding construction 
sites. 
  The current outlook puts an annual average increase of 
Japan's energy consumption at 1.6 percent toward the year 2000. 
The panel said domestic consumption, which bloated during the 
"bubble economy," continued to rise at an average rate of over 3 
percent despite the recession. 
  It also noted that Japan's dependence on crude oil has not 
declined as expected because of low oil prices. 
  The committee said the new outlook will incorporate a plan 
to 
promote the use of alternate energy sources which discharge 
lower levels of carbon dioxide than fossil fuels to meet the 
government-set goal for per-capita CO2 emissions.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan's steel exports in 
January rose 20.6 percent from a year earlier to 1,495,000 tons, 
an industry association reported Thursday [3 March]. The 
exports, however, fell 33.1 percent from the previous month, the 
Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. 
  January exports were valued at 961.66 million dollars, up 
7.1 
percent from a year earlier, or 107.6 billion yen, down 4.0 
percent. The yen value posted the sixth consecutive year-on-year 
fall. 
  Exports to South Korea surged 186.8 percent to 258,000 tons, 
due to increased pig iron exports, surpassing those to China. 
  Exports to China totaled 232,000 tons, up 4.2 percent, 
Taiwan 
192,000 tons, up 17.2 percent, and the United States 164,000 
tons, up 43.9 percent. 
  The federation said imports of ordinary steel in January 
fell 
5.1 percent from a year earlier to 470,000 tons for the fifth 
consecutive year-on-year decline.

Friday [4 March] to designate the lead and zinc mining and 
smelting industry as a recession-hit industry eligible for 
government subsidies from March 9, 1994 until June 30, 1995. 
  The industry is now in serious recession as a result of 
reduced demand from the automobile and steel industries and the 
yen's appreciation. 
  When a certain industry is designated as a specific 
slump-hit 
enterprise, businesses in the industry will be given subsidies, 
to help them take steps to prevent unemployment and help workers 
laid off find new employment.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan's electronics 
industry leader said Thursday [3 March] it will continue using 
the muse system for its high-definition television (HDTV) system 
for the 21st century. 
  Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the Electronic Industries 
Association of Japan, said, "Japan's muse system has been 
completed and we have no idea of giving up the HDTV system." 
  Sekimoto's comment was in response to the recent widespread 
misunderstanding that the muse system may be replaced by the 
"MPEG" system of the United States. The view was triggered by a 
posts ministry official's remark in February discussing the 
digital and analog formats for the future HDTV system in Japan. 
  "Analog-or-digital discussion is nonsense. That is based on 
lack of technological knowledge. In the core part of the muse, 
signals are digitally processed and the data can be output 
digitally," Sekimoto said. 
  Sekimoto, also president of NEC Corp., made the remarks at a 
press conference. 
  Even in an era of multimedia, which need to digitally 
operate 
data via optical networks, the muse system will be fully 
applicable to the next generation high-tech world, Sekimoto said. 
  For instance, Japanese manufacturers have already developed 
a 
digital videocassette tape recorder for the muse-HDTV set, 
Sekimoto said.

  [Text] Hanoi, March 2 (AFP) -- The first round of 
discussions between Vietnam and the United States on recovering 
seized property at the end of the Vietnam War ended here "with 
positive results," the foreign ministry said Wednesday. 
  "There are still some concrete problems that will be 
discussed at the next meeting at the working level," a foreign 
ministry spokesman told AFP without specifying when or where the 
next round of discussions would take place. 
  U.S. State Department officials refused to comment on the 
talks. 
  The bilateral meeting, the first since Washington lifted an 
economic embargo on Vietnam on February 4, lasted two days and 
brought together State Department, Treasury and Justice 
Department officials with their Vietnamese counterparts. 
  Claims by the two sides are estimated to total more than 500 
million dollars in assets seized or frozen following the fall of 
Saigon in 1975. 
  The opening of reciprocal representative offices in Hanoi 
and 
Washington, proposed by US President Bill Clinton, has already 
been accepted in principle by Vietnam. 
  U.S. delegation leader, James Hall, at his own request 
visited sites of searches for American servicemen missing in 
action, said the Vietnamese spokesman.

  [Text] Dear friends; in the Today Issues feature today, I 
would like to discuss the issue of boat people, a concern to 
many people. 
  As announced before, on 14 February a conference of 
high-ranking government representatives from various Southeast 
Asian countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, 
Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, Vietnam, and other 
countries, was held in Geneva to discuss the issues relating to 
boat people, mainly Vietnamese. 
  The conference attendants reported that there are presently 
some 60,000 Vietnamese boat people currently living in various 
refugee camps in Hong Kong and some Southeast Asian countries. 
Most of these people are not considered genuine refugees and 
will have no choice other than returning to Vietnam. The 
conference attendants declared that they will not and are not be 
able to contribute finance to support and provide free health 
services to these people indefinitely. All refugee camps are 
planning to close as early as possible before the deadline of 
late 1995. 
  Regarding repatriation allowance, a boat person returning to 
Vietnam used to be eligible for a $360 allowance, which has 
recently been reduced to $240 and will be further reduced. 
Apart from the allowance reduction, there are two other 
concrete provisions worth noting. First, the boat people 
arriving in Hong Kong, Japan, and Southeast Asia after 27 
September 1991 will not be eligible for the allowance nor the 
European Community [EC] program, an assistance program that 
funds projects of settlement and employment for repatriates. 
Second, the credit, occupational training, and financial 
allowance programs of the EC will be terminated in November 1994. 
  The Vietnamese boat people living outside of Vietnam, 
therefore, should return voluntarily and soon to Vietnam while 
they are still eligible for assistance from these financial 
support programs. 
  Dear friends, 60,000 Vietnamese living in overseas refugee 
camps are related to tens of thousands of families or millions 
of people all around the country. Therefore, I think that the 
information released here is important to many people. It is 
even more important to those who, for some reason, still have 
the intention to flee illegally from their motherland. 
  In implementing the renovation policy initiated and led by 
the Communist Party of Vietnam, our people have achieved 
important progress in the last three years. Many economic goals 
previously planned to be achieved by the end of 1995 had already 
been fulfilled at the end of 1993. We have progressed from the 
stage where many people did not have enough to eat, to being 
able to resolve the food shortage problem and exporting some 1.4 
million tonnes of rice every year. The inflation rate decreased 
from a three-digit to a two-digit number and came down to 4.4 
percent in 1993. More than 700 projects, large and small, of 
foreign investment with a total capital of over $7 billion are 
being developed in various socioeconomic sectors all over the 
country. The living standards of our people, though still not 
quite satisfactory, have been improved significantly. The 
social and political stability are well safeguarded. 
  Our developing economy, our stabilized society, and the 
assistance from the world community, are the key factors to help 
nearly 20,000 people from various refugee camps return in the 
last three years, quickly reintegrate into the community, and 
resettle fairly well. Many of them have become rich. 
  Inherited from our thousand-year-old generous tradition, the 
merciful Vietnam motherland, the people, and the authorities at 
all levels always open arms widely for the children, the 
siblings, and the friends coming back from the wrong. New 
opportunities and challenges are awaiting each and every citizen 
of Vietnam. Out of your home, out of work. [sentence as heard] 
There is no place like your own people's community and your own 
motherland, would you agree with me? If you are of the same 
opinion, every one of us, in our own circumstances, should do 
something to prove our people's love to each other and advance 
together toward the goals of a prosperous people and a strong 
country.

  [Text] The paper of Cong Giao Va Dan Toc [Catholicism and 
People] issue No. 947 carried an interview with Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet on a number of issues related to Catholicism in 
Vietnam. 
  On the role of Catholics in Ho Chi Minh City, the prime 
minister highly valued their patriotic spirit and dynamic 
participation in the city's social programs. He stressed that 
participation in activities that help construct the fatherland 
is the responsibility and right of the Catholic people. 
  There are presently a number of issues remaining to be 
settled between the Vietnamese Government and the Catholic 
Church, such as the Vatican's appointment of the supervisor for 
the Ho Chi Minh City diocese without any consultation with the 
Vietnamese Government, and the Vatican's prohibition on priests 
joining people-nominated agencies and the Solidarity Committee 
of Vietnamese Catholics. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held that more effort was still 
needed to settle issues caused by each side's lack of proper 
understanding of the other. People in Ho Chi Minh City have 
made considerable progress thanks to the implementation of a 
freedom of religion policy and of the principle of harmonious 
development between religious and secular activities, whereby 
the contributions of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, the 
Catholic Motivation Committee, the Solidarity Committee of 
Catholics, and the Cong Giao Va Dan Toc Paper should be greatly 
acknowledged. 
  The prime minister wished that there would be a succeeding 
archbishop for Ho Chi Minh City who would not contradict the 
lines of Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, the Solidarity Committee of 
Catholics, and the Cong Giao Va Dan Toc Paper, and who would use 
his role to better the contributions of the Catholics in Ho Chi 
Minh City to the advancement of the people and prosperity of the 
country, along with the harmonious development of religious 
activities.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 7 -- Vietnam and Russia have agreed 
to step up economic cooperation commensurate to their 
potentials, said Mr Le Xuan Trinh, cabinet minister and head of 
the government office, who has paid a week-long working visit to 
the Russian Federation. 
  In an interview with the army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on the 
present status and prospects of the two countries' economic 
cooperation, Minister Le Xuan Trinh said that during the visit 
the two sides reviewed the implementation of the programme of 
the Vietnam-Russia Intergovernmental Committee on Economic, 
Commercial and Scientific-Technological Cooperation approved at 
its second session held in Hanoi in early 1993. The two sides 
also discussed an agenda for the third session of the committee 
scheduled to be held in Hanoi in mid-April this year. The two 
sides signed protocols on trade for 1994 between the two 
countries, and on their cooperation in the time to come. 
Vietnam also signed a protocol on payment of mature debt to 
Russia. 
  Asked about the payment of debts to Russia, Minister Le Xuan 
Trinh said that Vietnam agreed to pay a mature debt of some USD 
[U.S. dollars] 60 million in garments, woolen carpets, 
lacquerwares, rice, meat and other goods. The two sides agreed 
that an amount of USD 50 million contributed by Vietnamese guest 
workers in Russia would be included in the payment to Russia. 
The Russian side agreed to take part of this payment to 
reinvest in and expand its cooperation with Vietnam. 
  Speaking about the cooperative orientation between the two 
countries in the years to come Mr Trinh said that the Russian 
side had declared to continue to provide loans to Vietnam to 
implement in 1994 the project for the city public lighting 
system. Also this year, he said, Russia will resume investment 
in agro-industrial projects to plant tea, rubber, and coffee.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "A Fine Event in Vietnam-Cambodian </F>
Friendship Relations"] 
  [Text] In this spring of 1994, our people have the great 
pleasure of receiving the National Assembly delegation of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia [KOC] led by National Assembly Chairman 
Samdech Chea Sim on an official friendship to Vietnam at the 
invitation of National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. 
  Arriving in Vietnam, National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim and 
the distinguished Cambodian guests have brought to our people 
the relationship of fraternity and friendship of the Cambodian 
people, who are living in a country with an historic Angkor 
civilization. This visit also marks a new developing step in the 
friendship and cooperation relations between the two countries 
and their national assemblies. 
  During its stay in Vietnam, the KOC National Assembly 
delegation held talks with the Vietnamese National Assembly 
delegation led by Chairman Nong Duc Manh in an atmosphere of 
friendship and mutual understanding. Party General Secretary Do 
Muoi, State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
held cordial talks with the visiting delegation. 
  The delegation visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and laid a 
wreath there. It also visited Ho Chi Minh's living and working 
quarters and many economic and cultural establishments in 
different localities. 
  Being neighbors of Cambodia, we are very happy at the 
important achievements recorded by the Cambodian people under 
the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk in building a Cambodian 
state of independence, peace, and non-alignment, and one which 
is friendly to all nations. We also express our joy at the 
relations of traditional unity and cooperation between the two 
close, neighboring countries of Vietnam and Cambodia. The 
relations, after experiencing challenges, have been continuously 
strengthened and developed. 
  Regarding their national construction and development, as 
well as their efforts to develop their friendship relations, 
especially in the present circumstances, Vietnam and Cambodia 
share a common concern to strengthen and broaden the relations 
of good neighborliness and multilateral cooperation for mutual 
benefit. That relationship is based on the principles set forth 
in the January 1992 Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique. The 
principles were also repeated in the August 1993 
Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique. 
  The joy of the two peoples is further multiplied when the 
relations have been continuously strengthened and developed. 
That is prominently manifested by this official friendship to 
Vietnam by the KOC National Assembly delegation. 
  In the cordial talks with Party General Secretary Do Muoi, 
State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, 
Samdech Chea Sim expressed his fine impressions of the quick 
improvement in the Vietnamese socioeconomy and the important 
achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in their 
renovation undertaking. He confirmed that as a great 
encouragement for the Cambodian people in their current 
undertaking of national protection and construction. He 
affirmed the Cambodian people's determination to overcome all 
difficulties and challenges in order to take their revolutionary 
undertaking to a situation of stability and development. The 
KOC National Assembly, government, and people will do their best 
to preserve and develop the Cambodia-Vietnam fraternal 
friendship and the comprehensive cooperation for peace and 
prosperity in each country and for peace, stability, and 
cooperation in the region and the world. Samdech Chea Sim 
thanked the Vietnamese Government and people for their previous 
great assistance to the Cambodian revolution as well as their 
present active contribution to the process for peace and 
national concord in Cambodia. 
  In their talks with the distinguished Cambodian guests, 
Party 
General Secretary Do Muoi, State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet heartily welcomed the Vietnam visit by the 
high-ranking delegation of the Cambodian National Assembly at 
the Vietnamese new year. They considered this as a significant 
event and a good sign of Vietnam-Cambodia friendship, unity, and 
cooperative relations. The Vietnamese leaders confirmed that as 
ever, Vietnam wishes -- and in reality, Vietnam has done its 
best -- to build and strengthen the time-honored friendship and 
the close, friendly relations between the peoples in the two 
countries. And Vietnam always supports the Cambodian people's 
efforts to build a Cambodia of independence, peace, 
non-alignment, which is friendly to all countries, especially to 
neighboring countries. The Vietnamese leaders stated that this 
Vietnam visit by the Cambodian National Assembly delegation 
ushered in a new era for the Vietnam-Cambodia relations of 
friendship and cooperation. 
  Heartily welcoming the official friendship Vietnam visit by 
the KOC National Assembly delegation led by Chairman Chea Sim, 
we hope that the delegation will record fine achievements in its 
visit and we trust that the Vietnam-Cambodia relations of 
friendship and cooperation will be continuously consolidated and 
strengthened.

tribute to President Ho Chi Minh at his mausoleum. The wreath 
carries the following inscription: A respectful Tribute to 
President Ho Chi Minh -- Glorious Man of the Vietnamese Nation. 
  The delegation also visited President Ho Chi Minh's 
residence 
and office. At Uncle Ho's stilt house, President Ochirbat posed 
for a while before some memorabilia that conjured up the image 
of the great leader of the Vietnamese people. He was apparently 
moved when Mr. Tran Viet Hoan, director of the late president's 
heritage complex, recalled a statement by President Ho Chi Minh 
that, although living far apart, the Vietnamese people and the 
Mongolian people love each other dearly and they have always 
supported each other. I firmly believe that the friendly and 
cooperative relations between the two countries will certainly 
develop with every passing day, thus contributing to the 
maintenance of peace in Asia and the world. 
  President Ochirbat entered his thoughts in a souvenir book 
and signed it. 
  After leaving Uncle Ho's stilt house, President Ochirbat and 
his wife visited the Ho Chi Minh Museum where he was welcomed by 
Curator Cu Van Truoc and the museum staff and was guided by them 
on a tour of various galleries.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 6 -- By 2000, Vietnam must have a 
central bank capable of administering monetary policy and 
commercial banks able to compete with foreign rivals, according 
to Cao Sy Kiem, governor of the State Bank. 
  Cao Sy Kiem also made known that a USD 73 million-project 
aimed at computerising and automating Vietnam's banking industry 
from now towards 2000 had been approved. 
  The fund, he added, would be taken from the state budget, 
foreign loans as well as the reserved capitals of the Vietnam 
State Bank. 
  Over the past three years Vietnam has made great efforts to 
become integrated with the world banking system. About 2,600 
assorted personal computers have been put into use in various 
state- run banks and commercial banks. Information networks 
have been formed and completed within each bank as well as from 
provincial- level banks to central bank. 
  Moreover, various new professional techniques have been 
applied such as electronic money transfer, an interbank market, 
remote inspection and supervision, preventative information, 
foreign currency and precious stone businesses, and so on. 
  Thanks to these changes, the payment time has been reduced 
considerably, thus the rate of circulation has also accelerated. 
  This improved service has improved the business environment 
for the entire economy.

  [Text] The Customs General Department held a conference 
from 1-3 March to discuss measures to fulfill its 1994 duties 
and orientations for building up the customs sector before 2000. 
Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai addressed the conference. 
  This year the customs sector was assigned by the state to 
collect 8,500 billion dong in import-export taxes. At the 
conference, the officials discussed various measures to 
implement state regulations and orders on renovating economic 
thinking in line with the party's open door policy; initiating 
and submitting to the government new regulations and policies 
that respond to the needs of the new situation; reforming 
supervision mechanisms to ensure convenience for local residents 
and foreign guests in traveling in and out of the country; 
maintaining a smooth flow of trade; and suppressing smuggling 
and tax evasion. 
  The sector will strive to fight corruption, and expel and 
bring to trial those degenerate cadres and officials. The 
customs offices will also pay more attention in improving 
statistical work, upgrading facilities so that they can help the 
government with effective macroeconomic management.

  [Text] Dear friends: After four days working with a high 
sense of urgency and enthusiasm, the all-army midterm conference 
has concluded. The conference participants worked with a high 
sense of responsibility to the renovation undertaking and in a 
democratic, open, and frank atmosphere, to concentrate all-army 
intelligence in thoroughly and profoundly absorbing the 
resolution of the party midterm national conference and the 
report of the party Central Committee Military Commission. 
  The conference participants also reviewed the national 
defense work in the last two years, discussed orientations for 
national defense work in the next period, and set up directions 
and measures to implement successfully the national defense and 
security tasks in the new situation. 
  The conference participants' discussion was rich in both 
theory and practice context and resulted in a high consensus to 
the evaluation on achievements and on duties for the period to 
come. In discussing the eight essential short-term tasks, the 
deputies paid extensive attention to the national defense and 
security tasks. 
  Considering the current world situation and domestic 
developments, the deputies totally agreed with provisions of the 
resolution passed by the party midterm national conference, and 
the report of the party Central Committee Military Commission. 
They also suggested many concrete measures to strengthen 
national defense and security systems. 
  The conference participants discussed orientations on a 
number of major tasks in national defense and security and on 
heightening revolutionary vigilance, strengthening political 
grassroots agencies and national defense movements, cohesively 
combining the people's security network with the all-people 
national defense undertaking, and consolidating party leadership 
and state management in national defense and security. Various 
deputies offered profound analysis on the current situation and 
new demands for national defense to safeguard internal security, 
the party, and the government. 
  Based on their particular positions, the deputies asserted 
that the task of consolidating political and ideological 
understanding is the basis for building up steadfast units, 
heightening the combat ability of the army, and successfully 
fulfilling all assigned duties. 
  Comrade Senior General Doan Khue, member of the party 
Central 
Committee Political Bureau, deputy secretary of the party 
Central Committee Military Commission, and national defense 
minister, on behalf of the presidium, summed up opinions and 
suggestions for the resolution of the party midterm national 
conference and the report of the party Central Committee 
Military Commission on national defense duties. 
  He pointed out that after all the discussion we have gained 
principal results of more profound understanding and higher 
support for the contents of the political reports. We have 
clearly seen a new renovation phase in party leading ability 
through reviewing all theoretical work and evaluating all 
realities. The entire army has shown confidence in the current 
progress and the bright future of the country and has clearly 
determined the political duties of the party and people in the 
important turn to a new stage. The entire army will continue to 
heighten the strength of the people's armed forces and the 
leadership ability of all party organizations, and together with 
localities it will build an ever more steadfast national defense 
system, thus contributing their part in maintaining political 
stability and the construction of a prosperous and beautiful 
country on the path of socialism. 
  The conference participants were very much encouraged by the 
presence of Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi. In the capacity 
of the party general secretary and secretary of the party 
Central Committee Military Commission, Comrade Do Muoi talked 
warmly and openly to the conference. On behalf of the party 
Central Committee Political Bureau and the party Central 
Committee Secretariat, the comrade praised the army for all its 
efforts and achievements, expressed confidence and love of the 
party and people in the firm political acumen, high sense of 
responsibility, and readiness for combat of the army. 
  The all-army midterm conference concluded successfully on 
the 
evening of 4 March.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>
  [Text] The revival of the "Super 301" announced by U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor Thursday is feared to affect 
Korea indirectly although initially no problems are expected. 
But the government issued a formal comment regretting the U.S. 
decision to revive the formidable retaliation clause of the 
Omnibus Trade Act in the wake of the successful conclusion of 
the multilateral Uruguay Round talks successfully ended and the 
set-up of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 for a freer 
trade order. 
  The Foreign Ministry said, "Trade disputes between countries 
should be solved through settlement procedures of the WTO rather 
than domestic legal procedures of any one nation." 
  Super 301 is initially targeted at opening Japanese markets 
as repeatedly reported after the failure of the U.S-Japan summit 
talks last month to rectify the snowballing U.S. trade deficit, 
a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Japan recorded $60 billion trade surplus with the United 
States last year. But to avoid criticism from the world for 
retaliation against one specific nation, Mickey Kantor did not 
pinpoint Japan in announcing the reinstatement of Super 301. 
  An official of the Economic Planning Board said this means 
that the United States intends to take retaliatory action 
against an country using unfair trade practices. 
  The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. [KOTRA] and the Korea 
Foreign 
Trade Association [KFTA] made similar comments that the United 
States is likely to use the weapon as a means to pressure all 
its trading partners recording trade surpluses with the United 
States to open their markets wider. A KOTRA official cited 
China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. 
  The United States is also deeply interested in the 
telecommunications and financial markets of Korea and protection 
of foreign intellectual property rights here. If the United 
States obtains what it wants from Japan, it is expected to use 
the clause against Southeast Asian nations and Korea, the KFTA 
and KOTRA officials said. 
  Korea has a good relationship with the United States thanks 
to balanced trade unlike in the late 1980s, they said. But 
Washington has not decreased its pressure, calling for advancing 
the market opening timetable in nine fields, including 
telecommunications and education, at a third conference of the 
Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) last month. 
  Han Yong-su, director-general at the trade cooperation 
bureau 
of the Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry said, "Now, we have no 
outstanding trade disputes with the United States. We have been 
carrying out the market opening program at a fast pace. We will 
wait and see how the situation develops." But Super 301 is 
different from existing Clause 301 by the act that the 
retaliation procedures are simple and negotiations are 
comprehensive with each nation involved, not item-by-item or 
field-by-field negotiations. A a result, its impact on one 
nation is wide, a KFTA official said. 
  Japan, India and Brazil surrendered to the U.S. threat to 
use 
Super 301 in 1989 and India again in 1990. To escape from the 
naming as a nation for priority negotiation in 1989-90, Korea 
opened its farm markets wider and drastically eased regulations 
on foreign investment in advance. 
  Since 1989, Korea has been listed as a priority watch nation 
for intellectual property rights and has been forced to 
strengthen protection of property rights under Special 301 which 
is only applied to that sector. 
  Some businessmen, on the other hand, forecast that Korea 
will 
be able to benefit from U.S. pressure on Japan. They claimed 
that Korea could advance to Japanese markets amid the high yen 
in a short-term view. The United States wants Japan's 
automobile and semiconductor markets to open to U.S. exporters. 
  It is reported that Toyota Motor, a leading Japanese car 
maker, plans to purchase $6 billion worth of auto parts from the 
Untied States in 1996-97 year as a gesture to ease U.S. 
retaliation. But Korea should pay keen attention to probable 
damage from across-the-board U.S. pressure rather than 
short-term benefits, an observer said.

<F P=106> [By Jim Hatton] </F>
  [Excerpt] PHNOM PENH, March 7 (AFP) -- Government forces 
have begun the long expected offensive against Pailin, the last 
remaining stronghold of the extremist Khmer Rouge guerrillas and 
a senior official here predicted Monday it would be captured 
"very soon." The three-pronged assault was launched Saturday by 
hundreds of troops backed by tanks and heavy weapons on the gem 
mining center in northeast Cambodia on the border with Thailand, 
the government official said. 
  The fighting was said to be fierce and casualties were 
expected to be heavy, in part because the area is known to be 
heavily mined, he said. "We cannot escape a lot of casualties. 
We know that a lot of our soldiers will be killed or wounded," 
the official said. "But we must do this for the defense of 
Cambodia. There is no other way to end the war with the Khmer 
Rouge except fighting," he added. "We know the Khmer Rouge very 
well. They talk this and they do that." 
  Government forces were attacking Pailin from the north, 
south 
and east, he said, while an elite unit of some 200 paratroopers 
had been strategicly stationed west of Pailin to cut off the 
guerrillas possible retreat into Thailand. Pailin is about 10 
kilometers (six miles) from the border with Thailand. General Ke 
Kimyan, the army's chief of staff, was personally directing the 
assault force, the official said. "We will take Pailin very 
soon," he said. 
  He did not specify the size of the assault force, but said 
it 
was larger than the contingent that had taken the Khmer Rouge 
stronghold of nearby Anlung Veng last month. 
  Government troops attacking from the north had earlier taken 
control of Sala Krau, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Pailin and 
were using that as a springboard to hit the main target, he 
said. Similarly, the force advancing from the south had earlier 
captured Samlot, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away and were using 
that as their base, he said. 
  The third force was advancing from the east along Road 10, 
the official said. No casualty figures from the Pailin fighting 
had reached the capital yet, the official said. But he said 
more than 200 government soldiers had died in the battle for 
Anlung Veng. 
  The government has denied reports that Anlung Veng has been 
recaptured by the Khmer Rouge, saying they had made a strategic 
withdrawal because of shelling and that the guerrillas had not 
actually moved back into the city. Anlung Veng is some 230 
kilometers (140 miles) to the northeast of Pailin, and is 
unlikely to affect the fighting there. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The government will likely suffer a 
budget deficit this fiscal year due to the fall in oil prices 
and higher-than-expected spending. "It is almost certain that 
the state revenues will fall short of the initial estimate, 
while spending for routine activities will be higher than 
originally projected," Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said 
here yesterday. 
  The state budget for the 1993-1994 fiscal year, to end next 
month, should, by law, balance at Rp [Rupiah] 62.32 trillion 
(US$29.6 billion). Receipts from the oil and gas sectors are 
expected to account for 28.7 percent of the total revenue 
projection. 
  Mar'ie told reporters following a hearing with the Budgetary 
Commission of the House of Representatives (DPR) yesterday that 
the fall in oil prices will significantly reduce the 
government's income from oil and gas taxes, which are projected 
to reach Rp 15.12 trillion ($7.2 billion) in the current fiscal 
year. The estimate of the state receipts from oil and gas taxes 
is based on an average oil price of $18 per barrel, far higher 
than the realized average price of $16.50 in the first 10 months 
of this fiscal year. 
  Oil prices on the world market are now hovering at around 
$13 
per barrel. 
  Mar'ie said the higher-than-expected increase in routine 
spending, especially for the salaries of civil servants and 
armed forces members, will widen the deficit. The minister 
refused to explain the amount of the deficit in the 1993-1994 
fiscal year but said that the fall in the state revenues will 
not cause a major blow to the government's coffers. "The 
government will partly use its development fund reserves to 
cover the expected deficit," he said. The government has 
allocated around Rp 3.5 trillion ($1.6 billion) as reserves to 
finance the shortfall in the state revenues. 
  The minister pledged during yesterday's hearing, which 
deliberated the state budget for 1994-1995, that the government 
will not introduce any drastic measures to manage the country's 
economy next fiscal year despite the continued fall in oil 
prices. 
  Yesterday's session was the third day of deliberation which 
will end today, on the 1994-1995 state budget. The budget plan 
will be further deliberated in the House's plenary session on 
Saturday before being passed into law. 
  The state revenues and expenditures for the 1994-1995 fiscal 
year are estimated to balance at Rp 69.74 trillion ($33.2 
billion). The receipts from oil and gas sectors, which are 
projected to reach Rp 12.85 trillion ($6.11 billion), are based 
on the oil price reference of $16 per barrel. The minister 
acknowledged that the cut in oil price reference to $16 per 
barrel from the current $18 per barrel reflects the government's 
concern over the falling oil prices. However, House members said 
the $16 price reference is still too high as oil prices on the 
international markets have now declined to below $13 a barrel. 
  The receipt projection from the oil and gas sectors will 
account for 21.5 percent of the total state revenues in the next 
fiscal year. 
  The 1994-1995 state budget will come into effect in April.

  [Excerpt] According to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak, any trade retaliation against Japan by the United 
States in accordance with its Article 301 is not expected to 
affect Thai products, with the exception of communications and 
electrical products and their spare parts, which are exported to 
Japan for reexport to the United States. Suphachai said the 
declared U.S. intention to use Article 301 against Japan is 
probably merely a threat. He is confident that eventually Japan 
and the United States will be able to settle their trade 
differences. At present, several countries disagree with the 
planned use of Article 301. 
  [Begin recording] [Suphachai] Personally, I disagree. I 
feel that since the GATT has reached an agreement and set up a 
new international trade organization, the use of unilateral 
retaliation per Article 301 should be illegal. The GATT members 
should rise up to protest this matter. The parts on which the 
United States and Japan could not reach an agreement should be 
mediated by the GATT. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] There is a possibility that the 
United States may not seriously apply Article 301 against Japan. 
Is this correct? 
  [Suphachai] The United States has made a declaration. In 
the past, it did not carry out its declaration against, I think, 
either Europe or France once the deadline arrived. I think it 
amounts to giving the other party time to think about the 
consequences before taking an action. Most of the time, Article 
301 is used as a threat. Even if it is merely a threat, we 
disagree with its use. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] CANBERRA, March 7 (AFP) -- Australian Foreign 
Affairs Minister Gareth Evans is expected to raise the deepening 
U.S.-Japan trade row during talks with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher due here Monday, officials said. 
  Last week the United States revived its Super 301 law which 
allows for unilateral trade sanctions against countries found to 
have discriminated against US imports. 
  The long-standing view in the Australian Government is that 
Australia does not take sides in the dispute but sees fault on 
both sides, officials said. 
  It is understood that Evans will raise the trade dispute 
with 
Christopher in their talks which are scheduled to start Tuesday, 
a trade ministry official said. 
  US President Bill Clinton signed an executive order 
reinstating the Super 301 provision following breakdown of the 
US-Japan economic-framework talks. 
  Trade Minister Bob McMullan stressed that Australia does not 
support punitive trade sanctions like Super 301. 
  "We understand why the United States, like Australia and the 
rest of the world, supports opening up of the Japanese market -- 
but we don't support anyone doing it in a unilateral or 
discriminatory way," he said last week. 
  He added that he did not see reintroduction of Super 301 as 
"the outbreak of a trade war," but as racheting up the pressure 
on Japan. 
  McMullan said the trade question would not be a "priority 
issue" in the Evans-Christopher talks which close Wednesday and 
which are to focus on defence and security concerns. 
  "But it would be very surprising if such a senior US 
representative came to Australia and we did not mention some 
trade issues," he said. 
  In an editorial Monday, the conservative Sydney Morning 
Herald labelled the invoking of Super 301 as "unnecessary and 
reckless" and warned that if there was a trade war "countries 
like Australia will be the first casualties." 
  Urging Evans to "tell it like it is", in his meetings with 
Christopher, the daily said the US official should be "reminded 
that Australia's ability to honour its alliance (with 
Washington) is tied to the health of its trade-based economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- Major Japanese dailies 
decried U.S. President Bill Clinton in their editorials Saturday 
[5 March] over his reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade 
provision that opens the door for trade sanctions against Japan. 
But the editorials at the same time urged the Japanese 
Government to take decisive steps to slash Japan's swelling 
trade surplus. 
  The major dailies denounced the Super 301 clause as 
violating 
free trade principles confirmed with the conclusion in December 
of the Uruguay Round of trade talks under the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN interpreted Clinton's move as bowing to 
domestic pressure after the recent U.S.-Japan summit in 
Washington failed to achieve a breakthrough in the so-called 
trade framework talks. 
  Given relevant promises made during the presidential 
campaign 
two years ago and strong demands from Congress to force open the 
Japanese market, Clinton could hardly avoid reinstating the 
Super 301 trade provision, the ASAHI said. The daily said, 
however, that using the threat of sanctions unless Tokyo makes 
concessions is "tantamount to waving one's fist" and a behavior 
Japan "cannot accept." 
  "It is only natural that the Japanese Government voiced 
ardent opposition," the ASAHI said. The paper said the fact 
that Clinton explained his decision in a phone call to Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa indicates that Washington is 
not interested in setting off a trade war. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet must demonstrate its political will to 
improve trade relations by drawing up an action plan to change 
Japan's economic structure, which the ASAHI said is the main 
cause for the nation's huge trade surplus. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN reproached Clinton for damaging 
bilateral relations by "pulling the trigger of the institutional 
gun, before Japan has even thrown back the ball." His reviving 
the clause is "extremely regrettable," the paper said in its 
editorial. 
  Reinstating the clause as if the stalled framework talks had 
already collapsed is "a dangerous game" that could drive overall 
bilateral relations into a "dangerous abyss against the 
President's own intention," the MAINICHI said. 
  The daily called for a plan to tackle Japan's total as well 
as bilateral current account surplus. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN said editorially that Clinton's move is 
"regrettable," but now Japan holds the "key" to solving the 
bilateral trade frictions. It urged Hosokawa to demonstrate 
"maximum leadership" in addressing the nation's trade imbalance 
"quickly and voluntarily." 
  Deploring the revival of the Super 301 provision, the NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN pointed to the damage Japan would suffer in a 
trade war of sanctions and retaliatory measures. 
  Clinton's move indicates that the United States this time 
will "not indulge" Japan's trade surplus, all the more as the 
end of the Cold War has eased pressure to play down trade 
conflicts for the sake of unity against a joint enemy, the 
economic daily said. To avoid further turbulence in the foreign 
exchange markets, Japan should not stick to its "determined 
no-policy" approach, the paper said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- A Bank of Japan [BOJ] 
source on Friday [4 March] welcomed the decline in the U.S. 
jobless rate for February as good for bilateral relations and 
the global economy as well. "This could be a factor which 
softens the recent stiff bilateral relations (between Japan and 
the United States), and it's a stabilizing factor for the world 
economy," the source said. 
  The labor department reported the U.S. jobless rate fell to 
6.5 percent in February from 6.7 percent in January, with 
nonfarm payrolls growing by 217,000. 
  The central bank source said the February increase in 
nonfarm 
payrolls was larger than expected despite cold weather for that 
month. 
  "This points to a recovery of the U.S. economy and an 
increase in competitiveness in the U.S. Manufacturing sector," 
he said. He did not elaborate.

  [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korea brushed aside 
the communist North's claim Saturday [day as received] that an 
inter- Korean envoy exchange is not required for a third round 
of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. 
  "This was something we expected (North Korea to do)," Chang 
Chae-yong, director-general of American Affairs at the Foreign 
Ministry, said in reaction. 
  "We don't feel the need to say anything about it. We have to 
wait and see," Chang said. 
  North Korean first Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu said 
the envoy exchange is not part of the agreed preconditions for 
the high-level talks, slated for March 21 in Geneva. 
  Seoul, Pyongyang and Washington announced a set of joint 
measures this week after North Korea allowed entry by a team of 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors. But 
Washington made a separate announcement that while the date for 
the high-level negotiations has been set, successful IAEA 
inspections and an inter-Korean presidential envoy exchange are 
two prerequisites. 
  "North Korea agreed that Washington would make this separate 
announcement," Chang said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
lays obstacle to the complete implementation of the agreement 
reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York and create 
artificial difficulties in the way of the talks by bringing 
forward such a precondition as the exchange of special envoys 
between the North and South of Korea in the future, it will 
reveal its intention not to resolve the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula, stresses NODONG SINMUN in a signed commentary 
Monday. 
  At a time when the agreed conclusions of the DPRK-USA 
contact 
in New York have begun to be implemented, the United States 
intends to set the exchange of special envoys between the North 
and South of Korea and the inspection by the IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency] as preconditions of the suspension of the 
"Team Spirit 94" joint manoeuvres and the opening of the third 
round of the DPRK-USA talks, the analyst says, and continues: 
This makes us doubt whether it has the willingness to fully 
implement the conclusions or not. 
  The stand of the United States that it will take an action 
only when the other side acts first, shows that it seeks a 
solution to the issue from the position of strength. This will 
only bring difficulties to the solution of the issue. 
  Whether the issue is solved or not depends on how sincerely 
the United States, a dialogue partner, work to implement its 
commitments. 
  Of importance here is for the United States to strictly 
observe the principle of the joint statement between the DPRK 
and the United States and renounce the attitude and stand to set 
preconditions, persisting only in its assertions. Such attitude 
and stand are only harmful to the solution of the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  The United States must show in deeds its sincerity and 
willingness to solve the issue as a partner of the dialogue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
on March 4 committed photographing and eletronic espionage on 
the in-depth areas of the northern half of Korea in the sky 
above the Military Demarcation Line with "RC-135" strategical 
reconnaissance plane from Okinawa base in Japan, according to a 
military source. 
  On the same day, a "P-3" anti-submarine plane staged an 
exercise for striking submarines with mines, torpedoes and depth 
bombs in the sky above the East Sea of South Korea [Sea of 
Japan] under the support of formations of pursuit planes. 
  Armed bandits of the puppet army took the combat positions 
in 
Chorwon county, South Korean Kangwon Province and staged a 
military rehearsal near the demilitarized zone, firing bullets 
and shells. 
  This is part of premeditated military provocations of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets to bring the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of strain.

that the demand on the abolition of South Korea's National 
Security Law [NSL] is a U.S. official position -- not that of an 
individual person. In response to a question, he clarified that 
the United States will advice [chongyong] South Korea to repeal 
the NSL, even though it is a touchy issue. He added that the 
reason for such a U.S. demand is the possibility that the law 
might be abused. 
  The final confirmation by the U.S. secretary of state came 
after the puppet Foreign Ministry's announcement that Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard's comment was his own 
personal view, not a U.S. official position.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher finally confirmed that the demand for the 
repeal of the "National Security Law" [NSL] in South Korea is 
not a personal opinion but an official stand of the United 
States, the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) of South Korea 
reported. 
  Answering a question put by the MBC on the evening of March 
3, he made it clear that, although the repeal of the 
controversial "National Security Law" of South Korea was a 
sensitive matter, the U.S. Government would persuade South 
Korea to repeal it. 
  He added that this demand of the United States to South 
Korea 
was motivated by its fear that the "National Security Law" might 
be abused. 
  This final confirmation of the U.S. State secretary came 
shortly after the South Korean puppet Foreign Ministry announced 
on March 3 that the remarks of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of State Hubbard urging the repeal of the "National Security 
Law" in South Korea had "turned out" to be an "expression of 
his personal hope", not the official position of the United 
States.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Federation of South 
Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Unification (Hantongnyon) 
made public a statement on March 3 as regards the demand of the 
U.S. authorities for the repeal of the "National Security Law" 
(NSL) in South Korea. 
  The statement branded the "NSL" as an anti-democratic, 
anti-reunification evil law defining the North and the 
anti-"government" forces in the South and overseas as "enemies" 
and totally blocking human rights, democracy and national 
reunification and as an evil law infringing upon basic rights of 
the people including conscience and the freedom of ideology and 
the freedom of speech, the press and association. 
  The attempts to keep the "NSL" only reveal the anti-national 
nature of the present "regime" which is turning a deaf ear to 
the demands of the people and scheming to perpetuate the 
division, the statement said. It repeatedly and strongly urged 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet authorities to abrogate the law.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
arrested Kim Sang-kyu, former chairman of the General Student 
Council of the Suwon branch of Kyonghui University, on March 3 
by invoking the "National Security Law", a fascist and 
anti-reunification law, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The fascist clique detained him for the reason that he was 
involved in the Seoul sponsorship of the pan-national rally at 
Hanyang University in August last year and the first meeting of 
co-chairmen of the National Alliance of youth and students for 
the country's reunification over the international telephone. 
  His righteous behaviour to contribute even a little to 
ending 
the tragedy of national division spanning nearly half a century 
and attaining national unity and the reunification of the 
country cannot be a crime.

  [Text] Pyongyang, march 7 (KCNA) -- It is inevitable in 
South Korea that the politicians become corrupt and 
irregularities prevail in society as the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
himself is engaged in irregularities. This is a proof that the 
days of the "civilian government" are numbered, declares NODONG 
SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It has recently been brought to light that the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam at the time of the "presidential inauguration" last 
year manipulated the "Ministry of Health and Social Affairs" to 
buy toothpaste and other goods with the "money donated for 
helping poor neighbours" and distribute them as "gifts." It was 
also exposed that officials of the puppet Defence Ministry built 
the "defence hall" equipped with deluxe amusement facilities 
with the money squeezed from the people including primary school 
children allegedly for the sake of "defence" and indulged in 
luxury. 
  Scandals of the puppet Home Ministry and many other units 
are 
reported one after the other. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's advertisement of "clean politics" 
is being shattered. 
  In fact, the "civilian government" is the hotbed of 
irregularities, outdistancing the "Fifth and Sixth Republics." 
  This shows the puppets are engaged in irregularities and 
encouraging them behind the facade of "reforms."

<F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON Denounces Traitor Kim Yong-sam's </F>
Outcry"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam in an interview with a reporter of the "Korea 
Broadcasting System" on March 3 cried that they could not take 
an "optimistic view" of the "nuclear issue of the North" or 
"nothing could be solved" without their presence. Commenting on 
this, MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined commentary says it is the 
scream of a fool reckless of his position. 
  The paper continues: 
  With the agreement on four immediate steps of simultaneous 
action for a package solution of the nuclear issue at the 
DPRK-USA contact in New York, a prospect that the peaceful 
solution process of the nuclear issue may be again on the right 
orbit has opened. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying to get rid of his 
secluded 
position by excusing himself for failing to participate in the 
DPRK-USA talks for a resolution to the nuclear issue. However, 
his attempt only betrays his ignorance of the outbreak of the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and the way of its 
solution. 
  For a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue as well as 
improvement of the North-South relations, such a fool as the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam must be removed without delay.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN and MINJU 
CHOSON today demand that the Kim Yong-sam group immediately make 
public the amount and kinds of nuclear waste dumpted into the 
sea and the dumping places and apologize to the whole nation and 
promptly stop such an act. 
  As already exposed, the nuclear waste dumpted into the sea 
by 
the South Korean rulers in seven years from 1986 to 1992 amounts 
to 11,000 trillion becquerels. 
  Noting that this act of the South Korean authorities is a 
never-to-be-condoned crime endangering the existence of the 
nation and destroying the ecological environments of the nature, 
a NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  Their dumping of nuclear waste into the sea is an 
anti-national criminal act of turning the Korean peninsula and 
the seas around it into a nuclear-polluted waste region. And 
this is a gross violation of the international law and accord. 
  The nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean puppets is 
unthinkable apart from their feverish nuclear arms development. 
  Their nuclear armament which has been accelerated from the 
early 70's is now entering a very dangerous stage. The puppets 
have played the role of a shock brigade in the "nuclear" racket 
kicked up by the international reactionaries to isolate and 
stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, charging it 
with its "nuclear issue." This is chiefly aimed at stepping up 
their criminal nuclear development behind the scene. 
  With the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique left alone, it is 
impossible to prevent the devastation of the land and seas and 
protect the nation from a nuclear disaster, let alone 
independence, democracy and reunification. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that if the South Korean 
puppets 
push ahead with nuclear development, continuing nuclear waste 
dumping into the sea, they will face a stern judgement by the 
nation and mankind.

of the Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the South Side 
Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon), in an interview with the magazine

  The "reunification policy" of the Kim Yong-sam "regime" is

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls for Halt to Japan's Nuclear </F>
Armament"-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- To hold in check 
Japan's nuclear armament is an urgent matter related to the 
existence of mankind, says NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The analyst says: 
  Japan plans to put into operation Monju, its first fast 
breeder reactor, in the near future. This is its open scheme to 
produce nuclear weapons any time by securing large quantities of 
plutonium by itself. 
  Japan has already stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium and 
developed the electronic destructive device and other devices 
and technology of atomic bombs and even means of long-range 
nuclear delivery. 
  The promotion of Japan's nuclear armament in full scale with 
the connivance of the West is, in actuality, a matter which must 
be taken most seriously in the world at present. 
  This is, first of all, because Japan's nuclear armament is 
an 
undisguised challenge to the desire of mankind to live in a 
peaceful world without nuclear threat and is a big obstacle to 
the building of a nuclear-free, peaceful world. 
  Checking Japan's nuclear armament has become an urgent 
matter 
also because the Japanese reactionaries are attempting to 
gratify their dominationist ambition with nuclear weapons. 
  In Japan today, revanchism for revenging Japan's defeat in 
the past has raised its head and ultra-nationalism, a 
reactionary ideological trend which had constituted the 
ideological basis of Japanese militarism, is being openly 
fostered. 
  It is not difficult to imagine the grave consequences that 
would be entailed by the nuclear armament of Japan upon the 
cause of peace in Asia and the world. 
  The main target of the nuclear threat from Japan is, 
needless 
to say, our country and other Asian countries. The Japanese 
reactionary ruling circles are revealing their aggressive 
designs on our country more openly. 
  The world people who love peace must join in the struggle to 
frustrate Japan's nuclear armament.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Denounces Japanese </F>
Reactionaries' Row Over `Nuclear Problem'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry answered a question of KCNA today 
concerning the spiteful hullabaloo of the Japanese authorities 
over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  He told KCNA: 
  The third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is to open before long as 
a series of controversial matters between the DPRK and the 
United States including the "nuclear issue" have been 
coordinated. Japanese politicians including the high-level 
authorities, however, are slandering the DPRK, urging it to 
accept "special inspection." They seek in this to instigate the 
hardline conservatives of the United States to lay obstacles in 
the way of the DPRK-U.S. talks and attain their sinister 
political and military purposes. 
  We cannot but watch with vigilance the attempt of the 
high-placed officials of Japan to impede the settlement of the 
"nuclear issue" with rash acts against the DPRK and find a 
pretext for a lawful promotion of their nuclear armament, which 
has reached the danger line. 
  If Japan arms itself with nuclear weapons, the 
denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realised, the 
inter-Korean joint declaration on denuclearization will be 
invalid and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be 
virtually meaningless. 
  If Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula is to be 
nuclear-free, not only Asia but also the world must pay due 
attention to Japan which is accelerating nuclear armament. 
  The denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to the 
total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide.

<F P=106> ["Japan Must Give Up Nuclear Design" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- As plutonium fully 
enough for Monju, a fast breeder reactor built in Tsuruga city, 
Fukui Prefecture, has been transported, it will shortly be put 
into operation, NHK reported recently. 
  This is part of Japan's undisguised intention to produce 
nuclear weapons any time by securing large quantities of 
plutonium by itself, and thus become a nuclear power. 
  The annual capacity of Japan's reprocessing factories is 800 
tons, largest in the world. Japan has reportedly stockpiled 26 
tons of plutonium and will secure 100 tons by 2010. This amount 
is enough to make far more than 10,000 nuclear bombs. 
  Japan, which has already been possessed of electronic 
destructive device and other devices and technology of nuclear 
bombs, developed in February this year even long-range, large 
roket H-2 which can be used as inter-continental ballistic 
missile. 
  The facts show that Japan's nuclear armament has reached a 
danger line. 
  With the nuclear armament being accelerated in real earnest 
in Japan, a neighbour of the Korean peninsula, we cannot but 
cope with such a situation with vigilance. 
  The accelerated nuclear armament of Japan throws a snag in 
the way of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must give up their criminal 
nuclear design, clearly mindful of the grave consequences to be 
entailed by their moves to turn Japan into a nuclear power.

dedicate signed articles to the 37th anniversary of the 
independence of Ghana. 
  The Ghanaian people, who achieved the independence of the 
country on March 6, 1957, have striven to consolidate national 
independence and achieve the prosperity of the country, MINJU 
CHOSON in an article says, and continues: 
  The Ghanaian Government, pursuing the non-alignment policy 
externally, is making efforts to establish a new fair 
international order against imperialism, colonialism and racism. 
  Korea and Ghana are far away from each other geographically, 
but the two governments and peoples established and have long 
developed the relations of friendship and cooperation. 
  The Korean people, believing that the friendly and 
cooperative relations between the two countries will further 
strengthen in the future, sincerely wish the Ghanaian people 
greater success in their work to develop the economy and build a 
peaceful and stable country.

reunification, as unpardonable criminal acts challenging the 
aspiration of the South Korean people and the trend of the times. 
  "We will stand firmly on the side of Hanminjon and the South 
Korean people who are intensifying the movement for the 
overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam regime, expulsion of the U.S 
Forces and reunification, upholding `10-point programme of the 
great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
country' and extend positive support and solidarity for their 
cause of independence, democracy and reunification," the 
statement said.

  Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of the DPRK National Defense 
Commission and supreme commander of the KPA, watched the overall 
song and dance performance by the artists of the KPA 
entertainment group on 5 March. 
  Comrade Kye Ung-tae, member of the Political Bureau of the 
Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee and secretary of 
the party Central Committee; Comrades Kim Chung-nin, Kim Ki-nam, 
Kim Kuk-tae, and Kim Yong-sun, secretaries of the party Central 
Committee; and responsible functionaries of the party Central 
Committee and the field of press and publication were on hand. 
  The performance began with the orchestral music and chorus 
of 
"The Sound of Horses Hooves at Mt. Paektu." Various 
performances were presented such as the dance, "The Palanquin 
Carriage Is Running," and "The Final Showdown;" a mixed vocal 
duet, "Love of Officers and Men Which Is Blossoming Along the 
Marching Road;" a men's chorus, "We Will Deeply Bear in Our 
Hearts the Red Certification of the Party;" and a solo and 
kayagum [a Korean instrument with 12 strings] ensemble, "It Is a 
Paradise of Hope at Which the Whole World Is Looking." 
  In May 1992, the creators and artists of the KPA 
entertainment group highly upheld the militant task presented by 
the supreme comrade commander and brought about a new turning 
point in the artistic creation work. Therefore, they were able 
to present on stage magnificent artistic works that greatly 
contribute to indoctrinating the people and soldiers of the 
People's Army in a revolutionary way. 
  After watching the performance, Supreme Commander Comrade 
Kim 
Chong-il expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the 
creators and artists of the entertainment group were able to 
create and perform revolutionary and militant art works which 
are of high ideological and artistic spirit. He highly assessed 
their results, and gave them a thank-you message of the party 
Central Military Commission and the KPA supreme commander. 
  The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il said that all 
performances that were put on stage are very good works that are 
in accordance with the character of the military and in 
conformity with the demand of the era. He pointed out that the 
performance by the entertainment group is giving great faith and 
courage to our people and soldiers of the People's Army due to 
its militant spirit and strong appeal. 
  The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il said all art 
works including songs and dances well reflected the courage, 
wisdom, and revolutionary spirit of our People's Army, which is 
the party's army, a revolutionary army armored to uphold the 
party and the leader, defend socialism, and complete the 
socialist cause. He showed his satisfaction that the People's 
Army entertainment group has created many revolutionary and 
combat-oriented art works and successfully fulfilled its 
fundamental duty of indoctrinating the soldiers of the People's 
Army to devotedly serve for the party and the leader, and for 
the fatherland and the people with the self-consciousness of 
defenders of the party and revolution. 
  The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il said the KPA 
entertainment group, a combat art unit of our revolutionary 
armed forces, should continue its effort in artistic activities 
for the revolutionary and combat indoctrination for the soldiers 
and concretely set forth creative directions to serve as the 
guidelines for artistic creative works. The Supreme Commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il said it is important that the People's Army 
entertainment group well reflects in the art works the great 
political and ideological aspects and invincible might of the 
soldiers of the People's Army, who are strongly guaranteeing our 
party's revolutionary cause with armed forces firmly united 
around the party and the leader. 
  The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il said to vividly 
show the soldiers' life, as did in the show, is a very important 
question in creative works and pointed out that the 
entertainment group should well describe the lofty spiritual 
world of the soldiers of the People's Army and how they 
struggle, including their loyalty toward the party and the 
leader, their spirit of devotion to serve the fatherland and the 
people, indomitable revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary 
comradely love. 
  The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out that 
the People's Army entertainment group should keep its identity 
of being socialist, revolutionary, winning, grand, and 
magnificent not only in the contents but also in the format in 
conformity with its mission and duty as an art group which 
indoctrinates and serves the soldiers of the People's Army. 
  The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out that 
as all art works created by the People's Army entertainment 
group should be perfect ideologically and artistically as they 
contribute to the indoctrination of the invincible revolutionary 
rank, a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary fighters, and added 
that new orchestral music should be created in chuche-oriented 
and national format in conformity with the characteristics of 
the Army units. 
  The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il said he firmly 
believes that the creators and artists of the People's Army 
entertainment group will actively contribute to our party's 
revolutionary cause by vigorously carrying out creative artistic 
activities that contribute to the indoctrination of the soldiers.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea and supreme commander of the Korean 
People's Army [KPA], on March 5 saw a music and dance 
performance of the artistes of the song and dance ensemble of 
the Korean People's Army. 
  Appreciating the performance with him were Kye Ung-tae,

[Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], Kim 
Chung-nin, Kim Ki-nam, Kim Kuk-tae and Kim Yong-sun, secretaries 
of the C.C., the WPK, and senior officials of the party Central 
Committee and of the press. 
  The orchestral music and chorus "The Sound of Horse's Hooves 
in Mt. Paektu" was the curtain-raiser of the colorful program 
which included the dances "The Kitchen Cajt Runs" and "The Final 
Decisive Battle," the mixed duet "Affection of Officer for his 
Men in a March," the men's group singing "We Will Keep the Red 
Party Card at Our Heart," and the solo and group singing to the 
accompaniment of Kayagum "The Paradise of Hope Focusing World's 
Attention." 
  After seeing the performance, Comrade Kim Chong-il noted 
with 
deep satisfaction that the creative workers and artistes of the 
ensemble created and performed revolutionary and militant stage 
works high in ideological and artistic plane and highly 
estimated their success and extended them thanks of the party 
central military commission and the Supreme Commander of the 
Korean People's Army. 
  He said that all the numbers of the program were very good 
works suited to the character of the Army and the demand of the 
times and that the performances of the ensemble gave deep 
confidence and courage to our people and People's Army soldiers 
for their militancy and strong appeal. 
  Noting that the songs, dances and all other works well 
showed 
the courage and resourcefulness and the revolutionary mettle of 
our People's Army, the Army of the party and the revolution, 
which upholds the party and the leader with arms, defends the 
socialist system with arms and is carrying the cause of 
socialism to completion with arms, he expressed satisfaction at 
the fact that the song and dance ensemble of the Korean People's 
Army was fulfilling with credit its basic duty to educate the 
People's Army soldiers to devotedly serve the party and the 
leader, the motherland and the people, conscious of its being 
the defender of the party and the guard of the revolution, by 
creating many revolutionary and militant stage works. 
  Saying that the KPA song and dance ensemble, the militant 
art 
unit of our revolutionary Armed Forces, must continue energetic 
art activities to educate soldiers in revolutionary and militant 
way, he indicated a concrete orientation of creation which would 
serve as the guideline in art creation. 
  He stressed that it is important for the ensemble to 
represent well in its stage works the great political and 
ideological features and invincible might of the People's Army 
soldiers who are firmly guaranteeing the revolutionary cause of 
our party with arms, united rock-firm behind the party and the 
leader. 
  Noting that it is a very important matter in creating works 
to vividly represent the life of soldiers as shown in the 
performance, he said that the ensemble must depict well the 
loyalty of soldiers to the party and the leader, and their 
spirit of devoted service for the motherland and people, 
indomitable revolutionary spirit and revolutionary comradeship 
and other noble mentality and combat features. 
  The ensemble must maintain its inherent style, socialist, 
revolutionary, militant, dignified and grandiose, not only in 
content but also in form to suit its mission and duty as an art 
organisation educating the People's Army soldiers and serving 
them, he said. 
  Saying that all the stage works created by the ensemble must 
be flawless ideologically and artistically as they contribute to 
educating the invincible revolutionary ranks, 
a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary soldiers, he stressed that a 
new orchestral music, chuche-based and national in style, 
conforming to the character of the Army must be created. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il expressed the belief that the creative 
workers and artistes of the People's Army song and dance 
ensemble would actively contribute to the accomplishment of the 
revolutionary cause of our party with its energetic creative 
activities conducive to the education of soldiers.

<F P=106> ["Vitality of Our Party's Policy of Economic Propaganda and </F>
Agitation" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN on March 
6 dedicated an article to the 20th anniversary of the 
publication of the famous work of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il "On Vigorously Conducting Economic Propaganda and 
Agitation" on March 7, 1974. 
  Recalling that Comrade Kim Chong-il in this work indicated a 
unique line of vigorously conducting economic propaganda and 
agitation on the basis of a scientific analysis of the realistic 
demand of socialist economic construction in our country and 
precious practical experience, the author of the article says: 
  The great vitality of our party's policy of economic 
propaganda and agitation lies, first of all, in that it has 
brought home to the party members and working people our party's 
chuche-based line of economic construction and economic policy 
and guided them to thoroughly defend and implement them. 
  The work contains the idea of energetically conducting the 
work of arming the party members and working masses with the 
party's line of building an independent national economy and its 
economic policy in each period. 
  The proud reality in which all people have turned out and 
are 
achieving new miracles and feats, upholding the revolutionary 
economic strategy setpforth by our party, is a precious fruition 
of the arming of the party members and working masses with the 
party's line of economic construction and economic policy. 
  The great vitality of our party's economic propaganda and 
agitation lies in that with the brisk progress of economic 
agitation, the revolutionary zeal and the creative ingenuity of 
the masses have been brought into full play in socialist 
economic construction. 
  The dear leader in the work indicated concrete tasks arising 
in vigorously conducting economic agitation on the basis of the 
success and experience already attained. What is important here 
is to concentrate economic agitation on the fulfilment of 
economic tasks set forth by the party and the leader in each 
time. 
  The great effect of economic agitation was demonstrated by 
the completion of such difficult and gigantic project as the 
West Sea barrage in a short time and construction of many 
monumental edifices including the May Day Stadium in a brief 
period. 
  With stress laid on enlisting the idea of people in economic 
agitation, a change has taken place in the work of remoulding 
their idea [word indistinct] construction. 
  Noting that the great vitality of our party's policy of 
economic propaganda and agitation also lies in the successful 
application of the anti-Japanese guerrilla-style propaganda and 
agitation, the article says: This is a most revolutionary one 
which makes it possible to stir the hearts of the masses by 
conducting agitprop activities with mobility any time, without 
formality and not restricted by place and condition.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The February 17 shock 
brigades of scientists and technicians dispatched to different 
sectors of the national economy of Korea have succeeded in 
important researches. 
  Last year they introduced some 700 items of the achievements 
of science and technology such as new coal-cutting method, rice 
harvester combine and developer for the electronic duplicating 
machine, thus making a sizable contribution to the development 
of the national economy and the improvement of the people's 
standard of living. 
  The scientists and technicians dispatched to the Sunchon 
District coal mining complex introduced a method of cutting coal 
layers downwards so that the coal output per cutting face could 
be raised 1.5-2 times. A coal mine under the complex produced 
an extra 210,000 tons of coal last year by introducing this 
method. 
  Those who are active at the Pyongyang thermal power complex 
resolved some 40 problems of science and technology in raising 
the combustion rate of boilers and keeping a steady rate of 
electric production to increase the annual generating capacity 
by 200 million kwh. 
  Those dispatched to the sector of light industry built a 
production process of super-plastic material, new shoe moulds 
and lasts so as to diversify the variety and increase 
productivity. 
  The February 17 shock brigades of scientists and technicians 
have solved a large number of scientific and technical problems 
of great importance to the chuche orientation, modernization and 
scientization of the national economy. Among them are 
note-worthy successes such as development of 300 kinds of micro 
and hi-fi electronic elements and NC devices, completion of the 
method of laser heating and massproduction of precision alloy 
steel and micro alloy steel. 
  They also solved many problems in such advanced science and 
technology as cell engineering, genetic engineering and 
ultracryogenics. 
  Thanks to their activities in recent years, the remote 
control and computerization of production processes have reached 
a higher stage at many industrial establishments including the 
Hwanghae iron and steel complex and the Puryong alloy steel 
complex, and many coal and ore mines nearly doubled the 
production. 
  The shock brigades, which play a big role in developing the 
national economy, were organised on February 17, 1978 by dear 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il laid down the policy of dispatching 
scientists and technicians to work sites in order to solve 
problems arising in production and actively develop new 
technologies in reliance on the collective strength of the 
producers, and took all necessary measures including the action 
programme, guidance system and supply conditions for the shock 
brigades. 
  Last year, he dispatched such shock brigades to 19 new 
important units of the national economy and provided them with 
good conditions for scientific research. 
  The shock brigades total more than 60 and involve some 8,000 
competent scientists and technicians.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- March 5 is day of 
agricultural working people in the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea. 
  With the proclamation of the historic law on agrarian reform 
in Korea on March 5, 1946, the farmers became the masters of the 
land. Korea observes this day as day of agricultural working 
people. 
  The agricultural working people are greeting this day with 
successful preparations for farming in spring to bring a bumper 
harvest this year, too. They are directing efforts to 
increasing the fertility of paddy and non-paddy fields. 
  According to data available, more compost than planned had 
been carried out to the paddy and non-paddy fields of South 
Hwanghae Province and other western areas of the country by 
March 1. 
  Carpeting fields with humus soil is in full swing. In the 
first two months of this year, 50,000 hectares of fields were 
carpeted with humus soil, taking the country as a whole. 
  Cooperative farms are making substantial preparations for 
sowing seed rice on cold-frame beds. 
  Notably, co-op farms in Sinchon and Anak Counties, South 
Hwanghae Province, Pongsan County, North Hwanghae Province, and 
Hamju County, South Hamgyong Province, had prepared windbreak 
fences, vinyl sheets and other materials for cold-frame beds by 
the end of February, earlier than the set time. 
  The rural communities in the west coast have filled 
reservoirs with water and completed the cleaning of waterways 
and checkup and repair of pumping facilities. 
  County farm machine stations and repair bases of cooperative 
farms across the country have completed the repair and 
readjustment of tractors and trailing farm machines. 
  And industrial establishments related to the agricultural 
sector are supplying farming materials and chemical fertilizers 
to cooperative farms in time.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 7 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia has 
not received any official proposal from the United Nations (UN) 
to station peacekeepers in the West Bank to protect 
Palestinians. Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said if the 
UN decided to send peacekeeping troops to the West Bank, 
Malaysia would consider participating since it already had such 
commitments in other countries. Until now, the government has 
not received any official proposal from the UN and if there is 
any it will be channelled through the UN office, he told 
reporters in the northern Penang state Sunday. 
  However, he said, the decision to send Malaysian soldiers to 
serve under the UN would be up to Defence Minister Najib Razak 
and the cabinet.

  [Excerpts] KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (AFP) -- Senior Malaysian 
ministers said Sunday they were prepared for retaliation by 
Britain for Malaysia's boycott of British firms, but warned that 
such a move would hurt bilateral ties. [passage omitted] 
  Malaysian International Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz Sunday 
warned that British firms would end up the major losers, as any 
retaliation from London would cause more unemployment in Britain. 
  "Many countries are ready to supply Malaysia's needs if 
Britain bans trade and investment in possible retaliation for 
the boycott," Rafidah was quoted by BERNAMA news agency as 
saying in northern Ipoh town. Malaysia, she said, would have no 
problem getting new foreign investments and the economy would 
not be affected. 
  "We can obtain supplies of medicines and weapons from 
countries like Switzerland, Germany, America, Russia, Japan and 
France if Britain retaliates," Rafidah said. 
  Calls have intensified for the Malaysian government to seek 
a 
full apology and sue the SUNDAY TIMES and its editor, Andrew 
Neil, for the February 20 article. 
  Ling Liong Sik, Malaysian transport minister and president 
of 
the ethnic-Chinese Malaysian Chinese Association -- a major 
partner in Mahathir's ruling coalition -- said Neil's denial 
that the article had not accused Mahathir of accepting bribes, 
was unacceptable, "ridiculous and unbelievable.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 7, (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
is prepared for any possible retaliation by Britain to its 
decision to ban British companies from new government contracts, 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Sunday. However, he 
added, it would be very unfortunate if the British government 
adopted retaliatory measures because the Malaysian action was 
not directed at the British Government. Abdullah made the 
statement after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
reportedly indicated that the British Government might take 
retaliatory measures. [passage omitted] 
  We are not hasty in our action against the allegations but 
we 
cannot allow the British media to publish baseless statements, 
he told reporters after presenting Id festival aid to poor 
people in the northern Penang state. Abdullah said Malaysian 
leaders had to defend their dignity by taking action owing to 
the allegations by influential newspapers in Britain. 
  The action by the Malaysian Government resulted from the 
attitude of the Western media which forced the country to act, 
he said. Abdullah said the government would wait and see what 
action the British Government would take in the matter. 
  Any action by the British Government should be directed at 
the media which brought about this problem between the two 
countries and should not be a retaliation against this country, 
he said. He said that if the British Government took retaliatory 
measures against Malaysia, bilateral relations would be strained 
and subsequently Britain would be the loser.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 7 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia is 
not contravening rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) by barring British firms from government contracts, 
Primary Industries Minister Dr. Lim Keng Yaik said Monday. This 
is because Malaysia is not a GATT signatory on procurement, 
which stipulates that a country opens its contracts to free 
competition, he told newsmen after the presentation of prizes 
for the sixth national furniture design competition here. 
  However, we have not slapped any trade sanction on Britain 
and the private sectors of both countries are free to trade with 
each other, he said in response to queries that a British firm 
had stopped its order of furniture from Malaysia. Asked whether 
this was a retaliation from the British company, he said, we are 
not afraid ..... We are ready to face any consequences. .. It 
looks like the British firm has succumbed to the emotional 
effect of the patronising attitude of the British press. He said 
Britain was only a small market as far as Malaysian commodities 
were concerned, adding that efforts had always been underway to 
diversify export markets of local products, meaning which the 
action of the British firm was unlikely to have any impact. 
  Dr. Lim, however, said he was compiling the list of 
commodities being sold with Britain which would be presented to 
the cabinet if the need arose for information on commodities 
traded with that country. 
  He also said that the action by the government showed 
Malaysia's daring in questioning the values that the British 
press has set, which are alien to us and which they insist we 
uphold.

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Wed.-- Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim 
said the decision not to give new contracts to British companies 
only involves government contracts and procurements and does not 
include the private sector and education. The deputy prime 
minister said the decision was reaffirmed by the cabinet at its 
meeting today. [passage omitted] 
  Anwar said the clarification was made in view of the various 
reports which appeared in the media after the announcement. 
Some ministers and agency heads had issued separate comments on 
the matter and this needed clarification, Anwar said. 
  Asked whether the cabinet today had revised the decision, 
Anwar said that there was no reason to revise it right now. He 
said: "The cabinet at its weekly meeting today reaffirmed its 
decision made last week to cease awarding new contracts to 
British companies. [passage omitted] 
  "We would like to state that the British Government aid -- 
both in the form of grants and concessionary loans -- are meant 
to subsidise British companies to make their bids more 
competitive. In the case of the Pergau Dam (hydroelectric 
project), no grant was involved but only concessionary loan for 
the purchase of equipment sourced from the UK. 
  "Our relations with the British Government is not affected. 
Let me state that the dispute was also not about press freedom. 
But press freedom is certainly not a licence to fabricate lies. 
We are not in the habit of sending journalists to jail as 
charged by one of the British newspapers. 
  "It is also amazing that the SUNDAY TIMES, London, could 
publish a report alleging the Malaysian Prime Minister taking a 
U.S. $50,000 (RM [Malaysian ringgit] 135,000) bribe from Whimpey 
International for a project that is non-existent. 
  "The violent reactions of some sections of the British media 
to our action since the past few days are, indeed, revealing. 
It is not only ignorance about this country that still abounds, 
but some even resorted to comments with racist undertones. They 
confirmed our worst suspicion. Thus, good sense and pragmatism 
prompt us to deal with firms from countries that treat us with 
fairness, respect, and as equal," he said. 
  Asked to cite specific examples of the racist undertones 
which he felt was seen in the British media, Anwar said there 
have been allegations that Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed was anti-colonial and that he was said to be unhappy for 
not getting a scholarship to study law in the United Kingdom. 
[passage omitted] 
  Anwar said that doubts were also raised as to whether the 
deputy prime minister was able to conduct a press conference in 
English considering that English was not his first language. 
  Asked whether he was aware of possible retaliation from the 
British, Anwar said that there had been no indication whatsoever 
of this possibility, adding that the problem was not with the 
British Government. He said: "As I have reiterated, our problem 
is not with the British Government, but with some sections of 
the British media, particularly those controlled by (Rupert) 
Murdoch." [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the cabinet had decided which company would 
take over the job of building the Kuala Lumpur International 
Airport in Sepang since the Anglo-Japanese consortium's contract 
has been terminated, Anwar said this had not been decided yet. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the government decision would affect 
educational linkage between the two countries, Anwar said the 
government had no objections to the programmes conducted by the 
private colleges. 
  For instance, if MARA [Council of Trust for the Indigenous 
People] has plans to send 1,000 student to Britain, they must 
continue to do so, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Super-Charged To The Brink"] </F>
  [Text] PREDICTABLY, the United States has reintroduced the 
Super 301 trade law which will enable it to punish those trading 
partners that it claims obstruct unfairly the sale of US 
products in their markets. The decision, announced on Thursday 
by Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, is aimed primarily at 
cutting Japan's huge trade surplus with the US. This is not the 
first time that Washington has decided to threaten sanctions to 
extract concessions from Tokyo. In 1989, it used the same law 
against Japan to boost its exports in wood products, satellites 
and super-computers. Presumably, the US believes that it can 
prevail again without having to act on its threat of 
retaliation. Under-Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten has 
said that Washington will be aggressive in seeking to increase 
its exports and open up the markets of its principal trading 
partners. Commercial interests, he added, had never been so 
important as they are now to US foreign policy. 
  Granted, Japan has been slow in taking steps to give foreign 
competitors a fair chance in its market. This has caused 
growing frustration in the US, which ran a trade deficit of 
US$60 billion with that country last year. But reviving Super 
301 is a retrogressive step. As the secretary general of Gatt, 
Mr Peter Sutherland, remarked, it is misguided and dangerous. 
Instead of acting unilaterally, which will make the US open to 
charges of unfairness, Washington should be settling its 
disputes through multilateral mechanisms under Gatt. 
Unilateralism also violates the agreement reached at the 
Uruguay Round of trade talks last December. If it is applied to 
Japan, it can also be directed at other trading partners with 
which the US has trade friction. If this happens, it will 
undermine free trade, which must be preserved at all costs. 
  Super 301 is perhaps meant to pressure Japan ahead of the 
market- opening measures it has promised to announce soon. But 
by resorting to it, Washington is taking the obvious risk of 
having to carry out its threat of sanctions if Tokyo fails to 
make an offer that it considers acceptable. Even if it 
retaliates selectively under that law, this will do considerable 
harm to both sides at a time of economic slowdown. It will also 
weaken their political and strategic ties, which are essential 
for the stability of the Asia- Pacific region. Handling their 
disputes outside multilateral forums also means that the 
situation could get out of control since they are democracies 
and, thus, vulnerable to domestic pressure groups and public 
sentiment. 
  Fortunately, the procedures under Super 301 are such that it 
could take more than a year before Washington can activate 
punitive measures after it has blacklisted what it considers 
offending partners. There is no imminent danger of trade 
retaliation. But the issue must be resolved at the earliest to 
prevent tension from building up to a dangerous level. It is 
reassuring that President Bill Clinton wants to avoid sanctions, 
which he conveyed to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on the 
telephone before the law was announced. He has, nevertheless, 
put the ball in Japan's court without waiting for Tokyo to make 
its new offer. 
  Thus far, Japan has been indecisive in responding to US 
calls 
for greater market access. Rifts within the ruling coalition 
have sapped its ability to govern effectively. Mr Hosokawa's 
failure to reshuffle his divided Cabinet raises the question 
whether he can act firmly to defuse tension with the US. He and 
his coalition partners must heed the lead that has come from the 
private sector. Toyota plans to import US car parts to observe 
a voluntary target of US$6 billion in 1996. Other Japanese car 
manufacturers are also expected to be forthcoming. But it is 
imperative that the US does not make patently unfair demands, 
such as managed trade, now that it has revived Super 301. As 
the world's pre-eminent economic power, it must act responsibly.

  [Text] Singapore will keep spending 6 percent of its gross 
domestic product on defence, despite a global downturn in 
military spending, says Defence Minister Yeo Ning Hong. "I do 
not foresee a reduction in future," he told Asia Airlines and 
Aerospace, a new trade magazine based in Kuala Lumpur. 
  Since soon after independence in 1965, Singapore had spent 6 
percent of GDP on defence every year to "compensate for its 
limited manpower and small economy", Dr Yeo said. "We consider 
our defence expenditure as an investment for peace and security. 
Maintaining a high level of preparedness and operational 
readiness is essential to the stability and strength of our 
nation and enhances our attractiveness for investment and 
business." 
  Dr Yeo also said that Singapore would not rule out buying 
Russian arms, which have been marketed only recently. While 
Singapore knew little about Russian weapons, there could be some 
systems that could meet the Singapore Armed Forces' [SAF] needs, 
he said. "Singapore is prepared, where feasible, to explore 
non-traditional arms suppliers, including the Russian defence 
industries," Dr Yeo said. "This will increase the range of 
advanced systems available for consideration by the SAF." 
  Dr Yeo also said that Singapore would do its part to help 
uphold international law and order. "In line with this, the SAF 
will continue to participate in UN-led international 
operations." But he said that due to manpower constraints, 
Singapore's contribution would always be limited.

  [Text] The United States has decided to reinstate the Super 
301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act 
(which identifies nations engaging in unfair trade practices and 
imposes sanctions on them). Economic leaders have voiced their 
strong dissatisfaction. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan; Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Osamu Uno, chairman of the 
Kansai Economic Federation each said: "This apparently runs 
counter to the spirit of GATT." 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives, said: "This runs counter to the spirit of free 
trade." 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers' Association, said the leaders also expressed concern 
that such action "will be dangerous to relations between Japan 
and the United States," and noted the need to quickly improve 
relations between the two. 
  As far as countermeasures are concerned, Mr. Hiraiwa said 
some economic leaders hoped the United States "will take action 
cool-headedly. 
  Mr. Nagano said others stressed the need for Japan to work 
out concrete measures to reduce its trade surplus, saying: 
"Japan should throw the ball back to the United States soon." 
  Mr. Hiraiwa stressed: "Japan needs to expand domestic demand 
and implement clear and quick action on deregulation and 
promoting market opening." 
  Mr. Hayami said: "Japan's efforts must address two issues: 
First reducing the current account surplus, second narrowing the 
disparity between domestic and overseas prices." He called on 
the government to promote such measures as a target for reducing 
the current account surplus which is linked to the gross 
domestic product (GDP). 
  There was also the feeling that private companies should try 
to improve relations with the United States. 
  Mr. Inaba said one of the suggestions was for "Japan and the 
United States to hold industry-to-industry consultations in 
controversial areas of trade. 
  Mr. Hayami said others saw the need for the private sector 
to 
make additional efforts to voluntarily increase imports through 
international procurement and improved distribution and 
transaction practices." 
  Mr. Uno said that leaders were critical, however, of 
attempts 
to set numerical targets in the microeconomy, saying: "Methods 
like managed trade should be eliminated."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Keep an Eye on the Real Substance of Trade </F>
Friction"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government has decided to issue a 
presidential decree to reinstate the Super 301 provision of the 
1988 Omnibus Trade Bill (which defines the unfair trade 
practices of specific nations and stipulates sanctions against 
them). This was no surprise for Japan, but we are concerned 
about the U.S. decision. 
  However, Japan must have an eye on the real substance of the 
bilateral trade imbalance. From here Japan may do nothing, or 
engage in an anti-U.S. trade war by taking action to counter the 
Super 301 provision. If Japan were, however, to take either of 
these courses of action, it would damage its national interests. 
  As a matter of fact, the U.S. decision conflicts with GATT's 
principle of "multilateralism." Even the European Union (EU) is 
questioning the U.S. decision. But this does not justify 
Japan's current attitude toward the trade imbalance issue. 
  The nature of the trade imbalance has substantially changed. 
We must pay attention to the following points: 
  1) Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world 
currently 
amounts to $100 billion per year, and this is too much trading 
profit for one nation. So the problem is rather more than 
simply the $60-billion trade imbalance with the United States. 
  2) Unlike the economic background to the 1985 Plaza 
agreement, Germany now has a deficit trade balance and Japan is 
the only country producing a huge trade surplus today. 
  3) Following the conclusion of the Cold War, the United 
States is reviewing the significance of the Japan-U.S. alliance. 
Not only the United States, but many other countries are 
beginning to consider economic issues are as critical as 
security affairs. While economic frictions used be settled more 
easily under the pretext of "the need for a healthy alliance" to 
cope with the Cold War, this is no longer true. 
  The Clinton Administration is the United States' first 
post-Cold War administration, and its Japan policy is obviously 
different from those of preceding U.S. Administrations. It 
appears Japan is too dependent on the alliance of the Cold War 
era. 
  In fact, the unilateral actions of the United States raise 
some questions. The U.S. demand for "numerical targets," for 
example, does not look reasonable. However, to neglect the U.S. 
demand is to remain idle despite the seriousness of the 
situation. 
  Japan's idle attitude toward the trade issue may result in 
further appreciation of the yen rate. Even if the United States 
imposes economic sanctions against Japan according to the Super 
301 provision, they will not redress the trade imbalance between 
the two nations. After all, the huge trade surplus and the high 
level of the yen rate will remain unchanged until Japan takes 
action. 
  If Japan makes antagonistic counter moves against the United 
States, it would be as good as declaring a "trade war." At 
least, that would be the reaction of the market. If the market 
views Japan's countermoves as the nation's "resolve to stick to 
idleness," it will be the market that takes over readjustment of 
Japan-U.S. relations. If that happens, the foreign exchange 
market would be driven into confusion, and Japan would be 
isolated on the international political scene. Neither 
idleness, therefore, nor countermoves should be Japan's response. 
  It may be possible for Japan to file a complaint to GATT 
against the unilateral action taken by the United States. Yet, 
taking into account how Japan's trade surplus affects the world 
economy, such a complaint would never be justified by Japan's 
current trade policy. 
  Fortunately, the United States has decided to prepare 
several 
months for negotiations on whether or not sanctions should be 
imposed. As a trump card, the Super 301 provision will be 
played slowly, but in earnest.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 4 March Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference following a cabinet meeting on 
4 March, Transport Minister Shigeru Ito said: "I am opposed to 
setting microeconomic numerical targets, which could lead to 
managed trade. However, setting macroeconomic numerical targets 
is acceptable." 
  He then proposed that as a specific numerical target, the 
government set itself the task of reducing Japan's current 
account surplus to about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product 
(the government proposes a figure of 2.8 percent in its economic 
outlook for fiscal 1994). 
  At the same news conference, Manae Kubota, director general 
of the Economic Planning Agency, touched on the government's 
430-trillion yen public investment plan, saying: "The 
government should consider reviewing the plan, including 
increasing that amount." 
  Her comments were a call for Japan to reduce its surplus by 
strengthening domestic demand.

said negotiations on the cellular phone issue -- one of the 
major areas of trade dispute between Japan and the United States 
-- could be nearing a conclusion. 
  He said: "Japanese and U.S. companies are talking to each 
other actively and in depth; I would like to think we may soon 
get some results from these talks." 
  He was asked if he thought a settlement would be possible by 
17 March, the date on which the United States says it will 
announce a list of sanctions measures against Japan. 
  He said: "I don't know," but ended on a note of cautious 
optimism by saying the 17 March deadline could well prove to be 
"a turning point" in the negotiations.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President 
Clinton held a telephone conversation only through an 
interpreter from the U.S. side in the early morning of 4 March 
because a Japanese interpreter from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs [MOFA] was unable to be present at the conversation due 
to the U.S. failure to give advance notice. This has been 
revealed by officials concerned. 
  President Clinton gave a call to the prime minister's 
official residence just before 0100 on 4 March, Japan time. It 
has been reported that because the phone call was made without 
advance notice, the prime minister had no time to contact MOFA 
officials, and he talked with the President for about 10 minutes 
only through a U.S. interpreter. Later, the prime minister 
informed the MOFA of the telephone conversation. However, the 
incident has left a diplomatic problem in that no one but the 
prime minister knows details of the conversation. 
  It is usual that when the prime minister holds a telephone 
conversation with a foreign leader the time and topics are 
coordinated in advance and the MOFA officials, as well as 
interpreters from both sides, are present at the conversation. 
This is because telephone conversation between state leaders 
are none other than diplomatic negotiations. 
  In the past, the United States made sudden telephone calls 
to 
then Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa. But, 
the recent call was especially exceptional because it was made 
early in the morning. There is speculation that President 
Clinton "made the telephone call in the early hours" 
intentionally because of his distrust of Japanese bureaucrats.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "U.S. Trade Representative Kantor </F>
Causes Laughter Trying To Cover His Inferior Experience by His 
Uncompromising Attitude"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. relations have been continuously 
aggravated since the Japan-U.S. summit was broken off. Many 
people think that the aggravation is attributable to U.S. Trade 
Representative Kantor's excessively uncompromising attitude. 
  To tell the truth, Kantor does not have any experience at 
all 
in dealing with commercial problems. Since one year ago when he 
assumed the present post, his capability has been considered 
questionable in the United States as well as in Japan. And 
people think that, to cover his inferior experience, he has 
absurdly maintained the uncompromising attitude toward Japan. 
  In fact, Kantor's attitude was excessively uncompromising in 
the process of the recent Japan-U.S. economic talks being broken 
off. A sign of compromise was seen between the secretariats of 
Japan and the United States with the Japan-U.S. summit close at 
hand. A consensus was being formed to the effect that, taking 
Japan's standpoint into consideration, the United States would 
make a concession concerning the numerical targets and others 
based on the agreement reached at the Japan-U.S. summit held in 
July last year. It was literally a final stage as "the wording 
of the agreement to be announced was being reviewed" (informed 
sources). It was Kantor who spoiled the agreement with his 
"voice of authority." Then, he tried to settle the issue by 
presenting the numerical targets at a direct talk with Foreign 
Minister Hata. 
  "At this point, the repulsion of the Japanese Government 
officials reached its peak" (informed sources in Washington). 
Presently, his understanding of the commercial problems lying 
between Japan and the United States is beginning to be 
questioned even in Washington. For example, in February this 
year, at a dinner table with reporters, Kantor referred to the 
fact that U.S.-made cars were not selling in Japan, and strongly 
accused the exclusive nature of the Japanese market. However, 
it is a well-known fact, even to American people who have some 
knowledge of the situation, that the big three makers had been 
neglecting their efforts to promote sales. Reportedly, Kantor 
caused laughter among the reporters because of his total 
ignorance of this fact. 
  While being such a person, he still maintains strong enough 
power to speak within the government, and is even supposed to be 
"the closest person to the president." At the back of this firm 
Clinton-Kantor line, there lies the fact that President Clinton 
himself maintains a revisionist idea toward Japan. In other 
words, he thinks it natural to exert strong pressure on Japan, 
and all the persons around him are making good impressions on 
him by maintaining an uncompromising attitude against Japan. A 
journalist in the United States points out: 
  "It is true that, in the past, there have been people among 
the high-ranking government officials who appeared to have been 
influenced by revisionists. However, right now, both Kantor and 
Secretary of State Christopher are giving the impression that 
they themselves are literally revisionists". 
  Kantor covers his ignorance about the commercial problems by 
bashing Japan, and has now raised himself to the No. 2 post of 
the U.S. Government as his attitude is completely in line with 
the revisionist concept of President Clinton. No doubt, he is 
going to be a person who would make future Japan-U.S. relations 
more and more gloomy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fuji Xerox Chairman Yotaro Kobayashi by </F>
editorial staff Hiroshi Nakajima; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Nakajima] At the time the U.S.-Japan framework 
talks broke down, you were in Washington D.C. as the deputy head 
of the Japanese delegation to the U.S.-Japan Business Council. 
What do you think was the cause of the breakdown? 
<H5>  A Gap Between Supply and Demand </H5>
  [Kobayashi] I think it was the fact that the Japanese side 
did not fully understand what President Clinton wanted. The 
political reality which surrounds President Clinton is severe. 
President Clinton defeated President Bush by criticizing his 
weak policy toward Japan. Against this background, he had to 
get visible results from Japan. 
  They may have been too optimistic in reading the situation, 
assuming that "even if things were not satisfactory, he would 
not corner Mr. Hosokawa," because they thought the president 
felt favorably toward Mr. Hosokawa. Of course, on the Japanese 
side there was the political reality surrounding Mr. Hosokawa 
and the fact he could not fully respond to President Clinton's 
demands. There was a gap between supply and demand. 
  [Nakajima] What was it that President Clinton wanted that 
the Japanese side did not fully understand? 
  [Kobayashi] He was looking for a macropolicy which would 
make a strong impression, such as an increase in domestic 
demand, measures to buoy up business conditions, and so on. The 
president said clearly at the news conference that he did not 
seek numerical targets. 
  [Nakajima] The Japanese side maintains that the talks broke 
down because of numerical targets. 
  [Kobayashi] President Clinton said he was not seeking 
numerical targets, but objective standards by which market 
opening could be judged. He even declared that he would not use 
the semiconductor agreement as a model. Numerical targets are a 
sectoral issue. The effect individual sectoral targets have on 
the overall problem is not significant. We must attack the 
trade issue with a 70-80 percent macroeconomic policy. 
  Why did we have the framework talks to begin with? The 
U.S.-Japan Structural Impediment Initiative was a similar case: 
It derived from the worry that we had to do something to deal 
with U.S. feelings that the Japanese market was closed. 
Individual industries are a problem; but above all else the 
issue is a macroeconomic one. Macroeconomic measures can be 
effective, hence a selling point in the proposals. But in 
Japan's proposals, there was nothing that could be called 
macroeconomic measures. But in the Japanese proposal, there was 
nothing you could describe as good macropolicy. 
  [Nakajima] What is your feeling about the reaction of the 
American business sector? 
<H5>  Microeconomy Was Sacrificed </H5>
  [Kobayashi] They see that something has to be done about the 
stark reality of the huge Japanese trade surplus. This is a 
worldwide problem. But each industry has a different view of 
individual retaliatory measures. It is not a situation in which 
one industry stirs up another by saying "go after them, go after 
them." We have to take it case by case. It is not going to be 
all-out war. 
  But there were also those who said although 95 percent of 
the 
U.S. businessmen present were Republican supporters, they would 
support the current president's policy 100 percent. It was not 
Japan-bashing. They realized that unless the U.S. Government 
followed a moderate and balanced policy, it would be the United 
States which would get hurt. Nonetheless, the proposals Japan 
brought to Washington were not well received. 
  [Nakajima] What about the view that the reason the talks 
broke down was because the U.S.-Japan relationship has matured? 
  [Kobayashi] I don't think we should attach that much meaning 
to them. It was President Clinton who first said no. He said 
no because he could not evaluate our macroeconomic policy. I 
understand that they had arrived at the stage where there was 
partial agreement on some individual sectors. They had 
approached a workable stage on insurance, for example, but in 
the end the talks broke down because there was no macroeconomic 
policy to follow and an agreement on insurance was sacrificed as 
a result. As far as the microeconomy is concerned, there is 
still room to achieve results by continuing the negotiations. 
  [Nakajima] What do you think must be done to satisfy U.S. 
requirements on macroeconomic policy? 
  There Is No `Worst Case Situation' 
  [Kobayashi] For the expansion of domestic demand and an 
upturn in economic conditions, we need something more than a 
policy which is good for one year, we need something which will 
take us into the future. A tax cut which lasts for only one 
year will not satisfy the United States, even if it was 
acceptable in Japan. Deregulation is also necessary. I do not 
mean to follow the lead of President Clinton, but the attitudes 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the 
Ministry of Finance are also a problem. 
  The microeconomy should not stop at the war of rhetoric, but 
make actual progress, but the macroeconomic policy is the issue 
on which everything is at stake. The United States will lose 
patience if our reaction is simply to say that the talks broke 
down because the United States demanded numerical targets, and 
that the United States wants a managed trade system and Japan 
opposes them because it is pursuing a free trade policy. 
  In the private sector there is enough ground for individual 
industries to make good progress. I think it is better to leave 
the industrial issues to the private sector. What the Japanese 
side worries about is that even efforts toward industry-based 
targets can be construed as a government promise. However, the 
highest authority in the United States, President Clinton 
himself, has said very clearly that he will not use the 
semiconductor agreement as a standard. I think we should 
believe him. 
  [Nakajima] What do people in the United States think about 
the way Motorola gets the government to take action? 
  [Kobayashi] Most consider Motorola an exceptional case. But 
since there is no other good precedent, when it comes to a case 
study, Motorola is used. However, there are also those who say 
the Motorola method is not a good one, and that the government 
should refrain from giving special support to a specific 
enterprise. 
  [Nakajima] There is a pessimistic line of argument that says 
that U.S.-Japanese relations are following a dangerous course if 
events continue the way they are at the moment. 
  [Kobayashi] I do not think relations will degenerate as far 
as some believe, there is no merit in that for either side. The 
key will be how much of a positive contribution the Japanese 
side can offer to deal with the political reality that President 
Clinton is confronting. Depending on the degree of that 
contribution, will be the point at which the United States 
lowers the fist it has raised.

  [Text] In the wake of the recent Japan-U.S. summit 
breakdown over new economic cosultations, ASAHI SHIMBUN 
conducted a nation-wide opinion survey 27-28 February to 
determine what the public thought of Japan-U.S. relations. The 
results of the survey show those who thought current Japan-U.S. 
relations as "going well" plunged to 20 percent from 37 percent 
only two months ago. Those who thought the relations are "not 
going well" rose sharply to 64 percent from 42 percent, thus 
giving the worst evaluation on the relations since 1982 when the 
first such survey was conducted. 
  Views on the future of the Japan-U.S. relations have also 
become more pessimistic. Only 16 percent of the pollees said 
they thought the relations would "go in a favorable direction," 
and this percentage is way below the 26 percent in the previous 
poll which was also the highest in the history of this survey. 
On the other hand, views given on the position of the Japanese 
Government which rejected the U.S. demands at the summit, broke 
down to 20 percent saying "it was only natural," 57 percent 
saying "it was unavoidable," and 12 percent saying "it was well 
done." 
  After the new economic consultations broke down, the United 
States stepped up its offensive against Japan, for instance, by 
charging that Japan's cellular phone market is closed. As if 
reacting to such a U.S. move, those who thought "the current 
Japan-U.S. relations to not be going well" far surpassed the 
previous highest rate of 47 percent shown at the time of the 
survey in December 1992, thus suggesting that the public views 
the situation as serious. 
  The percentage of those who gave positve views on the 
relations as "going well" dropped substantially, in particular 
among people over 50. Broken down by occupation, more white 
collar workers and those in the farming, forestry and fisheries 
industries were found to be departing from their earlier 
positive views. Broken down by political party background, 
those who have turned pessimstic were conspicuous among 
supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], the Democratic Socialist Party and Shinto 
Sakigake [Harbinger Party]. 
  On the outlook for future Japan-U.S. relations, 23 percent 
said they thought relations will "head in a bad direction, and 
51 percent said they thought "there will be no change." This 23 
percent predicting a" bad direction" is comparable to the record 
worst 24 percent shown in the December 1992 survey which was 
conducted shortly after Bill Clinton was elected President. 
  More older people and men thought the Japanese Government's 
position at the new economic consultations was "natural" than 
did younger people and women. Twenty-five percent of male 
respondents against 16 percent of female respondents said they 
agreed with the government's position.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hisashi Owada, Japan's new ambassador to the </F>
United Nations, by SANKEI SHIMBUN Editorial Board member Hiroaki 
Saeki; place and date not given -- first paragraph is SANKEI 
SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] In an interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN Editorial Board 
member Hiroaki Saeki, Hisashi Owada, who has assumed the post of 
Japan's ambassador to the United Nations, has spoken about his 
views on the reorganization of the United Nations and Japan's 
bid for a permanent membership in the UN Security Council. 
  [Saeki] Would you describe your aspirations upon assuming 
the 
post of Japan's ambassador to the United Nations? 
  [Owada] The world is searching for a new order following the 
collapse of the Cold War structure. I want to think seriously 
about how the United Nations will be able to return to its 
spirit and role at the time of its founding and how it will 
transform itself into an effective international organization 
that safeguards world peace and safety. 
  [Saeki] What do you think of reorganizing the United Nations 
and of Japan's bid for a permanent membership in the UN Security 
Council? 
  [Owada] It is necessary to strengthen the United Nations. A 
new world order should be an order under which major powers 
cooperate with each other. Japan has a great role to play. The 
UN Security Council is the most important body. It is important 
for UN member nations to use the UN Security Council while 
fulfilling their responsibilities. 
  [Saeki] It is said that Japan's personnel contributions are 
small compared to its financial contributions. What do you think? 
  [Owada] Japan's financial contributions must neither be 
downplayed nor be regarded as a wrong course. I do not mean that 
it is enough only if Japan makes financial contributions. It is 
important for Japan to cooperate multilaterally with the United 
Nations. 
  [Saeki] Like Japan, Germany intends to join the UN Security 
Council as a permanent member while indicating its resolve to 
fulfill its responsibility as a permanent member like other UN 
Security Council members. What do you think? 
  [Owada] Generally speaking, I believe Japan intends to join 
the UN Security Council with the same resolve as Germany. Japan 
is greatly expected to fulfill its responsibility as a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council for world peace and prosperity. 
  [Saeki] Should Japan not participate in the UN Peacekeeping 
Force (PKF), as well as the PKO [peacekeeping opeations)? 
  [Owada] I think that the PKO has the original mission of 
ensuring peace. It is important for Japan to fully cooperate 
with the PKO, as well as the PKF. 
  [Saeki] How do you see Japan-U.S. relations? 
  [Owada] The American society is faced with major problems. 
President Clinton pledged to reconstruct and change the United 
States when he took office, but he thinks of reconstructing the 
U.S. economy as the most important mission of his 
administration. It is important for Japan to respond with 
sincerity to the President's efforts. 
  [Saeki] Professor (Kurchis) at the University of Columbia 
has 
said: "It is important for Japan to open its market before 
joining the UN Security Council as a permanent member and making 
its contributions to tackling the global environmental problems." 
  [Owada] What is important is whether Japan intends to do 
something useful for the international community. Economic 
contributions do not mean manufacturing goods. What is important 
is that Japan's economic contributions must serve to make its 
economy cooperate closely with economies of other nations to 
generate affluence.

  [Text] The contents of a draft report the government plans 
to submit at the UN "International Conference on Population and 
Development" (ICPD), which is to be held this September in 
Cairo, was revealed on 1 March. In the report, the government 
touches on such issues as population trends and reduced birth 
rates. Regarding environmental hazards brought about by 
population growth concentrated in particular regions, the 
government concludes that "A high standard of education has 
enabled the nation to overcome such problems rather quickly." 
However, the government completely fails to touch on 
environmental issues which large cities face, such as huge 
amounts of garbage and air pollution. This stance is expected 
to cause a stir, inasmuch as the main theme of the Cairo 
conference includes "population, development, and environment." 
  The government's draft report consists of 17 pages of text 
divided into four major sections: 1) population trends and 
future outlook; 2) current situation regarding government 
policies related to population trends; 3) international 
cooperation regarding population issues; and 4) summary and 
conclusion. Seven sets of graphical data, such as that showing 
trends in average lifespans, are also included in the draft 
report. 
  Regarding problems resulting from population movements 
within 
the nation, the government, in the report, refers to the cases 
of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto as examples. It points out that in 
these cities, "the population began growing in the 1960's due to 
the development of heavy chemical industries and the urban 
living environment rapidly deteriorated." It adds that the 
nation "was able to proceed with economic development in harmony 
with environmental preservation, after succeeding in overcoming 
population, developmental, and environmental crises rather 
quickly through public support and government efforts." 
  In the report, the government contends that the nation was 
able to overcome such crises due to "an especially high standard 
of education." It adds that "putting emphasis on education and 
the government's effective use of information play an invaluable 
role in international efforts to help developing countries with 
their population problems." 
  In Tokyo and other major cities, the problem of securing 
garbage disposal sites has become very serious. Nitrogen oxide 
emissions accompanying the sharp increase in automobile traffic 
have led to air pollution. The government fails to take up 
these issues in its draft report. In this regard, an official 
of the Health and Welfare Ministry explained: "It is impossible 
to cover all population- related issues, and there is also a 
limit to the report's length." 
  However, greater interest has been shown in developing 
countries concerning air pollution and garbage issues because 
recently, the environment has been deteriorating in these 
countries due to a rapidly growing population concentrated in 
cities.

  [Text] Out of the $2.9 billion in export insurance which 
the government set aside for Russia, approximately $1.8 billion 
remains unused. This is because there are few profitable 
projects in Russia due to political unrest and inflation, and 
because the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
is reluctant to insure exports to Russia. Although the 
industrialized nations launched their aid plans for Russia with 
a flourish, in actuality, the plans have produced almost no 
results. 
  Japan decided to contribute $2.5 billion in emergency aid to 
the former Soviet Union in October 1991. It also pledged $1.1 
billion in aid to Russia at a G-7 meeting of foreign and finance 
ministers in April 1993. The first aid plan includes $1.8 
billion for export insurance and the second plan $1.1 billion, 
totaling $2.9 billion for export insurance. However, among 
this, only $1.1 billion has been used, including $700 million 
paid against events related to the export of steel pipes to 
Russian natural gas companies. 
  The subject of the insurance is limited to energy 
development, such as developing and refining oil and gas 
supplies, to help Russia build up a system in which it can 
acquire foreign currency by producing and exporting oil and gas, 
which are the country's major resources. 
  However, because Russia's internal structure has not yet 
been 
strengthened, no specific energy development projects have been 
drawn up. According to MITI, business talks between Mitsui &amp; 
Company and Luk Oil (in Moscow) [name as published] over the 
export of oil well pipes have been stalled, and thus are not 
subject to the export insurance. 
  MITI exercises prudence when it comes to paying insurance 
money. It has made a strict rule that events insured against are 
not subject to export insurance if they occur as a result of 
business failures on the part of Russia. Beginning this year, 
unpaid export charges from the former Soviet Union have become 
subject to export insurance, and MITI has begun to pay insurance 
against some unpaid charges. Because the amount of insurance 
money MITI will pay against events related to exports to Russia 
is likely to reach 70 billion yen during the current fiscal 
year, MITI has no choice but to be cautious about paying 
insurance. A source at a trading firm said: "Although MITI has 
decided on the amount of the export insurance, it has no 
intention of paying it." 
  The export insurance is not applied to a nation which fails 
to pay export charges. However, Japan set up the export 
insurance for Russia when the United States and Germany launched 
their aid plans and strongly requested Japan follow suit. A 
source at a trading firm who is critical of the government, 
said: "This is a good example of failure in Tokyo's policy of 
following in the footsteps of the United States."

<F P=106> [Speech by Small Firms Minister Lord Strathclyde at a </F>
special seminar in Nagoya, Japan on 3 March: "Japanese Investors 
Warmly Welcomed in the UK Says Lord Strathclyde"] 
  [Text] Japanese investors should be in no doubt about the 
warmth of their welcome in the UK, Small Firms Minister Lord 
Strathclyde emphasised today during a five day trip to Japan. 
  He was speaking to 150 top Japanese businessmen at a special 
seminar in Nagoya, organised by the Invest in Britain Bureau of 
the Department of Trade and Industry, during which he also 
announced the future opening of a British Government Office 
there. 
  He Said: [subhead] 
  "I would like to reaffirm that the British Government 
extends 
a positively unambiguous welcome to investment from Japan. Our 
approach is that all companies based in Britain are treated as 
UK enterprises whose interests within the EC we seek to promote 
and develop. 
  "I am particularly proud that over 40 per cent of all 
Japanese investment in the EC has come to the UK." 
  Lord Strathclyde added that it was not just investment in 
manufacturing which Britain welcomed, but investment in 
research, development and design as well. 
  "We are confident that our scientific skills and facilities 
for scientific research offer Japanese companies the best 
possible European base for research, development and design 
activities. 
  "I believe that Britain is the most positive and 
forward-looking of all Japan's trading partners. 
  "We each have something to give the other. We continue to 
learn from you about management efficiency and technological 
achievement. We appreciate and value the cultural, as well as 
the economic, contribution to British life made by Japanese 
companies investing in Britain. 
  "We offer in return a country firmly committed to remaining 
at the heart of Europe; we offer political stability; and a 
highly skilled and adaptable labour force ready and willing to 
learn new skills." 
  The new British Government office will open in Nagoya to 
promote trade and investment between the Chubu region of Japan 
and the UK. 
  During his trip to Japan Lord Strathclyde also visited 
several Japanese companies including the Toyota Motor 
Corporation, Matsushita Electric Works Ltd, and Koyo Seiko Co. 
He will also spend three days in Taiwan where he will meet the 
Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance and speak at other 
investment seminars.

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] considers Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's decision on the evening of 2 March 
to abandon his plan to reshuffle the cabinet a natural move. In 
view of the impending Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994 
draft budget, LDP President Yohei Kono asserted: "It is not the 
right time to be reshuffling the cabinet. Is it not necessary 
instead to do something for the people who are having problems 
in their everyday lives?" 
  However, the LDP questions Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
leadership, because the prime minister abandoned his plan due to 
opposition within the ruling coalition alliance, despite his 
initial determination. Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP 
Diet Affairs Committee, said: "This indicates the Prime 
Minister's Office, which is the heart of the government, is not 
functioning at all." 
  Regarding Hosokawa's carrying out his administrative duties 
in the future, a senior LDP official said: "The ruling coalition 
alliance has completely split in two, and there is an internal 
rift in the Prime Minister's Office as Prime Minister Hosokawa 
and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura remain at odds. 
As such circumstances have surfaced, the prime minister has 
lost his prestige to a considerable degree." 
  The LDP predicts the prime minister will now face many more 
difficulties than in the past. For example, LDP Secretary 
General Yoshiro Mori said: "Since so much confusion has been 
generated, there are bound to be some consequences." 
  In the series of developments over the cabinet reshuffle 
issue, however, there also are moves within the LDP in response 
to the split in the ruling coalition alliance. Such moves have 
emerged mainly among junior party members. For example, it has 
been revealed that Prime Minister Hosokawa and Michio Watanabe, 
former LDP vice president and foreign minister, held a secret 
meeting. Since such moves could very well trigger a further 
split in the LDP, party President Kono and other party 
executives plan to pull the party together more firmly by 
hammering out an offensive strategy against the Hosokawa 
administration in Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994 
draft budget and on other occasions. 
  Meanwhile Kazuo Shii, secretary general of the Japan 
Communist Party, criticized the ruling coalition parties, 
saying: "The ruling coalition parties are engaged in an ugly 
power struggle, merely in speculation over a political 
realignment and election strategies in which the public is 
ignored. Neither those who want to reshuffle the cabinet nor 
those who are opposed to it have any good reasons."

  [Text] Bureaucrats in Kasumigaseki [bureaucratic center of 
Japan] are talking about a "crisis of the Hosokawa 
administration in late March." The Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] has decided not to cooperate in dealing with "higire" 
bills [bills with a time limit] that need to be enacted by the 
end of this fiscal year, including bills related to the 
implementation of income and residential tax reduction. 
Therefore, officials of government ministries and agencies, 
such as Ministry of Finance [MOF], have come to show strong 
concern over the possibility of great turmoil in the political 
situation at the end of this month. 
  The alarm was sounded for MOF officials on the night of 3 
March. While senior officials of other bureaus hurried home, 
senior Tax Bureau officials, led by Bureau Director General 
Tadashi Ogawa, continued with their discussions. The income tax 
cut will start to be enforced by refunding withheld taxes when 
summer bonuses are paid in June. Officials concerned had 
started to lay the groundwork for enacting a bill of ad hoc 
measures on the tax cuts by late March so that there would be 
enough time to prepare for implementation. However, they were 
ordered to "stop" doing so. 
  There are various special ad hoc measures on taxes that will 
expire at the end of the fiscal year. At the end of March, the 
Diet usually approves various "higire bills" aimed at keeping 
those ad hoc measures effective. The Ministry of Home Affairs, 
which will be forced to handle complicated paper work in 
connection with the enforcement of the residential tax cut, as 
well as the MOF, planned to work out an amendment to the Local 
Taxes Act in a form of a "higire" bill. 
  However, the LDP decided on the evening of 4 March to 
completely review all these "higire bills," the bills related to 
the tax reduction in particular, which are usually enacted in a 
short time. 
  With regard to the enforcement of tax cuts, there was a case 
that bills related to "tax refunds" were enacted in early May 
and the tax cut was enforced on 1 June in fiscal 1977. However, 
local governments which actually handle the residential tax 
processing strongly urge: "Bills should be enacted as soon as 
possible, otherwise it will be difficult for us to handle the 
paper work." Local bodies concerned, including the National 
Governors Association, will probably start making appeals to 
this end to the government and the ruling parties early next 
week. 
  Several powerful LDP members, such as former Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone and former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, 
are saying repeatedly that "another election will be conducted 
under the multi-seat constituency system." These remarks can be 
taken as a strategy to force the Hosokawa administration to 
dissolve the Diet at an early date. Depending on the results of 
political maneuvering in which the "higire bills" are used as 
"pawns," the possibility remains that the talk of "crisis" by 
bureaucrats in Kasumigaseki may become reality.

<F P=106> [Article by Hitoshi Noguchi: "How Competent Is Japan in </F>
Managing A Crisis? -- Economic Stimulus Measures and North 
Korea's Nuclear Issue"] 
  [Text] As the last decade of the 20th century has come to 
its midpoint, what may happen tomorrow continues to be unclear 
in all fields -- politics, economics, international relations, 
and environment. It is in such times that the ability of 
government officials, who support the nation, to manage a crisis 
matters greatly. Yet the question is whether Japanese officials 
have such an ability. 
<H5>  Grave Blunder in Economic Measures </H5>
  The Japanese economy is about to start a countdown toward 
its 
destruction. Three years have passed since the "Great Heisei 
Recession" started early in 1991 following the collapse of the 
"bubble economy". The current slump is certain to be the worst 
and the longest recession since the war, lasting longer than the 
36-month recession of the second oil shock. 
  The causes of recessions up to the second oil crisis were 
external. It was as though business, in its declining phase in 
the cycle, caught an extremely bad cold which developed into 
pneumonia. 
  In contrast, the current "Great Heisei Recession" occurred 
because the Japanese economy had become fat through the bubble 
economy. It is, so to speak, suffering from adult diseases. 
Adult diseases do not worsen suddenly if an accurate diagnosis 
is made and proper treatment is given in the early stages. If 
one's constitution is improved carefully, the diseases are not 
so frightening. 
  Nevertheless, the authorities' diagnosis of the state of the 
economy was definitely wrong, and the cure was always one step 
behind. As a result, financial institutions, the heart of the 
Japanese economy, have suffered arteriosclerosis because of 
their bad loans which are now said to amount to 100 trillion 
yen, and the sharp fall in stocks is causing cardiac infarction. 
  Now, it has come to the point that an economic panic could 
happen any time. The Japanese economy now requires crisis 
management in the intensive care unit. 
  The name Masaru Yoshitomi, former director general of the 
Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] Coordination Bureau, has to be 
pointed out, though this cannot mend the matter now, as the 
person responsible for further deteriorating the situation by 
making a definitely wrong diagnosis and choosing wrong measures 
to deal with the problem. Yoshitomi should be held highly 
responsible, because he was not just a mere economist at that 
time but the director general of the EPA's Coordination Bureau, 
an important post for coordinating economic measures and foreign 
economic policies within the government. While I am sorry for 
Yoshitomi, his judgment is hopeless because, when the fall of 
the economy was evident to everybody in the spring of 1992, he 
was still saying publicly, "Where do you see a recession?" 
citing the tight labor market. 
  Corporations and financial institutions' latent profits were 
lost in 1990 due to the steep fall of stocks when careless land 
loans became bad loans one after another as a result of a sudden 
attempt to stop the bubble economy by Bank of Japan [BOJ] 
Governor Yasushi Mieno. 
  Then in 1991, scandals involving securities and financial 
institutions came to light successively, withering business 
sentiments at once. 
  Such a trend in the overall economy must have been totally 
invisible to Yoshitomi. 
  In May 1992 when Yoshitomi was repeatedly saying, "How can 
you say that we are in a recession when the unemployment rate is 
slightly higher than 2 percent and the ratio of job openings to 
job seekers is higher than 1:00?," the Business Sentiment Index 
of Principal Enterprises in the BOJ's Tankan [Short-term 
Business Survey of Enterprises] was 124. 
  The index is an index of companies that said business is 
"bad" subtracted from those who said it is "good." The figure 
124 is comparable to the number at the worst period when the 
recession brought on by the yen's appreciation in the first half 
of 1987 was causing a stir in society. 
  In spite of such an index, Yoshitomi was attempting to 
somehow produce the longest economic growth, exceeding the 57 
months of the "Izanagi Boom," during his term in office. Thus, 
making an objective diagnosis was downright impossible for 
Yoshitomi. 
  Takao Akaba, former vice minister of the EPA, once said in 
an 
interview with this writer, "The economy has a long-term big 
wave and a short-term wave. This wave was a big one in the 
economy's expansion phase. So the wave was still at a high 
level even after the economy peaked and was on the downturn. 
That explains why the shortage of labor looked serious and 
people were confused in thinking that the economy was still 
expanding." 
  A crisis occurred immediately after Yoshitomi insisted, "the 
economy is still expanding though its speed has slowed." 
  From mid to late July 1992, the Nikkei average declined more 
than 2,000 yen in ten days, and dipped below the 15,000 yen 
level on 11 August. 
  Although some people think Germany's interest rate hike in 
July triggered the situation, the definite statement of Mamoru 
Ozaki, who took office as vice minister of the Ministry of 
Finance [MOF] in July, that "deficit-covering bonds will not be 
issued" had an effect. The market, which had been expecting the 
government's pump-priming measures, was disappointed and reacted 
negatively. 
  When the Nikkei average falls below the 15,000 yen level, 
financial institutions and business corporations holding 
high-priced stocks will have to face enormous losses. 
  Alarmed by the situation, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa 
strongly directed the MOF and the BOJ, which had been saying 
that the economy was all right, to work out measures to maintain 
stock prices and to stimulate the economy. 
  But, Miyazawa, who advocated a positive financial policy, 
and the MOF officials, who put the rebuilding of the 
government's finances above anything else, were not getting 
along well with each other. Just before settling on the 
"economic stimulus package" in August 1992, Ozaki, who had just 
become vice minister, is said to have telephoned a certain 
out-of-office economist who is close to Miyazawa to ask him to 
convey his message to the prime minister. A crisis can never be 
handled when the MOF vice minister cannot see the prime minister 
in person, and has to ask an economist who is not in the 
government to relay his "real intention" to the prime minister. 
  Anyway, at this time, since the government announced its 
"monetary policy for the moment", business operators were 
relieved and the market stabilized again. However, this 
"tentative policy" was just postponing solving the issue by 
allowing, so to speak, "leaving out" losses on accounts in which 
the loss of stocks did not have to be redeemed in the September 
midterm earnings report, but could be postponed until the 
settlement of accounts in March 1993. 
  Thus gaining time, the government tried to bring the economy 
back with the largest ever "pump-priming package," worth 10.7 
trillion yen. Although the amount of the package was big, the 
"fresh water" contributing immediately to a rise in the economy 
was not more than 3 trillion yen. Still, these two policies 
were effective temporarily, and the Nikkei average recovered to 
the 20,000 level, avoiding a crisis. 
  However, since the diagnosis was fundamentally wrong, the 
policies could only work as first aid. If the economy is young, 
possessing potential for growth, it can be revived vigorously by 
giving it a nutrient like public works, even if the economy 
weakens temporarily due to overproduction. But for the current 
Japanese economy, which suffers from adult diseases developed by 
gaining fat, providing a nutrient cannot bring back its health. 
  After all, the economy deteriorated further instead of 
getting better, and the MOF only maintained stock prices from 
beginning to end by carrying out the so-called PKO (Price 
Keeping Operation). That is, the MOF managed to keep stock 
prices by buying stocks, using public funds such as postal 
insurance and savings, while pressuring life and nonlife 
insurance companies not to sell their stocks. 
  Because of that, the market became a completely managed 
market in which dynamic trading was confined, and the market 
itself was dead. 
  Speaking of public funds, not much could be expected based 
on 
the amount of funds for investment. Also, it was obvious that 
the artificial stock prices were maintained by controlling 
selling. Also, everyone knew that once the underpinnings were 
removed, stock prices would go down. 
  It is better not to carry out such a measure if the tricks 
of 
the authorities are so clear. 
  At that time, MOF senior officials Ozaki; Nobuyuki Teramura, 
director general of Banking Bureau; and Tadashi Ogawa, director 
general of Securities Bureau, concentrated only on making the 
numbers consistent through the PKO because they were afraid the 
fall of stock prices would cause the loss of nominal latent 
profits, and lead to the failure of financial institutions. 
  But, they were also trying to expand their colonies using 
the 
taxpayers' money. The best example is that the MOF sent former 
Banking Bureau Director General Masateru Yoshida with a dowry to 
the almost failed Hyogo Bank to be its president . 
  The bud for rebirth can only be seen after what has to be 
removed is removed. Nevertheless, since the MOF officials 
concealed the actual condition with a stopgap measure, suspicion 
and the fear of recession prevailed all the more, shrinking 
consumption. In that respect, it cannot be helped if they were 
criticized for amplifying the crisis. 
  At any rate, they had continued to deceive the market, and 
Ozaki retired in July 1993. Also, Ogawa was transfered from 
being director general of the Securities Bureau to chief of Tax 
Bureau. Teramura was left to continue to carry out the makeshift 
measures to save the banks. 
  Ozaki and Ogawa's successors, MOF Vice Minister Jiro Saito, 
and Securities Bureau Director General Shohei Hidaka seemed to 
continue the stopgap measures. 
  The listing of JR Eastern Japan stock on 26 October 1993 is 
illustrative. The authorities' intention must have been to 
direct the desire of the general public, which is naive about 
stocks, to the share market by listing the well-known JR Eastern 
Japan stock, and thus raise stock prices. 
  In fact, the market must have been moving according to their 
scenario until the initial transaction price of JR Eastern Japan 
was pushed up to 600,000 yen, by setting the initial offering 
price at 380,000 yen and creating an atmosphere that made the 
stock scarce. But, individual investors, who had learned 
distrust from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. stock 
case, did not buy. 
  As a result, only sophisticated semiprofessionals, in 
expectation of a high price just after the listing, bought JR 
Eastern Japan shares for short-term profitmaking. Because of 
that, once the stock reached a high price, the sell orders 
flooded in the next day, and JR Eastern Japan stocks fell in 
reaction. Since the fast sell orders for the JR Eastern Japan 
had swamped the market, the computer broke down and the trading 
of the stocks was suspended. Most investors were not able to 
sell their JR Eastern Japan stocks even though they wanted to, 
and had to hold the falling shares. 
  In addition to the steep fall of JR Eastern Japan stock, 
other stocks declined substantially also. This is because the 
semiprofessional investors bought the shares of JR Eastern Japan 
by selling their holding stocks, not using new funds. Under 
circumstances in which the daily trading volume continues to be 
at the 100 million level, one tenth of the volume at the time of 
the bubble economy, if JR Eastern Japan stock absorbs 1 trillion 
yen from the market, it will immediately be the start of a steep 
decline. 
  This is like forcing a patient to run who is suffering from 
cardiac infarction by giving an injection of a stimulant. 
  November's trading started to fall. The Nikkei average 
dropped nearly 3,000 yen in a month, and on 29 November it 
temporarily fell below 16,000. 
  This sudden fall is attributed mainly to the attempt of 
financial institutions suffering from the recession to make a 
profit by selling stocks while, in a way, strangling themselves. 
  When the average falls below 16,000, there will be some 
banks 
which cannot meet the BIS [Bank for International Settlement] 
rule. In that case, the average will decline to 12,000 at once, 
because investors will sell their stocks at a loss before prices 
hit bottom. Then, the latent profits of city banks will be 
lost, and the Japanese economy will have heart failure, leading 
to a series of large-scale bankruptcies. 
  While this was a crucial moment for crisis management, there 
was still no sign that an economic stimulus package has 
materialized. 
  Do bureaucrats consider the PKO, control of selling, and the 
raising of stock prices by listing a new stock, which are 
obvious stopgap measures, to be crisis management? 
  The Japanese economy will be in serious trouble unless 
government officials work on crisis management seriously by 
cutting out the affected parts and let the pus out, and 
sacrifice oneself to carry out deregulation. 
  The economy has been Japanese officials' strongest area, but 
MOF officials, who are supposed to be the most brilliant, are 
not able to cope with the structural change at all. 
  Still, the situation is more serious. 
  In addition to economic problems, crisis management related 
to the nation's security needs more attention, and this is where 
the bureaucrats' weakest point is revealed. 
<H5>  Farce of Unorchestrated Ministries </H5>
  The issues of North Korea's nuclear and economic sanctions 
have now become critical. 
  North Korea continues to reject inspection of its 
facilities, 
suspected of developing nuclear arms. 
  Having lost any further means, Hans Blix, director general 
of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke at the UN General 
Assembly on 1 November 1993 to urge North Korea to accept IAEA 
inspections. The assembly adopted a resolution, demanding the 
inspection of North Korea's nuclear sites by an overwhelming 
majority. 
  On 3 November, immediately following the UN resolution, then 
U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin, during his visit to Japan, 
said, "Economic sanctions are an option if diplomatic means 
fail." In other words, taking the issue to the Security Council 
and adopting a resolution to impose sanctions against North 
Korea is the only alternative left for the IAEA if the UN 
resolution is ignored by North Korea. Of course, it depends on 
the result of the planned third round of the bilateral talks 
between the United States and North Korea. 
  What will happen if economic sanctions are imposed on North 
Korea? "It is a serious matter. If economic sanctions are 
adopted by the United Nations, North Korea will take it as a 
declaration of war as it has warned repeatedly. Since that 
country faithfully carries out what it says, we must expect the 
worst-case scenario if economic sanctions are imposed." (Satoshi 
Morimoto, senior researcher, Nomura Research Institute). 
  Morimoto is a specialist who, as former chief of Security 
Policy Section in the Foreign Ministry's Information Analysis, 
Research and Planning Bureau, supervised "the second operation 
room" which specialized in gathering and analyzing military 
information at the time of the Gulf war. 
  "If the worst happens, the effect will be far bigger than 
that of the Gulf war. A large number of displaced persons may 
come to Japan, and missiles may come flying at Japan. In that 
case, local self-governing bodies on the coast of the Sea of 
Japan should also prepare for an emergency. At any rate, the 
worst case has to be expected and every possible precaution has 
to be taken. Imposing economic sanctions on North Korea 
requires much preparedness," Morimoto said. 
  A first-rate crisis management system is needed indeed. The 
imposition of sanctions on North Korea inevitably involves the 
danger of leading to war. However, what happens if Japan, 
fearing the possibility of war, objects to economic sanctions 
when the issue is referred to the Security Council? Japan will 
be criticized by the international community as the country that 
supports North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. 
  Already, some in the United States are displeased with the 
large flow of people, goods, and money going from Japan to North 
Korea, and even say that "Japan's money and goods are enabling 
the North's development of nuclear arms". 
<H5>  Conveying Information to the Prime Minister: A Secret Strife </H5>
  As a matter of fact, the United States unofficially asked 
Tokyo, "to discuss what kind of contribution is possible for 
Japan when economic sanctions are imposed" in the fall of 1992. 
But there is no sign that the Miyazawa administration took 
concrete actions afterward. 
  Then early in 1993 the issue of "special inspection" of 
the nuclear waste and storage facilities near Yongbyon came to a 
deadlock, and in February the IAEA referred the matter to the 
Security Council. North Korea, in response, stiffened its 
attitude and threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). On 12 March, North Korea 
actually announced its pullout from the NPT. The withdrawal 
automatically takes effect three months after the announcement. 
  Once North Korea leaves the NPT, legal grounds to demand 
that 
it accept nuclear inspections will be lost, and use of force 
will be the only means left to stop its development of nuclear 
arms. This means imposing economic sanctions, and if this does 
not work, then military action will be taken. 
  On 29 May when the deadline for North Korea's withdrawal 
from 
the treaty was near, North Korea test-fired a missile toward 
Japan. Also, it restricted the entry of foreigners and Koreans 
living in Japan, and prepared troops for action, showing an 
attitude of not budging an inch. 
  Since an emergency had occurred in the targeting of Japan, a 
crisis management system should have been announced immediately 
as a matter of course. However, the government offices 
concerned did not even hold a liaison conference, much less 
manage a crisis. Each ministry and agency did not try to do 
anything to cope with the situation and kept their information 
to themselves. Also, the Miyazawa administration, presiding 
over such bureaucrats, did nothing either. Even worse, they did 
not try to inform the public, while they knew what was going on. 
  Needless to say, in a democracy, government cannot make any 
important decision without gaining a national consensus. To win 
a consensus among the people, the right information has to be 
provided first. 
  If a crisis had arisen on the Korean peninsula in late May 
1993 while the public had not been informed about it, the 
government would have been unable to come up with a single 
measure to handle the situation, and Japan would have fallen 
into great confusion. 
  North Korea's test-launch of a missile was made public when 
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara "leaked the news at his 
own discretion" on 11 June, two weeks after the incident. 
  This was too late. A situation should not exist in which the 
people, as the sovereign, are informed of nothing while Japan's 
security is threatened by a crisis. If the bureaucrats had 
possessed such a common-sense recognition, each ministry should 
have brought in its information to the Cabinet Security Affairs 
Office, discussed measures, and informed the people that a 
crisis was approaching, even if Prime Minister Miyazawa did not 
make any decision, being too cautious. 
  However it was not until late October, five months after the 
missile incident, that the "Joint Council for Information 
Liaison and Coordination" was formed, in which the director 
general level officials from each ministry brought in and 
discussed their information regarding the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  Only after that did officials in charge from the MOF, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the 
Ministry of Transportation [MOT], as others visit a specialist 
to learn about North Korean issues. 
  Moreover, this "council" is not at all a place to discuss a 
scenario for managing a crisis. 
  Legally, Japan's crisis management is to be handled by the 
Security Council of Japan in the cabinet. However, the Security 
Council did not meet during the Gulf war to discuss measures to 
deal with the situation, though it was onvened to discuss the 
mid-term defense program. 
  The Security Council consists of the prime minister as 
chairman, the ministers of foreign affairs and of finance, the 
chief cabinet secretary, the chairman of the National Public 
Safety Commission, and the directors general of the Defense 
Agency and the EPA. Because the council has become a ritualistic 
conference to give authority to a conclusion reached in advance 
by ministries doing the groundwork, it cannot deal with an 
emergency situation. 
  Under this Security Council is the Cabinet Security Affairs 
Office which is for coordinating the ministries' administrative 
work related to national defense. 
  Under this system, this office is responsible for managing a 
crisis so the cabinet can cope with an emergency situation. 
Naturally, the previously mentioned "Joint Council for 
Information Liaison and Coordination" should also be chaired by 
the chief of the Cabinet Security Affairs Office to have 
ministries submit their top secrets, and evaluate and analyze 
them. Then, the results should be reported to the chief cabinet 
secretary. Nevertheless, the office is said to have no such 
ability nor the power to do so. 
  "There are no uniformed personnel, who are military 
specialists, in the office. So a correct analysis of the 
situation cannot be expected. Moreover, all the members of the 
office including the chief and the councilors, are on loan from 
other ministries, so the views of the central government office 
cannot be coordinated." (Sachio Genkawa, former Ground 
Self-Defense Forces Eastern District Commanding General). 
  Thus the "Joint Council for Information Liaison and 
Coordination," which should discuss a scenario for crisis 
management, has become a place for merely exchanging 
information. Since the evils of a vertically divided 
administration have clearly come to the surface, the council has 
become a place for learning about other ministries' information 
while protecting one's own ministry's top secrets. 
  The ministries' guarding of information to protect their own 
interests is quite astonishing. The biggest trouble for the 
nation's security is that there are secret strifes in the stages 
of conveying information to the prime minister. When the 
ministries want to tell the prime minister something, it has to 
be relayed through the prime minister's private secretaries. 
The judgment of those secretaries is very important because 
they manage the prime minister's heavy schedule, and decide the 
priority of the information to be conveyed. 
  Among the five private secretaries, one of them is the 
longtime secretary of a politician who became the prime 
minister, and the remaining four are career officials sent from 
the Foreign Ministry [MOFA], the MOF, the MITI, and the Police 
Agency, respectively. Those who are appointed private 
secretaries are all considered to be future vice ministers. 
  These four secretaries are responsible for communicating 
with 
the prime minister for other ministries besides their own. For 
example, a private secretary sent from the Police Agency will 
also cover the Ministries of Home Affairs, Health and Welfare, 
and the Defense Agency. All ministries and agencies are covered 
by the four secretaries. So, it is relatively easier for the 
MOFA, the Police Agency, the MOF, and the MITI to keep their 
secrets since they can convey information through their own 
secretaries. 
  In contrast, a secret of the Defense Agency, even if it is a 
real top secret, will be known by the Police Agency before it is 
conveyed to the prime minister. It is all right when the source 
of information to be conveyed is clearly identifiable as the 
Defense Agency, but if it is not so, then the Defense Agency 
will try to relay the information to the prime minister without 
going through the secretary from the Police Agency. For 
example, the Defense Agency will use a director general 
transferred to its Agency from the MOF to influence the 
secretary from the MOF. 
  Then the secretary from the Police Agency, out of suspicion 
and fear, will try to obstruct the Defense Agency's 
communications with the prime minister.... 
  Although this is about what could happen -- and it does not 
mean that it is always the case -- it is problematic because the 
above situation is more likely to occur as the importance of the 
information increases. 
  In the Defense Agency, there are also career officials on 
loan from the MOFA, the MOF, and the Police Agency. Yet the 
true top secrets are said to be conveyed to the prime minister 
through an official from the Defense Agency in the Cabinet 
Information Research Office which is directly connected to the 
chief cabinet secretary so that the secrets will never be known 
by officials from other ministries. The situation is far from 
discussing a crisis management measure by bureaucrats bringing 
in information. 
  To avoid such secret strifes, the function of the cabinet in 
integrating the ministries has to be strengthened. 
  In fact, there was an attempt to strengthen the cabinet so 
that a fair crisis management system could be implemented. In 
July 1984, the Nakasone cabinet, in response to the second 
provisional committee on administrative reform's report, 
integrated the Administrative Management Agency with parts of 
the Prime Minister's Office to form the Management and 
Coordination Agency. At that time, Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masaharu Gotoda decided to 
strengthen the cabinet's comprehensive coordination function, 
since they were worried that crisis management was impossible 
under the vertically divided administrative organization. 
  The late Ichiro Nakanishi, a member of the House of 
Councilors, was appointed as minister without portfolio in 
charge of crisis management, and the Crisis Management Measures 
Office was established under him in which a bold plan to 
strengthen the functions of the Cabinet Information Research 
Office was drafted. 
  "Information from all ministries will be coordinated by the 
Cabinet Information Research Office..." 
  Nevertheless, the plan was crushed in an instant by 
opposition from all ministries, which were alarmed over the 
expanding power of the Cabinet Secretariat. 
  What can be said when the crisis management system needed 
for 
protecting the nation was killed due to the ministries' own 
interests? 
  Regarding the imposition of economic sanctions on North 
Korea, the MOFA said, "Saying something about it will stir up 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, so we cannot even say 
whether we are discussing a measure or not." 
  The Police Agency also said, "Nothing can be said. If I say 
something, that disqualifies me as the person in charge of 
crisis management." 
  Although both ministries seem to have some kind of measures, 
the MOFA, the MOF, the Police Agency, the Defense Agency, the 
MITI, and the MOT are not cooperating, and they do not seem to 
be capable of implementing a comprehensive crisis management 
system at this point. Crisis management is for protecting the 
nation. It is not something for ministries to fight over based 
on their own interests.

  [Text] Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japan Trade Union 
Confederation [Rengo], has begun to take a softer stance on the 
issue of raising the consumption tax. It is widely believed the 
labor leader has embarked on creating a political environment 
that is favorable to his plan to appeal to the need to 
re-examine the ratio of direct to indirect taxes and approve a 
consumption tax hike. At the same time, Yamagishi apparently 
hopes to be in control of the regrouping of political parties 
which is expected to occur soon. To do this, Yamagishi plans to 
guide the ruling coalition parties in their discussions toward 
resolving the tax system reform issue by year's end and to 
reinforce the influence of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
within the ruling coalition alliance by urging the party, which 
has a strong "consumption tax allergy," to shift its policy in 
line with a more realistic approach. 
  In a lecture at the Japan National Press Club on 24 
February, 
Yamagishi said: "In the process of tax system reform, it will 
inevitably be necessary to re-examine the traditional ratio of 
direct to indirect taxes. The ratio of indirect taxes must be 
increased. Should a source of revenue become necessary, even 
after the government has reformed the tax system and cut back on 
its spending, then it will inevitably become necessary to raise 
the (consumption) tax rate." He thus indicated that he plans to 
approve consumption tax hikes in the future. 
  Yamagishi has been noted to make such remarks occasionally. 
He plans to propose as early as in April a Rengo-version of the 
tax reform and social welfare vision which will embrace his new 
stance.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 4. (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Today 
afternoon at the State Palace of Vietnam the Prime Minister of 
the SRV Vo Van Kiet and his spouse paid a visit to the President 
of Mongolia P. Ochirbat and his spouse. 
  During the meeting the President P. Ochirbat pointed out to 
a 
great success of the Vietnamese people achieved in transition of 
their country's economy to market relations, noting that 
experience of the Vietnamese friends would be of great 
importance for Mongolia. Mongolia has a respect for traditional 
relations and cooperation of many years established with the SRV 
and follows the line on enrichment of them by new content and 
forms on the principles of equality and mutual benefit under new 
conditions. P. Ochirbat expressed thanks to the SRV for 
rendering gratis assistance to Mongolia worth 200 thousand U.S. 
dollars in the difficult for the country's economy period. 
  As the Mongolian president noted, parallel with activation 
of 
political dialogue at all levels with the SRV Mongolia is 
interested in development of bilateral trade economic 
cooperation. In the sphere of external policy Mongolia is also 
interested in development of cooperation with Vietnam. P. 
Ochirbat made a suggestion to the Vietnamese side to cooperate 
on the issues of the Asian and Pacific region. 
  The Prime Minister of the SRV Vo van Kiet pointed out to the 
importance of development of bilateral relations and noted that 
for this purpose it is necessary to look for new forms and ways. 
That is why, first of all, it is necessary to revive activity 
of the inter-government commission, said the Vietnamese prime 
minister.

<F P=106> ["Mongolian Press Review"] </F>
  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 3 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The central 
Mongolian newspapers widely cover the official visit of the 
Mongolian President P. Ochirbat to the countries of Asia. The 
newspaper "ARDYN ERH" informs about the visit of the Mongolian 
President P. Ochirbat in the LPDR [Lao People's Democratic 
Republic]. It is informed about the grand ceremony of welcome 
of the President P. Ochirbat in Vientiane. As the newspaper 
notes, the President P. Ochirbat during the meeting with the 
Prime Minister of Laos K. Siphandon has exchanged with him 
information about economic reforms, which are carried out in the 
two countries, discussed the issues of bilateral relations and 
international problems of common interest. 
  The newspaper publishes the text of the treaty on friendly 
relations and cooperation between Mongolia and the Republic of 
India. 
  The newspaper informs about the working tour of the Prime 
Minister P. Jasray to the Western aymags, where he is getting 
acquainted with life of cattle-breeders. Is the newspaper 
notes, meeting with the citizens of Ulaan-Hust Soun of 
Bayan-Olgiy Aymag, the prime minister noted that the government 
is taking measures to stop economic deterioration, that for this 
purpose introduced were free prices and free currency exchange 
rates, pursued was a tough currency policy. 
  As a result of this, announced P. Jasray, there are positive 
tendencies for stabilization of economy. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent the 
government official L. Lantuu, who is responsible for 
construction in the capital of the hotel "Chinggis-Haan", 
speaking about reasons for the dragging out for a long time of 
construction works, explains this by financial difficulties and, 
on the other hand, by annulment of the agreement with the 
Yugoslav corporation "Genex". The annulment of the agreement 
was connected with economic sanctions in respect to Serbia. L. 
Lantuu notes that, judging by the world experience, for 
foundation of such a hotel needed are approximately 30 million 
dollars, but for building the hotel "Chinggis-Haan" in all 
probability we have to spend about 70 million dollars. In L. 
Lantuu's view, in case of taking the necessary measures it is 
possible to put the hotel into commission in the current year. 
  The central newspaper of the Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary 
Party (MPRP) "UNEN" publishes an article by candidate of 
historical science D. Altay "paradigm of development of 
Mongolia". In the article it is said that the present 
transition period of the country's development is notable for 
that the Mongolian society is freeing itself from usual methods 
of assessment of social and economic life. The author writes 
that this is accompanied by a crisis, which has enveloped the 
society as a whole. Mongolia, as noted in the article, has made 
a historical choice-creation of a humane democratic society, 
which is consolidated in the country's Constitution. In this 
connection the author rises the problems, which should be 
urgently solved, in her view, for realization of the planned 
tasks. 
  As journalist J. Roozon writes in "UNEN", in Mongolia for 
already fourth year deformations of social-economic life are 
felt. In J. Roozon's view, such deformations are the growth of 
forcible crimes, squandering of material values, in particular, 
under pretence of privatization, oblivion of moral and spiritual 
traditions of the Mongolian people. 
  The newspaper informs about the outcome of the international 
free-style wrestling tournament "Mongol Gobi `94". About 100 
sportsmen from China, Russia, South Korea and Mongolia have 
participated in the tournament. The Mongolian sportsmen have 
won 7 gold medals out of 10.

  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul on 7 March, 
the U.S. imperialists announced that they will deploy two Apache 
helicopter battalions to South Korea to reinforce U.S. 
imperialist aggressor forces in South Korea around 15 March, 
going against aspirations of the world's people who desire 
relaxation of tension on the Korean peninsula. 
  The U.S. imperialists' current step to deploy Apache 
helicopters, which are known to be the main offensive 
helicopters of the U.S. Army, is part of arms buildup maneuvers 
intended for a northward invasion, and is very alarming 
[simsangchi anta]. 
  Just as the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is at hand, the 
U.S. imperialists are running wild with arms buildup maneuvers 
intended for a northward invasion. This clearly shows that they 
have no faithfulness [sinui] and sincerity as a dialogue partner 
and are continually creating disturbances [changae] in DPRK-U.S. 
talks.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Urges Repeal of `NSL' in </F>
S. Korea"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- If the North-South 
dialogue is to progress successfully and the peace and peaceful 
reunification of the Korean peninsula to be achieved, such 
fascist laws as the "National Security Law" [NSL] must be 
abolished without delay in South Korea, said a spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today. 
  Answering a question put by KCNA about the controversy 
between the U.S. and South Korean authorities over the 
abrogation of the "NSL", the spokesman said: 
  Recently, the United States expressed its official position 
calling for the abolition of the "NSL" in South Korea. 
  Several days ago, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Hubbard, speaking at a university of the United States, held 
that the "NSL" of South Korea must be scrapped. Afterwards, 
Secretary of State Christopher stated that this demand was not a 
person's view but an official position of the United States. 
  As well known the world, the "NSL" of South Korea is a 
fascist law that defines the North as an "anti-state 
organization" and prohibits free dialogue and exchange between 
the North and the South and is an offspring of the military 
dictatorship. 
  The successive military dictatorial regimes of South Korea 
have harshly suppressed South Korean people, fostered 
North-South confrontation and obstructed national reunification 
by invoking the anti-communist fascist laws such as the "NSL" 
under the patronage of the United States. 
  Those in the "civilian" regime in South Korea have trampled 
underfoot human rights and obstructed reunification and dialogue 
so recklessly that even high-placed officials of the United 
States called for the abrogation of the "NSL." 
  The Kim Yong-sam regime is branded as a "civilian fascist" 
regime because it keeps the "NSL" intact. And it is also due to 
the "NSL" that the multi-channel dialogues and exchange between 
the North and the South were foiled without progress in the past 
and many South Korean people were put into prison or killed for 
their demand for national reunification or visit to the North. 
  Such being the case, the "NSL" can be termed the second 
concrete wall, from the legal point of view, built with in South 
Korea by the South Korean authorities as high as their concrete 
wall running along the Military Demarcation Line. 
  The "NSL" should have been abolished when the agreement on 
reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between 
the North and the South was adopted and effectuated. 
  It is a good thing that the U.S. Administration called for 
the abolition of the "NSL", the biggest obstacle to the 
North-South relations, though belatedly. I think that the call 
came from its understanding that the "NSL" is one of the factors 
that impede the progress of the negotiation between the North 
and the South of Korea.

  [Text] Moscow, March 7 (KCNA) [dateline as received] -- "If

insidious plot to take Korean residents in Sakhalin to South 
Korea, turning a deaf ear to our solemn warning, they would 
never be able to evade the responsibilities for insulting and 
abusing the noble idea of humanitarianism", said the chairman of 
the Federation of Koreans in Russia for Reunification, Yi 
Tong-chol, in a statement on March 1. 
  "The residence of Koreans in Sakhalin is attributable to the 
Japanese imperialists who illegally occupied Korea and forcibly 
took Koreans there by issuing the unlawful `general mobilization 
order', drove them hard and left them there", he noted, and went 
on: 
  "The problem of the Koreans taken to the Far East of Russia 
by the Japanese imperialists is not confined to over 40,000 
Koreans now residing in Sakhalin. It can be solved only when 
the Japanese Government sincerely apologizes and makes post-war 
compensations to the entire Koreans living scattered all over 
the territory of the former Soviet Union. 
  "We Koreans in Russia join all other Koreans living in the 
territory of the former Soviet Union in strongly opposing the 
sinister and crafty scheme of the South Korean and Japanese 
authorities to move our fellow countrymen to South Korea we will 
wage a vigorous struggle for defence of our national dignity and

<F P=106> ["`Industrial Peace' Is Reactionary Slogan for Exploiting </F>
and Oppressing Workers" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article on the reactionary "industrial peace" 
doctrine of the traitor Kim Yong-sam of South Korea. 
  "Industrial peace" is a South Korean version of the 
"labor-management cooperation" which had been claimed by 
capitalists and their servants from the initial period of 
development of capitalism with a view to exploiting and 
oppressing workers by appeasing and deceiving them, the article 
says, and goes on: 
  The reactionary essence of the "industrial peace" clamored 
about by the Kim Yong-sam group lies, above all, in that it is a 
slogan of fascist repression for shifting the blame for economic 
catastrophe on to workers and stifling their struggle for their 
vital rights and democracy at the point of the bayonet. 
  The puppets allege that a "wage hike should be curbed" and 
an 
"industrial peace" be achieved in order to find a way out of 
crisis, ascribing the serious crisis of the South Korean economy 
to the workers who demand a "higher pay" and cause 
"labour-management disputes". The very ones who have driven the 
economy to a catastrophic phase are now preaching "industrial 
peace", laying the blame for the economic crisis of South Korea 
at the door of workers. This is a shameless distortion of 
reality. What they really intend is to find a pretext for more 
harshly suppressing the labour movement. 
  The reactionary nature of the Kim Yong-sam group's 
much-touted "industrial peace" lies also in that it is a 
deceptive slogan for enabling comprador capitalists to exploit 
workers at will, paralyzing workers' class consciousness and 
fighting spirit and thus keeping them from turning out in the 
struggle for the right to existence and democratic freedom. 
  The allegation of the Kim Yong-sam group that workers and 
employers should work for "mutual cooperation" and "concord" to 
"fix industrial peace" is nothing but a reactionary ballyhoo 
intended to emasculate the class consciousness and the spirit of 
resistance of workers. 
  The way for the South Korean workers to free themselves from 
the present-day slave labour and hardships of living lies in 
their strenuous struggle for the right to existence and 
democratic freedom, not in "labor-management cooperation" and 
"industrial peace".

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- Cho Il-min, chief of 
the Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National Democratic 
Front (Hanminjon), in a statement on March 4 urged the Kim 
Yong-sam group to stop dumping of nuclear waste and apologize to 
the nation and mankind for it. 
  "The Kim Yong-sam group is dumping into the sea a fabulous 
amount of radioactive substances which destroy the natural 
ecosystem and inflict fatal damages on human body," he noted, 
and went on: 
  "Such act shows that they are, indeed, an enemy of the 
nation 
who is clean indifferent to the existence of the 70 million 
fellow countrymen, and international criminals who pay no heed 
to the importance of the international natural ecosystem. 
  "The nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam group is not 
unrelated to the nuclear development stepped up in secrecy in 
South Korea. One of the purposes sought by them in their 
malicious anti-DPRK row over the fictitious `nuclear issue' is 
to conceal their nuclear development programme. 
  "With the Kim Yong-sam group left alone, the nation cannot 
evade a nuclear holocaust. 
  "Hanminjon will get firmly united with the patriotic-minded 
people of various strata in South Korea and wage a vigorous 
anti-war, anti-nuke movement and force the bellicose group of 
Kim Yong-sam, a despicable nuclear war servant, out of power."

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- More than 1,000 
students under the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of 
General Student Councils (Namchongnyon) including Chonnam 
National University and Choson University Saturday held a 
demonstration against the anti-national rice market opening of 
the Kim Yong-sam group, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The demonstrators resisted against the suppression by combat 
police with a fierce stone-pelting, shouting "We are dead set 
against rice market opening". 
  They also protested against the police search into Chonnam 
National University and Choson University at the end of 
February, and strongly demanded that the puppet authorities 
immediately stop the repressive moves to disorganise 
Namchongnyon. 
  Prior to the demonstration, the students set the struggle 
against the United States which forced rice market opening and 
the struggle for resignation of the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime 
as the orientation of this year's struggle.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The bell [words 
indistinct] in Chongno District, Seoul, which is tolled at the 
time of Buddhist rites, was recently struck eight times at 
around noon when there was no ritual, South Korea's KYONGHYANG 
SINMUN newspaper reported. 
  It was once tolled contrary to usual practice 75 years ago, 
at the time of the March 1st popular uprising. 
  The Buddhist monks defined rice market opening by the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique as contravening the Buddhist rules and 
sounded the bell while an all-people rally against rice market 
opening was taking place on the Seoul railway station plaza. 
  This was an expression of their opposition to rice market 
opening and dismayed the puppet clique.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
Sunday issued its information No. 645 denouncing the recent 
sword-brandishing suppression of the just struggle of South 
Korean people and students by the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique. 
  Recalling that the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique recently 
cracked down on a demonstration of the participants in a rally 
marking the 75th anniversary of the March 1st popular uprising 
at the point of bayonet and is continuing to suppress the 
righteous struggle of people of all walks of life for 
independence, democracy and reunification including the struggle 
against rice market opening, the information said: 
  Such suppression, which was committed at a time when the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam issued an order to crack down on the right 
struggle of the South Korean people, labelling it "illegal" and 
"violent" one, is a clear proof that the South Korean puppets 
are throwing away even the formal "civilian" veil, openly 
resorting to the sword-brandishing fascist rule. The 
suppression at the point of bayonet cannot save the Kim Yong-sam 
group from the crisis of power. 
  As long as the traitor Kim Yong-sam as crafty as a fox 
remains in power, independence and democracy can neither be 
realized nor can existence itself be kept. The South Korean 
people should rise up in the struggle to overthrow the Kim 
Yong-sam group.

campus surveillance after forming an exclusive detective group 
in charge of Hanchongnyon five months ago. 
  "This campus surveillance is designed to prevent a struggle

<F P=106> [Communique No. 645 issued by the Committee for the Peaceful </F>
Reunification of the Fatherland Secretariat in Pyongyang on 6 
March] 
  [Text] The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland [CPRF] Secretariat issued a communique denouncing the 
Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique for suppressing with arms 
[chongkallo tanap] the just struggle by the South Korean people, 
youth, and students, berating it as an illegal and violent deed. 
  CPRF Secretariat Communique No. 645 reads: 
  Lately, fascist oppressive maneuvers by the puppet clique 
with the mask of a civilian government are being conducted more 
openly in South Korea. 
  According to reports, on 1 March, when some 2,000 Seoul 
citizens and college students marched on the street, shouting 
slogans "Yankee go home", "Cancel the plan to deploy patriot 
missiles in South Korea" after holding a meeting marking the 
75th anniversary of the 1 March popular uprising, the Kim 
Yong-sam traitorous clique repressed the protesters with arms 
and forcibly dispersed them by mobilizing the riot police, thus 
committing fascist violence. 
  Prior to this, on 23 February, when some 400 students of 
universities in Kwangju, including Chonnam and Choson 
Universities, launched a demonstration, shouting slogans against 
the rice market opening, the fascist clique savagely repressed 
them by letting the armed police move out and release tear gas. 
  On 25 February, the puppet police showered tear gas 
indiscriminately at college students in Kwangju, who were 
staging a demonstration opposing the National Assembly 
ratification of the nation-selling opening of the agricultural 
market. The rascals released so much tear gas that patients at 
the nearby Chonnam University Hospital had to seek help to take 
shelter. 
  After the indiscriminate oppression at the demonstration 
site, the puppets tyrannized by letting the riot police move to 
Chonnam and Choson Universities, where they conducted a surprise 
search and confiscation and incarcerated many students. 
  In mid-February, the puppets arrested students participating 
in an anti-U.S. demonstration in the front of the American 
Center in Kwangju and hauled in 23 students engaged in anti-U.S. 
agitation activities in front of the Kwangju Post Office. 
  Moreover, the puppets did not hesitate in committing an 
atrocity by arresting four students, including Yi Chang-yol of 
Kyongbuk University in Taegu, for posting a notice supporting 
the North's insistence on a billboard, by invoking the National 
Security Law. 
  The South Korean students, the target of the puppets' 
oppression, are patriotic students who oppose outside forces, 
acts of selling the nation, and the confrontation between fellow 
countrymen while insisting on independence and desiring the 
reunification through alliance with communism and the North. 
Their struggle and desire cannot be a crime. 
  Nevertheless, these fascist oppressive maneuvers following 
the oppressive order to control with arms the South Korean 
people's just struggle, which puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam issued 
while berating it as an illegal and violent deed on many recent 
occasions, clearly prove that the South Korea puppets are now 
openly adhering to the fascist rule with arms after casting off 
its perfunctory civilian mask. 
  The oppression with arms cannot save the Kim Yong-sam ring 
from the power crisis [chonggwon wigi]. 
  The South Korean people cannot achieve independence or 
democracy, nor can they even maintain their lives, leaving 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is as crafty as a fox, at the post of 
power. 
  The South Korean people in various classes and strata should 
struggle more stalwartly [kwagamhi] to overthrow [tado] the Kim 
Yong-sam ring, which sells the interest of the country and the 
people while depending upon outside forces and makes fascist 
oppression and treachery to the country and the nation 
commonplace.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- "For the ultimate 
solution of the rural question under the banner of the socialist 
rural theses," the letter sent by the great leader President Kim 
Il-song to the National Agricultural Conference, was reported by 
foreign news media. 
  The Burundian television said on February 26: 
  The great President Kim Il-song in the letter reviewed the 
brilliant victory in carrying through the socialist rural theses 
and put forward the task to advance the rural construction onto 
a higher stage. 
  He said that irrigation, electrification and mechanization 
of 
agriculture and chemical application in farming have been 
realized and water, bus and television services have been 
introduced and clinics developed into hospitals in the rural 
areas of Korea. 
  He put forward the five major tasks to complete 
electrification, water supply and bus service at a higher level 
in the rural areas and realize central-heating and gas systems 
in the rural villages in order to eliminate the distinctions 
between urban and rural communities in living conditions. 
  He noted that the form and method of converting cooperative 
property into all-people property must accord with the socialist 
rural economic management system of Korea and the specific 
conditions in Korean rural communities. 
  The letter was reported by the Indonesian paper INDONESIAN 
OBSERVER, the Singaporean paper STRAITS TIMES, the Romanian 
papers EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, DIMINEATA, NATIUNEA and ROMPRES, the 
Malaysian paper SIN CHEW JIT POH, radio Mongolia, radio 
Equatorial Guinea, Thai television and Zimbabwean radio and

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
expresses firm solidarity with the Cuban people's just struggle 
upon the lapse of eight years since the Korean visit of Fidel 
Castro, a historical event that brought Korea-Cuba friendship to 
a higher stage. 
  Noting that the Cuban people united closely around Comrade 
Fidel Castro are steadfastly defending the sovereignty and 
dignity of the country under the banner of socialism, while 
smashing the moves of the imperialists at every turn, the paper 
says in a by-lined article: 
  The righteous struggle of the Cuban people enjoys unanimous 
support from the world progressive people. 
  The progressive people across the world are urging the 
United 
States to promptly lift the economic and diplomatic blockade 
against Cuba. 
  The struggle for supporting the just cause of the Cuban 
people and frustrating the anti-Cuba moves of the imperialists 
are being waged in different forms in many countries. 
  The Korean and Cuban peoples have defended the cause of 
socialism, supporting and cooperating with each other. Their 
militant friendship and solidarity have been further 
consolidated and developed in the course of struggling for the 
common cause, overcoming difficulties together. 
  The Korean people will as ever fully support the just cause 
of the fraternal Cuban people. 
  The socialist cause of the Cuban people will vigorously 
advance, encouraged by international support and solidarity.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
dedicates a by-lined article to the 31st anniversary of the 
March 8 revolution in Syria. 
  Recalling that the Syrian people have made great strides in 
their struggle to defend the sovereignty of the country, achieve 
national unity and develop the national economy under the 
leadership of the Arab Socialist Baath Party led by President 
Hafiz al-Asad after the victory of the revolution, the article 
says: 
  The government and people of Syria are working hard to 
retake 
the occupied Arab land and preserve peace in the Mideast area, 
while developing the friendly relations with Arab and other 
countries of the world. 
  The Korean people are rejoiced over the achievements made by 
the Syrian people in building a new society, firmly maintaining 
the independent stand and extend firm solidarity to their just 
cause. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Syrian 
Arab 
Republic are both non-aligned countries in Asia and the two 
governments and the two peoples have long developed the friendly 
and cooperative relations with each other. 
  Particularly, the friendly and cooperative relations between 
the two countries are daily strengthening as they are based on 
the deep intimacy between the leaders of the two countries. 
  The Korean people believe that the friendly and cooperative 
relations between Korea and Syria will continue strengthening 
and developing in the idea of independence, peace and 
friendship, and sincerely wish the Syrian Arab people greater 
success in their work for an unbiased and comprehensive solution 
to the Mideast issue as well as for the independent development 
of the country.

Japan", which was published in Britain, in Swedish on March 1. 
  Edited in the "part of the Democratic People's Republic of

panoramic view of Pyongyang and photos showing the industrial 
and agricultural development of Korea. 
  Under a subtitle "Health and Welfare", the book says that 
the 
good health and long life and social stability are guaranteed 
to all people by the free medical service and the compulsory 
education system in the DPRK. In South Korea, however, a 
doctor's fee is expensive and the gap between the rich in town 
and the poor in country is widening, it writes.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The 30th anniversary of 
the publication of the socialist rural theses in Korea was 
celebrated in different countries. 
  A celebration meeting was held at the Zimbabwe Talian Millet 
state farm on February 23. 
  The general manager of the farm said in his speech that the 
rural theses published by the great leader President Kim Il-song 
is a programme which indicates a shortcut to the ultimate 
solution of the rural question and a true textbook which makes 
clear the way of freeing peasants from hard work and helping 
them lead a rich and civilized life. 
  Seminars on the work of President Kim Il-song "Theses on the 
Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" were held by the group 
for the study of the chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in 
Enmoe, Guyana, and the Nepal Institute for Chuche Studies and in 
Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania on February 24 and 25. 
  Manik Lal Shrestha, chairman of the Nepal Institute for 
Chuche Studies, in his report said: President Kim Il-song 
flawlessly indicated the fundamental principle, tasks and ways 
for the solution of the rural question. The brilliant 
achievements in the countryside of Korea today are a proud 
fruition of the rural theses. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of 
the DPRK said in a statement on February 22 that the application 
of the chuche farming method brings a bumper harvest in the 
countryside of North Korea every year, but South Korea, same 
territory, which was once called a granary has been devastated 
and farming ruined every year for lack of water. 
  The statement expressed the hope that Korea would be 
reunified at an early date according to the proposal for 
confederation and the South Korean peasants would receive a 
favour from the rural theses and the chuche farming method. 
  Commemorative articles were carried by the Bangladesh papers 
GONO GONTU, FEREZ KHAJOZ, SAMACHAR, NATUN KATHA and AL AMIN, the 
Thai paper SIN CHONG YUAN PAO, the Pakistani papers NIDA-E WAQT 
and JIHAD, the Zimbabwean paper PEOPLE'S VOICE, the Senegalese 
paper LE TEMOIN, the Burkinabe paper LE PAYS and aired by radio 
Santarosa of Peru, radios America and Primerisima of Nicaragua. 
  Korean photo exhibitions, film shows and lectures were held 
in Yugoslavia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Mongolia, Bulgaria and other 
countries.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- A national memorial 
meeting took place here today on the 10th anniversary of the 
death of Kim Il, a communist revolutionary fighter loyal to the 
great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Kim Il was born into a poor peasant family in Orang County, 
North Hamgyong Province, in 1910 and remained unfailingly and 
invariably loyal to the party and the leader, to the country and 
the people and devoted his whole life for the national 
liberation, for the happiness of the people and for the victory 
of the revolutionary cause of chuche till the last moments of 
his life after he took part in the anti-Japanese revolutionary 
struggle organized and led by President Kim Il-song. 
  Present at the memorial meeting were O Chin-u, member of the 
Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of 
the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and minister of People's Armed 
Forces. Yi Chong-ok and Pak Song-chol, Politburo members of the 
C.C. [Central Committee], the WPK and vice-presidents, and other 
senior party and state officials. 
  Vice-president Pak Song-chol made a memorial address. 
  According to him, Comrade Kim Il took an active part in the 
work of underground party and mass organizations, joined the 
Korean People's Revolutionary Army in October, 1935 and 
creditably fulfilled his revolutionary tasks, thus making a 
great contribution to the historic victory of the great 
anti-Japanese war. After the liberation of the country he 
devotedly worked for the unity and cohesion of the party and the 
revolutionary ranks and for the acceleration of socialist 
construction as a whole, at important posts of the party and the 
state. 
  Comrade Kim Il was a staunch communist revolutionary fighter 
who devoted his whole life to the noble revolutionary struggle 
for national, class and human liberation, and a talented 
activist who performed immortal feats in the revolutionary wars 
against U.S. and Japanese imperialisms and in the building of 
the party and the state and of a new society. 
  He was a true loyal subject. From the day when he joined in 
the revolutionary struggle in his early years till his heart 
stopped beating, he remained invariably and immensely loyal to 
President Kim Il-song. He sincerely upheld the great leader and 
our party with a steadfast revolutionary attitude toward the 
leader and firmly defended the party and the leader at any time 
and in any place. 
  He was a staunch follower and resolute defender of the 
leader's ideas and lines. Regarding it as his supreme 
revolutionary obligation to defend the personal safety of the 
great leader, he devoted his whole life to safeguarding the 
leader from the enemy's schemings. 
  In concluding, Pak Song-chol said all the party members and 
other working people should cement rock-firm the singlehearted 
unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks behind dear 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the illustrious leader of the party and 
the people and supreme commander of the revolutionary armed 
forces, and uphold the party's leadership with loyalty by 
carrying forward the tradition of singlehearted unity 
established in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle and 
should press ahead with socialist construction, checking and 
frustrating all the challenges and new war provocation moves of 
the imperialists and reactionaries.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Revolutionary Faith and Indomitable </F>
Fighting Spirit of Korean People" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- The revolutionary faith 
and indomitable fighting spirit pulsating with the hearts of the 
Korean people today is the firm conviction that the Korean 
revolution will certainly win as there is the illustrious 
leader, the death-defying readiness to share the destiny with 
him, though the world may change a hundred times and the strong 
revolutionary spirit to break through any difficulties, if it is 
to carry his plan and intention into practice, declares NODONG 
SINMUN in an article today. 
  The author of the article says: 
  Ours is a revolutionary people with the unshakable faith 
that 
the Korean-style socialism led by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il is sure to win. Today all our people are following him 
as a mental support. They have keenly realized the greatness of 
the dear leader through their practical life. Covering a road 
of victory and glory under his guidance, they have gained the 
rock-firm faith that there is no one but him to whom the destiny 
of our country and nation can be entrusted and that they will 
win without fail as he is with them. Ours is a loyal people with 
an indomitable revolutionary spirit to defend the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il with their lives and share the destiny with 
him. They are now fighting stoutly with a burning heart to 
firmly defend him, holding him in high esteem. They have the 
unshakable will to defend supreme commander General Kim Chong-il 
with their lives forever in the future, with the same fighting 
spirit and stamina they displayed during the semi-war state last 
year. As long as there is such faithful people full of 
death-defying readiness to share the life and death with their 
great leader and their dear leader, no enemy can dare harm and 
provoke us. 
  Ours is a heroic people who are fully displaying boundless 
devotion and mass heroism, upholding the plan and intention of 
the dear leader. They are now displaying matchless devotion in 
the fruitful work of socialist construction to carry the dear 
leader's plan into practice, holding high the slogan "when the 
party is determined, we can do anything!" There is no other 
people in the world like our people who are ready to jump into 
water and fire when they are called by the party. Our people 
volunteer to difficult and toilsome work and honestly work ten 
or twenty years at posts assigned them by the party. This noble 
traits tell us well how devotedly they are working to realise 
the intention of the party. 
  As there is such people, the plan and intention of the dear 
leader are being brought into reality in time and socialist 
construction is advancing vigorously.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Larry Jagan in the "Current World Affairs" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Dear listeners: news reports from Thailand have 
indicated that at least two Burmese ethnic rebel groups are 
close to signing cease-fire agreements with the Burmese military 
regime. In a statement issued a few days ago, the Karenni 
National People's Liberation Front [KNPLF] has cited the 
possibility of signing an agreement with Burma's military 
government, the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], 
in the near future. Furthermore, according to opposition 
sources at the Thai-Burma border, it has been learned that the 
Mon rebel group will meet with Burmese Government officials for 
another round of peace talks within the coming two weeks. Larry 
Jagan has reported that the peace talks process has gained 
momentum due to the signing of a cease-fire agreement between 
the Kachin Independence Organization [KIO] and the SLORC in the 
past week. 
  The KNPLF is one of the two main Karenni groups engaged in 
cease-fire talks with the Burmese military government. In a 
statement sent to the media on Sunday, the KNPLF has stated that 
the 40 years of civil war with the Burmese Government have shown 
that the ethnic conflict can not be solved by military means. 
According to the KNPLF, preliminary talks with Burmese 
Government officials took place last month in Loikaw, the 
capital of Kayah State, or Karenni State as it is more widely 
known. The KNPLF statement considered the talks as fruitful and 
hope to officially sign a cease-fire agreement in the near 
future. Just as in the case of the other ethnic insurgent 
organizations -- the Mon and the Kachin groups -- senior 
personnel from the Burmese Buddhist religious hierarchy acted as 
mediators before the two sides sat down face to face for talks. 
According to sources from the Thai-Burma border, the KNPLF and 
the Burmese Government are making plans to hold further talks in 
the state capital of Loikaw. As the KIO has opened a liaison 
office in Myitkyina for further talks and other activities, the 
KNPLF has similarly opened an office in Loikaw. If a cease-fire 
agreement is reached with the Karenni, it will be a politically 
strategic opening for the Burmese Government. 
  Historically and somewhat unnaturally, the Karenni state was 
administered by the British as a separate state without ties 
from Burma. The Karenni state was a state which was allowed to 
secede according to the 1947 Constitution of Burma, but the 
Karenni movement was not strong enough because of many factions. 
In the 1970s, the Karenni split into two groups -- one 
pro-communist and the other anti-communist. Fighting between 
the two groups erupted as recently as last year. 
  The government and another Karenni group -- the Karenni 
National Progressive Party, KNPP -- also held talks in Loikaw 
last January but at present, the talks seem to be aborted. 
  And, according to sources at the Thai-Burma border, the 
(?Mon 
National Liberation Army) and the New Mon State Party have 
agreed to hold further talks with the Burmese Government in the 
Mon State capital of Moulmein within the coming two weeks. 
However, according to Mon sources, more discussions are needed 
before a cease-fire agreement can be reached. 
  At present, the Karen ethnic group, the KNU [Karen National 
Union], is finalizing its policies by holding executive 
committee meetings at its headquarters in Manerplaw on holding 
peace talks with the Burmese Government. However, according to 
Karen sources, the KNU is still insisting that talks should be 
held with the Burmese Government outside of Burma.

  [Text] The Karenni National People's Liberation Front 
[KNPLF] has issued a statement on the cease-fire talks with the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]. The statement, 
issued on 27 February, showed optimism that the cease-fire 
agreement between the KNPLF and the SLORC would be signed in the 
near future. It stated that the present world situation and 
Myanmar's [Burma] circumstances have shown that all political 
problems can be solved peacefully by negotiation. Myanmar, 
which is part of the international community, should resolve 
ethnic problems and armed insurrections peacefully using 
political means. The KNPLF, for the good of all the people in 
the Karenni State -- who have suffered bitterly from the civil 
war which has been going on for more than 40 years -- has 
decided to hold talks with the SLORC. The statement also noted 
that the decision was made to stop the use of Karenni people as 
forced labor, prevent forced relocation, and overcome economic 
difficulties. In accordance with SLORC's invitation of 18 
November 1993 to hold talks with ethnic armed organizations, the 
KNPLF sent Lieutenant Colonel Tin Tun to hold talks with the 
SLORC on 18 December 1993. Colonel Maung Kyi, Major Zaw Thet 
Naing from the No.27 military intelligence unit, and other 
members from the SLORC's side held talks with Col. Tun Kyaw, 
KNPLF vice chairman and commander in chief, and a delegation in 
Me Thet Village, Loikaw Township, on 8 February 1994. Religious 
leaders -- Roman Catholic Bishop Sotero Phamo and Baptist Pastor 
Saw Ambia -- attended the meeting as observers. 
  The KNPLF hopes that the SLORC will be able to sign a 
cease-fire agreement in the near future and believes the 
bilateral talks will lead to peace for the benefit of the 
Karenni people and for the development of peace, tranquility, 
democracy, and harmony in the Karenni State.

  [Text] The Malaysian police is seeking to interview the two 
Australian newspapers that had reported that some senior members 
of the Malaysian parliament had received cash payments from 
ASIS, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. 
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor said this to 
newsmen in Kuala Lumpur today. 
  He disclosed that the police, through the arrangement of 
Interpol, is hoping to interview the editors or the reporters 
who wrote the reports in the newspapers concerned. The two 
dailies are the Sydney-based SUNDAY TELEGRAPH and CANBERRA TIMES 
based in the Australian capital. SUNDAY TELEGRAPH had reported 
on 10 January that senior opposition members of parliament have 
over the years received tens of thousands of dollars from ASIS. 
CANBERRA TIMES, however, reported on 3 February that the 
receipients were members from the ruling party. 
  Tan Sri Rahim said the police is viewing the allegations 
very 
seriously and he hopes the two newspapers will give the 
necessary cooperation.

  [Text] Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak has 
regretted the attitude of the Western media, which frequently 
portrayed Islam as an antidemocratic religion. Islam is also 
portrayed as an intolerant and its followers as fanatics craving 
for war. He said the Western media frequently resorted to 
tactics of generalization and simplification to portray Islam's 
image by claiming that the Islamic movements in Algeria and 
Afghanistan, for instance, were also prevalent in other 
countries. All these were described as that of Islamic 
fundamentalists. The Western media went to the extent of 
describing the victory of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria 
in 1992 as the victory of totalitarianism of democracy. 
  Datuk Sri Najib said Islamic leaders are often associated 
with a negative image even if they had achieved economic 
excellence for the benefit of their people. He made these 
remarks at the forum on current challenges in the Islamic world 
and the role of Malaysia, organized by the Malaysian Strategic 
Research Center in Kuala Lumpur.

  [Text] Kota Kinabalu, 31 Jan--The MCA [Malaysian Chinese 
Association] has decided not run in the state election on 18 and 
19 February in order to ensure the victory of the National Front 
(BN) candidates from districts where the majority of voters are 
of Chinese descent. MCA President Datuk Seri Ling Liong Sik said 
the decision was made after talks about the subject were held 
among MCA federal and state leaders and a detailed study was 
made of the party's chances. 
  Nevertheless, he said, the MCA, which is one component party 
of the BN, will not be idle but will use its election machinery 
to help BN candidates, particularly in districts where the 
majority of voters are of Chinese descent. "All MCA leaders and 
supporters will work hard to give unified support to ensure that 
BN candidates win in this election. I believe the decision we 
have made will increase support for all BN candidates by people 
of the state," he told reporters upon his arrival here at noon 
today. 
  When asked about the possibility that the MCA will give 
support to the Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), a new party 
formed in the state, he said, "Our commitment to the BN is 
clear. If they (the SAPP) join the BN, we will certainly give 
undivided support to their candidates." As for the possibility 
that its decision will hurt the morale of Sabah MCA members and 
their support for BN candidates, Dr. Ling said the matter has 
been accepted with true BN spirit. He said he has received 
pledges and undivided support from them so that all BN 
candidates running in this election will gain absolute victory. 
  "MCA members agree that they still need time before taking 
part in an election, although support for the party is on the 
increase in the state. For them, a BN victory in this state 
election is quite important for ensuring that economic growth 
and development in Sabah moves smoothly," he said. 
  The MCA expanded its influence to Sabah last year, two years 
after UMNO [United Malays National Organization] formed a branch 
in the state. Meanwhile, Sabah MCA Chairman Datuk Dr. Fong Chan 
Onn, said that all party members in the state agree with the 
decision that was made and have reiterated their support for the 
BN. MCA was the second BN component party to announce it would 
not put any candidate in the state election on 18 and 19 
February. 
  Yesterday, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) announced that 
it would not participate in this election in order to make way 
for SAPP candidates if the SAPP joins the BN before the state 
election. LDP President Chong Kah Kiat said his party will 
support the leadership of SAPP, which is headed by former Deputy 
Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee. 
  It was reported yesterday that Yong said the SAPP will apply 
to join the BN before the general elections in the middle of 
this month. Meanwhile, Sabah UMNO Information President Karim 
Ghani welcomed the decisions of the MCA and the LDP as a 
willingness to sacrifice for the sake of the BN.

<F P=106> [Unsigned Editorial: "BN (National Front) Formula for Unity"] </F>
  [Text] The people of Sabah have been given a guarantee that 
the post of chief minister will be held in turn by leaders of 
the three largest communal groups in the state if the National 
Front (BN) wins in these elections. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamad said that in this way the BN will be able to ensure that 
each communal group has a responsibility for bringing Sabah into 
a new era. We feel that this is a sincere effort by the BN to 
stand up for the people of Sabah so that they will not 
constantly be mired in narrow communal politics full of 
deceptive personal interests. We agree that the country's 
success up to now has been because of, among other things, 
leaders who are not only capable and dedicated, but who are also 
sincere and honest in serving the people. In truth, there is 
nothing worse for a country than having leaders who are greedy 
for power for the sake of personal interests. 
  Beginning with the Alliance and continuing through the BN, 
our success in overcoming communal problems is because of a 
spirit of cooperation among leaders and party members 
representing various communal groups. Such tolerance and 
consensus can resolve any problem and create political stability 
for developing Malaysia. We believe that if this concept had not 
been introduced and nurtured, Malaysia would have been 
multicommunal country facing frequent disturbances. As a result, 
every citizen of this country would have been left behind by the 
development process. 
  We are sure that the Sabah United Party (PBS) will use Dr. 
Mahathir's guarantee to inflame the sentiments of the people of 
Sabah, particularly the Kadazan community. That is the normal 
political practice of the PBS when under pressure, but we 
believe the people of Sabah have discernment. Their evaluation 
of the BN is not merely at election time, but they look at its 
"track record" throughout the era of its governance since the 
days of the Alliance. The BN's concept is measured by its 
success. The BN has proved its ability to unite a multiracial 
people and manage the country's economy efficiently and wisely. 
For us, there is no alternative to the BN. This is because the 
pact among its parties is constant and lasting, unlike the 
confusion of pacts among opposition parties that are made only 
when elections take place. Afterwards, they scatter to 
themselves and their differences. The failure of pseudopacts 
among opposition parties is because their leaders are not honest 
and are interested in their own pockets. This disease has 
clearly spread to Sabah. What we see are former USNO [United 
Sabah National Organization] leaders conspiring with the PBS. In 
order to have power, they are willing to try to win the hearts 
of the people, even though, having left the BN, they are forced 
to ride the PBS symbol in this election. This situation is very 
different from that of the BN. Because we believe that the 
interests of the people are above everything, we do not object 
to compromise. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was willing to 
pull its candidate to make way for the Sabah Progressive Party 
(SAPP) to run as an assurance that the Sabah Chinese community 
will be cared for. Similarly, the MCA [Malaysian Chinese 
Association] adhered to the BN concept and was willing not to 
run, although SAPP had not yet been accepted into the BN. All 
these things were done because of the realization that politics 
for the sake of one communal group, one party, or one group of 
leaders will not last. It is the opinion of those parties that 
PBS leaders manipulate the Chinese community, not for the sake 
of the Kadazans, but for their own interests. The BN will always 
adhere to this principle of tolerance, because if we bow to an 
individual or a group, the BN will face destruction. For us, the 
victory of the BN in this election is very important for the 
sake of restoring Sabah's economic excellence and the 
advancement of its people. 
  We admit that there are sometimes "minor ripples" in the BN, 
but they do not hurt it. On the contrary, its situation is 
further strengthened when a problem is resolved in a spirit of 
solidarity. What is even more important is that all communal 
groups must try to increase unity and understanding. Although it 
is difficult for us immediately to eliminate the identity of a 
particular communal group and replace it with the sense of a 
single nation, we must not inflame communal spirit, which would 
bring tension to the country's political and social climate. We 
need to remember that all communal groups can together obtain 
greater benefit from national stability than from a single 
communal group's seizing everything for itself. Therefore, there 
is no reason why the citizens of the Peninsula, Sabah, and 
Sarawak should fail in jointly achieving greater success for a 
brighter future.
