<F P=106> [Interview with Rengo President Akira Yamagishi by unnamed </F>
reporter; date and place not given: "Exclusive Interview: The 
Real Intention of Rengo Chairman Yamagishi, Who Talked 
Bombastically About the Concept of a New Liberal Party; He Makes 
a Clear Distinction Between It and the Shinseito-Komeito Bloc"] 
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
has no choice but to sublimate. The boss of labor circles, Rengo 
Chairman Akira Yamagishi, finally voiced his real motive. What 
he is aiming at is the straight line of a new liberal party. Its 
leaders will be Hosokawa, Takemura, Eda, and Yokomichi. What 
about Ozawa and Ichikawa? 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] What will become of the political reform 
bills? 
  [Yamagishi] I think they will be passed in the upper house. 
But I think it will be a slim margin of about 10 votes. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] Do you mean that the rebel group in the 
SDPJ 
will not oppose it that much? 
  [Yamagishi] Rengo, too, is making independent approaches, as 
a support group, to see that they are approved. Even so, I 
suspect that some crimes of conscience will appear. Persuasion 
will have no effect whatsoever on people who withdraw this time. 
In other words, it is a case of it being an ill bird that fouls 
its own nest. We cannot have this,but I think it can be kept to 
about five people. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] Is there no chance of the bills not 
passing, 
the Diet being dissolved, and a general election being held? 
  [Yamagishi] No, that won't happen. Politics is a living 
entity, so one cannot tell until the very end, but the mission 
of a support group is to persuade people. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] What was your impression when you saw the 
SDPJ conference on the 11th and 12th? 
  [Yamagishi] As might be expected, I had a gut feeling that 
the split between the faction which supports the coalition 
government and the independence faction is quite wide. As a 
guest, I said a few words, but there was a great deal of 
heckling and outcries. The heckling from those on the left was 
so outrageous that in the middle of my address I shouted back 
"shut up and listen!" It was my first experience with this kind 
of thing. I was gripped by a hallucination that I had mistakenly 
blundered into a conference of the Communist Party. 
  What made me mad was the heckling by Diet members. What is 
going on when local executives of the largest party that props 
up a government are heckling at the top of their lungs? One 
cannot keep the public trust by this kind of behavior. This is 
a manifestation of the split between the two factions. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] The two factions can no longer endure 
working together. 
  [Yamagishi] That is right, both of them say that, having 
come 
this far, they have to split up. They have already reached their 
limit. But if the SDPJ splits now, the coalition government will 
collapse, and the political reform bills will also be rejected. 
That is the weak point. I suppose that is why the group 
supporting the coalition government is having the most difficult 
time. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] If the political reform bills pass, next 
will be the issue of a source of revenue for compiling a budget. 
When that comes, the consumption-tax issue will become the 
occasion for a split. 
  [Yamagishi] That will not happen. The broad tax reduction of 
over 5 trillion yen should be financed by two or three years of 
short-term deficit-covering bonds. Both the right and left 
factions of the SDPJ agree on this. If they announced increasing 
the consumption tax as a package deal with reducing taxes, the 
Hosokawa cabinet would collapse. Hosokawa ought to understand 
that better than anyone else. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] In that case, when do you think there will 
be a second realignment of the political landscape which 
includes the breakup of the SDPJ? 
  [Yamagishi] For that we probably have to consider the next 
general election. I think that, if the reform bills pass, the 
next general election will probably be after the autumn of next 
year. It will take six months to draw up the bill for dividing 
the districts. That bill will also be very difficult because of 
party interests, so I suppose a special session of the Diet will 
be called at the very end of the year. Moreover, as is common 
knowledge, the period is three months. In addition to which, 
April 1995 are the local elections, right? June is the upper 
house election. Therefore, the general election will be after 
autumn. There is enough time before a second realignment of the 
political landscape. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] You are advocating the concept of a "new 
liberal party," what would it be in concrete terms? 
  [Yamagishi] After this, the political landscape will 
converge 
into a system of two large political parties. But even in such a 
case, we should not adopt the thesis of two conservative 
parties. I think it should be a system of two large parties, 
conservative versus nonconservative. But the process of going 
there must pass along a tripolar path. 
  The three poles will be conservative A, conservative B, and 
nonconservative. I think that conservative A will be Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] type conservatives, conservative B will 
be a group which aims at a non-LDP, new conservatism, and that 
the nonconservative will be a body in which social democratic, 
moderate, and liberal groups join forces. Therefore, I think 
that such as SDPJ, Japan Democratic Socialist Party, United 
Social Democratic Party, Sakigake [Harbinger]. The Japan New 
Party, the reform faction of the LDP, and the political forces 
located on their borders should join together in a 
nonconservative, liberal new party. The SDPJ must discover a 
path to survival in the midst of that and settle itself in a 
manner which leads to expansion. That is true for all of them, 
including the Japan New Party and Sakigake. 
<H5>  It Would Be Rude To Place Ozawa in a Different Dimension </H5>
  [SANDE MAINICHI] Are you saying that you would draw a clear 
distinction between it and the Shinseito-Komeito bloc? 
  [Yamagishi] That part has been greatly misunderstood. What 
kind of people do you imagine in the group of leaders of the 
nonconservative, liberal forces? I was asked this by Soichiro 
Tawara on television and said people like Yokomichi (governor of 
Hokkaido), Hosokawa, Takemura, Eda, and Hiramatsu (governor of 
Oita). 
  He asked me if it did not include Ozawa and Ichikawa, so I 
replied, no; I think they belong to the B conservatives, so they 
"are not included." That statement appears to have been taken as 
if I had said it excludes Ozawa and Ichikawa. 
  The nonconservative, liberal group has no room for 
cooperation with conservative A. But it should conclude an 
agreement on policy with conservative B and fight at their side. 
In fact, that is the framework of the current coalition 
government. The starting point of my idea is to maintain this 
framework in the future as well. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] In that case, do you mean to say that your 
posture has not changed since around the time of the general 
election last summer? 
  [Yamagishi] That is correct, I have not changed my posture. 
I 
said that (joining hands with Ozawa and Ichikawa) was 
collaboration between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At 
one time the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Nationalist 
Party joined hands and rose in a war against Japan in order to 
oppose military aggression by the Japanese military. I took that 
historical fact as a model. 
  In addition, I said that I did not have Ozawa in mind as a 
leader of the new liberal party because Ozawa said that he is a 
new conservative. It would be rude to put him in the midst of 
people such as social democrats and liberals who live in a world 
of a totally different dimension. I certainly have no antipathy 
or hostility toward Ozawa. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] I understand that you met Yokomichi at the 
end of last year; is he going to return to the central political 
scene? 
  [Yamagishi] I do not think he will serve a fourth term as 
governor. He is not inclined to run. In the history of Hokkaido, 
there is no governor who has served for four terms. Therefore, I 
think that Yokomichi understands the situation clearly. Surely 
he is not at an age to retire either, so naturally he is 
thinking of returning to the central political scene. We 
exchanged views, and I took him to be very enthusiastic about it. 
  But it is a matter of the timing of his return. Yokomichi 
wants to serve out his third term as governor and then return to 
the central political scene. The situation is developing in that 
way, so there will probably be no contradictionbecause his term 
will end in April 1995 and the general election will be the 
autumn 1995 at the earliest. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] Are you saying that Yokomichi has no desire 
to return to the SDPJ in its current state? 
  [Yamagishi] Yes. Therefore, it is what I call the new 
liberal 
party concept. He says clearly that he can no longer operate 
within the framework of the SDPJ. Yokomichi will fulfill the 
role of creating one pole of the tripolar structure. The SDPJ 
will sublimate within that. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] What will become of the so-called 
protect-the-constitution group? 
  [Yamagishi] How would I know something like that? I suppose 
it will cause a chemical reaction and break up. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] If the party breaks up, what will become of 
the party headquarters building? 
  [Yamagata] The reform group of the SDPJ will not make a fuss 
about the Miyakezaka Headquarters. The land belongs to the 
country. They will take care of such things by a fund-raising 
campaign. 
  [SANDE MAINICHI] Will you not also be forced to reconsider 
Rengo's endorsements when the election system changes? 
  [Yamagishi] The small election districts will have a single 
seat, so the LDP will narrow down to a single person. The 
coalition government side will also have to adjust to a single 
candidate. If it fails in this, it will lose miserably to the 
LDP. Deciding to back a conservative B in this district and a 
liberal in that district, Rengo will support them in order for 
them to be elected. It will only benefit the LDP if we say 
things like they were formerly in the SDPJ, so we do not back 
them, or they were in the Shinseito, so we will not work hard to 
support them.

<F P=106> [Article by Shigemichi Tomabechi, MAINICHI SHIMBUN editorial </F>
staff: "SDPJ's Four Groups Tossed About by Political Situation"] 
  [Text] The woods are lovely, dark and deep, 
But I have promises to keep, 
And miles to go before I sleep. 
  On 11 January [1994], speaker of the House of 
Representatives 
Takako Doi, who made a guest speech at the 60th Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Convention at the Kudan Kaikan 
Building in Tokyo, closed her message by quoting from a poem by 
Robert Frost. 
  The frame of mind of Speaker Doi, who occupies the honored 
position as the first woman speaker in Japan's parliamentary 
history to head the highest organ of state authority, is not 
clear when she quoted Frost's poem to the SDPJ members. 
  Although she was given the important role of lower house 
speaker because the SDPJ had become the largest party in the 
Hosokawa coalition government, her own party--the SDPJ--has 
continued strife that has split the party every time it faced a 
crucial political issue. Judging from the confusing 
circumstances of choosing between support for the coalition 
administration or withdrawing from it, she sounds as if she was 
strongly encouraging it to fulfill its mission as a responsible 
party. 
  Also, depending on how it is interpreted, there is a 
prominent theory that Ms Doi, who has powerful clout within the 
SDPJ as the leader of the pro-Constitution group, was 
conveniently promoted as speaker of the lower house where she 
would be unable to speak out on party management, whereas 
various hindrances would occur concerning coalition operations 
if she were to remain within the SDPJ. It is possible to 
interpret that Ms Doi, who was aware of such circumstances, 
hinted that she was prepared to relinquish her seat as speaker 
and take action as a savior to rescue the pro-Constitution group 
from its straits. 
  However, perhaps not a few members of both the right-wing 
and 
left-wing representatives who filled the convention hall heard 
her message as asking how long will it take for the SDPJ to 
disintegrate in view of the split in the party?" 
  The purpose of the convention, which was held amid a 
maelstrom and was a major turning point in the upper house 
deliberations on political reform-related bill as the focal 
point in the extraordinary Diet session, was to reach a decision 
on the 1994 campaign direction proposal. However, because 
passage of the bill depended on the response from the SDPJ, the 
principal aim of the Executive Division was to reconcentrate the 
party's will and strengthen solidarity toward passing the bill 
to support the Hosokawa coalition administration. 
  The slogan, "Let us cultivate a new future of the SDPJ for 
the coalition government and political reform," posted in front 
of the convention hall vividly illustrates the enthusiasm of the 
Executive Division. 
<H5>  Moves in Anticipation of a Split. </H5>
  However, the expectation and speculation of the Executive 
Division failed completely. Under the situation of a fierce 
confrontation within the party between the right wing that 
advocates maintenance of the coalition administration by passing 
the bill and the left wing that stresses independence of the 
party above the coalition administration, it was not possible to 
seek a union of will concerning the bill. 
  It is impossible to expect an agreement in debates between 
the right wing, which supports the coalition, aggressively 
responds to political restructuring by introducing the 
single-seat constituencies with proportional representation 
system as the core of political reform, and seeks to rise both 
in form and substance to a "ruling party" and the left wing, 
which opposes introduction of a "proportional representation 
system" as leading to the destruction of the SDPJ as a 
"pro-Constitution party." 
  Sure enough, it merely turned into a scenario of mutual 
criticism and condemnation, and the debate ended with the party 
on the verge of dissolution. It only amplified mutual distrust 
and hate and portrayed the party that was actually heading 
toward rupture. 
  Already preparatory moves are seen within the party with 
"spliting" in mind. 
  The moves can be roughly separated into four groups: 
"Democrats," "New Policy Discussion Group," "Liberal Group" and 
"Group To Promote True Political Reform." 
  The "Democrats," formed by some 40 Diet members of the 
faction which promotes political restructuring and supports the 
coalition government, anticipated the introduction of a 
"proportional representation system" and aimed at the marshaling 
of "social democratic/liberal forces including Sakigake 
[Harbinger], the Japan New Party and a portion of the LDP 
[Liberal Democratic Party]." It has in mind the formation of a 
new party by recruiting Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi as 
its new leader. 
  It is the largest right-wing group with former party General 
Secretary Hirotaka Akamatsu as chief of the secretariat 
supporting General Secretary Wataru Kubo. However, Chairman 
Akira Yamagishi of Rengo [National Confederation of Trade 
Unions] waits in the wings and cannot be ignored, inasmuch as he 
will be the nucleus of a second phase in political restructuring. 
  The "New Policy Discussion Group," with 30 Dietmen including 
lower house member Aogu Matsumae as chairman and Director Masao 
Sakon of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on Political Reform as 
members, is more aggressive than the "Democrats" concerning 
political restructuring and is therefore more splinter-bent. 
  An approach to and union with a group headed by lower house 
member Masayasu Kitagawa that is showing strong signs of 
splitting within the LDP is frequently rumored. The "New Policy 
Discussion Society" is a militant group that indicates a strong 
possibility of becoming the vanguard of splintering within the 
SDPJ. 
  In opposition to the right-wing groups, more than a dozen 
Dietmen of the left wing centering on upper house Diet member 
Hideo Den of the United Social Democratic Party and led by upper 
house member Masao Kunihiro formed the "Liberal Group," which is 
actively against the "proportional representation system." It is 
cooperating with the "national network to revitalize the 
pro-Constitution SDPJ" and is expected to form a new 
pro-Constitution party in the future. 
  The left-wing "Group To Promote True Political Reform," 
which 
supports Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and consists of about 30 
lower house Dietmen of the neutral faction, was originally 
opposed to the "proportional representation system." The group 
emphasizes independence and had established rapport with 
"Liberal Group." However, Chairman Murayama has been forced to 
adopt the position of promoting political reform and maintaining 
the coalition administration, and the situation within the group 
is complex and deeply troubled. 
<H5>  Defensive Evolvement </H5>
  Meanwhile, each of the four groups is moving in its separate 
way publicly and privately amid rife speculation. What they 
have in common is the fact that no one has the slightest idea as 
to how the political situation will evolve in the future and 
what will happen to them when they plunge headlong into the new 
political phase that is sure to come. 
  Even the right-wing groups, although they announce 
solidarity 
of the "social democrats and liberals," require an adversary to 
justify it. Unless the Sakigake, Japan New Party, and the LDP 
liberals act in unison, their "solidarity" would have no 
practical purpose, and it would become a monodrama. How 
effective can cooperation in the elections be? 
  It is the same in the case of the left-wing group. How many 
seats can be garnered by reuniting the pro-Constitution forces 
in a "proportional representation system" election? If only 
several seats can be anticipated in the proportional 
representation districts, the raison d'etre of the group itself 
would be questioned. 
  As this article is being written, the fate of the political 
reform-related bill is unclear. However, if it is passed, the 
impact of introducing the "proportional representation system" 
will unmistakably hasten the dismantling of the SDPJ. 
  What follows political reform is the issue of a hike in the 
consumption tax rate that will inevitably result in a major 
debate within the party. 
  "The woods dark and deep" lie ahead of the SDPJ. How many 
miles to go before one sleeps?

  [Text] On 10 March, a top official at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry commented on a package of 
external economic measures which the government plans to compile 
in two stages -- in late March, and before the July summit 
meeting of the major industrialized nations. The official 
stated: "Macroeconomic measures should be included in a 
market-opening package to be compiled in late March." He 
stressed that the ruling coalition parties need to make a quick 
decision on the tax system reform which is currently under 
discussion. 
  With regard to macroeconomic measures, the idea of 
increasing 
the amount of public works spending has now cropped up. 
However, a U.S. Government official previously said: "Even if 
the public works program is revised, the U.S. Government will 
not highly appreciate it." It appears that this U.S. view has 
been conveyed to the Japanese Government. For this reason, the 
major point at issue is how the government will spell out its 
direction in tax system reform. 
  Referring to the possibility of Japan offering to implement 
[income] tax reductions of 6 trillion yen a year for three 
consecutive years without deciding on revenue sources to fill in 
shortfalls therefrom, the senior official insisted the revenue 
source question should be decided at the same time, saying: 
"Otherwise, that is tantamount to announcing a plan to issue 
18-trillion-yen worth of deficit-covering public bonds." He 
then added, "Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura who is 
in charge of finalizing the package, and the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan should come up with responsible proposals on 
this," thus serving warning to the two who are reluctant about 
resolving the two issues at the same time.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 15 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] There has been growing support recently within the 
government and the ruling parties for a plan to resolve the 
issue of full-fledged tax cuts beyond fiscal 1994 before the 
meeting of leaders of the advanced countries (summit) to be held 
in Naples from 8 July, instead of "before the end of 1994" as 
originally planned. The purpose is to alleviate U.S. discontent 
with Japan's huge current-accounts surplus. The Japanese 
Government plans to include this in the market opening measures 
to be compiled by the end of this month, and inform the United 
States about this. 
  In connection with the tax cut, Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa announced in early February that a total of 18 trillion 
yen reduction in income and residential taxes over a period of 
three years would be implemented, to be followed by an increase 
in consumption tax rate from 3 to 7 percent, which he termed the 
"national welfare tax scheme." However, this plan was rescinded 
due to the opposition of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] and other groups. As a result, only a 6 trillion yen tax 
cut for fiscal 1994 has been agreed upon, and the issue of tax 
cuts beyond 1994 is being left to deliberations by the ruling 
parties' consultative body on tax reform, aiming at "passing the 
relevant laws before the end of 1994." 
  However, the United States is strongly critical of a 
"single-year tax cut." Visiting Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher criticized Japan's stance at a news conference on 10 
March, saying "this will be ineffective." 
  While the government intends to include in the economic 
measures to be announced by the end of March four major steps to 
liberalize the market -- such as import promotion -- and other 
steps to bring about improvement in the automobile and auto 
parts sector, and two other priority areas in the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, there is a persistent opinion in the 
Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry that "the 
United States will not be appeased unless there are concrete 
measures offered in macroeconomic policy." 
  Top on the list of macroeconomic policies being considered 
is 
a plan to further augment the basic program for public 
investments totaling 430 trillion yen. However, since it is 
believed that "what the United States wants is tax cuts; and 
they will also contribute to the expansion of domestic demand," 
(according to a senior Finance Ministry official) an earlier 
conclusion in the ruling parties'debate on tax cuts has now 
become a major focal issue. 
  Nevertheless, if an announcement that tax cuts are to 
continue beyond fiscal 1994 is to be made, it will not be 
possible to evade the issue of revenue source -- that is, the 
consumption tax hike. There is still the problem of how to 
persuade the SDPJ and other opposing forces inside the ruling 
coalition parties.

<F P=106> [John Madeley articles: "Second Dam Deal Outrages Greens"] </F>
  [Text] As the controversy rumbles on between Britain and 
Malaysia over the Pergau dam aid-for-arms deal, the Malaysian 
Government is embroiled in another dam controversy closer to 
home. 
  Environmental groups in Malaysia are angry at their 
government's decision to go ahead with the Bakun hydroelectric 
dam project in Sarawak, the country's easterly state. 
  Pergau is a tiddler in comparison, costing around 450 
million 
pounds and supplying about 600MW [MegaWatts] of electricity to 
Malaysian consumers. But Friends of the Earth [FoE] Malaysia 
says Bakun will cost 30.6 billion Malaysian ringgits (more than 
7 billion pounds) and be able to supply about 16,000MW of power 
within 10 years. 
  The dam will be on the Rajang river in north-west Sarawak, 
where about 5,000 people of the Kenyah, Kayan, Lahanen, Ukit and 
Penan tribes, living in communal houses, could be uprooted. 
  Nearly 275 square miles of forested land will be flooded as 
a 
result of the scheme, but FoE says the large reservoir to be 
built could also trap sediment that would silt up the dam and 
shorten its working life. 
  Mohamed Mahathir, the Malaysian premier, claims the dam is 
vital for the country's energy needs. Launching the project, he 
admitted it could destroy some trees and animals and displace 
natives, "but to get the desired achievement of well-being of 
the people later on, some price has to be paid now." 
  The Malaysian government says it has conducted studies that 
show the economic gains of the project far outweigh the adverse 
environmental impact. But Friends of the Earth says the 
Government is relying on selling electricity to neighbouring 
countries to make the dam pay. 
  It is concerned about the `viability and safety' of a 
planned 
submarine cable, yet to be built, that would transmit 
electricity from Sarawak to mainland Asia, 400 miles away. 
  The cable would be the longest of its kind in the world, and 
there is a `complete lack of experience' of laying such a cable 
and of continuously transmitting large amounts of power, says 
FoE. 
  Ironically, in June 1990, the government resolved to scrap 
the Bakun project, but Dr Mahathir said its changed decision 
proved `we care for the environment... Malaysia has made a big 
sacrifice for the environment.'

<F P=106> [By Tadao Karino and Masaharu Shimokawa; from MAINICHI </F>
SHIMBUN 15 March Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Seoul, 14 Mar -- Yi Yong-tok, South Korean deputy 
prime minister and minister of national unification, gave an 
exclusive interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 14 March. On the 
unresolved issue of an exchange of special envoys between North 
and South Korea, Yi said: "Theoretically, it is still possible 
to have the exchange in time," but "that is only what we are 
hoping for. In reality, this will be difficult to achieve." 
  He indicated he was pessimistic about the possibility of 
exchanging special envoys before 21 March, when the third round 
of high level talks between the United States and the DPRK 
(North Korea) is scheduled to be held. 
  Yi revealed that during recent talks with visiting U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, they had agreed 
that "if the exchange of special envoys does not materialize, 
the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks will be postponed," 
indicating the possibility the talks may be delayed. 
  Yi cited the fact that on 12 March North Korea virtually 
withdrew the four prerequisites it had set [for the exchange of 
envoys] -- including "discontinuation of military exercises 
using nuclear arms" -- at the North-South working level 
negotiations in Panmunjom, and predicted that "even if the 
exchange of special envoys could not take place in time, I am 
optimistic that we will be able to reach agreement (in the end)." 
  However, as far as the timetable for exchanging envoys is 
concerned, Yi said: "We would not be able to tell before the 
working level meeting on 16 March." 
  Yi stated that the exchange of special envoys with North 
Korea has already been agreed between the North and South, and 
it would amount to an indirect dialogue between the leaders of 
the two sides, which might open the way to direct dialogue. 
Seoul, therefore, intends to work for this patiently. 
  He also said that the reason the North is not eager to 
exchange envoys "seems to be that it wants to give priority to 
negotiations with the United States. However, the North is 
surely aware of the importance of direct North-South dialogue." 
  Touching on the nuclear inspections currently being 
conducted 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yi said: 
"While we cannot say they are proceeding smoothly, they are 
somehow progressing." 
  On recent developments in North Korea, Yi said: "There are 
signs of policy change, such as the North's admitting the 
failure of its economic construction. It also seems to be in 
the process of reconsidering its withdrawal from the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)."

<F P=106> [Press statement issued by the spokesman of the Committee </F>
for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, CPRF, on 15 
March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Recently, a working-level delegates contact was held 
on several occasions for the exchange of top-level special 
envoys of the North and South. However, no reasonable 
[ungdanghan] results have been produced due to the South side's 
unreasonable acts. In this connection, the spokesman of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
issued the following press statement [tamhwa] on 15 March. 
  Press statement issued by the spokesman of the CPRF: 
  Recently, working-level delegates contacts for the exchange 
of top-level special envoys of the North and South, which was 
suspended in October of last year, were held on several 
occasions at Panmunjom. A series of progress has been made in 
the contacts, but no reasonable results have been produced yet. 
We can view that this is wholly attributed to the unreasonable 
acts of the South Korean authorities who are creating a barrier 
before the exchange of special envoys and who do not welcome the 
early settlement of the exchange of special envoys. 
  As already known, at the sixth working-level delegates' 
contact held on 12 March, our side showed a broad-minded and 
tolerant position regarding the four demands that we justly 
presented. As one of the new measures to realize the exchange 
of special envoys between the two sides as soon as possible, we 
put forth constructive proposals that we inform the people at 
home and abroad in the form of a joint communique that the two 
sides have reconfirmed their intention for the exchange of 
special envoys and have agreed to the exchange of special envoys 
as soon as possible, and that at the same time the two sides 
sincerely discuss and bring to a conclusion the draft agreement 
on procedural matters presented by each side. 
  This kind of epoch-making measure not only gives the 
condition to all the more achieve, ahead of schedule, the 
exchange of special envoys, it also gives hope to all the people 
who are worried about the future of the exchange of special 
envoys. Moreover, it creates a significant opportunity which 
provides a turning point in the new beginning of North-South 
relations. 
  If the South Korean authorities truly want to realize the 
exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and the South 
from the position of dissolving today's acute confrontational 
situation and achieve, ahead of schedule, reunification in the 
nineties, they must rightly show a positive response to our 
rational and patriotic initiative. 
  Nevertheless, in the 12 March contact, while making remarks, 
the South side acted if it had interest in the exchange of 
special envoys, but it showed a negative attitude in putting it 
into practical action and rejected our constructive proposal. 
  This kind of attitude by the South Korean authorities on the 
exchange of special envoys is giving disappointment to the 
people at home and abroad who are watching over the Panmunjom 
working-level delegates contacts. As already known, we proposed 
the exchange of special envoys of the North and South first. 
This is the best way to smoothly and quickly discuss and 
resolve pending issues between the North and South including the 
issue of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and the 
nation's grave matters for the country's peace and peaceful 
reunification through the top-level political determination and 
under the principle of national independence and great national 
unity. 
  When the top-level special envoys of the North and the 
South travel between Pyongyang and Seoul and historic top-level 
North-South talks ensue, it will be no doubt that an epochal 
turning point will be made in North-South relations and a 
decisive stage will open in achieving the nation's ultimate goal 
of reunification in the nineties. 
  This is why we initiatively raised the exchange of the 
top-level special envoys of the North and the South, which the 
South side could never have imagined, prepared for working-level 
delegates' contacts in Panmunjom, and exerted every effort to 
smoothly open the road for the two sides' special envoys to 
visit Pyongyang and Seoul. 
  The reason our side demanded the South side suspend all of 
its large-scale nuclear war exercises against fellow countrymen, 
stop talking about an international alliance system against us 
for the nonexistent nuclear issue, cancel the plan to introduce 
new arms--including Patriot missiles, and clearly show an 
attitude to retract the remarks that it cannot shake hands with 
those who have nuclear weapons, was to successfully realize the 
exchange of the top-level special envoys of the North and the 
South without twists and turns in conformity with their 
primordial missions. 
  Our demands, which are truly just in terms of the nation's 
craving and of the lessons from past North-South dialogues, 
received active support from public opinion at home and abroad 
and even won sympathy from many people in South Korea. 
  Because the exchange of North and South special envoys is a 
precondition of the two sides' top-level talks and the missions 
of the special envoys are urgent and important for the sake of 
the country and the nation, it has become an inevitable 
prerequisite to remove the obstacles blocking the achievement of 
the exchange. 
  Nevertheless, the South side avoided expressing a clear 
attitude toward our just proposal, thus casting a shadow on the 
future of the special envoy exchange, which after much effort 
had been finally scheduled, and jeopardized its destiny. 
  At such a time, to break through the difficulty laid in 
front 
of the special envoy exchange, our side evaluated and analyzed 
what the South side said in the sixth working-level contact held 
on 12 March: that the issues of discontinuing all large-scale 
nuclear war exercises and abandoning the international alliance 
system could be discussed after the special envoys are exchanged 
in the future; that although conditionally, it decided to 
suspend Team Spirit '94 joint military exercise some time ago 
and withheld the plan to introduce Patriot missiles; and that 
regarding the remarks that it cannot shake hands with those who 
have nuclear weapons, the situation is now changed because there 
is no intelligence which shows the North has developed nuclear 
weapons. Based on this, we believed that although not 
sufficient, such a position is an expression of the South side's 
understanding of the feasibility of our four-point proposal. 
Bearing this in mind, we proposed to proclaim at home and 
abroad that the two sides reconfirmed their will to exchange 
special envoys and agreed to exchange special envoys at the 
earliest possible date. 
  Our side's broad-minded measure and constructive proposal 
is just in every respect and is a manifestation of an active 
position on the exchange of special envoys. However, when 
viewing that the South side is not accepting the issue of 
releasing the joint communique without any reasonable reason, we 
cannot but doubt whether they truly have the will for the 
exchange of special envoys and whether they will actually carry 
out the exchange of special envoys. 
  Also, even while discussing the procedural matters for the 
exchange of special envoys, the South side assumed the attitude 
that it cannot accept the issue of easing tension, the issue of 
great national unity, the issue of settling the method for the 
fatherland's reunification, and the issue of abiding by the 
principle of national independence which our side put forth in 
regulating the duties of the special envoys. It is nothing but 
clear that rather than bringing about fruitions in the exchange 
of special envoys, the South side is trying to make the 
working-level delegates' contact only as a show off. 
  As such, the South side opposed the issuing of the joint 
communique that the two sides of the North and South agreed for 
the exchange of special envoys, and even opposed including the 
fundamental and principle problems in regulating the duties of 
the special envoys. Therefore, this creates an artificial 
barrier in the exchange of special envoys, and furthermore the 
South side is carrying out acts of intentionally putting the 
breaks on the third round DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  While acting as such, the South side is intent on making 
nonsense by saying that the exchange of special envoys is a 
precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and that the 
exchange of special envoys must be achieved before 21 March, the 
date for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  In the third clause of the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New 
York contact which was concluded on 25 February, it only 
specifies that the working-level delegates' contact shall be 
resumed for the exchange of special envoys of the North and 
South. No other items were specified. There can be no other 
explanation for this and moreover, the South Korean authorities 
have no justification to come forth with any kind of condition 
by interfering in the process of explaining this problem. 
  Our side resumed the working-level delegates' contact for 
the 
exchange of special envoys at Panmunjom, and it was already held 
on three occasions. Moreover, our side assumed a broad-minded 
position to draw the contact to the doors [munhogu] of the 
exchange of special envoys. This is being viewed as having 
progressed the contact even more so than the content of the 
DPRK-U.S. joint agreement. 
  Even so, the South Korean authorities ignored our sincerity 
and positivism and even put forth unreasonable preconditions 
which do not even fall within their authority, and made 
distorted false charges. Also, for them to say that they cannot 
issue a joint communique on the exchange of special envoys is in 
reality to dissipate the exchange of top-level special envoys of 
the North and South itself, and this cannot but be interpreted 
as an act of putting a wet blanket over the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  We claim that if the South Korean authorities truly have the 
will to improve North-South relations and discuss and resolve 
with us all pending issues between the North and South including 
denuclearization, they must correctly show the will for the 
exchange of special envoys which all the people can understand, 
and make a resolute decision on accepting our side's proposal on 
procedural matters. 
  We will continue to watch over the attitude of the South 
Korean authorities.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
on March 11 staged a war exercise targeted against the North in 
the sky above Kunwi, Yoju and Sangdong, South Korea, with the 
mobilisation of formations of Pacific-based assault planes and 
above 400 fighter-bombers, observation planes and reconnaissance 
planes belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea 
and the puppet Air Force, according to military sources. 
  On the same day, armed bandits of the puppet Army in Yonchon 
County and Paju County, Kyonggi Province, and Chorwon County and 
Inje County, South Korean Kangwon Province, fired at random 
large-calibre machine gun and automatic rifles toward the 
Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line, thus 
whipping up war hysterics.

<F P=106> ["`National Security Law' Must Be Scrapped" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today urges the abolition of the ill-famed "National 
Security Law" [NSL] in South Korea, saying it is natural that 
voices calling for the abolition of the anti-reunification 
fascist law are growing louder after the United States recently 
manifested its official position that the "NSL" must be repealed. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The "NSL" is an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law 
that denies reunification, blocks dialogue and opposes 
improvement of North-South relations. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet group, however, is trying hard to 
avoid repealing the "NSL", turning a deaf ear to the strong 
demand of the people at home and abroad. This vividly reveals 
its despicable intention to maintain the notorious "NSL" and 
continue seeking North-South confrontation and further 
strengthen the "civilian" fascist dictatorship. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors said they would 
"reexamine" the question of repealing the "NSL" when 
"North-South relations have been improved", while maintaining 
such anti-reunification evil law as the "NSL" and putting the 
brakes on dialogue and reunification in every way. This 
virtually means that they do not intend to scrap the "NSL". 
  The ill-famed "NSL" in South Korea must be scrapped without 
delay. Otherwise, the "civilian" regime will inevitably bump 
into stronger protests of the people and meet its disgraceful 
end.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "A Pressing Demand of Time"] </F>
  [Text] The South Korean people, human rights organizations 
of many countries, and international organizations are raising 
their voice demanding the abolition of the South Korean puppets' 
National Security Law. 
  According to Seoul radio, in a meeting of the UN Human 
Rights 
Committee recently held in Geneva, many human rights 
organizations urged South Korea to abolish the National Security 
Law. 
  In the meeting, a U.S. human rights organization exposed 
that 
illegal confiscations by invoking the National Security Law have 
yet to be rooted out in South Korea, even under the so-called 
civilian government, and demanded that the UN Human Rights 
Committee investigate human rights infringements in South Korea. 
  Denouncing South Korea for still repressing the students 
movement and imposing evil sentences by invoking the National 
Security Law, the World Students' Christian Federation strongly 
demanded in the meeting that the puppet authorities release all 
prisoners of conscience. 
  On 8 March, a spokesman for the South Korean opposition 
Democratic Party released a commentary expressing strong 
dissatisfaction at the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's brake on the 
abolition of the National Security Law, an antireunification 
fascist evil law, and stressing that the party will push ahead 
with the movement for the abolition of the National Security Law 
to the end. 
  This party's position of strongly demanding the abolition of 
the National Security Law was also expressed in a news 
conference held by the party representative on 5 March. On the 
same day, the Hong Kong branch of Amnesty International issued a 
statement and said that it would carry out a movement of sending 
protest postcards to the puppet authorities to protect human 
rights of prisoners of conscience in South Korea. The Amnesty 
International branch also demanded that the puppet authorities 
release figures arrested on charges of violating the National 
Security Law. 
  These facts show that the abolition of South Korea's 
National 
Security Law is unvaryingly demanded not only by the South 
Korean people but also by the people of the world and that this 
is the most pressing issue that can be no longer delayed. 
  As everybody knows, the so-called National Security Law of 
South Korea is an old remnant of the military fascist 
dictatorship and an evil, antireunification and fascist law that 
is the most savage and malicious in the world. 
  The National Security Law defines us fellow countrymen as an 
antistate body and enemy, so that those who support and admire 
us or even mention a word regarding the fatherland's 
reunification are subject to punishment, and so that the just 
struggle by youth, students, and people for the independence and 
democracy of South Korean society become an object of oppression. 
  Tens of thousands of youth, students, and people have been 
punished for carrying out the just struggle of demanding 
independence, democracy, and reunification. Countless numbers 
of people died on the scaffold. Today, many prisoners behind 
bars with long-term sentences suffer inhumane torture in South 
Korea. 
  It is no accident that the Amnesty International pointed out 
on 9 March that South Korean incarcerates prisoners for longer 
terms than any place in the world, such as Kim Son-myong and An 
Hak-sam, who have been confined in jail since the Korean war. 
  Moreover, even with a civilian mask, the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime not only maintain the National Security Law but also 
abuse it to oppress with more cruelty the South Korean people's 
just struggle for independence, democracy, and the 
reunification, to block North-South dialogue, and to amplify 
confrontation, not reconciliation or unity between the North and 
the South. 
  Last year, the Kim Yong-sam groups blocked dialogue between 
youth, students, and people of the North and South -- including 
the meeting between youth and students of the North and South in 
Panmunjom on 12 June and the Fourth Pannational Rally -- by 
applying the National Security Law. Even this year, it blocked 
representatives of the Chondoist religion in the North and South 
from holding a working-level contact in Panmunjom to discuss 
joint celebration of the 100th anniversary of the peasant war in 
1894. Also, it has indiscriminately suppressed South Korean 
youth, students, and people who want to hold dialogue with us. 
  All these facts prove that the South Korean people cannot 
enjoy their democratic freedom and rights nor achieve their 
social independence and national reunification because of the 
existing National Security Law. Therefore, the South Korean 
people and the people throughout the world have strongly called 
for the abolition of the National Security Law, an evil 
antireunification, fascist law, which cannot be found anywhere 
else in the world. 
  Amnesty International has exposed and denounced the acts of 
the South Korean puppets who are viciously infringing upon their 
people's human rights without abolishing the National Security 
Law. However, the South Korean puppets will say that they regret 
hearing Amnesty International's denouncement and will find an 
excuse. 
  Such acts by the South Korean puppets show that they will 
continue to brutally suppress the patriotic people in South 
Korea without abolishing the National Security Law. Therefore, 
their acts are unforgivable and become challenges to the voices 
of the people at home and abroad who call for the abolition of 
the National Security Law 
  If the Kim Yong-sam groups fail to listen to the voices of 
the people at home and abroad -- which have reflected the 
demands of the times -- but instead continue to embark upon the 
road of betrayal, they will not avoid a greater denouncement 
from the people. 
  The Kim Yong-sam groups must clearly see the trends of the 
times and immediately abolish the National Security Law as 
demanded by the people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the

[SKNDF] (Hanminjon) released a statement on March 10 urging the 
Kim Yong-sam group to abolish the "National Security Law" [NSL] 
and step down from power, the Seoul-based radio Voice of 
National Salvation reported. 
  Recalling that U.S. State Secretary Christopher finally 
confirmed that the demand for the abrogation of the "NSL" in 
South Korea was an official position of the United States, the 
spokesman said: 
  As the whole world admits, the "NSL" is an anti-democratic, 
anti-national and anti-reunification fascist law unprecedented 
in the world history of legislation. 
  It is due to this cursed, murderous law that many champions 
of democracy and reunification and patriotic people of various 
social strata have suffered behind bars and the dialogue, 
cooperation and exchange between the North and the South have 
been blocked. 
  The "NSL" is, indeed, a means for maintaining the fascist 
system and prolonging their days in power, which is worse by far 
than the Japanese imperialists' "Public Peace Law" and is an 
obstacle to great national unity and the country's reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is now scheming to keep the "NSL" 
intact, discontented with the demand for its abolition. This 
clearly shows that "democratization," "improvement of 
North-South relations" and "resumption of dialogue" which the 
Kim Yong-sam group is crying for are all lies and it, in 
actuality, wants neither the democratization of the South Korean 
society nor reconciliation and dialogue between the North and 
the South.

<F P=106> ["Deserved Denunciation of `Civilian Fascists'" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- The report of the 
Amnesty International exposing human rights violations in South 
Korea is a stern condemnation and indictment against the 
strong-arm rule and fascist suppression by the Kim Yong-sam 
group under the veil of "civilian regime" and "reform", says 
MINJU CHOSON today. 
  When he took office, Kim Yong-sam made a noisy advertisement 
as if he would bring something like "reforms" and "changes", but 
nothing has changed, the analyst says, and continues: 
  He has only inherited the ruling system of the preceding 
dictators, more harshly suppressed the people with physical 
strength and made all social evils prevail. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is now deeply vexed, expressing 
"regret" at the report of the Amnesty International noting that 
the human rights situation has not improved in South Korea. 
  The denunciation of the Kim Yong-sam group by the 
international community is a result of its crimes. It deserves 
that. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique must step down before it faces 
greater denunciation from the South Korean people and the 
international community.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The Korean Anti-Nuke 
Peace Committee and the Central Committee of the Korean 
Environmental Conservation Union proposed that the anti-nuke, 
environmental organisations of the North and the South conduct 
joint survey and monitoring activities at an early date to probe 
the very truth behind the nuclear waste dumping by the South 
Korean authorities and check it. 
  This proposal was made in a letter sent today to the 
Alliance 
of the Anti-Nuke Peace Movement, the Alliance of the 
Environmental Movement and the Civic Federation for Economic 
Justice of South Korea. 
  Noting that the South Korean authorities had dumped 11,000 
trillion becquerels of nuclear waste into the sea in the 1986-92 
period, the letter goes on: 
  "Such nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean authorities 
is a crude breach of the international conventions on protection 
and conservation of the sea environment and an anti-national, 
anti-human crime inflicting immeasurable disasters on our nation 
and mankind. 
  "The random dumping of nuclear waste by South Korea vividly 
shows how far the South Korean authorities have gone in 
developing nuclear arms while crying over `suspected nuclear 
programme of the North.' 
  "It is entirely natural that in South Korea environmental 
organisations, people and broad public circles took issue with 
the authorities' criminal dumping of nuclear waste and have 
risen in a struggle against it. 
  "We hope your organisations will turn out more courageously 
in the just struggle in the future to check the South Korean 
authorities' criminal nuclear waste dumping and nuclear arms 
development."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) released a statement on March 11 denouncing 
the criminal act of the South Korean authorities in dumping 
nuclear waste in the East Sea of Korea at random. 
  The statement branded the nuclear waste dumping by the Kim 
Yong-sam clique as the heaviest anti-national crime of turning 
Korea into a barren land polluted with nuclear substances and 
cutting off the lifeline of the nation and as a wanton violation 
of international law and convention. 
  The statement further said: 
  The traitorous Kim Yong-sam group which, while developing 
nuclear weapons under the "nuclear umbrella" of the United 
States, had cried for "an international cooperation system" and 
"a military countermeasure" and now, even at the working contact 
for the exchange of special envoys between the two parts of 
Korea, is reversing the black and white, raising a row over the 
"nuclear issue". This is outrageous, indeed. 
  To make the matter worse, the traitor Kim Yong-sam plans to 
visit Japan a few days later and have a confab for a more 
vicious smear campaign against the DPRK and Chongnyon. This 
will be a criminal mendicant trip designed to balk the 
projected third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost in 
conspiracy with outside forces and continue to do harm to the 
DPRK. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique has been hell bent on flunkeyist 
treachery, fascism, confrontation with the North and splittist 
moves and, as if it were not enough, is now unhesitatingly 
dumping radioactive waste. This is a criminal act which can be 
committed only by them who are clean indifferent to the nation 
and international law. 
  The South Korean rulers must stop the criminal nuclear waste 
dumping at once, disclose its truth and apologize to the whole 
nation. 
  We strongly demand that the Kim Yong-sam regime immediately 
give up the anti-reunification and anti-national moves to kill 
fellow countrymen in reliance upon outside forces, scrap the 
"National Security Law" and unconditionally stop the fascist 
suppression of the South Korean people.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Where Is Japan Leading the Situation To?"] </F>
  [Text] The Japanese authorities are blocking the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Recently, Japanese 
Foreign Minister Hata unprecedentedly picked on us by raving 
that we are going to produce nuclear weapons, that we are 
suspected of possessing one or two nuclear bombs, and that if 
North Korea refuses inspections again, or takes a vacillating 
attitude, or uses the nuclear card in a strange manner, Japan 
will take a staunch countermeasure within the boundary of the 
constitution. 
  We cannot but take it seriously because Japan's top 
diplomatic authority personally came out to make such remarks. 
The Japanese foreign minister's remarks, which were made at a 
time when Japan's nuclear armament has actually reached a danger 
line and the Japanese reactionaries are seeking a legitimate 
pretext for nuclear armament, are in fact no different from an 
official announcement that Japan will openly proceed with 
nuclear armament. 
  The problem is serious because Japan's nuclear armament is 
one of decisive obstacles that block the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula. For the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula to become truly meaningful, it has to be able to 
guarantee peace and security of the region. However, under the 
condition that Japan's nuclear armament is becoming dangerous in 
actuality, even if the Korean peninsula is denuclearized, it 
will be useless being not able to guarantee peace and security 
of the region. 
  Particularly, Japan's attempt to legalize the nuclear 
armament is bringing about a crisis of invalidating the Joint 
Declaration of Denuclearization between the North and the South. 
The objectives of the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization 
between the North and the South are to remove the risk of a 
nuclear war by denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, to form a 
favorable condition and environment for our country's peace and 
peaceful reunification, and to contribute to peace and security 
of Asia and the world. 
  Japan's nuclear armament is bringing about an opposite 
result. Japan's nuclear armament is aggravating the nuclear 
threat on the Korean peninsula and forming a situation of 
tension. 
  Since long ago, we have felt that the Joint Declaration of 
Denuclearization between the North and the South is useless as 
long as Japan's nuclear armament attempt is not withdrawn. The 
more Japanese authorities take issue with our nuclear issue in 
an attempt to legalize their nuclear armament, the stronger such 
a feeling grows. 
  Because of this, we cannot but raise the question whether or 
not the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization between the North 
and the South is necessary. Judging from all these, we may face 
a situation of having no choice but to reconsider our position 
regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. [urinun 
choson pandoui pihaekhwae taehan chagiui ipchangul chaegoryo 
haji anulsu omnun chongse-e chohage toelsudo isumnida] 
  If this happens, the situation will flare to an 
unpredictable 
one and this will not benefit the United States and South Korea 
either. The Japanese authorities should take all the 
responsibilities. The Japanese authorities should carefully 
think about the dear price their remarks and behavior have to 
pay and act with discretion.

<F P=106> ["Japan Warned Not To Impede Denuclearization of Korean </F>
Peninsula" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
warns that the Japanese authorities must act prudently, mindful 
that their ill-intentioned words and deeds might cause 
unpredictable grave consequences. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Recently the Japanese Foreign Minister, Tsutomu Hata raved 
that if the DPRK "refuses again to accept inspection or takes an 
irresolute attitude," Japan would "sternly counter it," alleging 
that the DPRK "is going to make nuclear weapons" and "is 
suspected of having one or two nuclear bombs." 
  His outburst came at a time when the DPRK and the United 
States have agreed on immediate steps of simultaneous action and 
the third round of talks between them is soon to be held. This 
shows the Japanese reactionaries intend to attain at any cost 
their sinister purpose of accelerating their nuclear armament on 
the pretext of the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  Japan's nuclear armament and overseas aggrandizement have 
reached a serious danger line. 
  Japan has stockpiled a colossal amount of nuclear material 
and laid a material and technical foundation for the manufacture 
of nuclear weapons. 
  With Japan's nuclear armament presenting a nuclear threat in 
actuality, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula cannot 
be realised, and even if it is realised, it cannot ensure peace 
and security in this part of the world. 
  Judging from facts, we conclude that however hard we may 
strive to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, it cannot be 
realised and, accordingly, the inter-Korean joint declaration on 
denuclearization might be reduced to a mere sheet of paper. 
  Then we will have to reconsider our position toward the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the inter-Korean 
joint declaration will have to be nullified. 
  In case the Japanese authorities' rash remarks worsen the 
problem, Japan will be wholly to blame for it. 
  The Japanese authorities will have to account for their each 
word and deed and dearly pay for it.

expressed joy over an affirmative agreement at a recent

  Noting that the United States has continued to aggravate the 
situation on the Korean peninsula, it said that the point is 
what stand and attitude the United States takes to implement the 
agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in the 
future. 
  The statement said: 
  If the United States sincerely implement the agreed 
conclusions, a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula would be smooth, and if the United States do 
not implement what it should do under an unreasonable pretext, 
it would be complicated. 
  The United States, which is directly responsible for a 
peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, 
must no longer disgrace itself.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Great Military Genius, Iron-Willed </F>
Commander"] 
  [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed 
out: The party's leadership toward the People's Army is a basic 
guarantee of all victories of the People's Army. 
  The mission of the People's Army to advocate, defend, and 
complete generation after generation the great leader's 
revolutionary cause can be realized only under the party's 
leadership. 
  Leading the cause of military building to victory is not a 
matter that can be fulfilled by anyone. This can be carried out 
only by a military commander who is possessed with a great 
military ideology and extraordinary leadership. 
  Our People's Army grew up to become an invincible 
revolutionary armed force and walked a proud road of victory and 
glory. This cannot be thought about without the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il's trait in which he is leading the 
revolutionary armed force by having both profound ideology and 
theory and tremendous practical capability of a great military 
strategist. 
  Being possessed with a great military ideology is the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's outstanding trait as an 
extraordinary military commander. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is brilliantly 
succeeding, developing, and enriching the great leader's 
chuche-oriented military building ideology. He elucidated the 
fundamental cause of military building in which the master of 
the military work is the Army and masses and the result of the 
military work is decided upon according to the strength of the 
Army and masses. 
  Based on this, along with the principle of self-defense of 
defending our country with its own strength, the dear comrade 
leader bestowed a decisive significance in the soldiers' 
ideological consciousness; carried out all military work by 
enhancing their role of ideological consciousness; and motivated 
the soldiers and masses and presented principles to solve 
military problems in accordance with their country's concrete 
situation. 
  In various historical works of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il such as "On the Chuche Idea," "On Improving and 
Strengthening the Propaganda and Agitation Work Within the 
People's Army," and "Let Us All the More Strengthen the People's 
Army Into Invincible Ranks," he all the more clarified the 
mission and duty of our revolutionary armed force and elucidated 
the strategic and tactical principle of the revolutionary armed 
force building. In addition, based on the great chuche idea he 
newly elucidated systematically and on a full basis all military 
problems such as the viewpoint on war, revolutionary armed force 
building, national defense construction, military strategy, and 
the art of commanding the Army. 
  The method of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea 
occupies an outstanding position in the dear comrade leader's 
military building ideology. The dear comrade leader put forth 
modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea as a 
chuche-oriented Army founding program which the People's Army 
must adhere to. He elucidated the essence of modeling the whole 
Army after the chuche idea. 
  Modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea is to arm all 
the soldiers under the great leader's revolutionary ideology to 
foster them to become a chuche-oriented revolutionary fighter 
and carry out the revolutionary armed force building and all 
military activities in accordance with the demand of the chuche 
idea. 
  By presenting the outstanding strategic method of modeling 
the whole Army after the chuche idea by the dear comrade leader, 
the road to highly uphold the leadership of the party and leader 
with loyalty and to guarantee to the end with force the chuche 
revolutionary cause have been clearly elucidated. 
  Through the dear comrade leader, who is developing and 
enriching the great leader's military building ideology and 
theory, all theoretical and practical problems arising in 
military building, including the fundamental principle of 
military building and military building program, were wholly 
elucidated. Therefore, a firm guiding principle was provided in 
carrying out the revolutionary armed force building and military 
activities in accordance with the demand of the chuche era. 
Also, it was possible for our revolutionary armed force to grow 
into an invincible rank that can defeat any kind of enemy and 
defend ever so strong the party, the leader, the fatherland, and 
revolution. 
  Outstanding and tested leadership is one of the most 
important traits of a commander, and the commander's leadership 
can be said to determine the might of the revolutionary forces. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a military genius 
who 
has boundless military insights, limitless boldness, extensive 
military knowledge, and political insights. He is also a great 
commander who has an art of military operations with which he 
commands all Armed Forces of the country in a unified manner and 
makes them act like one. 
  The dear comrade leader presented a clear struggle slogan 
that the revolutionary Armed Forces must adhere to as a motto 
and noble mission and has strengthened and developed the 
People's Army into a powerful chuche-oriented Army and 
invincible revolutionary Army. 
  The dear comrade leader personally called in a People's 
Armed 
Forces Ministry official on 1 January 1976. With a serious look 
on his face, he told the official that we had many things to do 
in the new year and stressed that it is important to 
continuously and persistently carry out the work to build the 
party's unitary ideological system in the military. He also 
said: Your basic mission, comrades, is to make all soldiers, 
shock brigade members, and do-or-die unit members 
unconditionally carry out any order issued by the leader 
[suryong] -- by even risking their lives. Therefore, you, 
comrades, must better indoctrinate soldiers under the slogan 
"Let us fight for the great leader by even risking our lives!" 
  This slogan presented by the dear comrade leader impressed 
People's Army officers and men. This immortal slogan is 
imprinted at any guardpost in the frontline, coast, and 
mountainous areas; command posts on warships, aircraft cockpits, 
and guardposts at major facilities and vigorously inspires 
People's Army soldiers into the single road of loyalty and 
heroic feats. 
  The outstanding leadership with which one presents a slogan, 
builds the entire Army into a powerful rank, and leads the 
entire Army to fulfill a single purpose is a leadership trait 
that only the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il possesses. 
  Nothing is more fortunate to an army than having a commander 
who has an outstanding art of military operations. Upholding 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme commander is 
a boundless honor and the highest privilege to our people and 
People's Army. 
  Our dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an outstanding 
commander who takes charge of the entire Armed Forces of the 
country in a unified manner, makes the entire Army act like one, 
has a good understanding of everything from operational tactics 
to equipment, and is well versed with all Army, Navy, and Air 
Force branches. 
  The dear comrade leader personally visited the training 
field 
of a unit one day in October 1980. After watching soldiers in 
combat training with satisfaction, the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il said proudly that our People's Army's combat capability 
has been strengthened beyond comparison. He added: If our 
people see the invincible spirits of our People's Army, they 
will be very pleased, but, if the enemy sees them, it will be 
(?horrified). 
  He also gave a great lesson, which is a leading guideline in 
strengthening the People's Army's combat capability. 
  Even professional functionaries could not have imagined 
that the most important question of war victory lies in the 
seemingly ordinary logic set forth by the dear comrade leader. 
  The great military genius, dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
was the only one who gave answers to the victory of war after 
closely analyzing and comprehending all aspects of nature and 
characteristics of modern war from a new angle. His 
extraordinary strategy is a comprehensive reflection of the 
sagacious general's military wisdom, peerless courage, and 
scientific insight. These qualifications and traits can only 
been seen in a veteran of many battles. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a military genius 
and 
matchless sagacious general who long time ago smashed into 
pieces [sansanhi chitpusida] the enemy's reckless war maneuvers 
with wisdom that foresees all troubles and adapts to any 
circumstance. 
  An (?example) was seen a few years ago, when the enemies' 
Team Spirit joint military exercise reached its highest, he 
organized the mobilization of the Korea People's Army [KPA] 
units to one focused place and the enemies were chaotically 
confused. This made the most important part of the exercise 
useless. At another time, the enemies came at us saying they 
would make a preemptive strike. The dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il seized the initiative with one single tactic and 
frightened them away. 
  In March 1993, when the enemies resumed the Team Spirit '93 
joint military exercise, which the enemies had decided to 
suspend temporarily, and drew dark clouds of nuclear war to this 
land, he unsparingly smashed [chitpusida] the war aggression 
maneuver of the enemies, who ran wild without discretion, with 
an order in the name of the supreme commander. 
  Each time the military functionaries see the frosted-pumpkin 
look of the rascals in those right-on-target cases, they could 
not resist admiring the outstanding military sense and brightly 
shining extraordinary strategy of the dear comrade leader, who 
changes adverse circumstance to favorable one all at once by 
gaining supremacy over the enemies with one single blow. 
  Our revolutionary forces' supreme commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, is a great military genius who always leads our 
revolutionary armed forces to the single road of victory with 
outstanding military ideology, military wisdom that foresees a 
thousand ri ahead, and extraordinary military training skill, 
and an indomitable sagacious general who grips the enemies in 
one catch and tosses them around with fantastic strategies and 
tactics, and unique war method. 
  His respected name is indeed a brilliant symbol of spirit, 
dignity, hope, and victory of the ever-victorious invincible 
people and the People's Army. Endless is the glory of our 
people and the People's Army because we have the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme commander of our 
revolutionary armed forces. Wide open is the road of glorious 
and brilliant victory for our people and the People's Army 
because of his leadership.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
runs an article titled "High Glory in Having Great Genius of 
Thought and Theory" contributed by Dr. Chong Kwan-yong. 
  The article says: 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed undying 
ideological and theoretical exploits for human history of 
thought by propounding great idea and theories with his rare 
intelligence and scientific penetration. 
  It is the highest glory of the Korean people to have 
acclaimed the great thinker and theoretician possessed of 
extraordinary ideological and theoretical intelligence 
unparalleled in the world. 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il is exalting the chuche idea of our 
party as the great guiding idea of the era of independence by 
conducting ideological and theoretical activities with his 
unusual pursuit and energy." 
  The article continues: 
  What is important in the idea and theories of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il is that they are run through with uniqueness and 
contemporariness. He makes all his ideological and theoretical 
pursuits and thinking with innovative views and creative stand 
on the basis of the requirements of the time which is changing 
and developing. 
  The intelligence of the dear leader in making ideological 
and 
theoretical analysis and explanation in conformity with the time 
and reality finds an expression in that he reviews the history 
of the revolutionary ideas of the working class from the 
viewpoint of the times and raises and evolves ideas and theories 
in a unique way. 
  Notably, he expounded from a new angle that the 
revolutionary 
idea of the great Comrade Kim Il-song is composed of the 
man-centred philosophical world outlook, the revolutionary 
theory centred on the popular masses and the method of mass 
leadership. This is, indeed, a unique discovery. 
  When the imperialists were vociferating about the "end of 
socialism", the dear leader clearly indicated the strategy and 
tactics to frustrate the anti-socialist moves, defend the 
socialist cause and carry it through to accomplishment. This is 
an incomparable exploit he has performed for mankind. 
  As long as there is the idea and theories of the dear leader 
characteristic of creation and innovation, the Korean people 
will advance along the road of victory and accomplish the cause 
of socialism without any turns and twists, no matter how the 
situation and the circumstances and conditions of the revolution 
may change. 
  An important characteristic of Comrade Kim Chong-il's idea 
and theories is that they are run through with most profound 
pursuit and analysis, rich and diverse contents and are strongly 
expressive of clairvoyant ideological and theoretical 
intelligence and scientific foresight. 
  The capacity of pursuit and analysis of Comrade Kim Chong-il 
is really extraordinary and distinguished. Deeply penetrating 
thinking, pursuit of discovering new truth by comparing, 
analysing, reasoning and combining problems and the perfection 
and plainness of easy-to-understand logics -- these are the 
ideological and theoretical gifts of the dear leader. 
  He gives many clear-cut ideological and theoretical answers 
with rich and deep knowledge about the work of the party and 
people's power, the work of working people's organisations and 
defence building, industry and agriculture, construction and 
other domains, philosophy, political economy, history, 
literature and all other spheres. 
  He has extraordinary intelligence and far-sightness looking 
farther ahead than any other and indicating the road of victory. 
  He looks forward to a distant future from the present-day 
situation and the trend of the developing revolution, count ten 
and a hundred out of one practical fact and set forth a correct 
idea and theory. 
  The rare clairvoyance of the dear leader is always accurate 
and most correct because it is based on a scientific penetration 
relying upon the aspirations of the popular masses and the law 
governing social development. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il is not only possessed of gifted 
ideological and theoretical intelligence and quality but also 
has conducted tireless ideological and theoretical activities. 
  His rare intelligence and energetic ideological and 
theoretical activities have brought a great reality, 
demonstrating an invincible vitality in the accomplishment of 
the cause of socialism. 
  Korea has been able to successfully build socialism centred 
on the popular masses, going through rough storms of the 
revolution because the dear leader comprehensively systematized 
the chuche idea and developed it in depth in conformity with the 
developing reality and glorified it as the great guiding idea of 
the era of independence and has armed the people firmly with it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
devotes nearly one whole page to a signed article titled "Our 
Party is Impregnable". 
  It says that the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] is an 
impregnable one because its idea is great, its faith and will is 
incomparably strong and it is united in one mind. 
  In the first part, the article says that the WPK is a party 
with a great idea. 
  It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "The chuche idea, the world outlook of our party, is the 
guiding idea of our times which indicates the most correct way 
of achieving the independence of the popular masses." 
  The article continues: 
  The unique guiding idea of our party is the immortal chuche 
idea, the idea and theory developed and perfected by Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The idea and theory of our party is an ever-victorious 
banner 
leading the struggle of the popular masses of the present era 
for achieving their independence to victory and is a strategy 
and tactics of the revolution for defeating imperialism and 
accomplishing the cause of socialism, the human cause of 
independence. As it has the great idea and theory bearing the 
August name of dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, our party is so great 
and is an invincible revolutionary party which does not waver in 
any storm. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has comprehensively systematized and 
solved all the theoretical and practical questions arising in 
revolutionary party building including the question of 
conducting party construction and activities with the chuche 
idea as the guideline, the policy of building the party into a 
mass party for the working people and firmly guaranteeing the 
uniformity of thought and leadership within the party, the 
policy of taking the unity and cohesion of the party as a basic 
task of its building and building it up with main emphasis laid 
on thought and the question of realising the exclusive sway of 
one idea and definitely ensuring the political leadership over 
the whole society. 
  With this chuche-based idea of party building propounded by 
the dear leader, our party has been able to conduct its building 
and activities without the slightest deviation or twists and 
turns, and steadfastly defend its revolutionary character. 
  With the great idea, our party is further consolidating its 
organisational and ideological foundations, consolidating and 
developing its singlehearted unity and successfully paving the 
road of socialism, overcoming whatever trials and obstacles. 
  In the second part, the article says the WPK has an 
unshakable faith and will. 
  It continues: 
  All the activities and struggles of our party today are 
based 
on the firm resolve to follow the path of chuche opened by the 
great leader and the unshakable faith and will to lead the 
people to accomplish the cause of socialism. 
  Its faith and will are not shaken in acute political, 
military and ideological confrontation with the enemy and get 
stronger with the change of generations and the advance of the 
revolution. 
  With an indomitable faith and will, our party has become a 
great party which courageously smashes the imperialists' 
anti-socialist campaign and turns adversity into bliss. 
  It is the staunch stamina of the Workers' Party of Korea 
guided by General Kim Chong-il, an iron-willed brilliant 
commander, to counter arrogant pressure from the imperialists 
with an indomitable spirit and frustrate the 
counter-revolutionary offensive with a revolutionary offensive. 
  For its unshakable faith and will, our party has always been 
tough and resolute in confrontation with the imperialists. 
  Our party with firm revolutionary faith and will is 
displaying its grand appearance as a most revolutionary party 
which does not retreat a step from the revolutionary principle. 
  Its firm revolutionary position is that a principle 
certainly 
wins and that the fundamental idea and demand of socialism can 
never change even if the situation and conditions of 
revolutionary struggle may change. 
  For this firm faith and will, our party has become a 
revolutionary party with an invincible might which fulfills any 
vast task in socialist construction. 
  Our party carries into practice whatever it wishes to do, 
and 
carries to completion whatever it has started. 
  In the third part, the article says the WPK is a party 
united 
in one mind. 
  It continues: 
  The might of its singlehearted unity is demonstrated in that 
the entire members of the party have an absolute worship of 
their leader, deeply revering and following him, and move as one 
with strong organisation and discipline in accordance with the 
leader's idea and will. 
  Our party has the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the 
centre of unity and leadership, so the bonds between the leader 
and his men are unbreakable. These bonds are based on an 
absolute worship of their leader. 
  In our party, the leader's decision represents that of the 
entire membership. All the party members speak the same words 
and walk in the same manner. 
  The invincible might of our party deeply rooted among the 
popular masses including workers, peasants, soldiers and 
intellectuals is being fully demonstrated in the revolution and 
construction.

and those participated in debates said that great progress has

more firmly established in the publications, press, and literary 
and art sectors, in particular, and that propaganda work to 
vigorously inspire the masses into the revolution and 
construction should be actively waged, thereby seeing to it that 
newspapers, press, broadcasting, publications, and literary and 
art works can smoothly perform their mission and duty as our 
party's ideological weapon. They noted that to wage ideological

work and wage the work in conformity with the characteristics of 
the target of the ideological work and with specific situation 
and in the manner of the anti-Japanese guerrillas.

position and duty and improve, strengthen the party's 
ideological work in conformity with the demands of the 
developing realities, and, thus, more vigorously accelerate the

  [Text] A trial run of a new type of streetcar and 
underground electric railcar, produced at the Kim Chong-tae 
electric locomotive general enterprise, has been successfully 
carried out. The trial run made on several occasions covered the 
long distance from Mangyongdae District's Songsan to Sopyongyang 
Stations passing by Potonggang District's Kwangbok, Red and 
(Kyongun) Streets. All of the streetcar's operative functions 
and spare parts operated smoothly in accordance with the 
technological demand. The streetcar moved swiftly and this made 
the people happy. 
  By upholding the party's intention of developing the 
country's transportation and freighting system, and providing 
safer and more comfortable transportation conditions, the 
workers of the Kim Chong-tae electric locomotive general 
enterprise highly manifested the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude to make a new type streetcar and 
underground electric railcar in just 70 days. They also 
successfully guaranteed the trial run of the streetcar and 
underground electric railcar. 
  The streetcar was manufactured and completed safely in 
accordance with the topography of the capital and the passenger 
demand. According to the automatic operation of the streetcar, 
all the electric equipment and damping devices were operated 
smoothly from the first trial run. 
  In particular, the efficiency of the starting apparatus, 
made 
by introducing the structural method of the electric circuit in 
accordance with our country's situation, was very good. This 
made it possible for the traction electric motor's starter to 
move freely, and firmly guaranteed its operation's reliability 
and safety. 
  The underground electric railcar also had a successful trial 
run covering many blocks. All the elements including the 
traction part, electronic equipment, damping device, and buffer 
device operated normally. 
  In the vigorous road of the overall march of socialism of 
our 
own style, our heroic working class magnificently produced a 
modern streetcar and underground electric railcar through their 
own strength, technology, and material, and successfully 
guaranteed the trial run. This has made the mass production of 
the vehicles possible to develop the country's transportation 
and freighting system. It is also of great significance because 
it provides safer and more comfortable transportation conditions 
and cultivated living conditions for the people. 
  The streetcar and underground electric railcar, which will 
actively contribute to displaying the might of the country's 
self-dependent national economy and developing the capital's 
transportation and freighting, will soon go into mass production.

  [Text] Two more Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, 
PBS] state assemblymen today quit the party which has now lost 
its majority in the state legislative assembly. Deputy Chief 
Minister Datuk Chau Tet Onn and the assemblyman for Sembulan, 
Encik [Mr.] Chau Chin Tang, who announced their resignations 
from the PBS at a press conference at the Istana Hotel in Kuala 
Lumpur, said they will join Barisan Nasional [National Front, 
BN]. 
  Chau, the assemblyman for Api-Api, said he was joining the 
Liberal Democratic Party, LDP, a component of the BN. 
  They were the latest two defections of the three-week old 
PBS 
state government led by Chief Minister Datuk Joseph Pairin 
Kitingan, who lost its majority in the state assembly made up of 
48 elected representatives and six nominated assemblymen. 
  The defections of PBS assemblymen since Saturday reduced the 
PBS majority of 25 elected representatives and six nominated 
assemblymen to 24 seats -- five of them nominated members 
compared with 40 for BN. 
  The PBS, which won 25 seats in the state election on 18 and 
19 of last month giving it a simple majority, formed the new 
government on the 22d and appointed six more assemblymen as 
provided for under the state constitution. 
  Meanwhile, Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan has confirmed that he 
will lead the newly formed Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah [United 
Sabah People's Party] and which is to be launched in Kota 
Kinabalu today. He told newsmen before leaving Kuala Lumpur for 
Kota Kinabalu that the new party will be a multi-racial party 
and will apply to join the Barisan Nasional. Datuk Dr. Jeffrey 
will explain to the people of Sabah as to why he is taking such 
a move. He will also brief his brother, Datuk Joseph Pairin 
Kitingan, of his intention to leave PBS and join the new party.

  [Text] The Barisan Nasional [National Front, BN] will wait 
for a right time to approach Sabah Governor Tun Mohamed Said 
Keruak to form a new state government in accordance with the 
Constitution. The situation is not clear yet. Prime Minister 
Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the BN will have a majority in the 
State Legislative Assembly following the crossing-over of 
several Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, PBS] 
assemblymen and the formation of Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan of a 
new party which wants to join the BN. He told newsmen after 
holding a Hari Raya [end of fasting month] open house at Sri 
Perdana for VIP guests that the BN will implement its manifesto. 
The first sitting of the Sabah State Assembly after last 
month's state elections is slated for Friday. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir, who is also UMNO [United Malays 
National Organization] president, said the PBS now has less than 
half the number of seats in the assembly even with the inclusion 
of six appointed assemblymen. He also warned that 
three-quarters of the PBS assemblymen are expected to switch to 
the BN. 
  The prime minister also said the BN will approve the 
application by the new Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah [United Sabah 
People's Party, PBRS] to join the coalition. The PBRS was 
launched today in Kota Kinabalu with Joseph Kurup as pro-tem 
president and Dr. Jeffrey as its deputy. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir 
said the BN would fulfill its promise to rotate the chief 
minister's post among the three major groups in the state with 
each leader serving a two-year term. When asked to comment on 
his meeting with Bingkor State Assemblyman Datuk Dr. Jeffrey 
Kitingan at Sri Perdana last night, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said 
no specific decision was made. He, however, pointed out that 
all agree to form a government that is responsible and works 
together with the Sabahans and not by a small group only.

  [Text] At a recent meeting, a group of FUNCINPEC [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] MP's reportedly asked: What is the 
purpose of puppet Hun Sen's visit to the king on 15 March? Some 
said as the Tokyo conference had already ended, Hun Sen will go 
to ask the king to dismiss Sam Rangsi as finance minister and 
replace him with puppet Cham Prasit [state secretary for 
finance], who will heartlessly extort money from the people. 
Moreover, with Cham Prasit as finance minister, Hun Sen can 
spend financial aid at will. 
  Others said: Today, he asks the king to remove Sam Rangsi; 
tomorrow, he will ask for the dismissal of others who have not 
surrendered to him. In the end, he will control, then 
completely eradicate FUNCINPEC. This shows that the only thing 
Vietnamese communist Hun Sen understands is destruction, not 
national reconciliation or national unification. He also 
understands only the Vietnamese communists' dictatorship. As 
for Prince Ranariddh, all he can do is bow and scrape before him. 
  The MP's further said that Prince Ranariddh was well aware 
of 
this move because he was colluding with Hun Sen to remove Sam 
Rangsi. But he will not go to Beijing as he is afraid of being 
seen as too obviously involved in the matter. 
  Some other MP's said Hun Sen's visit was to ask the king to 
grant him the title of Samdech Krompreah. Prince Ranariddh is 
afraid of him, so why should the prince have a higher title than 
he? Moreover, he also wants to have a higher title than that of 
puppet Chea Sim and puppet Heng Samrin. The MP's added that Hun 
Sen will certainly boast that he had won this or that victory 
and will threaten the king not to achieve national 
reconciliation. Puppet Hun Sen is extremely insolent, so he 
will resort to this method, no matter what. He knows nothing 
about right and wrong since he totally obeys the orders of the 
Vietnamese communists, his masters. 
  In sum, puppet Hun Sen's visit to the king is not to seek a 
solution, but to create more problems for FUNCINPEC and our 
nation and people. He never thinks about national 
reconciliation or peace. He thinks only about reinforcing and 
expanding his Vietnamese communist power and threatening the 
king so he can eliminate resistance forces and other national 
forces with the aim of doing away with the Cambodian nation and 
race. 
  The nation and people are keeping an eye on the farce.

  [Text] There are reports saying that on 4 March, troops of 
communist Vietnam's puppets and the two-headed government 
launched a four-pronged attack against the people in the areas 
on both side of Route 10 in Battambang Province. 
  The first prong moved from Kamping Puoy toward Don Peou; the 
second prong from Treng toward Veal Thom and Buo Charak hill; 
the third prong from Sdau toward Neang Len hill; and the fourth 
prong from Snoeng toward Buon Chuo. 
  The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
[NADK] cooperated and smashed and routed this attack on the 
evening of the same day. We killed 53 enemy soldiers on the 
spot, including a colonel, two majors, and three lieutenants and 
wounded a great number of others. We destroyed 35 assorted 
weapons and some assorted ammunition and seized 15 AK's, three 
B-40's, a 60-mm mortar, and some ammunition. 
  On 8 March, troops of communist Vietnam's puppets and the 
two-headed government launched a two-pronged second attack along 
Route 10. The first prong moved from Treng toward Tuol village 
on Route 10 and the second from Kamping Puoy and Chrouy Sna 
toward Kaoh Chen Don Peou. The people and the NADK cooperated 
and completely routed this attack for the second time. We 
killed or wounded over 80 enemy soldiers; destroyed 31 assorted 
weapons and a quantiy of other war materiel; and seized 49 
assorted weapons and some ammunition. 
  Concerning the above attacks, people clearly know that the 
puppets of communist Vietnam and the two-headed government 
continuee to fuel the war of the communist Vietnamese 
aggressors; they do not want national reconciliation and peace.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Time Has Come for Australia To Cease its </F>
Suspicion of Indonesia"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday 23 February, Australian Defense 
Minister Robert Ray announced Australia's plan to expand its 
naval base in north Australia. The objective is to accommodate 
its large warships, particularly the Navy's 1,200-ton patrol 
vessels. He stated that Australia's northern region will 
definitely remain as the most important and strategic base for 
its Armed Forces. Apart from this, the development of 
infrastructure for its Navy will enable the country to launch 
more effective maritime operations. 
  A before the announcement, Defense Minister Ray stressed 
that 
Indonesia is a "key nation" for Australia, in its strategic 
alliance, along with the other countries in the Asia-Pacific 
region. He presented a 75-page doctrine on security which for 
the first time unfolded the regional security situation since 
the end of the Cold War. He said other nations should first 
override Indonesia as an effort toward "assuring" the region's 
security. This means that our national and regional defense 
will be able to endure and suppress any ideological or physical 
threat. 
  In December 1993, Australia's neighbor New Zealand, viewed 
with less importance the security in its northern region. 
According to their Defense Minister Gerald Hensley, his 
country's military was more concerned over the huge purchase of 
weapons by Asia-Pacific countries. He believes that these 
countries will continue their arms build-up at an annual rate of 
U.S.$131 billion until 1995. He also stated that by the end of 
the decade, the maritime network SLOC (Sea Lanes of 
Communication) [preceding expansion in English], which connects 
New Zealand and the rest of the Asian countries, will be 
patrolled by 1,800 modern Navy patrol craft, three dozen 
submarines, and 200 modern warships. 
  Presently, most Australians believe that Indonesia forms a 
"threat from the north" and which still harbors a secret 
ambition of attacking the country. Whether we like it or not, 
we must accept this -- the same suspicion we had regarding China 
as our threat from the north. 
  Australian and New Zealand officials are relentlessly 
embarking on diplomatic efforts toward forging more cordial 
relations regarding the Asia-Pacific region's security issues -- 
particularly with Indonesia. Australia and New Zealand, as the 
only "white group" in the region, have indicated their desire to 
lessen their dependence on the West, especially the United 
States and Britain. In this context, we observed that the ANZUS 
(Australia, New Zealand and the United States) military pact has 
become less effective. The two nations have increased their 
military cooperation through FPDA (Five Power Defense 
Arrangement), which also groups two other Asian nations -- 
Malaysia and Singapore. 
  We also know of Australia's series of foreign policies which 
point to its good intentions of being identified as one of the 
countries belonging to the Asian grouping which undertakes the 
task of hastening the peace process in Cambodia; proposing 
reforms in APEC through cooperation [preceding word in English] 
toward becoming a community [preceding word in English]; 
advocating the desire of establishing an Asia-Pacific peace 
group to carry out the responsibility of maintaining 
international peace and security; and urge Australia's 
formidable opposition party, the Labor Party, to induce Prime 
Minister Paul Keating into fostering military cooperation with 
ASEAN. 
  Currently, Australia has also become one of the potential 
countries selling weapons to Asia-Pacific countries. Indonesia 
-- along with South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia -- 
are attracted and are considering purchasing the diesel-powered 
Swedish designed Collins class submarine. As the Australian 
Navy is also operating this submarine, it could be considered 
that the sale is one of the efforts in the sale of "standard" 
military weapons to the region, a proposition currently being 
discussed by the region's major governments. Apart from this, 
Australia has a vision to become the Asia-Pacific region's 
submarine production center. 
  Australia and Indonesia held their joint land military 
exercises in 1993 involving a number of their special task 
forces personnel. The two countries also held a 10-day joint 
naval exercise in August 1993. Two thousand personnel, 14 
warships and six fighter aircraft from the two countries 
participated in the exercise -- the biggest joint military 
exercise held over the past 10 years. A joint air exercise was 
also conducted in November 1993 in Sumatera where Australia's 
F-18 Hornets and Indonesia's F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft 
participated. 
  Following this, an annual bilateral meeting on defense 
cooperation was held in Jakarta centered on restructuring 
defense relations with Indonesia. The restructuring is aimed at 
establishing a formal defense cooperation structure similar to 
that which Australia has with Malaysia and Singapore. It is also 
understood that Indonesian troops will be invited to participate 
in the upcoming land military exercise to be hosted by Australia 
in north Australia. Even though criticism was hurled at the 
Indonesian Government by the Australian press, 
Indonesia-Australia defense cooperation, nonetheless, continues 
to remain intact since 1986. 
  The time has come for Australians to eliminate all their 
suspicions about Indonesia being a potential threat given the 
above facts. Meeting with the visiting Australian Navy chief, 
Al Beaumont, at Bina Palace last year, President Suharto gave 
the assurance that Indonesia poses no threat to its neighbors 
and has no intention to threaten any other nations as this is in 
accordance with its defense and security policy. The assurance 
was issued within the context of Indonesia's purchase of 39 
former East German warships which spontaneously created undue 
concern even though such a purchase was in line with Indonesia's 
need. 
  It is true that the regional security situation is 
unpredictable during the post-Cold War era. Therefore, this 
will be the first occasion where ASEAN nations can freely and 
openly discuss issues pertaining to regional politics and 
security during the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in June in 
Bangkok. During the session, ASEAN foreign ministers have the 
opportunity to meet and hold discussions with their dialogue 
partners, including Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, 
known for his active participation in discussions on politics 
and security. This will be a good opportunity for Australia to 
grasp and assimilate political and security nuances in the 
Asia-Pacific region which will not be restructured by any 
Western influence. 
  It can be clearly perceived that the Indonesia-Australia 
bilateral security cooperation continues to remain good. 
Australia's participation in the ARF has also indicated that it 
will greatly benefit by understanding "Asian trends" -- that is, 
if it still desires to be integrated into the Asian region. But 
all this will still prove inadequate until the Australian 
Government can convince its people that the Indonesian 
Government is not expansionist. We have been waiting for a long 
time for such a declaration. Such an announcement will enable 
us to further smooth and improve existing bilateral relations 
and defense cooperation.

  [Text] Minister of Justice Oetojo Oesman, SH [Master of 
Laws], confirmed that the government has not issued a permit 
allowing the Indonesian Legal Aid Society (LBH) to visit the 
convict Jose Alexandre Xanana Gusmao. The government, in 
particular the Department of Justice, would like to know exactly 
why the LBH is interested in visiting the prisoner. 
  Minister of Justice Oetojo Oesman made this statement in 
response to questions from the press in Sukabumi on Thursday (3 
February). The press asked about the decision to postpone the 
visit to Xanana and about letters from the Indonesian Legal Aid 
Society requesting permission to see Xanana at the Cipinang 
Penitentiary. 
  As has been reported, the YLBHI [Indonesian Legal Aid 
Society] wrote Prof Dr Baharuddin Lopa, SH, Director General of 
Prisons, two times asking for permission to meet with Xanana in 
Cipinang. Dr Adnan Buyung Nasution, SH, chairman of the YLBHI, 
sent the first letter several weeks ago, after first submitting 
a verbal request. Since there was no response to the verbal and 
written requests, Buyung then wrote to Director General Lopa 
again asking when his group could meet with Xanana Gusmao. The 
letter, written on YLBHI letter-head, was signed by Adnan Buyung 
Nasution, Chairman of YLBHI's Executive Board, and by Secretary 
Frans Hendra Winarta, SH. "But since we haven't gotten an answer 
we wrote him again," said Frans. 
  Minister of Justice Oetojo said that it would be prudent to 
see these problems from the proper perspective considering the 
judicial regulations involved; the question is who is allowed to 
deal with or visit the inmate, for example, because that is a 
matter of judicial regulations. In general, only family members, 
close friends and attorneys handling the case are allowed to 
visit an inmate in the penitentiary. 
  It would also be a good thing to ask why the LBH is 
interested in visiting Xanana. Do they just want to see how 
Xanana is doing or do they have some direct interest in the case 
or not. "Meaning, it's OK for LBH to go see Xanana Gusmao, but 
what do they want to see?" he asked. 
  If, for example, Oetojo continued, they want to ask whether 
Jose Xanana Gusmao's trial was valid or not, or if they want to 
ask whether there were any judicial errors made during his 
trial, clearly they will not be given permission. Because 
Xanana's trial is over, the results are in force; it has the 
permanent force of law and can no longer be questioned from a 
judicial point of view. Moreover, as we know, Xanana submitted a 
request for clemency (a request for forgiveness) to the 
president. The president accepted this request for clemency and 
he commuted Xanana Gusmao's original life sentence to twenty 
years in prison. 
  So, Oetojo said, the Department of Justice will decide 
whether YLBHI's request falls into one of the categories just 
mentioned. If they just want to visit, that's OK, but what's 
their direct interest in the matter, Oetojo asked. 
  The press asked why two special envoys from the UN Secretary 
General were allowed to visit Xanana Gusmao. When they made 
their visit on Monday, 24 January, the policy of postponing 
visits to Xanana was still in effect (up to 9 February - 
editor)--and yet now the LBH is not given permission. Oetojo 
said the situations were different. 
  Oetojo said that the visit made by the two special envoys 
from the UN Secretary General had been planned long ago and had 
been programmed far in advance. In addition, the two envoys, 
Francesc [as published] Vendrell and Tamrat Samuel, had not only 
visited Xanana Gusmao but had also looked at general conditions 
in the Cipinang Penitentiary and had visited other inmates.

  [Excerpts] The Jakarta Stock Exchange is entering the 
modern era. Since the end of January, a big change has been 
attempted in the exchange's trading system. Indonesian Stock 
Clearing and Deposit Inc (KDEI) has been in official operation 
helping brokers to expedite day-to-day trading. The KDEI will 
handle all the details relating to the completion of 
transactions. 
  In that way, less of a burden will be placed on the brokers. 
All they have to do is trade; they no longer have to dun the 
buyer for payment. On the other hand, the buyer will not have to 
chase after the seller to transfer the stocks. KDEI will take 
care of all those matters. Four days after a transaction takes 
place, the selling broker can ask KDEI for payment, and all the 
buyer has to do is take possession of the stocks. 
  At first this so-called settlement process will only be 
applied to five stocks--Indah Kiat, Barito Pacific, Tjiwi 
Chemicals, Pan Brothers and Dharmala. These five stocks have 
dominated the market for the past three months. "They account 
for 30 percent of all transactions," said Cyril Nurhadi, 
managing director of KDEI. Next June KDEI hopes to handle all 
transactions on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. 
  KDEI will use computers to handle these settlements, which 
can be very complex. Computers will not only execute the 
settlements but will also handle the bidding process. [passage 
omitted] 
  As a pilot project, Hasan Zein Mahmud, managing director of 
the Jakarta Stock Exchange (BEJ), has been using a computer to 
implement the bidding on 72 stocks which are not traded very 
much and which are also known as "sleeper stocks". For this 
trial, BEJ employees wrote a simple program themselves," said 
Hasan. This is meant to be a way of getting ourselves used to 
the computer. 
  This simple program will be replaced by a sophisticated 
program which will merge the BEJ and KDEI computer networks. 
Everything, from the trade to the settlement, will be handled by 
electronic signals running through thousands of slender cables. 
The BEJ has appointed Berca Inc to computerize the system. 
  Berca Inc, which is owned by the businessman Murdaya Poo, 
submitted the winning low bid of $3.45 million. "This is cheap 
because it includes all the computer hardware," Hasan explained. 
It is said that the next lowest bid was three times higher than 
Berca Inc's. 
  However, this doesn't mean that everything is perfect. As 
was 
mentioned above, the BEJ wants the computers to be in operation 
by June 1994. Transactions, now valued at more than 100 billion 
rupiahs per day, cannot only be done by hand. 
  Problems might arise because the BEJ will not be in its 
present building, located at the corner of Merdeka Selatan 
Street and where the computers have been installed, for much 
longer. It has been reported that the lease on the building will 
not be renewed and that the BEJ will have to move into a new 
building on Sudirman Street, Jakarta, which is now being readied 
for the future site of the exchange. Of course it is not very 
efficient to install the computers and all their cables and 
networks and then three months later to dismantle them because 
the BEJ has to move. It has been estimated that at least 200 
million rupiahs will be wasted. [passage omitted] 
  Another problem is that the computers will be put through a 
three-month testing period in the old building. An expert in 
capital markets thinks that computers must be tested for at 
least one year while transactions are being executed. 
  "This is necessary in order to test the various scenarios 
which might arise on the market. Otherwise, if the system goes 
down and the market comes to a halt, the reputation of the 
Jakarta Stock Exchange can suffer," he said. Besides that, 
"Stock transactions on the primary market must be part of the 
computer's agenda," said J. A. Sereh, a broker who used to be 
the managing director of Danareksa Inc. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vientiane, March 12 (KPL) -- A ceremony of handing 
over of the Japanese assisted agricultural and rural development 
project at KM-6/Tha Ngon, an outskirts of Vientiane city was 
held yesterday. Taking part in the ceremony were Mr. Phimpha 
Thepkhamheuang, deputy minister of agriculture and forestry, Mr. 
Masao Wada, ambassador of Japan to Laos, Mr. Boun-gnang 
Volachit, mayor of Vientiane and other high ranking officials. 
  The project received a grant aid of 2,212 million yens from 
the Japanese government and an input of 128 million kip from the 
Lao government. The construction of this integrated rural 
development project, one of the main national scale development 
projects in the country, started in 1991. By the beginning of 
this year, it is basically finished. 
  The main pumping station houses five pumps so far four have 
been installed. The facility has a 95,600-metre principal canal 
network. Of this 9,415 m is made of concrete. The secondary 
canals are over 71,000-m long. There are 915 sluices. Roads 
along the canal network are 108,600-m long. In addition, water 
reservoirs and drinking water system have been established in 
Ban Sai, Ban Na Ke, and Don Noun. A three kilometre 
inter-village dirt road and a water control reservoir system 
have been built. The latter covers an area of almost six 
hectares. 
  The facilities can irrigate 1,000 ha of arable land in 
Saithani District and 200-700 ha in Saisettha District, in all 
1,700 ha. For this current dry season, 112 ha can be planted 
with second rice crops, in addition to six hectares of land for 
vegetable gardening. 
  The purpose of the establishment of this integrated rural 
development project is to provide farmers facilities to plant 
two rice crops per year. Along with this, they can engage in 
agriculture and livestock activities all year round. It is hoped 
that the project can provide food stuff to Vientiane Prefecture 
market and step by step the project's products may be exported. 
The facilities should allow farmers in the project area to 
generate more income, thus their living condition can be 
improved. The project also provides water for drinking and makes 
rural communities more accessible.

<F P=106> ["Press Release" on the 5 to 7 March visit to the Lao </F>
People's Democratic Republic by a high-level delegation of the 
National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia headed by Chairman 
Samdech Chea Sim -- dated 7 March] 
  [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Saman 
Vi-gnaket, chairman of the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR] National Assembly, H.E. Chea Sim, chairman of the Kingdom 
of Cambodia [KC] National Assembly, led a high-level KC National 
Assembly delegation on an official friendship visit to the LPDR 
from 5 to 7 March 1994. 
  During their visit, Samdech Chea Sim and delegation paid 
separate courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan and H.E. 
Khamtai Siphandon, respectively president and prime minister of 
the LPDR. 
  During the courtesy calls, H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan stressed 
that Lao-Cambodian ties consist of fine relations of friendship, 
fraternal solidarity, neighborliness, and comradeship. The 
traditional fine relations and cooperation between the two 
countries have existed since ancient times. The peoples of the 
two countries have practiced similar customs and traditions, 
ardently given support and assistance to each other, and shared 
weal and woe both during the periods of struggle against 
colonialism and neocolonialism and of national defense and 
national construction in each country. H.E. Khamtai Siphandon 
regarded that in the new period, there is a need to further 
strengthen the long-standing traditional relations of 
friendship, solidarity, and multifaceted cooperation between the 
LPDR and the KC in coordinating with each other to improve and 
readjust the forms and methods of cooperation for better harmony 
and higher efficiency for the immediate and long- term common 
and individual interests. This will ardently conform to the 
ever-increasing strong aspirations of the peoples of Laos and 
Cambodia in building their respective countries with peace, 
national independence, and prosperity. 
  The receptions and conversations between the hosts and 
guests 
were permeated with an atmosphere of profound friendship from 
beginning to end. 
  Samdech Chea Sim and delegation laid a wreath at the 
Monument 
of Unknown Combatants and visited many places of economic and 
cultural significance in Vientiane capital and Vientiane 
Province. Wherever Samdech Chea Sim and delegation visited, 
they were given a warm and intimate welcome by the local 
administrations, authorities, and Lao residents. 
  A meeting between the KC National Assembly delegation headed 
by Samdech Chea Sim and the LPDR National Assembly delegation 
headed by H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket to exchange views on the 
situation took place at the Lao National Assembly in Vientiane 
capital in an atmosphere of friendship, sincerity, and mutual 
understanding. At the meeting, the two sides informed each 
other of outstanding situations in their respective countries 
and exchanged views on the strengthening of relations and 
cooperation between the two countries and between the two 
legislative organizations. They exchanged views on regional and 
international issues of mutual interest. The Lao side regarded 
that the official friendship visit by Samdech Chea Sim and 
delegation constituted a gesture of historic significance, 
contributing to strengthening and multiplying the intimate, 
normal relations which have existed since ancient times between 
Laos and Cambodia. At the same time, it also wholeheartedly 
hailed the increasing achievements of the implementation of the 
Paris agreement, which is the process of achieving peace and 
national reconciliation in Cambodia; as well as the successful 
National Assembly elections; the endorsement and promulgation of 
the new Constitution; the revival of the constitutional 
monarchy; the return to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia by 
Samdech Norodom Sihanouk who has played the supreme, historical 
role in realizing the unification, peace, political stability, 
national reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction; and 
the establishment of the Government of the KC. 
  The Lao side highly assessed the role of the KC National 
Assembly in the process of national reconciliation and in 
developing and building the KC into an independent, peaceful, 
neutral, nonaligned, and prosperous country. 
  Samdech Chea Sim and delegation hailed the great 
achievements in various fields made by the Lao Government and 
people, noting that such successes have been scored thanks to 
the policy of principled and all-around restructuring under the 
clear- and far-sighted leadership of the Lao People's 
Revolutionary Party. He also hailed the role of the LPDR NA in 
building and broadening the popular democratic regime, carrying 
out socioeconomic development, and pursuing the broad foreign 
policy of peace, independence, friendship, and cooperation, 
thereby ardently contributing to turning Laos into a country of 
peace, independence, democracy, unification, and prosperity. 
  The two sides expressed satisfaction with the traditional 
fine relations of friendship which have continued for centuries 
and have thus been worthy of being good-neighborly countries 
which have practiced cooperation in many fields. They see a 
need to incessantly multiply and increase such relations and 
cooperation on the basis of the principles of respect for each 
other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; 
noninterference in each other's internal affairs; refraining 
from the use force and coercion; resolving all problems between 
the two countries peacefully; cooperation; equality; and mutual 
benefits. They regarded the exchange of visits of the high-level 
delegations headed by the prime ministers of the two countries; 
the Laos- Cambodia joint statement issued in July 1993; and the 
Laos-Cambodia joint declaration and the agreement on economic, 
scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation between the two 
countries signed by the two governments in Phnom Penh in 
November 1993 as very significant to the relations and 
cooperation between Laos and Cambodia in the new period. 
  The two sides were unanimous in planning to set up a 
friendship association between the LPDR National Assembly and 
the KC National Assembly to exchange delegations at various 
levels, and to assist each other in the sphere of legislative 
work on a regular basis. 
  The two sides share a common aim of establishing close 
relations and cooperation with the legislative institutions of 
other countries in the region and the Interparliamentary Union 
to contribute to turning Southeast Asia into a region of peace, 
friendship, and cooperation. 
  The Lao side expressed extreme appreciation with the success 
of the visit to the LPDR this time by Samdech Chea Sim and 
delegation, terming it a new glorious milestone in the history 
of relations between the two legislative institutions as well as 
the two countries. 
  Samdech Chea Sim and delegation highly valued the success of 
the visit and expressed profound thanks to the Lao National 
Assembly and people for having accorded an intimate welcome 
filled with a spirit of fraternal warmth and good neighborliness 
to the KC National Assembly delegation during its official 
friendship visit to the LPDR. On behalf of the KC National 
Assembly, Chairman Samdech Chea Sim extended an invitation to 
H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the LPDR National Assembly, 
and delegation to pay an official friendship visit to the KC. 
The chairman expressed his thanks to Samdech Chea Sim and 
accepted the invitation with pleasure. The time and date of the 
visit will be notified to the Cambodian side through diplomatic 
channels.

  [Text] Thailand is seeking to become a coordination centre 
for intellectual property protection in the region, Deputy 
Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said yesterday. Mr Churin 
said he will discuss the issue with the Vietnamese Government 
during his short visit to Vietnam early next month. He said he 
has asked the Intellectual Property Department to draw up a 
structure of operations for Thailand, Vietnam, China, Laos, 
Cambodia and Burma. 
  Cooperation between countries of the region is needed 
because 
trade between them will expand, and the problems of violation of 
patents, copyrights and trademarks need to be tackled. 
  As a first step, Thailand is expected to cooperate with each 
country bilaterally before expanding operations across the 
region. Thailand can help Vietnam in patent registration 
procedures, in which the Thai side is more experienced. The 
other countries will have the same or different cooperation 
agreements depending on their respective economies. 
  Concerning local protection of copyright works, Mr Churin 
said the Government may apply the Price Fixing and Anti-Monopoly 
Act of 1979, which requests that tapes, compact discs and 
videotape producers submit costs of production to the Internal 
Trade Department for use as a basis for considering whether 
producers have taken advantage of consumers. 
  Mr Churin said the Economic Crime Investigation Division has 
reported that the crackdown on infringement of copyright works 
in February increased 27 percent from January, and 21,043 pieces 
of illegal copyright works were seized. 
  The Singapore-based representative of the Motion Picture 
Exports Association of America, who recently visited Thailand, 
reported that violations of copyright laws were fewer in the 
first two months of the year.

  [Text] Bangkok -- The Commerce Ministry has reported it has 
not received cooperation on the intellectual property rights 
[IPR] investigation process from shop owners of pirated video, 
tapes and compact disks. Deputy Commerce Minister Churin 
Lasanawisit, who is also the chairman of the committee in charge 
of a crackdown on violators of intellectual property rights, 
said the shop owners have failed to cooperate with the 
Department of Internal Trade and Department of Commercial 
Registration, thereby hindering the investigation. 
  The two departments under the Ministry suffered due to this 
lack of cooperation since they were unable to get exact 
information related to IP [intellectual property] rights 
violation. As a result, the entire investigation process turned 
into a fiasco. Churin said his committee has ordered the two 
Departments to begin investigations once again, adding "If this 
time they hesitate to cooperate, the Commerce Ministry will have 
to take legal action against them." 
  The police crackdown last month resulted in the arrest of 
130 
people. That is a 27 pct [percent] drop from the number of 
similar arrests in January. The Department of Commercial 
Registration investigated 68 violators of which five faced legal 
action, and seven were subjected to a 10,000-baht-fine. 
Similarly, the Revenue Department is currently running 
tax-related investigations on more than 30 people.

  [Text] Four officials working for a Royally-sponsored 
project in Ta Phraya District were abducted by Cambodian bandits 
yesterday. The 13 bandits, armed with rocket-propelled grenade 
launchers and assault rifles, slipped across the Thai-Cambodian 
border into Site Two. The former camp in Ban Thap Thai, Tambon 
Thap Sadet has been transformed into a land development project 
for border inhabitants under the Thapthim Siam 03 project 
sponsored by HRH [Her Royal Highness] Princess Chulaphon. 
  The bandits forced Mr Cha-on Thongtonhak and Mr Phadung 
Wongsapan, two officials of the land development unit of the 
Land Department, and two temporary employees, Mr Charat Phutson 
and Mr Nak Khathong, into Cambodia's Ampil village, in Banteay 
Meanchey Province. About two hours after the abduction, the 
bandits freed Mr Nak and told him to fetch 120,000 baht ransom 
in exchange for the release of his three colleagues today at 3 
p.m. at a rendezvous point to be determined later. The bandits 
would notify him later about the location for the rendezvous, 
Nak told police.

  [Excerpt] Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak talked to 
reporters this morning at Government House about the problem of 
robberies by Cambodian soldiers. 
  He said that he agrees with the Army commander about 
implementing strong measures against the Cambodian robbers. 
Regarding preventive measures, all sides must coordinate with 
each other to make them work. These include those in the 
government administrative circle -- the Interior Ministry and 
the unit in charge of national security; and the military with 
the major tasks of preventing violations of sovereignty -- the 
Royal Thai Army and the Royal Thai Navy. In the case of serious 
incidents, the Royal Thai Air Force should also lend a hand. 
  In any case, the defense minister agrees with the idea of 
implementing extremely decisive actions against the bandits in 
the future. The reason is that many Thais have been killed and 
wounded. At the same time coordination has begun with the 
National Defense Ministry of Cambodia and the Cambodian side 
pledged to try to prevent such incidents from occurring. 
  Meanwhile, a group of armed Cambodian bandits held three 
Thai 
officials of the Thapthim Sayam project and demanded ransom. 
Following coordination between Thai authorities and Cambodian 
representatives, the Thai side agreed to pay 120,000 baht in 
exchange for the release of the hostages. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Two Land Department officials and one employee 
held hostage for a ransom of 120,000 baht by a group of Khmer 
bandits were freed yesterday following coordinated pressure from 
both the Thai and Cambodian authorities. No ransom was paid for 
their release. [passage omitted] 
  A meeting was held in Sakaeo Province yesterday morning to 
discuss ways of rescuing the three and suppressing the bandits. 
The meeting was attended by governor Kasem Chaisit, Burapha 
Force commander Maj-Gen [Major-General] Niphon Pharannit, 
provincial police deputy chief Col Somrit Yangprida and 
representatives of the Land Department, Thai-Cambodian 
Coordination Office and Foreign Ministry. 
  Governor Chaisit revealed that the Thai side would be happy 
to pay the ransom to secure the release of three of its 
citizens. After that the Thai authorities contacted Maj-Gen Ko 
Choun, deputy commander of the 7th Division, which is 
responsible for this part of Cambodia to seek cooperation in 
getting the Thais released. The three Thais, however, were freed 
and returned to the Thai side of the border yesterday afternoon 
without any money changing hands.

  [Text] Speaking about the Cambodian bandits abducting Thai 
nationals in Sa Keo Province for ransom, Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri said he has learned that the hostages have been 
freed. He believes the military and civilian authorities were 
able to take the situation under control. He said that the 
frequent incidents took place in remote areas where it is 
difficult for authorities of both the Thai and Cambodian 
Governments to control. However, the foreign minister is 
confident that the banditry is not supported by the central 
government in Cambodia. 
  [Begin Prasong recording] I do not think they were supported 
by the Cambodian Government. No, it's natural that there are 
bandits in Cambodia; the same as in our own country. Here we 
also have a lot of criminals and they are not supported by the 
government. It is the same. This has nothing to do with 
relations between the Thai and Cambodian Governments. Relations 
will remain the same or even be strengthened. When we can 
discuss with each other, it is easy to solve problems. There is 
no reason to allow the acts of Cambodian bandits to sour our 
relations. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister welcomed the news that Thai nationals 
have started moving out of Pailin which is controlled by the 
Khmer Rouge. He said the people who move out will be safe from 
the assault on Pailin planned by the Cambodian Government. 
  Commenting on the same issue, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin 
Phitsuwan said he will leave for Cambodia on 23 March. He 
expects that he will be able to discuss with Cambodian leaders 
and find solutions to many troubles along the Thai-Cambodian 
border. He said the central government in Cambodia always 
cooperates with the Thai Government. He does not think that the 
present situation will necessitate closing any border passes.

  [Text] On 9 March the French Government made two 
announcements imposing new conditions on the import of seafood 
and fish products from countries outside the European Union. 
The two announcements have hurt Thai fish products sent earlier 
to France and those that are to be exported there. The 
Association of Processed Food Producers estimated that the loss 
is valued at about 70.66 million baht or 17 million francs. The 
does not include losses by other associations such as the 
Associations of Frozen Food and Marine Animal Traders. 
Government agencies such as the Fishery Department, the 
Commerce Ministry, and the Foreign Ministry are keeping close 
contacts with France's agriculture and fishery ministries to 
solve the problem. Since the new regulations have been imposed 
at the request of French fishermen dissatisfied with falling 
fish prices, French agencies are reluctant to allow Thailand and 
other countries to resume exporting fish products to their 
market. The European Union has also expressed disagreement with 
the action taken by France. The Thai private sector is 
disappointed with France's sudden imposition of restrictions and 
has proposed that the Thai Government resort to trade 
retaliation against it if negotiations to tackle this problem 
fail. 
  On 9 March, the Foreign Ministry summoned the French 
ambassador to hear to the Thai complaint and has asked France to 
allow Thai fish products to be sold in the French market as 
before. Phirat Itsarasena na Ayutthaya, deputy permanent 
secretary for foreign affairs, has been assigned to follow up. 
The French ambassador has promised to bring Thailand's request 
to French agencies for urgent consideration.

  [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon has told 
reporters that it is unfair for France to set up barriers 
against Thai fish products, noting that the Commerce Ministry 
has been trying to settle the matter through diplomatic channels 
and instructed the Thai commerce attache to closely monitor the 
situation. 
  Uthai said: "If France continues to use such unfair measures 
against us, we must plan to reciprocate as France exports mostly 
luxury goods to Thailand. If we do nothing, France will treat 
us like that again." The commerce minister disclosed that other 
countries suffering from the French action include Indonesia and 
the Philippines. France, by so doing, has claimed that these 
countries have no specific quality control agencies for their 
fish products. Meanwhile, the European Union has set the end of 
1994 as the deadline for all its members including France to do 
away with such protectionist measures.

  [Text] French Ambassador to Thailand Jacques Rummelhardt 
yesterday expressed the hope that the difficulties caused by the 
French government decision of February 9 to ban imports of Thai 
fisheries products would soon be resolved. Mr Rummelhardt said 
after meeting Commerce Deputy Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap his 
government's decision did not set any new conditions on seafood 
imports. 
  "The decision was based on the restrictions to which both 
seafood imports and exports are subject. We must first secure 
guarantees on these restrictions and the condition to get a 
guarantee from Thailand must be observed," he said. Thai 
fishery imports to the French market were banned as of February 
9 due to uncertainties over a competent inspection authority. 
  Mr Chaiyot said the confusion resulted from the fact that 
Thailand has several agencies involved in the inspection 
process. He said the foremost inspection authority for Thailand 
was the Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative Ministry's 
Fisheries Department. 
  The Deputy Minister expressed reservations concerning 
Paris's 
decision, citing the perception of a selective practice toward 
Thailand because Bangkok had submitted the required documents 
indicating the Fisheries Department was the foremost authority 
concerned with export inspection. It appears Thai exports have 
been singled out by French authorities, he said. 
  Foreign Trade Department Director General Oranut Osathanan 
said the French had allowed seven countries to import fishery 
products after the February 9 decision. They are the United 
States, Morocco, El Salvador, Brazil, Colombia, Senegal and the 
Ivory Coast. Ms Oranut said Thailand had submitted a memorandum 
similar to the Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry letter with trade 
information for the French ambassador on Wednesday for 
forwarding to his government informing them of the Thai position. 
  The French ambassador assured Mr Chaiyot he would inform his 
government as soon as possible of the problems facing Thailand 
to salvage the relationship between the two countries. The Thai 
Government will await the decision of the French before taking 
any measures. 
  "Future action may take place in a very short period," said 
Mr Chaiyot when asked for a deadline on future measures, 
declining to elaborate. 
  Mr Rummelhardt acknowledged that French fishermen and the 
fishing industry was experiencing economic hardship and had 
pressed the government for help, yet he denied the request was a 
factor in his government's decision to ban Thai imports.

  [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon granted an 
interview to newsmen after he discussed with the EC ambassador 
the French ban on imports of Thai fisheries products. He said 
the ban was tantamount to trade protectionism and discrimination 
because Thailand abided by regulations concerning its exports. 
He said the EC ambassador expressed concern about what happened 
and asked Thailand not to lodge a complaint with GATT yet. The 
commerce minister also said he would raise the problem for 
discussion at tomorrow's cabinet session because the Thai 
private sector has already reported a loss of more than 100 
million baht -- and it could reach a billion baht. 
  [Begin Uthai recording] I will report the matter to the 
cabinet tomorrow; the private sector appealed for retaliation 
against France. But if we take action, it could lead to 
strained relations, and we do not want that. We might have to 
lodge a complaint with GATT if we do not get a good explanation 
or proper solution to the problem. Anyway, the EC ambassador 
told us not to take that step yet, but to let him do the work 
first. [end recording]

  [Text] Thailand may seek a formal ruling from the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade council regarding the French 
Government's decision to ban Thai imports of fishery products, 
said Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon. Mr Uthai said after 
meeting with the head of a delegation of the Commission of the 
European Union, J Gwyn Morgan -- the second meeting of an EU 
representative with the Commerce Ministry -- that he had 
expressed his government's dissatisfaction over the French ban. 
The import ban is based on confusion over Thailand's foremost, 
competent export inspection authority. 
  He indicated that if Thailand does not receive a timely and 
satisfactory response from the French Government, his agency may 
take the case to the GATT council to seek redress from the 
balance of a perceived selective practice against Thailand. Mr 
Morgan has urged the Thai Government to delay any decision to 
involve a GATT review and allow him his best effort to solve the 
current dispute. 
  Mr Uthai will inform the Cabinet today of the French 
authority's actions but declined to elaborate on what short-term 
measures, if any, the Thai Government should take against France. 
  The Thai Food Processors Association and the Thai Frozen 
Food 
Association has called for trade retaliation. "We hope the 
dispute will be resolved soon and will not jeopardise the 
existing relationship between our two countries," said Mr Uthai. 
Mr Morgan said yesterday: "On behalf of the European Union, we, 
in Brussels, will discuss with our French colleagues a remedy 
and resolution to this dispute as soon as possible". The French 
Government banned Thai fishery imports on February 9.

  [Text] The recently concluded Asean Senior Officials' 
Meeting (SOM) agreed in principle to enhance the regional body's 
role in security cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. The SOM 
was to lay the important groundwork for the Asean Foreign 
Ministers' Meeting and the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) in July 
with Thailand acting as host. While touching on potential 
regional flashpoints in the South China Sea, Korean peninsula, 
Burma and Cambodia, discussion of details was avoided due to the 
perceived sensitivities of certain powers. 
  Now for the first time since the end of the Cold War, Asean 
countries are thinking of their security concerns as mature 
nations responsible for their own fate. However, the regional 
grouping still lacks a sense of greater vision with regard to 
security, and adheres to the notion that economic development is 
the panacea for all problems. 
  There is no doubt that economic growth makes certain kinds 
of 
conflict less likely. But it does not solve everything -- for 
example the risk of an ethnic explosion for instance. Politics 
and economics have to be tied together in a security association 
and neither Asean nor the ARF offers this. The three major 
Asia-Pacific actors are very quiet now, but this may not last. 
  Japan has almost all the attributes of a superpower, and it 
has the ability to develop full capability, including nuclear 
weapons and missiles, within a short time. 
  China wants to be on good terms with the generally thriving 
Asean members to maintain stability and provide opportunities 
for its modernization drive. The country's outward-looking 
economy benefits enormously from regional trade and investment. 
At the same time, Beijing has territorial and security ambitions 
that it is tempted to pursue, even if they irritate or upset its 
regional partners. The most significant is its declaration of 
sovereignty over a large expanse of the South China Sea. Asean 
is aware that China used force to evict the Vietnamese from some 
of the Paracel and Spratly Islands in 1975 and 1988. These 
island archipelagos extend across important shipping lanes. 
  However, the regional grouping should also note that the 
Chinese didn't show the same kind of aggression in pursuing 
their claim to the Senkaku Islands, northeast of Taiwan, 
controlled by militarily superior Japan. In Burma, China has 
become one of the closest foreign allies of the thuggish State 
Law and Order Restoration Council, supplying the military junta 
with arms destined to be used against domestic opponents. 
  The United States, which previously had a high-profile 
military presence in Southeast Asia, is yet to decide on its 
role in the region. 
  The much asked question now is: How will Asean react when 
these three powers wake up and stretch? 
  Clearly, if Southeast Asia has not created a credible and 
cohesive multilateral security system by then, the smaller 
countries will be prey to traditional balance of power politics 
among the key actors. The ARF, proposed to be formed in July, 
runs the risk of just being an empty framework if fears of 
offending regional powers and partners inhibits discussion of 
internal problems. 
  It is completely baffling how security threats can be 
identified and diffused if they are not even discussed in 
detail. For a start, the Spratly Islands issue and other 
connected disputes in the South China Sea -- from piracy to 
poaching of fisheries resources -- must be taken up by the ARF. 
Asean must send out a clear message that it does not condone 
what Beijing is doing in the South China Sea and China should 
make good its promise of joint development in the disputed 
territory to dispel Southeast Asian anxiety. 
  In Asean, collective security is still in its infancy. Arms 
control, confidence-building measures, satellite surveillance 
and the verification of chemical weapons possession have not 
even been thought of yet. What is needed first and foremost in 
the region is an overall political framework that is strong 
enough to contain disorder and survive changes in member 
countries. A security mechanism for quick and effective action 
will have to follow. 
  The ARF must prepare not for clashes two years from now, but 
for the politics of the 21st century.

  [Excerpt] Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr. said yesterday the 
House of Representatives is prepared to support an amnesty 
program that will cover all political offenders, including the 
convicted killers of U.S. Col. James Rowe. But, he said, 
beneficiaries of such a proclamation should first apply for this. 
  De Venecia, who was given by Malacanang a draft copy of the 
two proclamation orders that would cover insurgents on one hand 
and government forces who committed crimes in the course of the 
counter-insurgency campaign on the other, said: "It (the 
application) is not a condition but a procedure that is but 
logical and reasonable. We cannot just go to the top of Mount 
Olympus and announce that we hereby declare an amnesty. My God, 
who are these people?" he said. 
  De Venecia said amnesty that is granted even without being 
asked for would make the program vulnerable to abuse. He said he 
would favor the inclusion of Juanito Itaas and Donato 
Continente, convicted killers of Rowe, in the program. Both 
have appealed their cases before the court. "I have not studied 
their cases but in principle, amnesties should be wide-ranging 
and general application," he said. 
  When asked how an application for amnesty would affect the 
contention of Itaas and Continente that they are innocent of the 
murder charge, De Venecia said seeking inclusion in the program 
would not necessarily be an admission of guilt. "You're just 
applying for amnesty," he said. 
  De Venecia expressed confident that the second amnesty 
program will result in the faster resolution of armed conflicts 
with rebel groups whose number has been estimated at 25,000. 
The first was declared by former President Aquino. The amnesty 
proclamation needs the concurrence of Congress. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Central Police District Command (CPDC) has 
created a drug enforcement team which will conduct police 
operations in a national level. CPDC Director Chief 
Superintendent Diony Alvaro Ventura bared this during their 
weekly command conference wherein he directed his 11 station 
commanders to turn over all cases involving illegal drugs to 
newly-activated Drug Enforcement Task Force (DETF). 
  According to Ventura, the DETF will be the sole authority in 
the command level to conduct intelligence and investigation on 
suspected drug traffickers not only in Quezon City but also 
nationwide. "Not only that, but DETF will also be responsible in 
filing drug cases which was the normal practice in CPDC before. 
DETF was borne by a unified effort not only to sting the street 
but the national level as well," Ventura explained. 
  He said, only two commands -- the CPDC and the Western 
Police 
District Command (WPDC) -- under Senior Supt. Hermogenes Ebdane 
were tasked by Chief Superintendent Recaredo Sarmiento III, 
National Capital Region Command (NCRC) director, to create their 
own "centralized" drug enforcement office. 
  He said the two command's task forces will be headed by 
Supt. 
Dominador Resos. 
  The PNP-Narcom [Philippine National Police-Narcotics 
Command] 
has provided the personnel, the PNP General Headquarters will 
render legal assistance, and the PNP Crime Laboratory will 
conduct lab testing on seized illegal drugs.

<F P=106> [By Bong Reblando] </F>
  [Text] General Santos City -- Moro National Liberation 
Front (MNLF) rebels have been training new recruits in Sultan 
Kudarat in violation of the cease-fire agreement, a top 
provincial official said. "It is a clear violation of the 
truce," said Gov. Nestor Gumana of Sultan Kudarat who disclosed 
that 826 new cadres of the MNLF finished their guerrilla 
training at the foothills of the Daguma Range last 10 January. 
  Moro rebels led by Kamsa Itom, alias "Commander Ronnie," 
were 
planning to hold this month another training for rebel recruits 
in the mountain sitio [district of a village] of Baton, barangay 
[village] Lagandang, Isulan, a Muslim-dominated village, Gumana 
said. 
  The apparent infraction of the peace record, Gumana also 
said, prompted the Peace and Order Council of Sultan Kudarat to 
file a protest with government panel chief negotiator Manuel 
Yan. "It's up to General Yan to act on our protest but certainly 
we believed that ongoing training and recruitment indicated bad 
faith," he added. "This could heighten tension as it is sending 
the wrong signal to Christian constituents." 
  Gumana's report came in the wake of information that some 
Christian groups believed connected with the Ilaga, an 
underground movement opposed to Muslim domination, have been 
courting police authorities at the PNP Recom [Philippine 
National Police Regional Command] 12 headquarters to allow them 
to conduct raids on known rebel lairs in the province. 
  "I told them to hold their line since the police and the 
military can contain lawlessness," Sr. Supt. [Senior 
Superintendent] Jovencio Sales, PNP Recom 12 chief, said, adding 
that several Christian leaders have signified their willingness 
to fight the rebels in retaliation of the recent ambush-slaying 
of a busload of passengers in Tulunan, Maguindanao and the 
bombing of the Catholic cathedral in Davao City. Police sources 
said that Christians in Central Mindanao, fearing that the 
collapse of the peace talks between the government and the MNLF 
could spark hostilities, have been rearming themselves 
discreetly.

  [Text] A breakaway group of the MNLF [Moro National 
Liberation Front] operating in Basilan province in southern 
Philippines has warned that more wealthy businessmen and school 
teachers will be abducted by the group. Sulaiman Ali, leader of 
one of the lost commands said the new wave of kidnapping will 
start at the close of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The 
month-long fasting of Muslims ended on Sunday. 
  Ali, however, denied responsibility in the kidnapping of 
five 
school teachers in Tuburan, Basilan last 7 March. He demanded a 
pull out of the marines from Tuburan, saying that more people 
will be abducted by his group starting this month if the marine 
troops will not be pulled out.

  Thirty-nine firearms believed to have been left behind by 
former New People's Army [NPA] rebels, who had surrendered to 
the government, were recovered by military and police operatives 
from a thickly forested area in Santa Lucia, Ilocos Sur. 
Recovered were 34 Garand rifles, three M16 Armalite rifles, two

  Felix Lusabia y Nunez, commander of the NPA's mobile 
regional 
guerrilla unit (MRGU) operating in Bicol and Quezon Province, 
surrendered to military authorities. Nunez is responsible for

of the NPA Eastern Visayas Regional Party Committee (EVRPC), and 
his wife, Rosario Afable, former secretary of the EVRPC Central 
Front Committee, fled from Samar to Manila to escape trial and 
possible execution by their comrades after amassing the 
communist movement's funds worth thousands of pesos. (Manila

  [Text] HONIARA, March 11 (AFP) -- The United Nations will 
help the Solomon Islands Government negotiate a border treaty 
with Papua New Guinea [PNG], Foreign Minister Francis Saemala 
said here Friday. 
  The two countries have experienced tensions in the past 
created by the civil war on the PNG island of Bougainville, on 
the Solomon's border. PNG military forces on several occasions 
crossed into Solomon's territory and opened fire on Solomon's 
villages. 
  Saemala returned here Friday from a United Nations 
Development Programme [UNDP] funded study tour of Torres Strait 
Islands, an Australian territory near PNG. 
  Saemala said the UNDP told him it was willing to fund 
technical aspects of an initiative taken by the government here 
to seek a lasting peace on the border with PNG. 
  Negotiations on the treaty will start after the technical 
aspects here are finalised.

  [Text] Hanoi has issued new controls on economic activities 
of the powerful Ministry of Interior [MOI] in what is seen as a 
major attempt to curb corruption in the police force and 
restructure the state enterprise sector. The move came in an 
order announced by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai which was 
carried in the March 7 edition of SAIGON GIAI PHONG. The order 
cautioned the MOI against allowing private businesses to act "in 
the names of police enterprises". It called on the MOI to "check 
the activities" of companies under its wing, and to dismiss 
managers found to be incompetent. 
  The order also indicated that subsidies would only be 
forthcoming to business activities of the police force that are 
deemed to meet its needs. 
  The MOI owns the Pacific Company, which operates a chain of 
hotels in major cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Vung 
Tau. In Hanoi, it owns the Boss Hotel which was among the first 
establishments in the capital to offer a discotheque and pool 
table. 
  "The MOI has to report to the Prime Minister on the 
effectiveness of the hotel operations...and convert loss-making 
hotels into joint ventures with foreign partners in order to 
ensure effective use of capital," the order said. 
  The Government further instructed the MOI to make optimum 
use 
of prison land, calling among other things for a 
"reorganisation" of the plantation of industrial crops. It also 
urged maximisation of prison labour "except for (that of) the 
old, ailing and political criminals." The order called on the 
MOI to turn over products made by prison labour and resources to 
the Government. It said proceeds from the products would be 
shared out as reward to worthy "cadres" and prisoners, and 
reinvested for expanded production. 
  The order affirmed that the State Planning Committee had 
been 
assigned to work out a capital allocation plan for companies run 
by the MOI. 
  It also made clear that none of these companies would be 
"equitised" -- in other words, be open to shareholdings by the 
general public. 
  The State Planning Committee organises subsidies given to 
companies run by the MOI and the Ministry of Defence.

  [Text] HANOI, March 15 (AFP) -- Workers at a Vietnamese 
state-owned factory producing bags for a South Korean firm held 
their third wild-cat strike in two months over the weekend to 
demand higher wages and protest harsh conditions, a report said 
Tuesday. Management at the Saigon Shoe Factory in Ho Chi Minh 
City complained that workers had not given any notice of the 
24-hour strike that began Saturday, the Nguoi Lao Dong newspaper 
reported. 
  Workers said the demands made by their "tense" work were too 
great and their payments too low, common complaints at factories 
here under contract to foreign clients, particularly South 
Koreans. But after talks with the Ho Chi Minh City Federation of 
Labour, the workers returned to the factory, which has seen two 
earlier strikes in the past two-months. 
  The labour ministry said last month that workers would be 
allowed to strike as a last resort but should give two-weeks 
notice of any industrial action. 
  Reports of strikes, particularly in the south of the 
country, 
are becoming more common, with three large shutdowns just before 
the Lunar New Year holiday last month.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 15 -- the State Planning Committee 
has introduced orientation for building a key development zone 
in the north at a conference held here recently and chaired by 
Vice Premier Phan Van Khai. The northern key development zone 
expected to cover Hanoi, Haiphong and Hon Gai (to be renamed Ha 
Long soon), will play an important part in the implementation of 
the strategy for socio-economic development of the north and the 
whole country as well. The zone concentrates major industrial, 
activities and communication and transport junctures of northern 
Vietnam. It has a great economic potential in the way of 
natural resources, workforce, and tourisms. It has 300-km 
coastal line with deep gulfs favourable for sea port 
construction. In addition, the zone's hydro-electricity 
potential accounts for 60 of the country's reserves. It has 
175,000 ha of forests, 318,000 ha of farm land, and 226,000 ha 
of bare hills. About 90 of its population are literate 
[sentence as received]. By the end of last year some 162 
foreign investment projects had been licensed in this zone with 
a total investment capital of USD 1.63 billion: Hanoi has 120 
projects with USD 1.04 billion, and Haiphong 24 projects with 
USD 523.5 million. The development orientation of all branches 
of activities in the zone from now to the year 2000 and 2010 is 
to change the economic structure in conformity with the market 
economy to increase the proportions of industrial production and 
services, and to encourage the development of non-governmental 
economic sectors and foreign investment into this zone.

<F P=106> [Report by Dinh Khai on Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's working </F>
visit to Hoa Binh Province from 12-13 March] 
  [Summary] Dear friends, the first stop on Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet's visit was the Hoa Binh 500-kilovolt power 
transformer, which is the key power transmission station of the 
north-south 500-kilovolt power line. 
  In his cordial exchange of views with Nguyen Huyen Chuoc, a 
labor hero and prominent machine installation expert, Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet said: 
  [Vo Van Kiet] "Comrade, do you see any difference between 
the 
installation of this 500-kilovolt power transformer and that of 
a 200-kilovolt power transformer? 
  [Nguyen Huyen Chuoc] "Well, in principle, there is no 
difference. We face a greater danger, however, in term of 
insulation here. Furthermore, this project calls for more 
stringent quality control measures and higher precision. 
  [Vo Van Kiet] "Do you think that once you have completed the 
installation of this 500-kilovolt power transformer, you can 
improve your expertise and cooperate with foreign engineers in 
the future? 
  [Nguyen Huyen Chuoc] "I am positive we can." 
  Vo Van Kiet noted with pleasure that most of the work had 
been completed. He commended everyone for their great efforts 
to build the north-south 500-kilovolt power line, which is of 
great importance to the cause of national construction. The 
prime minister expressed his hope that everyone will continue to 
complete the remaining work with the highest results. 
  Next, the prime minister called on the Vietnamese cadres and 
workers and Russian specialists at the Hoa Binh hydroelectric 
power plant where the last phase of the installation of the 
eighth group of generators was in progress. The prime minister 
reminded everyone of the need to make continued efforts to 
guarantee the highest level of quality for this last group of 
generators. 
  During his two-day visit to Hoa Binh, Vo Van Kiet devoted 
much of his time to touring a number of production 
establishments and to working sessions with leading provincial 
officials. He also toured Nam Phong Village in Ky Son District, 
where he called on a number of households which performed very 
well in the movement to promote the household economy. Next, 
while touring Trung Phong Village, the prime minister expressed 
his keen interest in sugar cane planting. Afterward, he visited 
the Cao Phong state farm. In his exchange of views with Farm 
Director Hoang Huu Qui, the prime minister said: 
  [Vo Van Kiet] "What is the average annual income of each 
household here?" 
  [Hoang Huu Qui] "On the average, each worker here earns 20 
million dong per year. Some outstanding workers earn as much as 
40-45 million dong each per year. The farm management collects 
fees on basic depreciation and agricultural taxes. In addition, 
each worker also makes a three-percent contribution to the 
production insurance fund. Altogether, each worker contributes 
about 40 percent of his or her income and keeps the rest, which 
stands at about 60 percent." 
  [Vo Van Kiet] "Is production stable?" 
  [Hoang Huu Qui] "Yes, it is stable. For example, the 
yield of each orchard is about 150 quintals, or 15 tons." 
  [Vo Van Kiet] "Are there any supplemental measures to 
increase the incomes of the farm and households?" 
  [Hoang Huu Qui] "Well, we think that intensive cultivation 
is one way to increase our crop yield. We also think of ways to 
generate high-yield saplings, which, in turn, will yield higher 
revenues." 
  Also at Ky Xuan District, Vo Van Kiet visited the forested 
area in Dan Hoa village. He urged the local administration and 
people to continue to plant forest trees and fruit orchards on 
denuded land to earn more income. 
  After visiting various production establishments, Vo Van 
Kiet 
held a working session with the leading cadres of Hoa Binh. 
Comrade Nguyen Nhu Coc, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, briefed the prime minister on the socioeconomic 
situation of the province and its tasks for the days ahead. 
  "In a talk to leading cadres of the province, Vo Van Kiet 
commended the provincial party organization and people for their 
efforts in improving the economic structure in accordance with 
the party lines and policies. He urged Hoa Binh to formulate 
plans to plant more crops and improve animal husbandry to 
produce a greater volume of products so as to provide good 
support to the processing industries. The province should play 
close attention to each village and help each family develop 
production to extricate themselves from poverty and strive to 
amass wealth through their great efforts." 
  He also urged the province to formulate concrete plans to 
reduce the number of poor families by 20 percent annually, while 
striving to improve its economic structure through progress 
toward agro-industrial development. 
  During the working session with leading cadres of Hoa Binh, 
Vo Van Kiet stressed the necessity of helping the local people 
overcome their difficulties and poverty, especially those who 
live in the Da River basin. He also stressed the importance of 
preserving forests around the Da River basin. The prime 
minister said: 
  [Vo Van Kiet] "I heard that forests in the Da River basin 
are 
being destroyed by some people. If this is true, it is very 
dangerous. We must take most concrete measures to immediately 
stop deforestation there [words indistinct]. We must also 
formulate plans to help the local people engage in various kinds 
of trade. We must educate and motivate the local people to 
preserve the forests. For those who intend to destroy forests 
through illegal logging, we must take drastic measures against 
them. I would like to stress that first we must formulate plans 
to help the local people to overcome difficulties, while 
encouraging them to preserve forests in the Da River basin."

  [Text] The No. 2 Electricity Company inaugurated three 
37.5-megawatt gas turbine generators at the Ba Ria-Vung Tau 
Power Station on the morning of 12 March. The three generators 
are now safely producing more than 92 million kilowatt-hours of 
electricity for the national line after being installed and 
completing a test run from 12 January to 2 March. Thanks to 
these generators, daily electricity resources for the southern 
provinces have increased by about 15-20 percent. The total cost 
of the 63-km, 220-kilovolt Ba Ria-Long Binh line and the three 
generators was more than 441 billion dong.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection team departed Pyongyang at 1000 [0100 GMT] on 15 
March by air after completing its 12-day inspection of North 
Korean nuclear facilities. 
  The IAEA inspection team was scheduled to stay one day in 
Beijing; however, it will proceed directly to IAEA headquarters 
in Vienna. 
  Mr. Kyd, IAEA information director, revealed that the 
inspection team was to stay one day in Beijing, but the team 
will arrive in Vienna on 16 March after changing its original 
plan in response to an emergency directive from the IAEA 
Secretariat. 
  The IAEA will decide if it will convene a special Board of 
Governors meeting this weekend after hearing the inspection 
team's report on detailed results of the inspection activities. 
  The major board members stated that the inspection for 
examination of conversion of nuclear materials was insufficient, 
including difficulties the team experienced in extracting test 
material of nuclear materials due to North Korea's lack of 
cooperation. As a result, it seems that convocation of a 
special Board of Governors meeting next week is inevitable.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, March 15 KYODO -- A weary-looking team 
of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
arrived in Beijing on Tuesday [15 March] from Pyongyang after a 
two-week tour inspecting North Korea's nuclear facilities. 
  Team leader Olli Heinonen refused to comment on how the 
inspections went or to answer questions concerning rumors that 
the North Korean Government denied the team access to some of 
the seven agreed-upon nuclear sites. 
  "We don't give any statements. That will be done in Vienna 
tonight," Heinonen said. "We had a nice pleasant trip. We all 
want to go home now." 
  Upon arrival, the team immediately booked tickets out of 
Beijing, with five members scheduled to arrive in Zurich later 
Tuesday. 
  The IAEA will release a statement in Vienna concerning the 
trip later Tuesday, Heinonen said. 
  Prior to this round of inspections, North Korea had delayed 
for more than a year IAEA inspections of its nuclear program, 
fueling accusations that it was trying to develop nuclear 
weapons. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The North Korean side admitted on 15 March that 
there were some disputes regarding the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's [IAEA] method of inspecting its nuclear 
facilities, but revealed that such friction can be resolved 
through dialogue. 
  (Choe Han-chun), councillor of the DPRK Embassy in Beijing, 
said that the inspection team demanded that it take samples from 
one facility, but the North Korean authorities rejected this 
move, calling it an unjust demand. 
  Councillor Choe said that there was a slight dispute in the 
process of inspection, but that it is not serious. He also 
claimed that this can be resolved through dialogue between North 
Korea and the IAEA.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 (YONHAP) -- Yi Yong-tok, South 
Korean deputy prime minister and minister of the National 
Unification Board (NUB), said on Tuesday that South and North 
Korea would not be able to exchange special envoys by March 21, 
the scheduled date for Pyongyang-Washington talks. 
  Lee, in an interview with the Japanese daily MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN, said, "theoretically, realization of the special envoy 
exchange is possible before March 21, but it is nothing more 
than our (South Korea's) wishful thinking. Actually, we have 
little time. It is difficult." 
  Yi added that since Washington agreed with Seoul not to hold 
the talks unless the special envoy exchange is realized, the 
scheduled third round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and 
Washington seems impossible either. 
  In one promising development, North Korea virtually withdrew 
four preconditions for the envoy exchange including "suspension 
of the nuclear military exercise" at an inter-Korean 
working-level contact last Saturday. 
  "With North Korea's change of attitude, although the special 
envoys may not be exchanged before March 21, a final agreement 
on the exchange may be reached by that date," he said. 
  South Korea will press the envoy exchange because it is part 
of preparatory work for an inter-Korean summit meeting, Yi 
emphasized. 
  Yi said North Korea had admitted its economic failure, 
adding 
that Pyongyang seemed to be re-evaluating its announced 
withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT).

  [Text] This morning, the government held a strategic 
meeting participated by unification-related ministries, and 
chaired by Yi Yong-tok, vice prime minister and national 
unification board minister, to discuss follow-up measures for 
the seventh North-South working-level contact for the exchange 
of special envoys scheduled to be held on 16 March. 
  At today's meeting, the government confirmed the position 
that the exchange of special envoys must be carried out before 
the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks is held. 
It has decided to call on the North side to make efforts to 
expedite the process of initiating exchange of special envoys 
during tomorrow's contact in Panmunjom. 
  During tomorrow's contact, if there is no final agreement 
between the North and South, and see only a negative attitude of 
the North side, the government will officially ask the United 
States to postpone the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks. 
  The government has decided that if the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's inspection in North Korea which ended on 15 
March, does not produce sufficient resuslt, the government is 
considering to resume the Team Spirit exercise.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea-U.S. 
high-level dialogue has been delayed indefinitely due to 
insufficient International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspection results, a government official here said Tuesday [15 
March]. 
  IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is highly likely to convene 
a 
special Board of Governors meeting within the week to brief the 
members on the inspection results, the official said. 
  The IAEA inspection team was to leave Pyongyang and head 
back to the Agency's headquarters in Vienna on Tuesday morning. 
  The inspectors leave without having secured the promised 
access to one or two critical sites at the radiochemical 
laboratory, an installation the IAEA has said would be a nuclear 
reprocessing plant when completely built. 
  "North Korea has not met either of the two preconditions for 
the Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. The talks are now 
suspended indefinitely," said the official. 
  Seoul and Washington earlier made conditional promises to 
call off the annual joint military drill "Team Spirit" and to 
hold the high-level meeting on March 21 in Geneva. 
  The pledges were made on the condition that North Korea 
allow 
unlimited IAEA inspections and exchange special envoys with 
South Korea. 
  "North Korea is apparently trying to acquire more 
negotiating 
cards with its nuclear facilities," said the government 
official. "It remains up to the IAEA to determine whether the 
just-concluded inspection proved that North Korea did not divert 
nuclear material for non-peaceful uses." 
  The IAEA inspectors need two to three weeks to produce a 
conclusive report on North Korea, but the official said Blix is 
unlikely to wait until the report comes out to convene a special 
board meeting. 
  "It's very probable that the special board session will be 
convened within this week," he said. 
  Blix is expected to make some sort of announcement by 
Wednesday or Thursday on the IAEA's evaluation of the North 
Korean inspection, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- Yi Yong-tok, deputy 
prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board 
(NUB), said Tuesday that Pyongyang-Washington relations will 
hardly advance unless inter-Korean ties are placed on the right 
track. 
  Yi told reporters that progress in inter-Korean relations 
will help improve the North's links with Japan and the United 
States, emphasizing that an envoy exchange is a precondition for 
the third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. 
  South and North Korea have held three working-level contacts 
on exchanging special envoys since the North agreed to accept 
nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) late last month, but failed to narrow their differences 
on the envoys' mission and how to conduct the exchange. 
  Yi said, "We are accepting most of the North Korean demands 
on procedure. But some of the seven items North Korea proposed 
under the envoys' mission have been analyzed as related to 
Pyongyang's same old strategy toward Seoul." 
  For example, Pyongyang presented "the problem of forging a 
great unity among all the people" as one facet of the mission, 
which the South says is related to the old "unification front" 
stategy. 
  Yi said, "The special envoy exchange is significant in 
solving the North Korean nuclear problem and breaking the 
deadlock in inter- Korean relations. Anyway, I think Pyongyang

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States on Tuesday reaffirmed that they will hold the 
joint military exercise "Team Spirit" this year if IAEA 
inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities are deemed 
unsatisfactory and an inter-Korean envoy exchange fails to take 
place. 
  The reaffirmation came at a meeting between South Korean 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and U.S. Deputy Secretary of 
Defense Frank Wisner in Seoul on Tuesday. 
  The two officials also discussed security on the Korean 
peninsula and strengthening bilateral security cooperation, 
officials said. 
  Wisner told Yi that the Korean peninsula is vital to U.S. 
strategy while the two officials agreed that the security 
arrangement between the United States and South Korea remains 
firm, the officials said. 
  The meeting was attended by other military officials from 
both sides. 
  Wisner, visiting South Korea for the first time, is 
scheduled 
to visit the U.S. Second Infantry Division, an underground 
tunnel dug by North Koreans in the Demilitarized Zone, South 
Korea's First Infantry Divison and the Joint Security Area of 
the truce village of Panmunjom before departing on Thursday.

  [Text] Frank Wisner, U.S. under secretary of defense for 
policy, arrived in the ROK on 14 March to discuss the North 
Korean nuclear issue and measures to promote security 
cooperation between the ROK and the United States. 
  Visiting the ROK after accompanying U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher to China, Under Secretary Wisner on 15 March will 
seriously discuss the North Korean nuclear issue and other 
matters with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae, and Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential assistant for 
diplomacy and security. 
  Regarding this issue, a government official noted that 
"Under 
Secretary Wisner has come to the ROK to better understand the 
latest security situation on the Korean peninsula. However, the 
issue of resuming this year's Team Spirit exercise, which has 
been conditionally suspended, will also be discussed in the 
event that no progress is made regarding the exchange of special 
envoys during the seventh North-South working-level contact 
slated for 16 March." 
  Noting that Under Secretary Wisner is in charge of nuclear 
policy in the U.S. Defense Department, the official pointed out 
that during the current ROK-U.S. consultations, an overall 
review will be made concerning the North-South mutual nuclear 
inspections, which our side will raise in the course of 
exchanging special envoys, and concerning ways to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Seven members, including (Stanley Ross), deputy assistant 
secretary of defense for East Asian and Pacific affairs; Michael 
Ryan, assistant to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Kent 
Wiedemann, special assistant for Asian Affairs of the National 
Security Council in the White House, are accompanying Under 
Secretary Wisner.

<F P=106> [By Pak Tu-sik] </F>
  [Text] In the sixth working-level contact held at 
Panmunjom on 12 March to discuss the South-North envoy exchange, 
North Korea demanded that the two sides adopt a South-North 
joint communique. Pak Yong-su, chief delegate of the North side, 
abruptly insisted on "issuing a joint communique expressing both 
sides' intent before adopting an agreement for exchanging 
special envoys of South and North Korea." At the same time, 
North Korea "virtually" withdrew its demand for four 
preconditions of the envoy exchange. The four preconditions, 
including the abrogation of President Kim Yong-sam's remarks on 
the North's nuclear development, were nothing but "North Korea's 
devices" aimed at delaying the envoy exchange. It seems that 
North Korea is insisting on announcing a joint communique 
"hinting that South-North contacts for the envoy exchange are 
going smoothly" after allowing itself to withdraw the delaying 
devices because it wants to pave the way for the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, which will be held in about 
a week. 
  In other words, North Korea intends to make it difficult for 
the ROK and U.S. Governments to postpone the third round of 
talks, and it also intends to create a pretext for spurning 
responsibility on the other side when the talks are actually 
delayed. 
  Despite this effort by North Korea, it seems almost 
impossible for the third round of talks that are slated to be 
held in Geneva on 21 March, to go on as scheduled. Robert 
Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political and 
military affairs and head of the U.S. delegation to North 
Korea-U.S. talks, clearly said that "the third round of talks 
will not be held unless the South-North envoy exchange is 
realized" in a series of consultations with the ROK Government 
before he left the ROK on 13 March. 
  Of course, the ROK and U.S. Government authorities have not 
made the delay of 21 March North Korean-U.S. talks an 
established fact because, from a logical point of view, it is 
possible that after South and North Korea dramatically reach an 
agreement in their next contact slated for 16 March, either 
side's envoy will visit the other side before the 21 March 
Geneva talks. However, this can hardly become reality. 
Accordingly, the ROK and U.S. Governments seem to be making a 
policy in preparation for the possible delay of the third round 
of North Korean-U.S. talks in consequence of failure to exchange 
South and North Korean envoys prior to 21 March. 
  As has been well known, the ROK and the United States have 
demanded the inspection by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] and the South-North envoy exchange as 
preconditions of the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. 
The IAEA inspection is a precondition that can immediately 
result in international society's intervention such as sanctions 
by the UN Security Council. Time has proven that IAEA 
inspections of North Korea are being conducted at an acceptable 
level. If the IAEA inspection is completed satisfactorily 
before the end of this week, only the issue of envoy exchange 
will remain unresolved. 
  It is the ROK and U.S. Governments' position that the third 
round of North Korean-U.S. talks cannot be held unless the envoy 
exchange is realized. If North Korean-U.S. talks, slated for 21 
March, are delayed, North Korea will be held responsible for 
that since it has delayed the envoy exchange. Accordingly, 
North Korea is being pressed for time while the ROK and the 
United States comes into a composed position. The government 
plans to continue to promote the envoy exchange with patience 
even if it is not realized before 21 March. If it becomes 
completely impossible for North Korea and the United States to 
hold high-level talks on 21 March, the United States will 
probably notify North Korea of the delay of the third round of 
talks through the New York channel around 16 March, when the 
next South-North contact will be held. The third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks are likely to be delayed until after mid-April 
because the South-North envoy exchange should be realized before 
the talks. 
  This can be expected, however, only when North Korea gently 
accedes to the envoy exchange, even if it is late, as well as 
agrees to the delay of the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. 
If North Korea strongly opposes this, it is possible that the 
North Korean nuclear issue will again temporarily fall into a 
phase of harsh confrontation. If IAEA inspections uncover a 
"serious-level" of diversion of nuclear materials for other 
purposes, that may bring about full-pledged intervention by the 
international community.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean press, 
placed squarely under the boot of the Workers' (Communist) 
Party, has sharpened the "pens of revolution" to spearhead the 
North's recently stepped-up campaign against the South. The 
press joined the North's mud-slinging drive in earnest late last 
year when the workers' party prodded journalists to intensify 
propaganda against the South. 
  "The press should step up propaganda campaigns in firm 
support of the struggles of the South Korean people, who are 
fighting for self-reliant and democratic unification," the party 
said. The party's instructions were contained in a 
congratulatory message sent to the seventh general meeting of 
the North Korean Journalists Union held last Nov. 17. As a show 
of their faithful adherence to the instructions, the Journalists 
Union pledged firm unity and loyalty to the great leader, Kim 
Il-song, and the party on March 10 at its 48th anniversary 
celebration. 
  North Korean journalists abet subversion in the South 
because 
they fail to uphold freedom of the press -- that is, to satisfy 
the people's right to know -- in their own country, and because 
their main goal is to muster unswerving public support and 
loyalty for the great leader and his party. The regime's use of 
newspapers for its political purposes is not so strange given 
the party's press policy. 
  A press guideline handed down by the party describes the 
press as "a medium of chuche" and "a revolutionary medium of Kim 
Il-songism." 
  Of course, the North Korean Constitution does provide for 
"freedom of the press" in Article 67. But in interpreting this 
constitutional provision, the official history glossary of North 
Korea says, "we at no time can accord these freedoms and rights 
to the enemy of the fatherland and people." It is thus clear 
that "freedom of the press" as mentioned in the North means the 
"freedom" to demonstrate loyalty to the great leader and party. 
  This is a "freedom" under which no criticism of the North 
Korean official ideology, system or state policies is tolerated. 
The "theory of the press," a North Korean textbook on 
journalism, sheds a brighter light on the nature of the 
Stalinist state's press. It explains that the press must perform 
the "function of propaganda and agitation, the function of 
organizer and the function of culture and indoctrinator." 
  In other words, North Korea forces the press to serve as an 
"ideological tool for class struggle" and a "socio-political 
tool" designed to link the policies of the great leader and the 
party to the people. It is under this basic press policy that 
the North Korean media as a whole are required to place emphasis 
more on purpose than on reality in handling news. 
  This is why such significant news items as the suspension of 
the '94 Team Spirit exercise and the decision to hold the third 
round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks were reported by 
North Korean media only on March 6, three days after they had 
been announced. The media's anti-South programs are carefully 
orchestrated by the Choson (North Korean) Central News Agency, 
which is under the direct control of the Administration Council. 
  The agency has a "South Korean News Bureau" and a "South 
Korean Research Department" that prepare news on the South and 
items related to unification programs for distribution to all 
print and broadcast media. Little wonder then, that the regime 
seems satisfied with the performance of the only North Korean 
News Agency. 
  "The Choson Central News Agency has performed a great role 
in 
letting the South Korean people rise up in anti-U.S. and nation- 
saving struggles and in strengthening the international 
solidarity of revolution," said a report on the agency's 30th 
anniversary in December 1976. 
  Among the broadcast media, Pyongyang Broadcasting Station 
specializes in programs covering the South and abroad. Its 
programs about the South are all designed to instill communist 
ideas in the minds of South Koreans and agitate them into 
staging a popular uprising. A typical example of such programs 
is the serialized "chuche thought is the true view of the world 
in the contemporary age and the most accurate guidance thought 
for campaigns for change in South Korea." There is also the 
"Minminjon Broadcasting Station," which the Workers' Party runs 
directly and which North Korea disguises as an underground radio 
operated somewhere in the South. The duty of the psychological 
warfare station is to spread slanderous propaganda and wild 
rumors among South Koreans to discredit the Seoul government. 
  The specific organization that tightly controls all of the 
print media is the propaganda and agitation department of the 
Workers' Party. Individual journalists are not immune from party 
control, either. In the first place, all of them have to be 
ideologically screened by the Party's Central Committee before 
being recruited by the press.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government has decided to offer refuge to North Koreans 
defecting from the North's logging camps in Siberia, which are 
widely known for meting out inhuman treatment, informed sources 
said Tuesday. 
  The decision will be made at a meeting of related ministries 
and agencies called by the Foreign Ministry on Friday to discuss 
dealing with defectors from North Korean logging camps in 
Siberia, a government official said. 
  Participating in the meeting will be bureau head-level 
officials from Chongwadae [presidential office], the Foreign, 
Home and Justice Ministries, the National Unification Board and 
the Agency for National Security Planning. 
  Only defectors seeking refuge in South Korea will be 
accepted 
while those with "grave problems," such as involvement in a 
criminal case, will not be allowed to come, he added. 
  Diplomatic steps, including requesting the Russian 
Government 
to issue exit permits to the North Korean defectors so they can 
lawfully enter South Korea, will be discussed at the meeting. 
  Home Ministry measures for their settlement in the country 
will also be discussed. 
  Previously, the government has not allowed North Koreans 
defecting from logging camps in Siberia to enter the country, 
but it has changed this policy in view of North Koreans' rights 
as citizens of the Republic of Korea, provided for by the 
Constitution, and to protect their human rights. 
  At present, some 20,000 North Koreans are believed to be 
working in logging camps in Siberia and 150 to 200 have applied 
for refuge in South Korea through its embassy and 
consulates-general in Russia after deserting their camps, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea may make 
important decisions on its nuclear program and relations with 
the United States at the seventh meeting of the Ninth Supreme 
People's Assembly slated for early April, officials here said on 
Tuesday. 
  Hwang Chang-yop, North Korean Workers' Party secretary in 
charge of international affairs, visited Vietnam from March 7-10 
to find out how Hanoi improved relations with Washington in 
resuming economic cooperation. 
  Vietnam's example in enhancing relations with the United 
States may have served as a valuable case study for North Korea, 
an official at the National Unification Board (NUB) said. 
  Hwang met with senior officials from the Vietnamese 
Communist 
Party to discuss the issue of returning the remains of U.S. 
soldiers killed during the Korean war (1950-53). 
  After visiting Vietnam, Hwang stopped over in Laos on March 
11 to negotiate North Korean purchases of Laotian rice. 
  The NUB official said, "we are taking note that Hwang, who 
is 
a mastermind of North Korean diplomacy, visited these countries 
shortly before the meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly is 
to be held." 
  The Assembly usually meets to deal with party reorganization 
and the budget and to make decisions on important matters.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's Chongjin 
and China's Yanji cities have agreed on joint investment in 
hotel construction in the northeastern North Korean port and 
expansion of a 95-kilometer road between Chongjin and Hoeryong, 
which is already under construction. 
  Under the contract between the two cities, China will be 
responsible for construction and profits are to be divided 
equally, trade and shipping industry sources here said Tuesday. 
  China has promised to put up 65 million U.S. dollars while 
guaranteeing to supply North Korea with 10 freight cars, one 
3-ton truck, one 16-passenger bus, two 44-passenger buses, one 
jeep and 1,000 tons of wheat flour. 
  North Korea, in return, will lease out a 10,000-square-meter 
storage site at 90 cents per square meter a year. 
  The contract also states that North Korea will open Chongjin 
port to all foreign vessels and allow enterpot [as received] 
freight transporation regardless of the cargo's origin. 
  Trade officials said mutual interest brought about the 
contract since Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture wanted to 
use the North Korean port to cut the transport distance for 400 
South Korean manufacturers in the region on the current route 
from Dalian, while the North Koreans were in need of foreign 
currency. 
  They confirmed that Chongjin-Hoeryong road construction is 
under way from their Chinese trade partners. 
  Shipping industry sources said it has been easy to transport 
South Korean goods on vessels from other nations, but it would 
still be difficult for South Korean flagged-ships to enter the 
North Korean port directly due to complicated procedures at home.

<F P=106> [Article by Pak Che-kyun: "Some Changes in the North Korean </F>
Economic Structure] 
  [Text] It was learned on 14 March that North Korea had 
drastically reorganized its economic structure. Because of 
North Korea's adoption of an agriculture-is-best, trade-is-best, 
and light-industry-is-best policy at the 21st plenary session of 
the 6th party Central Committee on 8 December 1993, it had been 
predicted that North Korea would drastically reorganize its 
economic structure. Since then, it has reshuffled a 
considerable number of ministers of the economic-related 
ministries and drastically reorganized the enterprise 
organizations. 
  According to an analysis made by the Information Analysis 
Office of the National Unification Board [NUB] from January to 
10 March 1994 based on reports in North Korean newspapers, North 
Korea has increased the size of enterprises in light industry 
and trade, while reducing the size of enterprises in heavy 
industry. 
  First, the "General Bureau of the Shoe Industry," which 
belongs to the light industrial sector, has been upgraded to the 
"Joint General Bureau of the Shoe Industry, and the "Korea Silk 
Company" has been upgraded to the "Joint Korea Silk Company." 
On the other hand, the Kangso District Coal Mining Complex has 
been downgraded to the Kangso District Coal Mining General 
Enterprise; the Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive Complex to the 
Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive General Enterprise; and the 
Kumsong Tractor Complex to the Kumsong Tractor General Plant. 
  A general enterprise is a combination of enterprises that 
deal with the same kinds of materials according to the order of 
the production process. On the other hand, a complex is a 
combination of general enterprises that are technologically 
related to each other based on a large-scale production unit. 
Therefore, a complex has been defined as a parent organization 
of a general enterprise. 
  The reason for North Korea's upgrading light industrial 
sectors into complexes and for downgrading heavy industrial 
sectors into general enterprises is the result of its policy to 
give priority to light industry. This is a change in policy to 
remove the unequal development of light industry and heavy 
industry, which is a deep-rooted problem of the North Korean 
economy. 
  According to North Korea's announcement of the trade-is-best 
policy, the Unha Trade General Bureau has been upgraded to the 
Joint Unha Trade General Bureau. The Joint Unha Trade General 
Bureau has several light industrial subsidiaries, such as the 
Sariwon Textile Plant, the Kaesong Textile Plant, the Hwangju 
Fiber Plant, and the Songjin Fiber Plant. 
  In early January, North Korea reshuffled ministers of 
economic- related ministries by appointing Kong Chin-tae as 
deputy premier in charge of economic affairs of the State 
Administration Council; Kim Pyong-kil as minister of the Mining 
Industry Ministry; Yi Chun-sok as minister of the Forestry 
Ministry; Kim Kil-yon as director of the State Academy of 
Science; and Chae Hui-chong as chairman of the State Science and 
Technology Committee. All of the above are from the working 
class rather than politicians. North Korea has undoubtedly 
taken these steps to raise its economic productivity.

  [Text] New York, March 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korean 
Ambassador Han Sung-su has called on U.S. companies to increase 
investment in South Korea, saying his country is providing new 
opportunities for foreign entrepreneurs. 
  In a letter to the editor of the WALL STREET JOURNAL printed 
in its Monday issue, he noted that the South Korean Government 
is tearing down virtually all trade barriers against foreign 
firms making inroads into the country, particularly those 
against foreign direct and equity investment. 
  Refuting a story published by the influential economic 
newspaper on Feb. 25 that South Korea is the least attractive 
market for foreign investors in East Asia, Han said South Korea 
offers a number of attractions for American investors. 
  Among them are the 15th largest gross national product in 
the 
world, the 12th largest trading partner of the United States, a 
population of 43 million, a solid foundation for manufacturing, 
an educated and skilled labor force, the country's geographical 
location as a relay point for trade with China, Russia and 
Japan, and political stability for sustained economic growth, he 
enumerated. 
  Because of foreign invasions in the past, Koreans once 
opposed foreign investment: This xenophobia has now changed to 
an understanding that the Korean economy is mutually dependent 
on other countries' economies for sustained growth and that 
foreign investment and technology imports are necessary for 
further development. 
  Han said Koreans are well aware that foreign loans, which 
helped to develop the country's economy, are no longer 
instrumental in importing the technology the economy needs in 
its present stage of growth.

<F P=106> [Article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong: </F>
"The U.S. Congressional Report on `Reassessment of Military 
Cooperation'"] 
  [Text] The report entitled "North Korea's Nuclear 
Development Plan," which was made public by the U.S. 
Congressional Investigation Bureau last month, pointed out that 
the Kim Yong-sam Government is approaching the North Korean 
nuclear issue based on a short-term standpoint as to what 
influence the nuclear issue will exert on North-South relations. 
The congressional report also observed that the ROK is concerned 
with the possibility of being estranged from active diplomacy 
and of suffering a blow therefrom. Thus, the ROK is opposed to 
comprehensive negotiations between the United States and North 
Korea unless the North Korean side responds to North-South 
dialogue. 
  The U.S. Congressional report also noted that differences 
have been revealed in the method of dealing with the North 
Korean nuclear issue between the United States and the ROK, and 
such differences worked as a stumbling block in the United 
States' formulation of its policy toward the North Korean 
nuclear issue. The report said that unlike the assurance of the 
governments of the ROK and the United States on the satisfactory 
cooperative system maintained between the two countries, they 
failed to attain practical cooperation. The ROK asked the United 
States to "resolutely but tenderly deal with" North Korea so 
that it does not get angry, thus making an inconsistent and 
contradictory demand. As a result, the United States suffered a 
blow in understanding the true intention of the ROK side. THE 
NEW YORK TIMES wrote that the ROK is attempting to cautiously 
approach the North Korean nuclear issue on the precondition that 
a war against North Korea must be avoided while the United 
States regards it necessary to approach the North Korean nuclear 
issue firmly and in a decisive manner based on firm unity 
between the ROK and the United States. The WALL STREET JOURNAL 
on 7 March also pointed out that because of the inconsistent, 
double-dealing, hardline and moderate nature of countermeasures 
by the ROK government and of anti-U.S. sentiment, confusion has 
been caused to the U.S. policy on the North Korean nuclear 
issue. It was learned on 11 March that the attitude of the ROK 
Government, which is running about in confusion, was seriously 
discussed during a closed-door session of the hearing in the 
U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on 2 March. Gordon 
Sullivan, U.S. Army chief of staff; Barry R. McCaffrey, 
commander of the U.S. Southern Command; Charles Larson, 
commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet; Gary Luck, commander of 
U.S. Forces Korea; and the vice chief of naval operations, 
attended the hearing. After a public session, the senators held 
a closed-door meeting and raised the issue on the new assessment 
of relations between the two countries from the standpoint of 
ROK-U.S. military cooperation. 
  General Luck stated in the hearing that the United States 
is fully ready to deploy Patriot missiles for the U.S. Forces in 
the ROK at any time but that the decision for the deployment was 
still pending because the ROK Government was worried that the 
deployment of Patriot missiles might provoke North Korea. 
  U.S. Senator Richard Lugar who was in the ROK with Senator 
Sam Nunn in mid-January said on his return from the trip that 
the ROK people's view of North Korea has changed capaciously 
compared with that in the past. He added, "We noted that the 
ROK might have altered its military objective in such a way as 
to take into consideration a broader political situation than 
the problem of North Korea." He called attention to the fact 
that the United States has made cautious efforts to reestablish 
its cooperative security relations with the ROK. 
  The United States, particularly the U.S. Congress, has had 
doubt about the feasibility of the appeasement policy toward 
North Korea. Some said that North Korea may already have a 
nuclear bomb, and the plan for the deployment of Patriot 
missiles and offensive Apache helicopters in the ROK was 
materialized. A U.S. national intelligence assistance team was 
recently deployed to the ROK, and a plan was announced that an 
aircraft carrier would be deployed on the sea near the ROK. 
These moves show the U.S. mood that it cannot accede 
indefinitely to the ROK insistence that the ROK and the United 
States endeavor for peaceful settlement through dialogue to the 
end rather than resorting to a hasty stick. 
  Some Washington military critics criticized the ROK 
position, 
saying that the United States has had its self-respect hurt much 
in its tug-of-war with North Korea over the nuclear issue and 
that the ineffective policies put forth by the ROK policymakers 
elated North Korea so much that they led the North Korean 
nuclear issue to the war of pride between the United States and 
North Korea. Some U.S. circles came to think that while the 
United States and North Korea were dealing with the critical 
issue with the tough stance of not hesitating to use sanctions 
and taking military countermeasures, the ROK took an indecisive 
attitude without concrete logic between the United States and 
North Korea. This may be one of the reasons why in some circles 
in the United States, such as the U.S. Congress, ROK-U.S. 
military cooperation became an issue for discussion.

  [Text] Sunkyong Group Chairman Choe Chong-hyon met with 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin Thursday [10 March] and agreed on 
the construction of a joint-venture oil refinery with daily 
capacity of 100,000 barrels, business sources said here 
yesterday. During Choe's unofficial courtesy call to the Chinese 
leader, the Korean business tycoon proposed the joint-venture 
refining plant as part of projects to promote substantial 
economic cooperation between the two countries and received 
positive support from Jiang. Choe, who was visiting China on a 
five-day schedule, became the first foreign businessman to 
exclusively meet with the top Chinese leader, the sources said. 
  Under the proposed plan, Sunkyong will tie up with Sinopec, 
China's state-run petrochemical company, and municipal 
government of Shenzhen to build the $1.5-billion refining plant 
in the free-trade city along China's southern coast, under the 
equity participation ratio of 40-30-30. Formal signing for the 
contract will likely be made during President Kim Yong-sam's 
visit to China between March 26-30, they said. 
  When materialized, the 100,000 barrel-per-day plant will 
mark 
the biggest joint project between the two countries in terms of 
investment amount. Korea's daily refining capacity now totals 
16.7 million barrels. A Sunkyong Group official said the oil 
plant is part of its grand overseas investment program, aimed at 
relocating the conglomerate's vertically-integrated 
petrochemical sector to China and other Southeast Asian nations. 
  The nation's fifth-largest industrial conglomerate also 
plans 
to participate in oil exploration project in China's No. 23 oil 
mining zone along the East China Sea, build polyester chip and 
acetate factories in Shantou, and operate mobile 
telecommunication service network for China's three northeastern 
provinces, the official said. It already has been operating a 
solar cell battery factory in Shenzhen and a video tape plant 
with annual production capacity of 18 million tapes in Fujian 
Province, he said.

  [Text] Security authorities are sounding the alarm as lost 
and stolen South Korean passports are being abused by other 
Asian nationals, who use them to enter the United States, Japan 
and other countries. 
  Two Chinese nationals were caught last Dec. 21 trying to 
enter Los Angeles with altered South Korean passports, followed 
by one in New York and another in Chicago Dec. 29, Foreign 
Ministry officials and travel agencies said yesterday. 
  Cambodians, Thais and Turks have been caught using South 
Korean passports in Japan and the United States. 
  Cambodian nationals turned up with four South Korean 
passports Jan. 8 that were stolen separately in Hong Kong, New 
York and Seoul, with the latest incidents occurring in Thailand, 
Belgium, the Philippines and the United States throughout 
January until Feb. 4. 
  Officials said they believe the passports are being sold on 
the black market for $1,500 to $2,000 in places like Bangkok and 
Manila. 
  The concern in Seoul is that due to the rise in illegitimate 
passports, foreign immigration officials may decide to step up 
security checks and entry procedures for South Korean passport 
holders, the officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- The government held a 
unification-related ministers' meeting on Tuesday morning to 
discuss the seventh inter-Korean working-level contact slated 
for Wednesday. 
  At the meeting presided over by Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime 
minister and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB), 
the ministers agreed to strive for an agreement on exchanging 
special envoys at the seventh contact. 
  They also decided to keep pushing for the exchange by March 
21 after analyzing the results of the six inter-Korean 
working-level contacts held so far. 
  The ministers, however, reaffirmed that if North Korea 
delays 
the envoy exchange to the last minute, the third round of 
high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington should be put 
off too, informed sources said. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu reported on the 
results of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspection of North Korean nuclear sites, officials said. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Senior Presidential 
Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong 
Chong-uk also attended the meeting.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- Clear differences of 
opinion on pending issues cropped up at Friday's meeting between 
the leaders of the ruling and main opposition parties, 
foreshadowing a tense political situation in the days ahead. 
  Although President Kim Yong-sam and Yi Ki-taek, chairman of 
the Democratic Party [DP], agreed on the need for political 
reform, they were sharply divided on such issues as the DP's 
calls for abolition of the National Security Law and 
renegotiation of the Uruguay Round trade accord. 
  Kim Yong-sam, also president of the ruling Democratic 
Liberal 
Party (DLP), rejected in no uncertain terms the opposition 
demands at a two-hour meeting at Chongwadae [presidential 
offices] Friday morning. 
  The talks' outcome brought a critical, if not angry, 
reaction 
from the ranks of the Democratic Party. 
  As a result, friction between the ruling and opposition 
parties is expected to rise as the DP plans to work against 
ratification of the Uruguay Round accord at the National 
Assembly, continue to press the DLP and the government to 
abolish the National Security Law, and highlight the sensitive 
issue of rising prices. 
  DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won said Saturday that President Kim 
raised many issues such as his views on North Korea, his 
determination to realize clean politics and measures for the 
Uruguay Round agreement. 
  "But there is such a wide gap between his views and those of 
the Democratic Party, we could not help being disappointed by 
them (Kim's views)," Pak said. 
  "We detected the will to reform in the president's remarks 
but we could not also help worrying that (he) is heading toward 
a civilian dictatorship under the pretext of political reform," 
Pak said. 
  Pak said the opposition party was particularly upset by an 
"unscruplous and intentionally arrogant" statement issued by 
Chongwadae on the Kim-Yi meeting. 
  "How could they wish to conduct politics with the kind of 
attitude that demeans the (leader) of the other side," he said. 
  "We do not wish to worsen relations between the ruling and 
opposition parties over such a matter and the Democratic Party 
has no plans to resort to action (against the DLP and the 
government)," Pak said. 
  "But it (Friday's meeting) could become a reference point 
when we are formulating policies," he said, hinting that 
depending on how the issues are addressed, the opposition party 
will mount a strong offensive. 
  One senior DP official said the party plans to push strongly 
for renegotiation of the Uruguay Round agreement and revision of 
the National Security Law. 
  The government and the ruling party are also taking a lax 
attitude toward the problems of rising consumer prices and 
welfare of ordinary citizens, he said. 
  In contrast to the opposition reaction, the ruling party 
gave 
high marks to the two leaders' agreement to work together to 
implement the newly adopted political reform legislation. 
  DLP Secretary-General Mun Chung-su said, "it was an epochal 
event in the 50-year constitutional history that the president 
and the representative of the opposition party have agreed to 
realize political reform and a revolution in elections." 
  Commenting on opposition complaints that Yi failed to get "a 
present (concession)" from the president, Mun said the past 
practice of an opposition party leader receiving such a gift is 
an anachronism. 
  "It (such thinking) has to change," Mun said. 
  Mun said, however, that the issues Yi Ki-taek raised at 
Friday's meeting can be taken up at various meetings or 
working-level negotiations. 
  Mun thus indicated that the ruling party plans to actively 
negotiate with the opposition party on those issues in order to 
avoid a tense situation. 
  DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong also said Friday's meeting was 
held 
not to give or take anything. "It was called to discuss how to 
carry out the political reform laws which are unprecedented in 
the political history of this country," ha said. 
  "If the ruling and opposition parties had a confrontational 
relationship in the past, it is now time for them to forge a 
partnership," he said.

  [Text] Chunchon, Kangwon Province, March 12 (YONHAP) -- 
President Kim Yong-sam said Saturday that the government will 
not fail to achieve election reform in 1995 polls for chiefs of 
district self-governing bodies and in the next general election. 
  The president made the remarks in a meeting with figures 
from 
various walks of life before being briefed on Kangwon Province's 
administrative plan for this year. 
  Kim clarified anew the strict application of the political 
reform laws, saying, "I will see to it that a candidate who 
spent a lot of money will never be elected as a lawmaker or 
chief of a district self-governing body." 
  He also commented on his meeting Friday with Yi Ki-taek, 
chairman of the main opposition Democratic Party. 
  Kim said, "It is significant in and of itself that I met 
with 
the opposition party chairman to frankly exchange views. The 
meeting has important meaning in the country's political history 
since it was realized after ruling and opposition party 
lawmakers unanimously passed the political reform bills at the 
National Assembly."

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- Democratic Party [DP] 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek declared Tuesday his determination to pursue 
unification of the opposition parties. 
  "The party and myself are willing to offer considerable 
concessions on vested rights to unify the opposition camp within 
the scope of protecting the legitimacy of the DP," Yi said at a 
press conference marking the first anniversary of his leadership 
of the main opposition party. 
  In order to build a powerful opposition, Yi said he would 
join hands not only with the existing opposition parties -- the 
United People's Party, New Korea Party and New Political Reform 
Party -- but also with dissident and civil groups. 
  The DP would soon coordinate party opinions in a supreme 
council meeting and, depending on the form of unification, could 
make considerable concessions on its vested rights, he said. 
  "During the past year as party leader, I realized that 
without inner discipline, any rewards from struggling against 
the ruling party or progress as a policy-making party are 
useless," he said, vowing to instill discipline in party members 
or step aside. 
  He said he would prepare for next year's mayoral and 
gubernatorial elections by strengthening the DP's nationwide 
network, adopting a budget accounting system and conducting 
training programs for election candidates and winners at home 
and abroad. 
  An agreement reached recently by DP and ruling DLP floor 
leaders to create a subcommittee on legislation and judiciary to 
discuss revision or abolition of the national security law must 
be honored, he said. 
  He pledged that formation of the legislation and judiciary 
subcommittee would top the agenda when a special National 
Assembly session opens in May. 
  Yi proposed that a special committee to reform legislation 
affecting the public, including the national security law, 
police neutrality law, Bank of Korea independence law, unified 
medical insurance law and labor relations law, be set up on a 
full-time basis. 
  He hinted at a stronger attack against the ruling camp, 
saying he would no longer tolerate delay in the installation of 
a National Assembly intelligence committee under the revised law 
related to the Agency for National Security Planning. 
  "Though it is best that I visit North Korea after an 
inter-Korean summit, I am firm on my wish to visit North Korea 
despite the lack of realization of such a summit," the 
opposition party leader said. 
  He said he would apply to visit the North at an appropriate 
time depending on progress in inter-Korean dialogue and 
Pyongyang-Washington talks. 
  Yi, however, said little about his recent summit with 
President Kim Yong-sam except to note that the DP, as a 
legitimate opposition party, has performed its duty in helping 
the government when it is headed in the right direction and 
offering criticism when it is not. 
  He went on to urge a thorough investigation into a bribery 
scandal concerning the state-financed National Agricultural 
Cooperative Federation and relocation of Sangmudae, an army 
athletic unit. 
  He said his party would emphasize economic affairs as its 
success in the local elections also depended on resolving the 
public's financial problems.

  [Text] Seoul, March 14 (YONHAP)--President Kim Yong-sam has 
called for a powerful police force, declaring, "We can't 
increase national competitiveness insofar as violence and crime 
are rampant in our society." 
  Speaking on Monday [14 March] at the Korean Police Academy's 
commencement ceremony in Yongin, about 40 kilometers East of 
Seoul, the chief executive said the more advanced a country, the 
more powerful its police. "Rule by law can be realized with a 
strong police force... We can't maintain law and order with a 
weak police force," he stressed. 
  Unlawful, violent demonstrations cannot be justifed under 
any 
circumstances, nor can any violations of law and order be 
forgiven, he added. 
  "The people want the police to be a strong sentry of law and 
order... The police must have a sense of mission to protect the 
people and the nation," he said. 
  Kim said the government would not spare any efforts to 
modernize the country's police force and to improve their 
treatment and working conditions.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- Rep. No Chae-pong of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) lodged a strong protest 
with the Democratic Party [DP] Monday, slamming the DP's 
in-house report that he and another DLP lawmaker, Yi Chun-ku, 
planned to form a new political party. 
  "Your report on current political trends is fictitious and 
untrue," No said in the protest note. 
  "The Democratic Party has to take proper responsibility as a 
legitimate party for preparing and distributing a false report," 
No demanded. 
  The DP's office of party affairs coordination submitted the 
report in question Monday to the party's governing Supreme 
Council. 
  The report, forecasting the future of domestic politics, 
said 
that many ruling party members who were active in the 
administrations of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u would bolt the DLP 
and form a new party 
  They were already planning to do so in the belief that they 
would not receive party nominations for the next parliamentary 
elections in 1996 due to changes taking place in the DLP under 
President Kim Yong-sam's political strategy, the report said. 
  No, former prime minister under No Tae-u, and Rep. Yi 
Chun-ku, former DLP secretary-general, planned to form a new 
party embracing disgruntled DLP members and former military 
officers purged in President Kim's anti-corruption drive, the 
report said. 
  In his protest note, No said, "DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, as 
the 
leader of the party, has to apologize not only to myself and 
Rep. Yi Chun-ku but also the Democratic Liberal Party, in which 
both of us are party postholders." 
  Henceforth, the Democratic Party must try to maintain 
dignity 
and responsibility as a legitimate political party in dealing 
with public affairs of a similar nature, No said. 
  There was no immediate reaction from Rep. Yi Chun-ku as he 
is 
currently visiting Germany. 
  Officials at the Democratic Party, meanwhile, admitted that 
the two DLP lawmakers' honor could have been stained since their 
names were mentioned in an official paper. 
  The party is looking into apologizing to the two men in the 
name of the director of the office of party affairs 
coordination, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 14 (YONHAP) -- Former President Chon 
Tu-hwan's "donation" of political funds totaling 14 billion won 
(17.5 million U.S. dollars), including 100 million won in 
interest, to the government, had been transferred to the 
national treasury as of April 25, 1989, Board of Audit and 
Inspection (BAI) officials said Monday [14 March]. 
  Precisely what happened to the funds is not known because 
national treasury funds are channeled, irrespective of their 
source, into the government's fiscal plan, the officials said. 
  The BAI looked into whether Chon's donation was placed in 
the 
national treasury at the request of the opposition Democratic 
Party during the recent parliamentary session.

  [Text] The government plans to legislate, revise or abolish 
149 laws this year in a bid to make the legal system of Korea 
fit the emerging international economic order after the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations. 
  Thirty-two laws are related to deregulation in the economic 
field. They include the Foreign Trade Law, the Insurance Law 
and the Law on Farmland Ownership. 
  Legislation Minister Pak Song-kyu reported to the weekly 
cabinet meeting yesterday that the Foreign Trade law will be 
revised to allow people to engage in international trade by 
simply reporting their business to the authorities. 
  Pak said the regulation on financial support for Korean 
businesses which suffer losses because of imported products will 
be also modified. 
  He said his office has already handed in 15 bills to the 
National Assembly for consideration. It will seek the 
Assembly's approval for the other bills at the upcoming special 
or regular sessions. 
  The government will draw up a bill on development of the 
information industry to provide tax benefits to the investors in 
this area. 
  Minister Pak said his office is working to draw up a bill on 
the promotion of people's health with a view to providing 
regular health checks to all people. 
  The bill would form a fund for national health promotion 
using part of the profits from the sale of cigarettes, a 
government monopoly.

by 
item, shipments of heavy-industry products such as electronics, 
machinery and automobiles soared 11.3 percent while

and direct consumer goods also dropped 3.4 percent. 
  Imports rose 3.4 percent from the same month of 1993 and 
issuance of import licenses jumped 17.5 percent, indicating that 
imports are likely to grow considerably in the near future.

  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- The administration's 
ethics committee on Tuesday [15 March] started looking into the 
real estate holdings of 680 civil servants ranked at grade one 
and above who reported changes in their property status late 
last month. 
  The investigation is focusing on how their real estate 
holdings have changed since the last property registration early 
last year, committee officials said. 
  To carry out its work, the committee obtained real estate 
registers from the Home and Construction Ministries and the 
National Tax Administration. 
  The committee has also asked banks and other financial 
institutions to provide financial data related to 120 to 130 
civil servants who registered no change in their financial 
assets, though they are considered to have made asset changes. 
  Examination of the financial data will start early next 
month 
when the committee obtains the data, an official said. 
  The investigation will be completed toward the end of May, 
and those civil servants found to have falsely registered 
propertychanges will face punishment including dismissal and 
fines of up to 20 million won.

  The ministry plans to start building up a data base on 
diplomatic information this year. 
  It will begin with information on people, protocols, 
economic 
and trade statistics, National Assembly interpellation 
summaries, diplomatic schedules, dates of global events and 
international organizations this month. 
  Work on the data base will continue to include diplomatic 
policies, materials, books and personnel. 
  Comprehensive and efficient management of diplomatic 
information is neccessary to respond quickly and aggressively to 
changes in the world, an official said. 
  In the long run, the ministry will adopt a multi-data system 
that handles letters, images and sounds at the same time and 
introduce an optical file system to produce colorful image data.

  [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- GEC Alsthom, selected as 
priority negotiator on the supply of trainsets to the projected 
Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway line, has agreed to transfer its 
TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) technology individually to members 
of the consortium to be formed for the project, instead of 
through any particular member, Daewoo Heavy Industries, Ltd. 
said over the weekend. 
  Late last year, the French company named Hyundai Precision 
&amp; 
Industry Co. as the consortium's prime contractor in order to 
transfer its technology only through Hyundai, but the agreement 
was a reversal of this decision. 
  Under the agreement, GEC Alsthom will transfer its 
technology 
related to the manufacture of TGV locomotives and coaches 
equally to consortium members, the officials said. 
  Daewoo and GEC Alsthom will negotiate details of the 
technology transfer and consortium forming in the near future, 
they added. 
  Because of the agreement between Daewoo and GEC Alsthom, the 
forming of a consortium for the production of high-speed 
trainsets will be expedited, along with the negotiations between 
the government and the French firm for the final contract. 
  Officials of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry Co. refused to 
make any official comments on the Daewoo-GEC Alsthom agreement 
but unofficially welcomed it, saying it would expedite the 
forming of the consortium.

  Daewoo, which said it had been assured a partnership role

be produced in Korea. 
  The trains will be assembled and tested at Hyundai

and Daewoo: and the motorized carriages by Hanjin. 
  The technology and production of components such as traction 
motors, bogies and electrical equipment will be allocated to 
specialized companies, Alsthom said. 
  Goldstar and Samsung will participate in the signalling and 
traffic control systems.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Hwang Ui-pong: "Powerhouses in the Kim </F>
Chong-il Republic"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The story about the likelihood 
of something serious happening inside the power structure in 
North Korea where the succession of power to Kim Chong-il has 
been nearly completed is not limited to the realm of fiction. 
The Japanese biweekly SAPIO in its 12 August 1993 issue printed 
a sensational article about the possibility of a violent clash 
between the Kim Il-song faction and the Kim Chong-il faction. 
  The article said: "The first round of high-level talks 
between the United States and North Korea on matters concerning 
North Korea's withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty [NPT] was held in New York. But the venue for the second 
round was moved to Geneva. It appears that Kim Il-song had 
something to do with the change of the venue. He probably wanted 
to prevent Kim Chong-il from making policy decisions and give 
his own instructions to the North Korean delegatio through 
Ambassador Kim Kwang-sop in Vienna. Earlier, on 18 March, just a 
week after North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT, 
Kim Kwang-sop took up his post as ambassador in Vienna. He is 
the husband of Kim Kyong-chin, daughter of Kim Il-song's third 
wife, Kim Chong-ae. Kim Kyong-chin is Kim Pyong-il's sister. 
Behind the sudden appointment of Kim Kwang-sop was Kim Il-song's 
desire to avoid isolation from the international community by 
dispatching Kim Kwang-sop, a man belonging to the anti-Kim 
Chong-il force, to the seat of IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] headquarters." 
  The SAPIO article continues: "There is a possibility that an 
internal change in North Korea, irrespective of sanctions from 
the outside, will happen. Nobody knows when a neurotic Kim 
Chong-il might instruct his close aides who are present at a 
midnight meeting surrounded by pretty women to mount a 
deliberate attack on the South to provoke the South Korean 
front-line division commanders, or might order his aides to take 
up a plan to invade the South as a subject of discussion at such 
a meeting. Should that really happen, first- and 
second-generation revolutionaries might urge officers who 
support Kim Pyong-il to rise up in order to block Kim Chong-il's 
adventure." 
  The content of the SAPIO article seems to have little 
substance. There is almost no reliable information to 
substantiate the likelihood of serious strife or conflict 
breaking out within the North Korean power elite, at least at 
this moment. Rather the dominant view is that, with the process 
of "dynastic succession of power to Kim Chong-il" progressing 
smoothly, a tidy Kim Chong-il kingdom is in the making. 
  Nevertheless experts on North Korea are cautiously watching 
developments in North Korea. According to them, it appears on 
the surface that the Kim Chong-il hierarchy is being 
established, and there is ample room for unstable developments, 
depending on the situation. In the opinion of these experts, 
North Korea could be engulfed in an unpredictable political 
upheaval when Kim Il-song dies. 
  One thing is certain about the Kim Chong-il leadership, 
namely, that after Kim Il-song dies, there will be internal 
strife in one form or another, and the way this strife is 
overcome may decide the fate of the Kim Chong-il regime. The 
prevailing view is that, in this process, threats to Kim 
Chong-il from opposing forces may come in the form of internal 
conflict among those in power rather than in the form of 
something like a popular uprising. 
  Accordingly, it is very important to examine the profiles of 
those in power in North Korea in predicting the future of not 
only the current North Korean regime but also the Kim Chong-il 
regime after Kim Il-song's death. Would there emerge in North 
Korea a man like Khrushchev who downgraded Stalin? Or would the 
successor to the dictator in North Korea fall as Hua Guofeng did 
after Mao Zedong died? 
  To examine the personal connections of those in power in 
North Korea, it is necessary first of all to know the 
peculiarities of the North Korean power structure. As everyone 
knows, In North Korea the party dominates the power structure. 
The party stands above the government, and all decisions and 
policies of the government are under party control. Power 
centers on three organizations, namely, the Workers Party of 
Korea [WPK] Central Committee that exercises supreme leadership 
when the WPK Congress is not in session; the Political Bureau in 
control of the Central Committee; and the core of the Political 
Bureau, namely, its Standing Committee. 
  The Political Bureau, which is at the center of power, 
currently consists of 13 full members and nine candidate 
members. The full members are: Kim Il-song (head of state, WPK 
general secretary, and chairman of the WPK Military Affairs 
Committee); Kim Chong-il (chairman of the National Defense 
Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Armed 
Forces [KPA]); O Chin-u (minister of People's Armed Forces); 
Kang Song-san (premier of the State Administration Council); Yi 
Chong-ok (vice president); Pak Song-chol (vice president); Kim 
Yong-chu (vice president); Kim Yong-nam (minister of foreign 
affairs); Choe Kwang (KPA chief of General Staff); Kye Ung-tae 
(party secretary); Chon Pyong-ho (party secretary); Han 
Song-yong (party secretary); So Yun-sok (responsible secretary, 
South Pyongan Provincial WPK Committee). These are really the 
most influential persons in North Korea. 
  Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il, and O Chin-u (members of the 
Political Bureau Standing Committee) are at the core of the 
power center in North Korea. Considering the fact that O Chin-u 
is a symbolic figure representing the military as Kim Il-song's 
comrade in revolution, it may be said that Kim Il-song and his 
son are the ones who actually rule North Korea. 
  The Secretariat, as important as the Political Bureau in the 
party machinery, discusses matters relating to personnel and 
other important matters as they arise and make pertinent 
decisions. Whereas the Political Bureau is a political 
organization that chiefly makes highly important political 
decisions, the Secretariat may be called an "organization above 
the administrative branch of government" because it formulates 
major practical polices and commands their implementation. The 
Secretariat consists of 11 members, including Kim Chong-il and 
Kye Ung-tae, under Secretary General Kim Il-song. It has 27 
specialized divisions and has 12 municipal and provincial WPK 
committees under its control. 
  In North Korea where the party stands supreme, holding party 
power means holding state power. The WPK Department of 
Organization and Guidance was the first official organization 
that Kim Chong-il joined in 1964 after he graduated from Kim 
Il-song University. It is in the party machinery where a 
majority of his trusted followers are placed. The WPK is Kim 
Chong-il's power base. 
  The one who draws the foremost attention in the North Korean 
party hierarchy is Chang Song-taek, 49, husband of Kim 
Chong-il's younger sister. As a WPK Central Committee member, 
Chang heads three party departments, namely, the Department of 
Three-Revolution Team, the Department of Labor Organizations, 
and the Department of Youth Affairs. Irrespective of his 
position and rank, Chang Song-taek's star is rising rapidly 
because he is Kim Il-song's son-in-law and Kim Chong-il's 
brother-in-law. Opinions differ, but many experts regard Chang 
Song-taek as the third most powerful person after Kim Il-song 
and Kim Chong-il. 
  Chang Song-taek is said to be a highly capable person with 
smooth personal relationships. What is more, he spends his money 
generously for people around him. That is why he is very 
popular. He is regarded as Kim Chong-il's alter ego in the 
party. Whereas Kim Chong-il is not easily accessible, Chang is 
readily accessible. Naturally, party cadres tend to flock around 
the latter. Chang is called "Kim Chong-il's itinerant 
counterpart" because he is the man who puts into execution 
policies prepared by Kim Chong-il and his policy planners in the 
party. Kim Chong-il has such an unquestioning trust in Chang 
Song-taek that he is quoted as saying, "You are the only person 
I can trust and depend on." 
  Interestingly, some observers say that Chang Song-taek is 
rising so fast in the hierarchy that he is being held in check 
by both Ki Il-song and Kim Chong-il. Originally, Kim Il-song is 
said to have opposed accepting Chang as his son-in-law. Chang 
met Kim Il-song's daughter, Kim Kyong-hui, 48, for the first 
time while they were in college. Kim Kyong-hui, Chang's 
classmate at Kim Il-song University Department of Political 
Economics, loved him passionately. When Kim Il-song discovered 
their love affair, he forced Chang to be transferred to Songdo 
College of Political Economics in Wonsan. But Kim Kyong-hui 
loved Chang so much that she would travel to Wonsan by rail at 
each weekend to see him. In the end, Kim Il-song gave in and 
approved their marriage. 
  Even after the marriage, Kim Il-song continued to hold Chang 
in check. In June 1990, when Kim Chong-il recommended that the 
vacant post of director of state security be filled by Chang 
Song-taek, Kim Il-song squashed the recommendation. They say the 
reason Kim Il-song is holding Chang Song-taek in check is that 
Chang is superior to Kim Chong-il in ability as well as in 
character. 
  It is noteworthy that Kim Chong-il is also holding Chang 
Song-taek in check despite the fact that Chang is known as his 
closest aide. There were rumors that some sports officials and 
ambassadors known as Chang's men were replaced. In the latter 
part of 1993 the North Korean press mentioned "eliminating the 
act of playing toady to some cadres and fueling factionalism." 
Observers say that Chang Song-taek is the only person who could 
have been linked to this report. 
  In its 24 June 1993 weekly edition NAEWOE TONGSIN reported 
that Kim Chong-il began to put his brakes on Chang Song-taek's 
abuse of power. Based on testimony by a North Korean defector, 
NAEWOE TONGSIN said: "In early 1991 Kim Chong-il convened a 
meeting of important party cadres in the central party 
headquarters during which he pointed out and criticized one by 
one the irregularities committed by Chang Song-taek." Following 
this episode party cadres were said to be trying to avoid Chang. 
  As a matter of fact, it is difficult to confirm the rumor 
about the discord between Kim Chong-il and Chang Song-taek 
because their political activities are veiled in secrecy. But 
that rumor cannot but be the focus of attention because the 
blood ties among those at the top of the hierarchy might work as 
a fuse to kindle a power struggle. The story in Chong Ul-pyong's 
novel--the story that Chang Song-taek becomes the party general 
secretary after Kim Il-song and his son are ousted from 
power--may be based on the same assumption. 
  Kim Il-song's brother, Kim Yong-chu (72), is also arousing 
attention these days. Kim Yong-chu was removed from power in 
1974 when Kim Chong-il officially emerged as Kim Il-song's heir 
apparent. But he staged a comeback late last year for the first 
time in 20 years when he was named a Political Bureau member and 
vice president. Speculation is rife regarding his comeback. 
  In the past there were various rumors about his whereabouts. 
Some said he was convalescing in Siberia in the form of de facto 
confinement. Others said he was in Moscow. Still others said he 
was under house arrest in a house in South Pyongan Province. Ko 
Chong-song (33), who defected to South Korea in June 1993 while 
working as a guidance worker at the revolution's historical site 
in Kanggye, Chagang Province, testified as follows about Kim 
Yong-chu's whereabouts: 
  "Kim Yong-chu underwent medical treatment (for a mental 
disease) in Chamosan for a while after he was ousted from power 
by Kim Chong-il. Later he moved to Unsuri, a mountainous 
village in Nangnim County, Chagang Province. Subsequently, he 
stayed in Chosan County or, maybe in Iwon County, in Chagang 
Province until he moved to Puchang-tong, Kanggye City, in 1980. 
He stayed in Kangye until April 1991. As far as I know, he lived 
there idling away at home with no particular job. 
  "Kim Yong-chu lived in a duplex unit (about 20 pyong) in a 
two-story workers apartment complex in Kangye with his wife and 
two daughters. I heard the rumor that he had a son also. His 
older daughter was a guidance worker at the provincial 
Administrative [and Economic Guidance] Committee, and his 
younger daughter worked at the meteorological observatory in 
Chagang Province. It was in April 1991 that Kim Yong-chu moved 
to Pyongyang. About a week before he moved, his home was 
burglarized. Rumors said that the thief made off with a watch 
and money. 
  "According to rumors, Kim Yong-chu was able to move to 
Pyongyang after his two daughters petitioned Kim Chong-il. On 
the day he moved, Kim Chong-il went to Kanggye aboard a special 
train. When Kim Chong-il arrived, Kim Yong-chu's daughters met 
him for the first time. When the women addressed Kim Chong-il as 
`dear leader comrade,' he said to them, `You should not address 
me like that,' and told them to call him cousin." 
  Experts on North Korea make the following general analysis 
about the reasons for Kim Yong-chu's comeback: 
  First, Kim Yong-chu has been reinstated because the 
succession arrangements for Kim Chong-il are so secure that he 
can no longer be Kim Chong-il's rival. Second, the comeback is 
aimed at making Kim Yong-chu, Kim Chong-il's uncle, the guardian 
of the system for Kim Chong-il's succession to power. 
  Despite his exclusion from power for over 20 years, Kim 
Yong-chu's future role, particularly in the field of North-South 
relations, deserves attention in view of his career, including 
his cochairmanship of the North-South Coordinating Committee 
which he held when he was director of the WPK Central Committee 
Department of Organization and Guidance. 
  Some experts say that it is a mistake to regard him as an 
"expert on South Korea." When the 4 July 1972 Joint Statement 
was issued, he was named as cochairman of the Coordinating 
Committee simply because he was the counterpart of Yi Hu-rak, 
then ROK Central Intelligence Agency [KCIA] director. In 
reality, Pak Song-chol was in charge. However, some observers 
speculate that if a hurdle is raised in the way of Kim 
Chong-il's immediate succession to the presidency upon Kim 
Il-song's death, Kim Yong-chu might assume the presidency on a 
provisional basis for the purpose of crisis management. 
  Kim Nam-sik of the Institute for Peace said that Kim 
Yong-chu 
appears to have the ability to serve at least as a 
complementary force for the Kim Chong-il leadership structure, 
and that, depending on circumstances, the possibility cannot 
ruled out that he will serve as provisional president in the 
event of Kim Il-song's death, thereby filling the vacuum in the 
transitional period before the Kim Chong-il regime establishes 
itself. 
  The party line is an absolute guideline for action in North 
Korea, and any deviation from it automatically constitutes an 
antiparty, antinational, and antistate act. It is Kye Ung-tae 
(76), Political Bureau member and party secretary in charge of 
public security and judicial affairs, who sees to it that the 
party line is effectively implemented at party, government, 
military, and public levels. He is a powerful man with the right 
of personnel management over the director of state security, the 
minister of public security, the president of Central Court, and 
the procurator general of the Central Procurator's Office. Kim 
Si-hak (71), director of the WPK Department of Administration, 
furnishes Kye Ung-tae with various information collected from 
intelligence, public security, and judicial sources. By 
analyzing such information, Kye Ung-tae provides "partywide" 
guidance. He consults Kim Chong-il and receives instructions 
from him on important matters. In short, Kye Ung-tae is a 
powerful man who holds all intelligence and inspection 
organizations under his control. 
  Chon Pyong-ho (70) and Han Song-yong (67) are both Political 
Bureau members and members of the party Secretariat. Chon is in 
charge of heavy industry, and Han in charge of machine and metal 
industries. They were appointed to the Secretariat after the 
Kim Chong-il era began. They are Kim Chong-il's intimate 
technocrats who have shared their political fortunes with him. 
Reportedly, Chon and Han--both children of revolutionary 
martyrs--stayed with Kim Chong-il for about six months in Kim 
Il-song's residence before Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute 
opened in 1946. They were among the children of fallen 
revolutionaries whom Kim Chong-suk [Kim Il-song's wife] looked 
after in her home. In this way these children entered into 
special relationships with Kim Chong-il from their childhood. 
  Chon Pyong-ho is an authority on theories on party building 
and has such outstanding writing ability that he has reportedly 
drafted theses and speeches for Kim il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
Chon Pyong-ho is a member of the National Defense Commission. He 
is unique in that he is the only nonmilitary person in the 
commission besides Kim Chong-il, its chairman. In this position 
Chon pushes forward Kim Chong-il's stand by playing the role of 
a pipeline connecting the National Defense Commission to the 
party. Both Chon Pyong-ho and Han Song-yong are not only 
quick-witted, but also have profound expertise and an 
outstanding ability. Although their stars have not risen as 
fast as Kim Tal-hyon's, they have steadily maintained the tempo 
of their ascendancy and are regarded as important pillars 
propping up the Kim Chong-il heirdom. 
  So Kwan-hui (68), WPK secretary in charge of agriculture, is 
an influential person known as Kim Chong-il's intimate economic 
brain. He is recognized as an agricultural expert credited with 
the founding of the so-called chuche-based farming method. 
  Kim Kuk-tae (76), director of the WPK Department of Cadre 
Affairs, was among the first graduating class of Mangyongdae 
Revolutionary Institute. He is the son of the late Vice Premier 
Kim Chaek, who died during the Korean war. Kim Kuk-tae graduated 
from Kim Il-song University and studied at Moscow University. He 
is a bulwark and shield for the Kim Chong-il regime. A party 
theoretician, he was in overall command and supervision of 
political, ideological, and propaganda activities while serving 
as director of the WPK Department of Propaganda and Agitation in 
the 1967-1973 period. He was at the center of attention when he 
pushed forward the drive to found the unitary ideology system of 
the party. As part of this drive, he reorganized history 
research rooms into Kim Il-song research rooms. 
  Kim Kuk-tae played a decisive role in consolidating Kim 
Chong-il's power by ousting Kim Chong-il's stepmother, Kim 
Song-ae, and his uncle, Kim Yong-chu, from power. Reportedly, it 
was thanks to Kim Kuk-tae that the practice of hanging portraits 
of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il side by side was established. 
  Hwang Chang-yop (69), secretary in charge of ideology, and 
Yang Hyong-sop (71), speaker of the Supreme People's Assembly 
[SPA], are expert theoreticians. As such they are the 
ideological prop of the establishment and the "royal 
instructors" who teach the art of kingship to Kim Chong-il. 
Hwang Chang-yop, husband of Kim Il-song's niece, is a 
philosopher. After graduating from Kim Il-song University, he 
majored in philosophy at Moscow University. Upon returning from 
Moscow, he filled the chair of philosophy at Kim Il-song 
University and began to demonstrate his ideological and 
theoretical talents. He became the SPA speaker in his forties 
and served in that post for three terms. Beginning in 1975 or 
thereabout when North Korea joined the Nonaligned Movement, 
Hwang Chang-yop visited more than 30 countries on over 20 
occasions organizing chuche ideology research organizations in 
host countries. Thus he made a great contribution to the effort 
to muster the support of nonaligned nations by unfolding his 
so-called people-to-people diplomacy. 
  Reportedly, Hwang Chang-yop began to teach the art of 
kingship to Kim Chong-il when the latter was named heir apparent 
at the Seventh Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee in 
September 1973. From then on he assumed responsibility as 
manager of Kim Chong-il's public as well as private life. He 
introduced Kim Hye-suk (43) to Kim Chong-il. They say Kim 
Hye-suk is Kim Chong-il's second wife. After Kim Chong-il 
divorced his first wife, Hong Il-chon, there was a two-year 
blank period. In the course of searching for a candidate for 
Kim Chong-il's second wife, Hwang Chang-yop uncovered Kim 
Hye-suk, a beautiful woman hailing from Hoeryong, North Hamgyong 
Province. She is a graduate of Kim Il-song University. Hwang 
worked hard to rewrite Kim Chong-il's experience and his 
background in such a way as to fit his position as heir 
apparent. Hwang arbitrarily changed Kim Chong-il's birth place 
from the Soviet Union to Mt. Paekdu, and greatly contributed to 
idolizing Kim Chong-il by inventing such epithets for him as 
"the Party Center," "the Dear Leader," and "the Sagacious 
Leader." 
  All North Korean state programs and all foreign proposals to 
North Korea must be approved after going through ideological 
scrutiny by the party's chuche ideology research group led by 
Hwang Chang-yop. Particularly, any plan directed toward South 
Korea and various South Korean proposals are said to be subject 
to double scrutiny by him. Hwang Chang-yop, the circumspect 
scholarly type, pays more attention to giving lectures on chuche 
ideology than discussing matters of mutual interest when he 
meets foreign guests. That is why foreign visitors who meet him 
often give their impressions by saying, "It was like receiving a 
college lecture." 
  Yang Hyong-sop is the only high-ranking North Korean 
official 
who hails from Cheju, South Korea. While attending Moscow 
University, he became acquainted with Kim Yong-chu. Thanks to 
this tie, Yang Hyong-sop became Kim Il-song's relative by 
marrying Kim Sin-suk (86), Kim Il-song's cousin. His face was 
familiar to us because he hosted receptions for the delegations 
to the second, fourth, and sixth rounds of North-South 
high-level talks in Pyongyang in his capacity as speaker. 
Because he was close to Kim Yong-chu, Yang Hong-sop was demoted 
to president of the Academy of Social Sciences from a Standing 
Committee member of the Political Bureau in 1980. But he 
reemerged in the forefront of power as SPA speaker in April 
1984. He became a candidate member of th Political Bureau, thus 
rising in rank from 32d place to 18th. 
  The following are among the influential persons in charge of 
South Korean affairs--an important function in the North Korean 
power structure: Kim Yong-sun (59), party secretary for South 
Korean affairs, and Kwon Hui-kyong (66), director of the WPK 
Department of Investigations. In the personnel reshuffle last 
December, Ki Yong-sun lost his post as a candidate member of the 
WPK Political Bureau and slipped from 15th to 26th place in the 
ranking. This gives the impression that his power has been 
weakened. But judging from the fact that he still holds his 
position as party secretary for South Korean affairs, apparently 
he is still an influential person. According to recent reports, 
North Korea set up a high-power special measures group in 
preparation for sudden breakthroughs in its relations with the 
ROK, the United States, and Japan. Reportedly, Kim Yong-sun has 
taken charge of the U.S. unit. Kim, a tall massive figure, 180 
cm in height and 90 kg in weight, is regarded as a key player in 
the North's policy toward the South. 
  An anecdote illustrates Kim Yong-sun's straightforward 
personality. In 1984 when he was the deputy director of the WPK 
Department of International Affairs, Kim Chong-il said to him: 
"Inasmuch as what the party's Department of international 
Affairs does falls within the realm of foreign relations 
activity, its members should practice social dancing, such as 
the polka." So, Kim Yong-sun organized a dance party in the 
courtyard of the party central headquarters building, to which 
members of his department and their wives were invited. At the 
sight, officials of other department exclaimed, "The 
international department is going wild," and squealed to Kim 
Chong-il. The plea that the dance party was held according to 
Kim Chong-il's suggestion was not accepted. The party Department 
of Organization and Guidance investigated the case and confirmed 
some "cases of love affairs." As a result, Kim Yong-sun and 70 
employees, about half the total number of employees of the 
Department of International Affairs, were dismissed. Kim 
Yong-sun staged a comeback a year after this case, and in the 
end became director of the party's Department of International 
Affairs. 
  Kwon Hui-kyong is an expert on foreign information and 
collects information on South Korea. Apparently, he was chosen 
as the person in overall charge of this area because of his 
ability to collect and analyze information, a skill he learned 
while serving as ambassador to the Soviet Union for many years. 
While working as ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kwon Hui-Kyong 
used to return home once or twice a year to provide Kim Chong-il 
with high-level information and thus succeeded to win his trust. 
The fact alone that Kwon served as ambassador to the Soviet 
Union for 15 years in two stints shows that he carries a lot of 
weight. 
  There is an anecdote that gives some glimpses of Kwon 
Hui-kyong's character and loyalty to Kim Chong-il. When Kwon was 
ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kim Chong-il from time to time 
called him back for drinks. Each time he left Moscow for home, 
he kept not only his embassy staff but also then Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam, his superior, in the dark about his trip 
home. As a result, occasionally there was a stir in the North 
Korean embassy because nobody knew where the ambassador was. 
  Kim Ki-nam (68), director of the WPK Department of 
Propaganda 
and Agitation, may be reckoned as another influential figure in 
the WPK. He has held this job since 1987 and is said to have 
very close personal ties with Kim Chong-il. Actually, he is 
regarded as one of Kim Chong-il's closest aides. Number-one 
writer in the party, Kim Ki-nam not only writes articles for Kim 
Chong-il, but also takes overall command of all information and 
propaganda. All famous slogans in North Korea--such as "Let us 
live in our own way !" and "Study in the manner of anti-Japanese 
guerrillas!"--are his brainchild or were brushed up by him. Kim 
Ki-nam; Hyon Chun-kuk, NODONG SINMUN editor in chief; and Kim 
Chong-suk, MINJU CHOSON editor in chief, are called the "Gang 
of Three" of the propaganda team. 
  The military in North Korea is strictly under the control of 
the party, but it has the potential of playing the most powerful 
role in an emergency. That is why the military is always the 
focus of attention. At present the military is regarded as one 
of the major forces buttressing the Kim Chong-il succession 
system. But according to experts on North Korea, it is difficult 
to predict the course the military might take after Kim 
Il-song's death. That is why the military must be watched most 
closely in connection with any possible change in power in North 
Korea. 
  Among the influential figures in the military, O Chin-u (78) 
may come first. He is a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau and ranks third in the ranking order. He also 
holds the posts of minister of the People's Armed Forces, first 
vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, and member of 
the WPK Military Affairs Committee. As these titles suggest, he 
is the top man in the North Korean military. He belongs to the 
first generation of revolutionaries who engaged in anti-Japanese 
partisan operations under Kim Il-song. He actively supported the 
campaign to lay the groundwork for Kim Chong-il's succession to 
power, and was promoted to the rank of marshal in 1992. He has 
been constant in his loyalty to Kim Il-song and his son. 
  There is an interesting anecdote telling how O Chin-u came 
to 
be reverentially loyal to Kim Chong-il, who is inexperienced and 
so young compared with him. One day in the early winter of 
1985--the year in which O Chin-u was promoted to the rank of 
vice marshal--while driving a Mercedes-Benz 450 alone through 
Sosong Street, Sosong District, in Pyongyang at about 0200, his 
car hit a concrete pole in front of the Memorial Hall honoring 
the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. A policeman on 
patrol spotted the accident. Seeing the emblem of the vice 
marshal of the People's Army on O Chin-u's shoulder, the watch 
bearing a Kim Il-song mark on his wrist, and the special license 
number on his car, the policeman immediately knew that the 
driver was a high-ranking official in the hierarchy and took him 
to the hospital immediately. Meanwhile, the story says, Kim 
Chong-il, informed of the accident, promptly took measures to 
save O Chin-u's life. 
  On the night before the accident, O Chin-ui had a heated 
argument with Kim Chong-il at a drinking party about the 
question of dismissing O Kuk-yol. After the party was over, a 
frustrated O drove the car by himself leaving his driver and 
aide de camp behind, and had an accident on the way. That was 
the circumstance surrounding the accident. This anecdote is 
often cited to explain how O Chin-u came to be loyally devoted 
to Kim Chong-il, and how Kim Chong-il came to trust O Chin-u so 
much. 
  In connection with the future of North Korea, O Kuk-yol (65) 
draws more attention than O Chin-u. Reportedly, O Kuk-yol, a KPA 
general, is currently in charge of the party's Department of 
Operations. But in the future he is expected to be the minister 
of the People's Armed Forces. O Kuk-yol is a son of O Chung-hup, 
Kim Il-song's comrade-in-arms in partisan fighting. He was among 
the first graduating class of Mangyongdae Revolutionary 
Institute. He is an elite military officer who graduated from 
Kim Il-song University and a Soviet air force academy. 
  He was appointed as Air Force commander in 1968 at the age 
of 
40. In the middle of the 1970's O Kuk-yol, together with O 
Chin-u, suppressed the forces in the military opposed to the 
system insuring Kim Chong-il's succession to power. From then on 
O Kuk-yol enjoyed the complete trust of Kim Chong-il. In 1979 he 
was promoted to KPA chief of General Staff with the rank of 
lieutenant general (equivalent to two-star general in the South) 
and became a candidate member of the Political Bureau. In this 
way he emerged as a key figure in the military. 
  However, while breezing along on the royal road to success, 
O 
Kuk-yol had to relinquish his post as KPA chief of General 
Staff, which he had led for 10 years, to Choe Kwang in 1988 
because of his friction with O Chin-u. In those days O Kuk-yol, 
banking on Kim Chong-il's trust, ignored O Chin-u. As part of a 
scheme to oust O Kuk-yol, O Chin-u sent him to the Higher Kim 
Il-song Institute in January 1988 for a month-long training 
course. Meanwhile, O Chin-u presented a written evaluation 
report to Kim Il-song detailing irregularities committed by O 
Kuk-yol. As a consequence, O Kuk-yol was relieved as KPA chief 
of General Staff. 
  According to Ko Yong-hwan (41), a North Korean defector, O 
Kuk-yol is very popular among younger military officers. He is 
so popular that a saying circulates among North Korean military 
personnel that "if O Chin-u wages war, we might lose; but when O 
Kuk-yol does, we will win." The reason for O Kuk-yol's 
popularity is that, whereas O Chin-u has "the image of a senile 
old man," O Kuk-yol looks like an intelligent man of vision. 
While serving as KPA chief of staff, O Kuk-yol made many 
reasonable suggestions, including the suggestion that, to 
promote the modernization of the military, military personnel be 
given more opportunities to have overseas training, and that 
military commandeers be given more power so that they might not 
need to try to read the minds of political officers. 
  Another influential military figure who deserves attention 
alongside O Kuk-yol is Choe Kwang (76), KPA chief of General 
Staff. Choe Kwang, a vice marshal with background as a former 
partisan fighter, ranks next only to O Chin-u in the military. 
Dr. Kang In-tok, director of the Institute for Far Eastern 
Studies, regards Choe Kwang and Kim Kwang-chin (76), who 
symbolize the first generation of KPA soldiers, as persons to 
be reckoned with. Choe Kwang early on criticized the 
partisan-type antiquated North Korean military system and called 
for its modernization, and thus ended up losing his power. 
  The key figures in the North Korean military may be divided 
into two groups, one consisting of the first generation of 
partisan fighters, and the other consisting of military 
technocrats. KPA Vice Marshals Paek Hak-nim (76), Yi Ul-sol 
(74), and Chu To-il (78) belong to the former, whereas Generals 
Kim Tu-nam (66), Kim Kang-hwan (64), and Yi Pong-won (67) belong 
to the latter. 
  Paek Hak-nim is in charge of security matters as a member of 
the Military Affairs Committee and minister of public security. 
A veteran partisan fighter, he has been a close aide to Kim 
Il-song. He was a company commander of Kim Il-song's security 
force and later its overall commander. Pak Hak-nim is always 
associated with the legendary story that he rescued Kim Il-song 
from danger during an assault by his guerrilla unit on an area 
adjacent to the Tumen River bank. It is a well-known story 
throughout North Korea that Pak waded through the snow at the 
foot of the mountain in northern Manchuria searching for pine 
nuts for Kim Il-song who was completely exhausted in the icy 
winter weather there. Anyhow, thanks to this personal tie to Kim 
Il-song, Paek is also on intimate terms with Kim Chong-il. They 
say Paek brought from overseas the kinds of acoustic equipment 
and musical instruments Kim Chong-il liked as a gift for him. 
  Yi Ul-sol and Chu To-il, both members of the party Military 
Affairs Committee, head the General Bureau of Security and the 
Pyongyang Defense Command, respectively. These titles are 
indicative of their standing in the military. As a matter of 
fact, they have greater power than their positions suggest. Like 
Paek Hak-nim, they "have waited upon" Kim Il-song "near at 
hand." That is why, experts say, they are in a position to make 
the most of their unique ties to Kim Il-song and his son. The 
range of their activities is not limited to North Korea, and 
they are expected to go as far as it is necessary to prop up the 
Kim Chong-il heirdom. They are expected to serve as a shield for 
the Kim Chong-il regime when Kim Il-song dies. 
  Kim Tu-nam, Kim Kang-hwan, and Yi Pong-won all belong to the 
second partisan generation and are graduates of Mangyongdae 
Revolutionary Institute. They belong to the military power 
elite. Kim Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan are former and current 
directors of the party Department of Military Affairs, 
respectively. These two and O Kuk-yol are called "the troika who 
established the unitary ideology system of the party in the 
military." 
  What draws attention in connection with the careers of Kim 
Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan is the fact that both formerly served 
as deputy chief of Section 13 of the WPK Department of 
Organization and Guidance. This department is one of the 22 
departments under the party Central Committee, and it has 13 
sections. To all intents and purposes, the Department of 
Organization and Guidance is the highest power center in North 
Korea. It provides party guidance to all party, government, and 
military organizations through personnel management and 
ideological scrutiny. It is common knowledge that when it comes 
to personnel affairs, background materials prepared by the 
Department of Organization and Guidance play a vital role in 
taking personnel actions with regard to officials at the same 
level as or at higher levels than provincial party secretaries 
(equivalent to the rank of provincial governor), vice ministers 
of the State Administration Council (same as vice minister of 
the cabinet), and general officers. The Department of 
Organization and Guidance was the public organization in which 
Kim Chong-il began his public career. The fact alone that Kim 
Chong-il still has this department under his personal control is 
indicative of its power. 
  Various information converges on the Department of 
Organization and Guidance in the form of a daily report so that 
the department can use it in making ideological evaluations of 
important cadres. The collected information covers everything 
about cadres, for instance, details of a drinking bout the 
director of a certain department had with a certain person for a 
certain number of hours; or details of the medical treatment a 
certain military general received and the doctor's opinion on 
the patient's condition. These bits of information are used in 
evaluating cadres. Therefore it is no exaggeration to say that 
in a sense a guidance functionary in the communications and 
transportation section of this department has more power than 
the minister of posts and telecommunications. 
  Section 13 of the Department of Organization and Guidance in 
charge of military affairs not only gives guidance for the 
correct implementation of the party's military policy but also 
actually exercises the power held by the party Military Affairs 
Committee and the National Defense Commission. This department 
is really all-powerful because it also directly controls the KPA 
Party Committee and the KPA General Political Bureau. From the 
fact that Kim Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan once served as deputy 
director of this department in charge of Section 13, most 
probably they must have wielded immense power over the military. 
  Yi Pong-won is currently deputy director of the KPA General 
Political Bureau. O Chin-u being its director, Yi may be 
regarded as the de facto director. Yi, responsible for political 
control over the military, is in essence the special person Kim 
Chong-il dispatched to the military. He is expected to become 
next director of the General Political Bureau, succeeding Choe 
Kwang. 
  Persons emplaced in administrative, economic, and diplomatic 
positions in the State Administration Council are not as 
powerful as those in the party and military. But they are the 
ones who are charged with the task of finding practical 
solutions to difficult problems confronting North Korea, such as 
how to achieve economic development and how to improve North 
Korea's relations with the United States and Japan. That is why 
their roles are assuming added importance. 
  As far as we are concerned, technocrats in North Korean 
government organizations are the effective windows through which 
we can predict whether it is possible for North Korea to shift 
its direction to reform and opening. That is why attention is 
focused on these technocrats and the roles they are playing. 
  The State Administration Council, with the largest array of 
expert technocrats, is equivalent to our cabinet. But there are 
limits to its role because the party Political Bureau or 
Secretariat formulate all important policies and the State 
Administration Council draws up only detailed plans for their 
implementation. However, with the same influential persons 
holding both party and government positions, there are quite a 
few powerful persons in the State Administration Council. 
  Premier Kang Song-san (63) is Kim Il-song's cousin by a 
maternal aunt and the fourth-ranking member of the Political 
Bureau. He is a leading technocrat who has steered the North 
Korean economy together with Yi Kun-mo and Yon Hyong-muk. After 
graduating from Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and Kim 
Il-song University, Kang Song-san majored in economics at Moscow 
University. He started out as a guidance worker at the party 
Department of Organization and Guidance. He successively served 
as director of that department, responsible secretary of the 
Pyongyang Municipal WPK Committee, premier of the State 
Administration Council, and responsible secretary of the North 
Hamgyong Provincial WPK Committee before he was reappointed 
premier of the State Administration Council. 
  As is apparent from his blood ties to Kim Il-song and his 
career, Premier Kang Song-san is the top administrator in North 
Korea who has breezed along on the elite track. In a sense it is 
quite natural that his name is adorned with such epithets as 
"the front-runner of the new generation" and "the man at the 
head of the second generation of revolutionaries." Kang Song-san 
has been reckoned as one of the few trump cards that North Korea 
can use in reviving its economy. This can be easily understood 
when one traces the footsteps he has taken until now. This is 
because his career and North Korea's economic development and 
policy for opening are closely linked. 
  Kang Song-san was appointed to the premiership for the first 
time during the third session of the Seventh SPA in January 
1984. At this session he, then first vice premier, delivered a 
speech titled "On Stepping Up South-South Cooperation and 
External Economic Activities and Further Developing Trade 
Activities." After this speech, he was named premier of the 
State Administration Council. His speech drew attention because 
it was unique in that it called for active economic exchanges 
with capitalist countries. 
  During his premiership, North Korea enacted the joint 
venture 
law in September 1984 to facilitate ventures with foreign 
enterprises. In December of the same year North Korea 
established the External Economic Committee. He was relieved of 
his premiership in December 1986. Later, in March 1988, he was 
appointed as responsible secretary of the North Hamgyong 
Provincial WPK Committee. It appeared that he was demoted from 
the premiership to a position equivalent to provincial governor. 
But in the intervening years he worked out the plan for the 
development of "the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone." 
  Opinions differ about his image as a proponent of reform and 
opening that his career projects. Some say that, given the 
nature of the North Korean regime, Kang just acted 
administratively each time Kim Il-song and his son issued 
instructions and that the measures for opening he took were not 
of his making. Others, on the other hand, claim that it is a 
fact that, despite certain limitations, Kang Song-san has pushed 
for the opening of North Korea. 
  It is said that there are more than 10 vice premiers in the 
North Korean State Administration Council. Relatively well-known 
among them are: Choe Yong-nim (68), Kim Hwan (64), and Hong 
Sok-hyong in charge of the economy; and Kim Yong-nam (69) in 
charge of foreign relations. 
  Many observers predict that some day Choe Yong-nim and Kim 
Hwan will become premiers of the State Administration Council. 
This is to say that Kim Chong-il trusts them that much. 
According to these observers, Choe Yong-nim, a veritable 
retainer for the Kim Il-song clan, might become premier if the 
Kim Chong-il heirdom is beset with trouble, or if an economic 
crisis erupts and voices mount demanding accelerated opening to 
the outside world and faster economic development. 
  Choe Yong-nim, vice premier and minister of metal industry, 
is a retainer of the Kim Il-song family who early on served as 
senior secretary of the presidential palace. He is known for his 
meticulous character and his mental agility. He is said to be 
fluent in Russian, English, and Japanese. After becoming a vice 
premier in February 1984, he consolidated his position as the 
nucleus of administrative and economic organizations. He was 
relieved as vice premier in October 1985, but staged a comeback 
as a candidate member of the Political Bureau, vice premier, and 
chairman of the State Planning Committee in May 1990. 
  Vice Premier Kim Hwan once appeared to have been purged for 
a 
while but later staged a comeback. He is regarded as a would-be 
reformist in the Kim Chong-il era. He graduated from Kim Il-song 
University and Karl Marx School of Engineering in East Germany. 
He once served as a member of the Political Bureau of the WPK 
Central Committee and a member of the party Secretariat, and 
subsequently held other important jobs. He tried to set up a 
Chinese-type special zone in Kim Chong-suk County, Yanggang 
Province. Kim Hwan came out with that idea when Kim Chong-il was 
groping for some changes after he had consolidated his position 
as heir apparent at the Sixth WPK Congress. Although Kim 
Chong-il endorsed Kim Hwan's plan, Kim Il-song rejected it, and 
as a result, Kim Hwan was ousted from his post. 
  Hong Sok-hyong was named vice premier and chairman of the 
State Planning Committee succeeding Kim Tal-hyon in last 
December's reshuffle. He is a grandson of Hong Myong-hui and a 
son of Hong Ki-mun, former vice president of the Academy of 
Social Sciences. The background of his career advancement draws 
attention. Hong Sok-hyong successively served as first minister 
of metal industry in the State Administration Council and as a 
candidate member of the WPK Central Committee. He has been the 
responsible secretary of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex 
WPK Committee since 1988. He is known for his expertise in 
metals in particular and in science and technology in general. 
His latest promotion has prompted speculation that the focus of 
North Korea's economic policy will shift to economic activities 
in the field. 
  In connection with Hong Sok-hyong's role, it is noteworthy 
that he is concurrently chairman of the State Planning 
Committee. In a socialist state under a thoroughgoing economic 
planning system, the duties of the state planning committee are 
very important indeed. As a matter of fact, it has been 
customary for North Korea to assign big wheels to the 
chairmanship of the State Planning Committee. Particularly in 
view of the real condition in North Korea, which is in a 
transition period, we can easily imagine the great hope the 
party leadership might pin on Hong Sok-hyok. 
  Kim Yong-nam, foreign minister and concurrently member of 
the 
Political Bureau, is the godfather of North Korean diplomacy 
after the late Ho Tam. He was born a son of a railway worker in 
North Korea. After graduating from Kim Il-song University, he 
studied at Moscow University. Upon returning from Moscow, he 
embarked upon his career as a party bureaucrat in the party 
Department of International affairs. As a diplomatic 
technocrat, he concentrated on European diplomacy until the late 
1970's and on Southeast Asian and African diplomacy beginning in 
the 1980's. He has long served in the bureaucracy, probably 
because he is the type who stands aloof from factionalism or 
sectarianism. Attention is focused on how he will deal with 
outstanding issues, such as the IAEA nuclear inspection issue 
and the problem of improving North Korean relations with the 
United States and Japan. 
  Yi Hwa-son (58) and Kang Sok-chu (55) cannot be counted out 
from the list of influential figures in North Korean diplomacy. 
Yi Hwa-son is deputy director of the party Department of 
Organization and Guidance in charge of Section 2 of the 
department. He is not conspicuous to outsiders, but he is said 
to exercise very strong influence on North Korean diplomacy. He 
holds the right of personnel management over all North Korean 
diplomats except Kim Yong-sun and Kim Yong-nam. Even Vice 
Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu is said to be cowed in his 
presence. 
  Lately Kang Sok-chu has become a "star diplomat" as he often 
appears before mass media in his capacity as North Korean 
delegate to U.S.-North Korean negotiations on the nuclear 
facilities inspection issue. Kang, currently vice minister of 
foreign affairs, emerged as an important diplomat when he 
addressed the UN General Assembly as senior North Korea delegate 
when North Korea was admitted to the United Nations in late 
1991. He is classified as a typical technocrat. Very little is 
known about the background of his career. The period in which he 
began to cut a conspicuous figure in the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry coincided the period in which the campaign to 
establish the Kim Chong-il heirdom was in full swing. This may 
suggests that Kang Sok-chu may be one of the Kim Chong-il 
intimates. 
  According to Ko Yong-hwan, a former North Korean diplomat 
who 
defected to the South, Kang Sok-chu is a man who is 
"intelligent, skillful in adapting himself to circumstances, and 
fond of reproaching others to their faces." Kang stands ready 24 
hours a day to answer the call of Kim Chong-il at any time. 
According to Ko, when Kim Chong-il calls up the Foreign Ministry 
at 2300, Kang moves from room to room in shirtsleeves and 
slippers to collect papers in person instead of using the 
intercom and fax machine. 
  Experts on North Korea say that, inasmuch as Kim Chong-il 
set 
it as his strategic goal to establish diplomatic relations with 
the United States and Japan, he will have no choice but to keep 
Kang Sok-chu in important posts because of his proficiency in 
English and expertise in diplomacy toward the West. 
The future courses of the "faded stars" like Yon Hyong-muk 
(62) and Kim Tal-hyon (54) deserve attention. These two are 
well-known to us as the former premiers of the State 
Administration Council who attended the high-level inter-Korean 
talks. Although they are removed from the top post in the 
central government, they are expected to stage a comeback in 
view of their outstanding abilities as economic technocrats. 
Inasmuch as they are typical North Korean proponents of opening 
to the outside world, much is to be expected from them when 
inter-Korean economic cooperation moves into high gear. 
  Yon Hyong-muk, a native of North Hamgyong Province, 
graduated 
from Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and the Ural College of 
Engineering in the Soviet Union. After he became a guidance 
worker at the party Department of Organization and Guidance, he 
continued to climb the bureaucratic ladder and was elected to 
the party Central Committee in 1970 at the age of 38. In 1974 he 
was named a member of the Political Bureau and the party 
Secretariat. He is regarded as the foremost front-runner among 
the elite technocrats. After emerging as the number-one heavy 
industry expert, he became premier of the State Administration 
Council in December 1988. But he was demoted to responsible 
secretary of the Chagang Provincial WPK Committee at the Fourth 
Session of the Ninth SPA for his failure to fulfill the economic 
plan. 
  Yon Hyong-muk is known as a cautious and learned man with 
outstanding powers of judgment. Commenting on his personality, a 
defector from the North said, "If Kang Song-san knows only one 
side of a particular issue, Yon Hyong-muk will know three 
sides." Yon Hyong-muk currently is a candidate member of the 
Political Bureau. Therefore it is hard to conclude that he has 
been ousted from power. 
  We can guess the future standing of Kim Tal-hyon on the same 
basis as in the case of Yon Hyong-muk. Once he was called an 
"immediate candidate for the premiership," but he suddenly 
disappeared from the front stage of the power scene late last 
year. At that time speculation persisted that he just took 
responsibility for the slowdown in economic development as a 
matter of formality, and therefore he cannot be regarded as 
ousted from power completely. Observers attach weight to Kim 
Tal-hyon not only because he is a rare economic expert in North 
Korea but also because he is the husband of Kim Il-song's cousin 
once removed. Viewed from this angle, recent reports that Kim 
Tal-hyon has taken charge of a special measures team on South 
Korea deserve attention. 
  According to Ko Yong-hwan, Kim Tal-hyon says what he has to 
say even in front of Kim Il-song. In brief, he is the only man 
in the administration who can say "No" to Kim Il-song. That is 
why Kim Il-song sometimes characterizes him as "an arrogant but 
intelligent man." 
  There is the rumor that Kim Tal-hyon has been demoted as a 
warning because he appeared to be the head of the reformist 
group. 
  As is apparent from the above analysis, the North Korean 
hierarchy consists of the intimates of Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il without exception. In the socialist regimes in the 
Soviet Union and China, squabbles about party lines or policies 
begot factions, and factionalism gave rise to power struggles. 
But it seems that North Korea maintains a nearly perfect 
patriarchal leadership structure centering on Kim Il-song and 
his son. 
  This feature of the North Korean power elite is a by-product 
of the process in these past 20 years by which the Kim Chong-il 
leadership has thoroughly consolidated its support base while 
laying the groundwork for the succession of power. Nevertheless, 
an analysis of major players in the apparently monolithic North 
Korean power elite reveals some elements of factionalism. 
  First, the power elite has a strong characteristic of 
nepotism. Its salient feature is that many of Kim Il-song's 
relatives are entrenched in the center of power. The relatives 
of Kim Il-song and his son number more than 20. They include: 
Kim Song-ae, Pak Song-chol, Yang Hyong-sop, Hwang Chang-yop, 
Kang Song-san, Kim Chung-nim, Kim Tal-hyon, and Kim Yong-sun. 
  According to an analysis by a research team headed by Dr. 
Chon Hyon-chun at the Research Institute for National 
Unification, about 7 percent of the full members of the WPK 
Central Committee are Kim Il-song's relatives by blood and 
marriage. Considering the fact that it is difficult to ascertain 
the kinships because of the closed nature of North Korean 
society, the ratio must be much greater than that. About 50 
percent of these relatives on the Central Committee are above 
the 30th place in the ranking order. This ratio squares with the 
fact that five members of the Kim Il-song clan are among the 
first 10 places in the ranking order of the Political Bureau. 
  Second, graduates of particular schools are conspicuously 
numerous. Graduates of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, which 
has courses from kindergarten to high school, account for 3 
percent of officials with the rank of vice minister and above 
and 13 percent of the full membership of the Central Committee. 
These figures are only confirmed ones, and the actual numbers 
may far exceed them. 
  As for colleges and universities, Kim Il-song University and 
Kimchaek Polytechnic College top the list by a large margin. 
The ratio of graduates of the Kimchaek Polytechnic College is 
increasing, reflecting the tendency to attach greater importance 
to expert technocrats. Of those who studied abroad, 70 percent 
studied in the Soviet Union. 
  All this indicates that the path from Mangyongdae 
Revolutionary Institute to Kim Il-Song University to 
universities in the Soviet Union has been the typical academic 
track for the North Korean power elite. Mangyongdae 
Revolutionary Institute is a special school that admits only 
bereaved children of fallen revolutionaries and children of 
high-ranking officials. Anyone who enters this school will 
automatically be put on an elite track. 
  The regional distribution is also interesting. Overall, 
those 
who hail from Hamgyong Provinces and Pyongan Provinces account 
for a large proportion. Particularly in the Central Committee, 
those from Hamgyong Provinces account for 48.4 percent of the 
total full members, although the population of North and South 
Hamgyong Provinces accounts for 22.6 percent of North Korea's 
total population according to 1990 statistics. There is a 
historical factor behind the overwhelming large proportion of 
natives of Hamgyong Provinces in the power elite. It is said 
that Kim Il-song was reluctant to employ people from the areas 
that were once under the control of UN forces during the Korean 
war because, in his opinion, the temporary occupation 
compromised their social integrity. For this reason, he filled 
key posts with people from the Hamgyong Provinces, particularly 
North Hamgyong Province. 
  On the basis of our analysis of the key figures in the North 
Korean power elite and the peculiarities of their personal 
connections, we wonder whether it is possible to prognosticate 
about the possibility of change in the power structure in North 
Korea, particularly the possibility of the Kim Chong-il regime 
disintegrating after Kim Il-song dies. 
  Experts on North Korea admit that the process of succession 
of power to Kim Chong-il has progressed successfully. But they 
predict that when Kim Il-song dies, the present atmosphere of 
unconditional loyalty to Kim Chong-il might undergo considerable 
change. Kim Chong-il may be able to take over the reins of 
government from Kim Il-song, but it is impossible for him to 
inherit his father's charisma. That is why, experts say, there 
is bound to be a centrifugal force at work within the power 
elite. 
  Dr. Chon Hyon-chun gave the following estimate about the 
possibility of change in the power structure in North Korea: 
  "The cohesive power of the Kim Chong-il power elite is 
stronger than that of the power elite in any other socialist 
country. That is why, supposing Kim Chong-il will take control 
of North Korea after Kim Il-song dies, it might not be until at 
least three to five years after the succession of power that 
factional moves begin to appear. If factionalism appears in 
North Korea, it will be triggered by strife between the 
relatives of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il and a group of expert 
bureaucrats who are not their relatives." 
  In this regard Dr. Kang In-tok says that it is necessary to 
watch the first 1.5 generations of revolutionaries as well as 
the military. This generation of revolutionaries has been 
relatively alienated by the North Korean regime and might find 
it difficult to regard Kim Chong-il as a qualified successor to 
power. Therefore, when Kim Il-song dies, this generation might 
not show much reverence to Kim Chong-il. 
  In the military are many who have experienced life in the 
Soviet Union and East Europe. Therefore, experts say, these 
military officers are bound to question the appropriateness of 
Kim Chong-il as Kim Il-song's successor when the senior Kim 
dies. It is said that as a rule the party controls the military 
in a socialist country. However, experts say that this is true 
only in peacetime, and in times of emergency the military would 
control the party. In this event technocrats might join the 
anti-Kim Chong-il move in alliance with the anti-Kim Chong-il 
group, although not as its leading force. 
  If so, we are interested in the question of who could be the 
center of the anti-Kim Chong-il force in such an emergency. In 
this connection, some observers pay attention to Ambassador to 
Bulgaria Kim Pyong-il (41), who is Kim Chong-il's half-brother. 
But the dominant view is skeptical about Kim Pyong-il because of 
his youth and lack of experience. Nevertheless he remains a 
factor to be reckoned with because he resembles Kim Il-song and 
is more popular than Kim Chong-il. 
  We cannot ignore the outlook that, as examined above, the 
North Korea power elite would not change so easily. Some critics 
question the claim that in North Korea there is conflict between 
hard-liners and moderates or between conservatives and 
proponents of opening. In the opinion of these critics, we 
should not overlook the fact that people like Kim Tal-hyon, who 
are regarded as belonging to the group of proponents of opening, 
in reality have a strong party spirit as well as expertise and 
they are not diehard proponents of reform and opening. 
  In conclusion, if there is to be any change in the North 
Korean power structure, chances are high that change will 
appear after Kim Il-song's death. In this event, how the 
"powerful" military and the group of expert bureaucrats who have 
relatively good rational judgment, as well as the group of 
people who are not related to Kim Il-song by blood or marriage 
and who have been left out of power, will act will be the most 
crucial factor.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- The latest accord between 
Tokyo and Washington over cellular phone trade carries no 
government pledge guaranteeing results, a senior Trade Ministry 
official said Tuesday [15 March]. 
  What Japan agreed to do in the phone trade talks is not 
anything like a "government guarantee," said the official at the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined to be 
identified. 
  The comment came in response to remarks by U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor on Saturday's settlement of a 
dispute involving Motorola Inc. and Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. 
(IDO) over the U.S. company's access to the Japanese cellular 
phone market. 
  Referring to part of the accord that says Tokyo will take 
"all available measures to ensure compliance with the 
commitments" undertaken by IDO, Kantor said the expression 
"validates the result-oriented approach" Washington wants in the 
future. 
  The MITI official said Japan cannot accept an interpretation 
that would lead to the setting of "numerical targets," an idea 
Tokyo has adamantly turned down in its trade talks with the 
United States. 
  MITI fears that the difference of interpretation between the 
two countries over the wording in question might develop into 
another source of bilateral contention, the official said. 
  Under the private-level agreement between IDO and Motorola 
that was reached before the governmental accord, the Japanese 
cellular phone company promised to open 159 new relay stations 
for Motorola-format phones.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan's telecommunications 
ministry confirmed Tuesday [15 March] that it will remain 
neutral on a complaint filed by Japanese international operators 
against cut-rate services offered in Japan by U.S.-affiliated 
firms. 
  Japan is shelving the decision on whether to restrict or 
keep 
allowing the services, an official at the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry said, noting that global attention 
is fixed on Japan and the United States. 
  "We are seeking a compromise measure...but Japan cannot move 
alone on an issue that requires international adjustments," said 
Hirokazu Suda, director of the ministry's tariff division at the 
ministry's Telecommunications Bureau. 
  The comments came after an industry official last Friday 
quoted government sources as saying that the ministry had 
virtually dismissed the Japanese industry's petition as it found 
the U.S. firms' services posed no problem under current rules. 
  Suda admitted that the services cannot be restricted under 
the current law, but said, "it's just that the law was not made 
to encompass such a new, advanced service." He described the 
services as "abnormal." 
  But with the services already spreading, user benefits of a 
service that was invented amid the global trend toward 
deregulation cannot be ignored, he said. 
  "We just have no idea yet, and don't know which countries 
will come up with a good solution," Suda said. 
  KDD and other common carriers should also review their 
services and rates, he said. 
  Three Japanese common carriers led by KDD, which formerly 
monopolized Japan's international phone services, lodged the 
petition in January requesting the ministry to probe the 
"call-back" discount services which they claimed use their lines 
unfairly, free of charge. 
  The move followed a similar complaint filed with the U.S. 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last autumn by American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co. against U.S. discount phone firms 
exploiting call-back and other such systems. 
  Under the call-back system offered in Japan, users call a 
switching center in the United States and hang up after two 
rings. After a few seconds, the center calls back and the users 
dial the actual number they want to call, the country of origin 
of the call now being the United States. 
  In the U.S., cut-rate operators use lines offered with 
discounts to large-lot resellers by common carriers. 
  Suda said Japan is gathering information from the FCC, which 
is also having difficulties in ruling on the issue. The FCC is 
also probably watching what Japan will do, he said. 
  France and Germany are focusing attention on Japan because 
U.S. discount rate operators have also entered those two 
nations, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan likely faces 
criticism at the current "jobs summit" for "exporting 
unemployment" but the issue is not so simple, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [15 March]. 
  Global unemployment involves many structural problems, he 
stressed at a regular news conference after a morning cabinet 
meeting, but he acknowledged Japan is likely to be under fire at 
the Detroit meeting for its stubborn current account surplus. 
  The ministerial meeting of seven industrialized powers is a 
place for broad debate on dealing with unemployment, Fujii said. 
  He repeated that Japan is trying to boost domestic demand, 
which would help curb the imbalance, expressing hope for "large 
effects" from last month's 15 trillion yen economic stimulus 
package. He also repeated that Japan is crafting measures to 
further open its markets, promote new business and restructure 
industry. 
  Asked if Japan could explain its views adequately without 
the 
finance minister present, Fujii said he thinks Labor Minister 
Chikara Sakaguchi is "clearly" explaining the Japanese position 
in Detroit. 
  Fujii said there are no bilateral meetings officially 
scheduled at a meeting later this week of finance ministers from 
members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, but that 
he favors such exchanges. 
  Asked if he wants to meet separately with his U.S. 
counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, Fujii said only that he favors 
bilateral meetings with "several people."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan's overall trade 
surplus edged up in February from a year before but the 
politically sensitive imbalance with the United States shrank 
fractionally, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday. 
  Import growth outstripped that of exports, with slumping 
auto 
exports counterbalancing a pickup in semiconductor exports, 
while imports of computers surged, a ministry official said in 
explaining the monthly preliminary report. 
  The overall merchandise trade surplus on a customs-cleared 
basis grew 3.3 percent from a year before, slower than some 
recent double-digit rises, to 10,912 million dollars. 
  But the official said it was the largest February figure 
ever 
for the surplus, which has expanded every month for more than 
three years with the exception of last November. 
  Imports grew 7.0 percent from a year before to 18,620 
million 
dollars, while exports increased 5.6 percent to 29,533 million 
dollars. 
  The surplus with the U.S. dipped 0.9 percent from a year 
before to 4,344 million dollars, the first decline in nine 
months, the official said. Imports grew 15.1 percent, 
outrunning a 6.8 percent rise in exports. 
  The Japanese currency was up 13.5 percent from a year before 
to average 109.07 yen to the dollar in February, the official 
said. 
  The higher yen should eventually curb Japan's surplus by 
making exports pricier in other currencies while making imports 
cheaper in yen terms. But in the short run it inflates the 
value of the surplus in the closely watched dollar terms. 
  In yen terms, Japan's surplus continued to decline, falling 
9.1 percent, with imports down 5.7 percent and exports off 7.0 
percent from a year before. In volume terms, imports climbed 
9.9 percent for their ninth straight gain, while exports dipped 
3.6 percent, the official noted. 
  On the export ledger, motor vehicles fell 16.7 percent to 
4.6 
billion dollars. That somewhat offset such increases as a 32.9 
percent rise in semiconductors and electronic parts to 2.0 
billion dollars, and a 79.0 percent jump in ship exports to 938 
million dollars. 
  Among the import gainers, computers and other office 
machines 
climbed 31.8 percent to 673 million dollars, semiconductors rose 
43.9 percent to 488 million dollars, and clothing gained 41.2 
percent to 1.0 billion dollars. 
  But the value of crude oil imports sank 20.1 percent to 2.0 
billion dollars, while that of petroleum products plunged 41.3 
percent to 295 million dollars. The price of crude slumped 16.5 
percent in February from a year before to an average 14.83 
dollars a barrel, the official said. 
  Contributing to the rise in U.S. imports was a 30.2 percent 
climb by computers and other office machines and a 26.9 percent 
increase in semiconductors and electronic parts. 
  Among exports to the U.S., semiconductors were up 24.8 
percent and auto parts rose 11.9 percent, while motor vehicle 
exports slipped 6.8 percent. 
  Imports from the U.S. totaled 4,680 million dollars, while 
exports reached 9,024 million dollars. 
  The trade surplus with the rest of Asia grew for the 22nd 
straight month, rising 5.8 percent to 4,389 million dollars, the 
official said. 
  Exports to Asia rose 12.4 percent to 10,740 million dollars, 
with car engines up 40.7 percent and semiconductors rising 36.6 
percent, the official said. Imports rose 17.5 percent to 6,351 
million dollars. 
  The surplus with the European Union also remained in 
decline, 
falling 15.8 percent to 2,269 million dollars. 
  Exports fell 6.9 percent to 4,529 million dollars, with 
autos 
sagging 33.3 percent. European imports edged up 4.3 percent to 
2,260 million dollars on increases such as autos, up 41.1 
percent, and semiconductors, rising 21.9 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- The administrative reform 
headquarters of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [14 
March] held its first meeting to discuss how to relax government 
regulations in information and telecommunications fields. 
  The premier urged an affiliated working group on information 
and telecommunications to propose ways to ease regulations in 
the two fields, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told 
reporters. The panel was asked to report as soon as possible. 
  The group will meet once or twice a month and is expected to 
make its proposals by the end of June. The next meeting is 
scheduled for early April. 
  The group will weigh the possibility of developing an 
optical 
fiber-based communications network modeled after the national

Takeshi Fujii, chief of the Cabinet Councillor's Office on 
Internal Affairs.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa called on his ministers Tuesday to come up with a list 
of new items for possible deregulation by the end of the month, 
government officials said. 
  Hosokawa made the call in a morning cabinet meeting in 
response to pressure from the United States and elsewhere for 
Japan to harmonize its economy with that of the rest of the 
world. 
  In the Japan-U.S. trade framework negotiations, Washington 
has proposed dozens of new targets for deregulation. 
  Hosokawa called deregulation a vital component of the 
government's economic reforms and said it must be actively 
tackled to promote harmonious economic relations with other 
countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives agricultural committee decided Tuesday [15 
March] to call a special session on March 22 over the rice 
shortage, in response to increasing protests against the 
compulsory blending of domestic with imported rice, legislators 
said. 
  The agricultural committee of the House of Councillors, 
which 
is scheduled to convene Wednesday, is also expected to set a 
date to discuss consumers' worries about the rice supply in a 
plenary session of the upper house. 
  Legislators from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), had urged the committee meetings after customers started 
to line up in front of supermarkets hoping to buy some scarce 
unblended Japanese rice. 
  In a controversial decision, the Food Agency announced on 
March 7 that it would mandate the blending of Japanese and Thai 
rice for retail as an emergency measure to discourage consumers 
from hoarding domestic rice. 
  In a field excursion to supermarkets and rice retailers in 
central Tokyo, a group of 11 LDP legislators from both houses of 
parliament interviewed shoppers about the situation on Tuesday. 
  The group also visited the metropolitan rice center, where 
imported rice is being packed, and observed the quarantine 
inspection of Australian rice shipments at the Yokohama customs 
office. 
  The legislators also plan to inspect government storehouses 
and other facilities related to rice distribution on Thursday 
and Friday and on two days next week, in preparation for the 
special Diet meetings, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata voiced concern Tuesday [15 March] over reported 
restrictions North Korea placed on inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its seven declared 
nuclear facilities. 
  "We were relieved when the inspections finally took place, 
so 
we can't but feel concern over the current situation," Hata told 
a press conference after a cabinet meeting. 
  Hata was referring to reports that the IAEA inspectors were 
barred from certain activities in inspecting North Korea's 
nuclear facilities. 
  On Monday, an IAEA source said the North Koreans placed some 
restrictions on the activities of the seven-member team, though 
the agency's spokesman declined to comment on the details of the 
inspection. 
  Also, in Monday's edition of the CHUNGANG ILBO, a major 
South 
Korean newspaper, an unidentified government official was quoted 
as saying the team was barred from removing samples of nuclear 
materials from one facility for laboratory tests. 
  If such restrictions took place, or if it is confirmed that 
nuclear materials have been diverted for military purposes, the 
IAEA will convene a special meeting to consider referring the 
matter to the U.N. Security Council for further action. 
  An IAEA spokesman said a decision on whether such a meeting 
is called could be made within this week, depending on the 
content of the inspection team's report. 
  The spokesman said the IAEA team had concluded its schedule 
of inspections of North Korea's seven declared nuclear 
facilities. 
  The IAEA inspections, which began March 3, were the first 
allowed by North Korea in about a year. 
  The team is scheduled to depart for Vienna via Beijing on 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Japan and the European 
Union (EU) should agree as early as possible on setting a 
ceiling for European-bound Japanese car exports for 1994, a 
senior Japanese trade ministry official said Monday [14 March]. 
  Japan's export ceiling for the year should be worked out 
before the next fiscal year starts on April 1, Hideaki Kumano, 
vice international trade and industry minister, told a press 
conference. 
  The comment came ahead of Japan-EU auto talks scheduled for 
Thursday and Friday in Tokyo, which are expected to discuss the 
size of auto demand in the EU in 1994, the benchmark for setting 
Japan's auto shipments to the union. 
  In talks in February, the two parties failed to narrow their 
difference on the prospects for demand for cars in the EU. The 
Europeans projected demand would level off, while the Japanese 
predicted a slight pickup. 
  The 1992 Japan-EU accord calls for the two sides to monitor 
Japanese car exports during a 1993-1999 transitional period 
before the EU auto market is fully liberalized in 2000.

  The dispatch is in line with a request from UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in late February to send Japanese 
personnel to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary 
elections. 
  The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three persons from 
the Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo metropolitan government 
and 11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member UN unit 
to oversee the polls in the central American country. 
  El Salvador is the third country to which Japan has sent 
election observers in accordance with the UN Peacekeeping 
Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Ecuador President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen Cordovez called on Japan on Tuesday [15 March] to 
extend yen loans to the Latin American country to help its 
project to build up its power transmission network, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  The president made the call in a 35-minute meeting with 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the officials said. 
  The meeting was followed by a 70-minute dinner at the prime 
minister's official residence. 
  Ecuador's project to set up branch lines from its main power 
grid and build transformer substations is estimated to cost a 
total of 90 million dollars, the officials said. 
  Duran-Ballen did not specify the amount of Japanese 
cooperation desired, they said. 
  Hosokawa told Duran-Ballen Japan will study the request for 
yen loans based on Ecuador's economic situation and debt, they 
said. 
  Duran-Ballen was quoted as saying ecuador will solve the 
debt 
problem as soon as possible so it can implement the power grid 
project. 
  During the meeting, the president also invited Hosokawa, 
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, and Crown Prince Naruhito 
and Crown Princess Masako to visit Ecuador, the officials said. 
  He also invited them to visit Galapagos Island west of 
Ecuador, they said. 
  Hosokawa was quoted as saying Ecuador is a country he would 
like to visit sometime. 
  Hosokawa expressed the hope that relations between Japan and 
Ecuador would become even closer, the officials said. 
  He told the president the Japanese Government has been 
extending assistance to improve Ecuador's infrastructure and is 
currently studying possible cooperation in the nation's 
vocational training, the officials said. 
  A Japanese mission is visiting Ecuador between March 15 and 
26 to study the cooperation, Hosokawa was quoted as saying. 
  Hosokawa also said Japan will invite 10 young people from 
Ecuador for training in Japan, they said. 
  At the outset of the meeting, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and his counterpart from Ecuador Diego Paredes Pena exchanged 
documents on two Japanese grants-in-aid amounting to a total of 
1,123 million yen, according to the officials. 
  The assistance comprises 1,074 million yen for medical 
equipment in major hospitals and 49 million yen in cultural aid 
for equipment for the national sucre theater, they said.

"dialogues" with representatives of important cooperation 
partners such as the United States, China and Japan. 
  In response, Hosokawa pledged Japan's readiness to further 
develop ties with the region.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, at a news conference 
held today in Kanazawa City, where he is visiting on a stumping 
tour, expressed his hope again to form a new party to create a 
two-party system, in which change of power can be realized. 
  Foreign Minister Hata said: The coalition parties are 
working hard to steer the government. But, we just cannot 
continue indefinitely to keep the current process, in which the 
parties take every single issue to their own party for consensus 
before the coalition makes a decision as a while. 
  He then said: Rather than insisting on keeping our own 
party, I would like to form a strong and stable political force 
which can compete with the Liberal Democratic Party. I do not 
mind calling it a new new-party [shin shinto]. 
  In this way he renewed his willingness to form a two-party 
system, in which change of power can be realized.

into one party to facilitate electoral cooperation. It was 
decided that the ruling parties' representatives' meeting would 
serve as the venue for coordinating views on electoral 
cooperation and realignment of political parties. 
  During today's meeting, Shinseito representative Deputy 
Secretary General Kozo Watanabe, Komeito Secretary General 
Yuichi Ichikawa, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Secretary 
General Takashi Yonezawa commented on the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan's [SDPJ] plan to unite the social democratic and 
liberal forces. They said that if there is no plan for the 
ruling parties to become one party in the future, electoral 
cooperation will not be possible in the upper house elections 
scheduled for summer 1995. They also pointed out that even in 
the lower house elections, it would be impossible to cooperate 
in the single-seat constituencies while competing in the 
proportional-representation constituencies. They indicated that 
it is necessary for the ruling parties to aim to form a new-new 
party [shin shin to] to campaign effectively in the forthcoming 
elections. 
  In response, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo said, it is 
still a viable method of electoral cooperation for the ruling 
parties to coordinate on the choice of candidates and cooperate 
with each other in the elections. He stated that it is not 
possible to proceed right away to form a new-new party. 
  In light of these differing views, the ruling coalition 
parties decided to use representatives' meetings or party heads' 
meetings as venues to coordinate views on electoral cooperation, 
and to discuss the closely-related issue of the realignment of 
political parties for the time being.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Keigo Ouchi, chairman of 
the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), advocates an early 
realignment of Japanese political parties to prepare for general 
elections which he says could take place anytime after January 
1995. 
  He said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that 
political parties should realign by this summer to allow time to 
hammer out policies and prepare candidates for the House of 
Representatives elections. 
  "The elections for the House of Councillors are planned for 
next summer and general elections (for the lower house) under 
the new electoral system could take place anytime after January 
next year," Ouchi said. 
  The DSP chief said the biggest challenge facing Japanese 
politics today is to lay the foundation for one or two political 
parties that could take over the reins of government from the 
largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The LDP ruled for 38 years until Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, head of the fledgling Japan New Party, launched a 
seven-party coalition last summer. 
  Ouchi praised Hosokawa for making a "courageous decision" 
not 
to reshuffle his cabinet, a move aimed chiefly at getting rid of 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the head of new 
party Sakigake. 
  He said in the interview that the Hosokawa administration 
would have fallen apart if it had proceeded with a 7 percent 
national welfare tax program and a cabinet shake-up. 
  Ouchi blamed Shinseito secretary general Ichiro Ozawa and 
his 
Komeito counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa for the ill-fated scenarios, 
and said such high-handed politicking could lead to a collapse 
of the coalition government.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- The leader of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called for Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday [15 March] to present the 
Diet with a receipt to verify that he repaid a loan of 100 
million yen which he received from a parcel delivery firm. 
  Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP's Diet Policy Affairs 
Committee, told a party panel of directors that Hosokawa had 
claimed "he repaid 100 million yen by 10 installments," but the 
panel never received any proof. "Hosokawa should present us 
with a detailed copy of at least one installment," said Ozato. 
  He said the LDP has sought verification that Hosokawa repaid 
his debts to the scandal-tained Sagawa Kyubin Co. as a condition 
of opening deliberations of the House of Representatives budget 
committee. 
  Meanwhile, Hosokawa told his coalition partners on Tuesday 
afternoon that he has already released all documents in 
connection with the Sagawa Kyubin case. 
  The LDP has demanded that the prime minister's former 
secretary testify to the Diet as a sworn-in witness to verify 
that he did not receive a backhand political donation from 
Sagawa Kyubin Co. 
  Hosokawa has indirectly acknowledged that he received 100 
million yen from the firm in 1982, when he was governor of 
Kumamoto Prefecture. 
  However, he has claimed that he repaid the loan, which he 
said was used to purchase a condominium in central Tokyo, to 
repair his home in Kumamoto and to fund a gubernatorial election 
campaign in 1983. 
  Hosokawa served as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture for two 
consecutive terms from 1983 until February 1991. 
  In the meantime, the lower house budget committee remained 
idle Tuesday morning due to the LDP's refusal to attend. 
  In a related development, the governing coalition's 
directors 
of the lower house Diet affairs committee and their LDP 
counterparts held a three-hour meeting in the Diet in an attempt 
to break the deadlock and open deliberations. 
  After the meeting, Koken Nosaka, head of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) Diet administration committee, told 
reporters he will ask Hosokawa to submit to the Diet proof that 
he did not receive a backhand political donation from Sagawa 
Kyubin Co. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, head of the SDP, the largest party in the 
coalition, said it is not necessary for the prime minister's 
former secretary to testify in the Diet as a sworn-in witness. 
  He said the Diet will be able to investigate the matter by 
receiving satisfactory answers from Hosokawa himself.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa rejected an opposition party demand Tuesday [15 March] 
to submit further documents related to his loan from a 
scandal-tainted trucking firm. 
  The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which 
set 
the submission as a condition to start deliberations of the 
fiscal 1994 state budget at the House of Representatives budget 
committee, reacted angrily, with the result that debates on the 
budget are likely to be delayed until later this month, Diet 
sources said. 
  Chiefs of the Diet affairs committee from the coalition 
parties and the LDP met in the afternoon in order to reach 
agreement on the opening of debate on the 73.08 trillion yen 
budget. The negotiations, however, broke off after Hosokawa 
rejected the LDP demand, the sources said. 
  The LDP decided not to attend Wednesday's scheduled meeting 
of senior members of the budget committee, which will discuss a 
timetable to deliberate the national budget for fiscal 1994 that 
starts April 1, LDP officials said. 
  The government last Friday submitted to the panel documents 
relating to the loan but the LDP and the Japanese Communist 
Party (JCP) were not satisfied, saying the submissions were 
insufficient, and renewed their demands that the government 
offer further detailed materials. 
  Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from 
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair his home in Kumamoto 
Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo, and fully repaid the 
money nine years later. 
  The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob 
scandal which forced LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign in 
disgrace in 1992. 
  Hosokawa maintains he repaid the money by January 31, 1991, 
using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor. 
But the LDP argues that Hosokawa could not have received the 
retirement allowance before finishing his second term as 
governor in February 1991.

<F P=106> ["News focus" by Takehiko Kajita: "Hosokawa's Loan Dispute </F>
Delays Debate on Key Budget"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's failure to give a clear-cut account of his loan from 
a scandal-plagued firm has not only fueled a spat between the 
ruling coalition and the opposition camp, but has delayed 
parliamentary debate on the key fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  "With the question of politicians and money drawing 
attention, Mr. Hosokawa has not told the truth of whether he was 
given the money or borrowed it, leaving the matter unresolved," 
Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) said Sunday [13 March]. 
  Mori, in a move to throw down the gauntlet to the governing 
coalition, warned that his party will refuse to begin a session 
of the House of Representatives Budget Committee to discuss the 
national budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, until the 
premier proves his innocence. 
  Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from 
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a now-defunct parcel delivery company, 
in 1982 and repaid the money nine years later. But the LDP, 
toppled from power last summer for the first time in nearly four 
decades, has retorted it is unclear how the premier used the 
money and how he returned it to the creditor. 
  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, which has since been absorbed into 
Sagawa Kyubin Co., a Kyoto-based parent company, was embroiled 
in a massive money-and-mob scandal in 1992 and 1993 that 
implicated former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and disgraced 
LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru. 
  One element compounding the matter is Hosokawa's 
inconsistent 
and less-than persuasive explanations about his receipt and 
repayment of the money. This has caused the LDP to suspect that 
it was not a loan that the premier obtained, but an illicit 
donation. 
  Last December, Hosokawa said in a memo to the Diet that he 
borrowed the 100 million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, former 
chairman of Sagawa Kyubin, through Tokyo Sagawa in September 
1982 to buy a condominium in Tokyo and repair his home in 
Kumamoto Prefecture, southwestern Japan. 
  He also explained he paid back the money by January 31, 
1991, 
using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor, in 
addition to using the proceeds from the sale of a plot of land 
in Tokyo. 
  But the LDP has pointed out that Hosokawa could not have 
received the retirement allowance before he finished his second 
four-year term as governor in February 1991, raising doubts 
about the premier's accounts. 
  With the memo also showing that Hosokawa purchased the Tokyo 
condominium in July 1982, two months before he borrowed the 
money from Sagawa, the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party 
(JCP) have charged that the premier used the money to secure his 
campaign funds for a Kumamoto gubernatorial election one year 
later. 
  Furthermore, Hosokawa's failure to submit to the Diet all 
the 
receipts he must have accepted from Sagawa if he really repaid 
the money sparked a barrage of criticism from the opposition 
camp that the premier took the money as an illegal political 
donation, not as what he insists was a loan. 
  Dissatisfied with Hosokawa's explanations, the LDP and the 
JCP successfully forced the lower house budget panel, in an 
unusual move, to ask the government to submit to the Diet 
detailed documents concerning Hosokawa's payment of the Sagawa 
money. 
  Although the government presented some documents relating to 
the loan last Friday, the two parties laughed them off and 
refused to set a timetable for Diet discussion on the key budget 
unless the government submits further detailed documents. 
  "If Mr. Hosokawa can have the public understand he really 
paid back the money, we believe we do not have to question him 
any further and discuss this matter any longer," Sadatoshi 
Ozato, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee, said Monday. 
  "But he has only widened doubts regarding the question of 
how 
specifically he returned it," Ozato said, adding that the party 
will leave the matter of setting a schedule of budget discussion 
up to a group of directors of the lower house budget panel for a 
little longer. 
  The government and the ruling coalition aim to have the 
fiscal 1994 national budget passed through the Diet by mid-May 
and minimize the effects of the delayed Diet deliberations on 
the ailing Japanese economy. 
  As Hosokawa postponed the formulation of the budget from the 
end of last year till early this year to concentrate on Diet 
deliberations on his cherished political reform, the start of 
budget debate has been delayed until mid-March or later for the 
first time since 1967.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 13 KYODO -- Executives of several 
major contractors joined an arrested Kajima Corp. executive in 
asking former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura to use his 
influence as a Diet member to block accusations over bid-rigging 
practices, informed sources said Sunday [13 March]. 
  The executives were key members of a cartel of 66 
contractors 
including Kajima in Saitama Prefecture. They attempted to 
solicit Nakamura's cooperation in blocking a probe by the Fair 
Trade Commission (FTC) into suspected bid-rigging practices. 
  Prosecutors have questioned some executives of the 
contractors as witnesses, the sources said. 
  Nakamura, after being stripped by the Diet of his 
parliamentary immunity from arrest, was arrested Friday on 
suspicion of receiving a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima's 
former senior vice president, Shinji Kiyoyama, in January 1992. 
Kiyoyama, who is now on trial on charges of sending bribes to 
former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, 76, was rearrested Tuesday 
for reportedly passing the bribe to Nakamura. 
  The money was allegedly intended as a reward for Nakamura 
exerting his influence to help block an accusation by the FTC 
against the cartel over the scheme to rig bids on public works 
projects in Saitama Prefecture. The FTC announced in May 1992 
that it would not file an accusation with prosecutors, and 
instead ordered the contractors to stop the collusive activities. 
  FTC Chairman Masami Kogayu said Friday the commission was 
never influenced by outside forces on decisions involving cases 
of violating the antimonopoly law.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) raided the office of the Japan Association of Refrigerated 
Warehouses and about 20 warehouse companies Tuesday [15 March] 
for allegedly operating an unauthorized cartel, officials said. 
Nichirei Corp., unrivaled leader in the refrigeration warehouse 
industry and also No. 1 in frozen foods, and Yokohama Reito Co., 
the nation's second largest cold storage company, were among the 
firms searched by the government fair trade watchdog. 
  The FTC suspect the association and the companies illegally 
conspired in July 1992 to fix storage fees and the timing of the 
increase before hiking the fees from July until the end of the 
year in violation of the antimonopoly law.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) has ordered four major newspaper companies to report why 
they raised subscription fees, suspecting them of violating the 
Antimonopoly Law, FTC officials said Tuesday [15 March]. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN and the MAINICHI SHIMBUN raised 
subscription fees last December and the YOMIURI SHIMBUN in 
January, all by 200 yen per month. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
raised its monthly subscription fee by 300 yen in February. 
  The FTC suspect the four major dailies colluded in 
increasing 
the fees, the officials said. 
  The Antimonopoly Law stipulates that a concerted price hike 
occurs if two of the top five firms in a sector with a market of 
60 billion yen or more in which the top three firms together 
account for a share of more than 70 percent, raise prices of 
their goods within three months of each other.

Monday [14 March] to pay a 180 million yen penalty for their 
involvement in a bid-rigging affair, FTC officials said.

Prefecture and 16 municipal, town and village administrations in 
Fukuoka Prefecture, the officials said. 
  Among the 25 firms were the Tokyo-based Kimmon Mfg. Co., the 
Nagoya-based Aichi Tokei Denki Co., the Kyoto-based Nitto Seiko 
Co., and OKK corp. and Toko Co., both based in Osaka. 
  Over the years, the 25 firms held meetings to conspire in 
determining who would be awarded orders from local 
administrations and what prices would be set on equipment.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Japan's wholesale prices 
fell 0.5 percent in February from the previous month, the Bank 
of Japan said Monday [14 March]. 
  The overall wholesale price index came to 93.5 against the 
base of 100 for 1990. 
  On a year-to-year basis, the index slid 3.2 percent. 
  Domestic wholesale prices in February were unchanged from 
the 
previous month but retreated 2.0 percent from a year earlier. 
  Export prices for February fell 0.1 percent from the 
previous 
month on a contract currency basis and moved down 3.3 percent in 
yen terms. 
  Import prices edged up 0.8 percent on a contract currency 
basis but declined 2.3 percent in yen terms from January. 
  A Bank of Japan official said export prices on a contract 
currency basis fell for the first time since December 1992 as 
price-raising moves following the sharp appreciation of the yen 
against the dollar last year came to a halt. 
  Import prices on a contract currency basis moved up from the 
month before due to higher commodity prices overseas but they 
declined in yen terms because of the yen's appreciation, he said. 
  The dollar averaged 106.25 yen in the month, falling 4.8 
percent from January and down 12.3 percent from a year before. 
  The official said domestic wholesale prices remain stable 
and 
attributed the levelling off from the previous in contrast to 
continued declines since last July to higher overseas commodity 
prices. 
  But commodity prices are already coming down, the official 
said, adding that the index is unlikely to continue moving up. 
  The wholesale price index for rice stood at 112.0 against 
the 
base of 100 for 1990, continuing to stay high since last autumn 
because of the poor harvest, the official said. The index was 
102.2 in August, before it began to go up. 
  It remained unchanged from January, however, in spite of 
higher prices reported at the retail level. The statistics do 
not include prices of imported rice, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan's top economic 
planner on Tuesday [15 March] called for more public works 
spending, particularly housing investment, to give an added 
boost to the burgeoning economic recovery. 
  The Japanese economy is showing some sign of pickup in such 
areas as housing, home electric appliances, audio equipment and 
autos, Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency [EPA], told a regular press conference. 
  The bud of the economic recovery should be nurtured with 
steps to spur personal spending, such as more housing investment 
and early implementation of planned tax cuts, she said. 
  These measures will be effective in putting the economy on a 
strong recovery track, she said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Machinery orders from the 
private sector increased in January from December, marking the 
third straight month of increases and reaffirming that orders 
have hit bottom, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Tuesday 
[15 March]. 
  January orders rose 1.9 percent from December to 912.7 
billion yen, following a 5.3 percent increase in December and a 
23.0 percent jump in November. 
  The January figure also marks a 0.4 percent rise from a year 
earlier, the first year-on-year increase in 22 months, the 
agency said in its monthly report. 
  The data exclude orders for ships and from electric power 
companies, which are often volatile. 
  An EPA official in a briefing for reporters said the January 
results support the agency's view that the downward trend in 
private machinery orders has come to an end. 
  The official also said the latest figures have increased the 
likelihood that the agency will meet its target of an 8.1 
percent increase in private orders for the first quarter of 1994. 
  The official said, however, that results from January alone 
are insufficient for making an accurate prediction. 
  Private machinery orders, omitting volatile factors, are a 
leading indicator for near-term corporate spending on plants and 
equipment. 
  Including orders for ships and from electric power firms, 
January private-sector orders totaled 1,102.9 billion yen, down 
4.5 percent from December and a 4.1 percent decrease from a year 
before. 
  Orders from manufacturers accounted for 377.9 billion yen of 
the total, and orders from nonmanufacturers, excluding those for 
ships and from power firms, came to 541.6 billion yen. 
  Orders placed by the public sector jumped 23.9 percent from 
the previous month to 387.3 billion yen, and orders from 
foreigners increased 31.7 percent to 542.6 billion yen. 
  The agency official said public-sector orders received a 
boost from the second supplementary budget enacted last year for 
the current 1993 fiscal year, ending in April. The budget 
increased orders for items such as garbage-disposal facilities 
and telecommunications equipment. 
  An agency hearing found that many makers expect orders from 
the government to remain strong at least through the end of 
March, the official said. 
  The January jump for foreign orders is "too good to be 
true," 
the official said. In the last few months foreign orders 
increased only modestly, with a 0.4 percent rise in December and 
0.2 percent rise in November. 
  The yen's decline against the U.S. dollar in January cannot 
fully explain the jump, the official said. 
  Overall, January machinery orders amounted to 2,165.4 
billion 
yen, up 4.8 percent from December and 3.3 percent from a year 
earlier.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] The U.S. Justice Department, claiming 70 Japanese 
construction firms including general contractors inflicted 1.1 
billion yen in damages to the U.S. Government through rigged 
bids for a contract to construct facilities at the U.S. Atsugi 
Naval Station, has decided to ask the Japanese construction 
firms involved to pay compensatory damages in accordance with 
Article 9 (Illegal Business Actions) of the Civil Act. The U.S. 
Justice Department will soon ask each construction firm to 
comply with the U.S. demand for compensatory damages through 
process attorneys. It is said the U.S. Justice Department plans 
to file a suit with a Japanese court against 70 Japanese 
construction firms for compensatory damages. In 1989, the U.S. 
Government filed a suit against Japanese general contractors for 
rigging bids for a construction project at the U.S. Yokosuka 
Naval Station, but the U.S. Government dropped the suit 
following an out-of-court settlement. This is the first time 
that the Clinton administration has decided to take legal action 
against Japanese construction firms for rigging bids. 
  The prevailing view is that the "exposure" of the 
bid-rigging 
by the U.S. Justice Department is an indication that the Clinton 
administration has embarked on the offensive against Japan 
following the breakdown of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
and the break off of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. 
  The United States, which revived the Super 301 provision of 
the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, is believed to have adopted a 
strategy to bring the Japanese keiretsu [interlocking corporate 
grouping] and bid-rigging structure to light by taking forcible 
measures to expose bid-rigging, and to open the Japanese market 
by hinting at the possibility of slapping sanctions on Japan in 
accordance with the provision. 
  The same government source said the U.S. Justice Department 
claimed the Japanese construction firms have been engaged in 
bid- rigging for six years between 1984 and 1990 in connection 
with the construction of facilities at Atsugi Naval Station. 
The U.S. Justice Department also asserted that 70 Japanese 
construction companies, including Nishimatsu Construction 
Company, Obayashi Corporation, and Penta-Ocean Construction 
Company, have formed a cartel and, as a result, the U.S. 
Government has been unfairly forced to pay 1.1 billion yen more 
than ordinary prices. 
  According to the U.S. side, Japanese construction firms have 
rigged bids for contracts for construction projects at three 
U.S. military bases of Yokosuka, Yokota and Sasebo. In the case 
of Yokosuka Naval Station, the Fair Trade Commission ordered 70 
Japanese construction firms involved in the bid-rigging to pay 
penalty fees totalling 289.890 million yen after confirming 
their involvement in the bid-rigging. The Japanese construction 
firms later paid compensation of 4.7 billion yen to the U.S. 
Government at the end of an out-of-court settlement. 
  The Fair Trade Commission has yet to confirm their 
involvement in the bid-rigging in connection with the 
construction of facilities at Atsugi Naval Station. Therefore, 
the government plans to investigate facilities constructed by 
the Japanese construction firms, their bidding prices, and the 
possibility of their violation of the Antimonopoly Law.

  [Text] The U.S. Justice Department has decided to demand 
that some 70 Japanese construction companies, including 
Ohbayashi Corporation and Nishimatsu Construction Company [NCC], 
pay a total of 1.1 billion yen in damages inflicted due to their 
bid-rigging on construction projects at Atsugi Naval Station. 
These construction firms, however, are perplexed over the U.S. 
accusation. NCC executive director Mikio Kunisawa said: 
"According to the Fair Trade Commission, there was no 
bid-rigging in tenders for the projects at Atsugi Naval Station. 
It seems that the United States is harassing us by putting 
forward the demand, behind which lies the trade friction between 
Japan and the United States." 
  In 1988, it was disclosed that Japanese construction firms 
rigged bids in tenders for constructing facilities at the U.S. 
base at Yokosuka. Many people in the construction industry 
assert that "bid-rigging practices in connection with projects 
at U.S. military bases were all unearthed at that time" 
(according to an official at a major construction firm). 
  Some people even claim that "to pressure Japan, the United 
States may intend to resume its Japan-bashing methods by making 
use of bribery cases involving major construction firms, in 
which lower house members were arrested for their involvement." 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Construction Ministry is shocked by 
the "bid-rigging charge" by the United States as it comes at a 
time when the ministry is boasting of its achievement in 
averting possible U.S. sanctions in the Japan-U.S. construction 
talks in January. Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi has said: 
"Japan's attempts to review its bidding system (starting from 
fiscal year 1994) have been evaluated highly by the United 
States." A senior official at the ministry said: "We will 
decide what to do after confirming the intentions of the United 
States."

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 11 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The two 
documents connected with solution of the issue of migration of 
Mongolian Kazakhs to Kazakhstan have been initialed here. These 
are the Intergovernment Mongolian-Kazakhstan Agreement on 
Procedure of Mutual Ending and Receiving Citizens of Mongolia 
and Kazakhstan at Economic Units and Organizations and the 
Inter-State Agreement on Regulation of the Issue of Employment 
and Migration of Citizens according to the Agreement. At the 
Mongolian-Kazakhstan meeting on this theme, which has been held 
recently in Ulaanbaatar, present was a group of Kazakhstan 
experts headed by the Deputy Minister of Labour of Kazakhstan G. 
Ye. Yesmukanov. As it was envisaged in the draft agreements, 
Mongolian Kazakhs, who wish to live in Kazakhstan permanently, 
before leaving for this country can stop being a citizen of 
Mongolia and become a citizen of Kazakhstan on a voluntary 
basis. And this very issue will be solved in accordance with 
the laws of the two states, the generally recognized 
international legal principles. 
  In the document also reflected is the taking by migrants of 
their own property through the country's border without paying 
any duties and taxes. In the draft agreements the fk"su edpo 
[words indistinct] concerning creation of corresponding labour 
and living conditions for migrants, conditions for their 
education and improvement of their qualification are touched 
upon. 
  Today more than 50 thousand Kazakhs-citizens of Mongolia are 
working in Kazakhstan according to the labour agreements.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on DPRK's Position on </F>
Implementation of DPRK-USA New York Agreed Conclusions"--KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
finally refuse to fulfill its obligations on the steps of 
simultaneous action, we too will be unable to ensure further 
still the continuity of safeguards of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency restored this time and to continue the 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys between 
the North and the South and, furthermore, we will find ourselves 
in a phase in which we cannot go to the third round of DPRK-USA 
talks, said a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry, speaking 
in response to a question put by KCNA today regarding the fact 
that the United States has set unreasonable conditions to avoid 
implementing the agreed conclusions made at the DPRK-USA contact 
in New York. 
  He said: 
  As already reported, four immediate steps of simultaneous 
action for a package solution of the nuclear issue were agreed 
upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York on February 25. 
  The contents of the agreed conclusions are suspension of 
"Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises, resumption of 
working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys between 
North and South of Korea, inspection by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to ensure continuity of safeguards and the holding 
of the third round of DPRK-USA talks in Geneva on March 21. The 
agreement is strictly based on the principle that the DPRK and 
the United States must simultaneously do what they are obliged 
to. 
  After the publication of the agreed conclusions we have 
completely fulfilled our obligations with regard to the steps of 
simultaneous action. 
  We have accepted inspection of the seven declared sites 
enough for the continuity of safeguards within the time agreed 
upon with the IAEA, and unilaterally taken a broad-minded and 
magnanimous position at the inter-Korean working-level contact, 
thus opening a firm prospect for the exchange of presidential 
envoys. 
  But the United States has not fulfilled its obligation 
concerning the steps of simultaneous action. 
  When the United States announced it would suspend the Team 
Spirit joint military maneuvers in 1994, it raised unreasonable 
preconditions--satisfactory inspection by the IAEA and 
realisation of the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and South of Korea. 
  Even now when the inspection by the IAEA for the continuity 
of safeguards has ended and several rounds of inter-Korean 
working-level contact have taken place, the United States 
persistently insists on the preconditions, saying that the 
inspection by the IAEA is not satisfactory and the exchange of 
presidential envoys between the North and South must be realised. 
  The IAEA itself recognizes that the recent inspection was 
carried out on the basis of full discussion between its 
inspectors' group and the operators of the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities and that the problems raised during the inspection 
were smoothly resolved under the agreement of the IAEA. 
  As for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North 
and South, it is on the verge of realisation, far more 
progressive than is signified in the agreement of the New York 
contact between the DPRK and the United States, though the 
agreement provides only for resumption of working-level contact. 
Nevertheless, the United States has insisted on unreasonable 
preconditions. It is unjustifiable in every respect. 
  It is patently contrary to the agreed conclusions reached at 
the New York contact between the DPRK and the United States that 
the United States has raised as a precondition of the talks the 
realisation of the exchange of special envoys between the North 
and the South, which is not included in the conclusions. 
  If the United States persistently imposes unreasonable 
preconditions on the DPRK, while failing to discharge its 
obligation concerning the steps of simultaneous action, we 
cannot but refrain from taking an action unilaterally. 
  It is clarified in the conclusions that it is necessary for 
the implementation of the conclusions to carry into practice 
every step of simultaneous action. 
  So, if the U.S. side failed to discharge its obligation, the 
conclusions would become invalid automatically. 
  We already stated at the New York contact that if the United 
States failed to fulfill its obligation, we will consider the 
DPRK-U.S. talks to have been foiled and take appropriate steps. 
  The future developments depend on the U.S. attitude.

<F P=106> ["South Side Must Show Sincerity in Discussing Exchange of </F>
Special Envoys" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today hits out at the attempt of the South Korean 
authorities to use the question of exchange of special envoys as 
an expedient to attain their sinister political aims. 
  The analyst says: 
  The South side said it had no objection to the proposed 
early 
exchange of special envoys, yet it took exception to announcing 
the agreement on it in a joint communique. It also refused to 
accept the North side's reasonable proposal on the mission of 
special envoys, including the question of the North and the 
South observing the principle of national independence. This is 
a mockery of the fellow countrymen and an act utterly lacking 
faith as a dialogue partner. 
  What the South side really seeks is to drag on the 
working-level contact for an indefinite period and delay the 
exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and 
thereby to cast a shadow on the soon-to-be-held third round of 
DPRK-USA talks. 
  It is an unjustifiable anti-national criminal act for the 
very one who is blocking an early exchange of special envoys to 
create an obstacle in the way of the third round of DPRK-USA 
talks by laying the blame for the failure of exchange of special 
envoys at the other's door. 
  The South side must bear in mind that a good opportunity 
does 
not present itself any time and stop playing tricks to block the 
exchange of special envoys. And it must effect a fundamental 
switchover so that the agreement may be finalized without fail 
at the next contact. 
  We will watch the South side's attitude hereafter.

  [Excerpt] Security at the Interior Ministry will be stepped 
up from today, with the offices of Interior Minister Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut being declared a "restricted zone". The offices of 
the five deputy interior ministers, the permanent secretary and 
deputy permanent secretaries have also been declared "restricted 
zones", where unauthorised entry is prohibited. 
  A source said yesterday the tightening of security at the 
ministry was agreed on at a meeting on Friday in the aftermath 
of bomb attacks on the homes of Social Action Party [SAP] leader 
Montri Phongpanit, SAP MP Bunphan Khaewatthana, Permanent Labour 
Secretary Sawai Phrammani in Nakhon Ratchasima and on a 
locomotive in Songkhla. 
  As part of the new measures, the source said, the offices in 
the Interior Ministry of the Local Administration Department, 
the Secretariat, the Permanent Secretary, the Welfare and Labour 
Protection Department and the Institute of Prince Damrong 
Rachanuphap are now regarded as restricted zones. Earlier, 
Permanent Interior Secretary Aree Wong-araya had declared his 
office and the area in front of it off-limits to reporters.

<F P=106> [By Tim Johnson] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Vietnam views the 
Philippines' successful transformation of a former U.S. naval 
base at Subic Bay as a model for commercializing its own 
Russia-utilized naval facilities at Cam Ranh Bay, according to a 
senior Vietnamese Foreign Ministry official. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Le Mai, who left Tokyo for Hanoi on Monday [14 March], 
made the disclosure in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
during a visit to participate in an international conference on 
Cambodian reconstruction, which ended Friday. 
  "The reality of Subic Bay -- to turn a military base into a 
commercial base -- is very interesting to us," Le Mai said. "I 
don't think that, in this post-Cold War era, military bases are 
as important as before." The Philippine Government transformed 
Subic Bay, 80 kilometers northwest of Manila, into a free port 
and industrial zone after U.S. forces left in November 1992, 
ending nearly a century of U.S. military presence in the 
country. Over 350 million dollars has reportedly been invested 
there so far by Filipino and foreign companies. Le Mai said 
Vietnamese officials have already visited Subic Bay on an 
inspection tour at the invitation of the Philippine Government. 
  Russia, which inherited use of Cam Ranh Bay from the former 
Soviet Union, has been scaling down its presence in recent years 
and the number of its visiting naval ships has dropped sharply. 
Compared with thousands before, only a few hundred Russian 
servicemen now reportedly remain at the base in central Vietnam, 
many of them manning a large signals-intelligence facility 
there. Moscow is said to desire continued access for refueling 
and provisioning of its naval ships. 
  "I think the best thing is not to have any foreign military 
forces using the facilities there," Le Mai said. "We want to 
have a peaceful environment. We rendered some facilities to the 
Soviet Union in the past and now Russia, but as you know Russia 
is too busy with her `homework' and the role of military bases 
is going down, down in this new post-Cold War situation." 
  He added that Vietnam is keeping open all "long-term 
options" 
for use of the facilities. 
  Prior to its evacuation of its troops from South Vietnam 
during the Vietnam war, the United States invested some 250 
million dollars to develop Cam Ranh as a commercial port, 
building deep-water harbor facilities later taken over for use 
by the Soviets. 
  Hanoi is said by some Vietnam-watchers to favor a limited 
Russian presence at Cam Ranh Bay to deter Chinese ambitions in 
the South China Sea. According to Le Mai, Vietnam is trying to 
solve "by peaceful negotiation" its territorial disputes with 
China and several other countries in the region centering on the 
Spratly Islands.

  [Text] Berlin, March 14 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspection team finished its work 
in North Korea Monday and is scheduled to leave Pyongyang for 
Vienna Tuesday, IAEA officials said. 
  The IAEA team had studied the possibility of leaving some 
inspectors behind to handle the transport of equipment and 
samples weighing about 300 kilograms, but decided against it, 
the officials said. 
  An IAEA official stressed that the idea of leaving some 
members behind had been contemplated purely because of equipment 
shipping problems. He said he understood that the inspection 
work had proceeded without a hitch so far. 
  The official added, however, that he did not know whether 
the 
team had carried out all of its inspection plans. 
  One of the inspectors has already gone to Vienna and the 
remaining six are scheduled to return on Thursday via Beijing. 
  The IAEA's nuclear safeguards bureau will receive a report 
from the team before submitting its own report to 
Director-General Hans Blix on whether there was any change in 
the North Korean situation. The report will help determine the 
need for convening a special Board of Governors meeting, they 
said. 
  At the regular Board of Governors meeting in February, the 
IAEA agreed to call a special meeting if the inspection team's 
activities were restricted or if it determined that continuity 
in nuclear safeguards had been disrupted in North Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection team will leave Pyongyang on 15 March after finishing 
its 12-day inspection of North Korea. 
  David Kyd, IAEA information director, said: On 14 March, the 
inspection team completed its activities in Yongbyon, which 
started on 3 March in response to an emergency order from the 
IAEA Secretariat. The team will depart Pyongyang on 15 March 
and return to Vienna via Beijing on 16 March. 
  The IAEA is now considering convening a special Board of 
Governors meeting next week after notifying major board members 
that the recent inspection activities were unsatisfactory 
[manjoksuropchi motaessumul]. 
  Major board members decided that the recent inspection of 
North Korea was not sufficient [mihup] to determine if nuclear 
materials are being used for other purposes because it was 
difficult to collect sample materials due to North Korea's 
uncooperative attitude [pukhanui pihyopchoro]. Accordingly, it 
seems to be inevitable that a special Board of Governors meeting 
will be convened next week.

  [Text] It was learned on 14 March that North Korea will 
hold the Seventh Session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly 
[SPA] early April and will likely make important decisions on 
the nuclear problem and on its relations with the United States. 
  Concerning this, Hwang Chang-yop, secretary for 
international 
affairs of the Workers' Party who is in charge of North Korean 
diplomatic affairs, visited Vietnam from 7 to 10 March, and 
examined the background of Vietnam improving relations with the 
United States after the Vietnam war and the procedure to resume 
economic cooperation. 
  Holding talks with high-ranking officials from the 
Vietnamese 
Communist Party, Secretary Hwang discussed the issue of the 
remains of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. On 11 March, he visited 
Laos and discussed the issue of importing Lao-produced rice. 
  Past North Korean SPA sessions debated buget and 
reorganization issues and the adoption of important resolutions 
as key agenda. 
  On 14 March, one of the National Unification Board officials 
said: We paid close attention to the visit of Secretary Hwang, 
who actually supervises North Korean diplomacy toward Vietnam 
before the SPA session. Thus, there is a great possibility that 
the forthcoming SPA will make important decisions on the nuclear 
issue and on its relations with the United States. 
  This official, however, noted that the possibility that 
steps 
will be taken for Kim Chong-il's succession to power is slim.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- The ruling coalition's 
chief strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, said Tuesday [15 March] he has 
canceled a journey to the United States later this month. 
  Ozawa told a group of reporters in the Diet that it would be 
difficult because he has not made any preparations for the trip. 
His U.S. visit was believed to be a troubleshooting mission to 
find a breakthrough in the strained Japan-U.S. trade ties. 
  Secretary general of the coalition's primary bloc Shinseito 
and a close associate of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Ozawa 
initially considered going to Washington on March 21 at the 
request of the National Press Club to deliver a speech. 
  Ozawa, however, had eyed using the opportunity to meet 
officials in the administration of President Bill Clinton and 
congressional leaders to work out difficulties that hampered the 
development of bilateral economic ties following the failure of 
the "framework" trade talks last month, political sources said. 
Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach agreement in the talks 
aimed at opening up Japan's market to U.S. goods and reducing 
its huge trade surplus. 
  On the possibility of visiting the U.S. in the future, Ozawa 
said he would consider going after the intense media speculation 
over the trip has died down.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Text] It has been revealed that concerning construction 
projects at the U.S. Forces Japan [USFJ] Atsugi base, the U.S. 
Government has notified the Japanese Government of its intention 
to demand that 73 Japanese construction companies pay a total of 
1.1 billion yen in compensation for its having been forced to 
pay unreasonably high construction costs as a result of bid 
rigging among major Japanese construction companies. 
  According to the message, the U.S. Government has been 
unjustly forced to pay unusually high costs for the construction 
of facilities at the USFJ Atsugi base in Kanagawa Prefecture 
between 1984 and 1990 because major Japanese construction 
companies engaged in bid rigging. It is reported that the U.S. 
Government therefore intends to demand about 1.1 billion yen in 
compensation from 73 construction companies which were involved 
in the construction projects. 
  In this regard, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said at 
a 
news conference following a cabinet meeting this morning that 
although it is the job of the Fair Trade Commission to determine 
whether there was bid rigging, the Construction Ministry, for 
its part, will immediately investigate the matter. Igarashi, 
however, brushed aside concerns that this situation might refuel 
bilateral construction frictions, saying that it would not 
affect future bilateral ties because Japan presented the United 
States with measures last January to improve foreign access to 
Japanese construction markets, including the revision of bidding 
procedures, and that the two nations managed to reach an accord. 
  Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry feels the United States is 
not linking the bid rigging issue to the ongoing bilateral 
economic disputes because this matter is strictly a civil issue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The "Sobaeksuhoe," an 
underground circle of Seoul National University which was 
inaugurated on February 5, adopted a letter to the one million 
students of South Korea on March 1 calling on them to deal a 
sledge-hammer blow at outside forces and the "civilian fascists" 
and play the role of detonator and bomb in making 1995 the year 
of reunification, the Seoul-based Radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  Noting that to put an end to the domination and interference 
of outside forces, ostracize the "civilian fascists" and 
immediately terminate the tragedy of national division was our 
fellow countrymen's desire and a solemn request of the time, the 
letter said: 
  The basic way of overcoming the present difficulties and 
accomplishing the national-historic cause is to achieve great 
national unity with the illustrious leader of the nation as the 
centripetal point. 
  Our people's deep reverence for and trust in the dear leader 
Mr. Kim Chong-il, the lodestar, is an expression of the faith 
and will that stem from the belief that the destiny of a nation 
is orientated by an illustrious leader. 
  We, the vanguards of the "Sobaeksuhoe" ardently call on the 
one million students who value justice and truth to greet 
national reunification in 1995 at any cost, braving all the 
difficulties and trials and remaining loyal and devoted to the 
dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il, the destiny of the nation and the 
lodestar of the era of independence.

<F P=106> ["Japan's Nuclear Armament Is Obstacle to Denuclearization </F>
of Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- We cannot remain an 
on-looker to Japan's nuclear armament which is blocking the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, says a NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today. 
  The analyst goes on: 
  Japan's nuclear armament is an obstacle to the process of 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula because it can cause a 
new nuclear arms race in this region. 
  If the situation on the Korean peninsula is to be eased and 
denuclearization to be realized, nuclear weapons must be removed 
in and around the region, above all. The nuclear armament being 
promoted in Japan, however, will inevitably give rise to a new 
nuclear arms race in the Korean peninsula and its surroundings. 
Moreover, Japan takes the DPRK as the first target of attack for 
its overseas aggression. 
  If the Korean peninsula is to be denuclearized, an 
environment and conditions for it must be created in this 
region. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
presupposes the removal of nuclear threat, and if it is to be 
realized substantially, a nuclear threat must be eliminated in 
its surroundings. Under the conditions where Japan is stepping 
up its nuclear armament, the North-South joint declaration on 
denuclearization will be reduced to a good-for-nothing one and 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be, in fact, 
meaningless. 
  In actuality, the Japanese reactionaries do not want to see 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula settled, the 
North-South joint declaration on denuclearization implemented 
and the Korean peninsula turned into a nuclear-free, peace zone, 
for they may lose the ground for nuclear armament when the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is fundamentally and 
completely settled and this region is turned into a nuclear-free 
zone. Their ulterior intention is to oppose the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, aggravate the military 
confrontation and tension in this region and thus step up 
Japan's nuclear armament on a legitimate basis. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must immediately stop their 
criminal nuclear armament that snags the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- The International 
Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco) 
printed a bulletin on March 3. 
  The bulletin in an editorial titled "New Prospect for 
Solution of Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula" says an 
agreement reached between the DPRK and the U.S. in New York on 
Feb. 25 entirely conforms to the spirit of the joint statement 
issued between the both sides last year, which clarifies the 
principles to be maintained in solving the Korean question 
including the nuclear issue as a whole. 
  It is owing to the United States that the joint statement 
has 
not yet been implemented and the tensions still remain on the 
Korean peninsula, the bulletin points out, and goes on: 
  The most important question at the present juncture is to 
put 
international pressure upon the United States so that it may 
honor its promise. 
  The bulletin calls upon the world peaceloving forces to more 
vigorously conduct the international solidarity movement for 
supporting the just struggle of the Korean people for the 
independent, peaceful reunification of the country. 
  It edits news about the solidarity movement for supporting 
Korea's reunification held in different countries of the world.

  Tax payable by a foreign-invested business and a foreign 
individual shall be calculated and paid in Korean won from a 
foreign exchange note account. 
  If any tax-related agreement concluded between the 
Government 
of the DPRK and the government of a foreign country contains tax 
provisions that differ from those stipulated in these 
regulations, a foreign investor and a foreign individual may pay 
taxes pursuant to the agreement. 
  Enterprise income tax shall be imposed on the taxable income 
which is the remainder after the deduction of cost, other 
expenditure and turnover tax from the gross revenue. 
  Enterprise income tax rates shall be 14 percent of the 
taxable income in the case of a foreign-invested business 
established inside the free economic and trade zone, 25 percent

technologies, natural resource development and infrastructure 
construction sectors as well as scientific research and 
technological development sectors.

60,000,000 won in total in infrastructure construction projects 
such as railway, road, telecommunication, seaports and airports 
inside the free economic and trade zone shall be exempted from

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- Agro-science has made 
progress in Korea. 
  The variety of crops cultivated and applied in agriculture 
has increased three times over the past thirty years since the 
publication of the socialist rural theses (February 1964). 
  Methods of farming suitable for different areas and soil 
have 
been completed on the principle of the right crop in the right 
time and the right crop on the right soil. 
  Noteworthy is the completion of the method of farming on the 
northern highlands 1,000 to 1,400 metres above sea level and of 
the two-crop farming method in South Hwanghae and Kangwon 
Provinces and other areas with a relatively mild weather. 
  Along with this, scientific and technological problems have 
been satisfactorily solved in the irrigation, comprehensive 
mechanization and extensive application of chemicals in 
agriculture. 
  The study and development of various kinds of chemical 
fertilizers and herbicides suited to conditions for the growth 
of crops raised their qualitative composition. 
  A large number of modern farm machines have been invented 
and 
introduced and nearly all farm work is done with the help of 
machines. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song, always paying deep 
attention to the development of the nation's agriculture, saw to 
it that chuche-based agro-science research institutions were set 
up. 
  More than 180 branches and experimental farms have been 
built 
in all provinces since the agro-science research centre was 
built in December 1948. 
  Training centres for agro-scientists and technicians were 
built up. 
  Hundreds of thousands of agro-scientists and experts are 
active in the agricultural sector. 
  The development of agro-science brought about a rapid growth 
of agricultural production. 
  Over the past thirty years after the publication of the 
rural 
theses the production of grain increased 1.9 times, of which 
rice 1.8 times and maize 2.2 times. 
  The number of tractors and lorries engaged in the 
agricultural domain increased six and five times respectively. 
  The amount of chemical fertilizers per hectare rose to more 
than two tons from 300 kilograms.

  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh -- Cambodian Defence Minister Gen Tie 
Banh on Monday dismissed reports that an all-out offensive 
against the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin would start within 
days, saying the date for such an attack could not be fixed. "It 
is not possible to specify when we are going to attack. That 
would depend on the opportunity," he said. However, according to 
Tie Banh, the Royal Army will definitely move against Pailin as 
it is the responsibility of government forces to suppress "the 
outlaw forces". [passage omitted] 
  "(The Cambodian government) is to try to solve this (Khmer 
Rouge) problem as soon as possible so people can live happily," 
Tie Banh said. 
  There have been rumours recently that about 9,000 government 
forces had moved closer to Pailin, preparing for a major attack. 
But according to Tie Banh, a large force would not necessarily 
be helpful in fighting the Khmer Rouge who are accustomed to 
hit-and-run fighting. "Effective and well-planned strategies 
will be more useful," he said. The minister said the news media 
had worsened the situation by publishing groundless reports. 
"How would they know how many army personnel we have? And even 
we don't know when to attack the Khmer Rouge," he said. 
  Asked if he knew the size of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla 
force, 
Tie Banh said it was difficult to estimate but he personally 
believed the faction did not have as big a force as generally 
reported. He said news reports have always overestimated the 
guerrilla forces. 
  Despite the fact that the royalist Funcinpec [National 
United 
Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative 
Cambodia] and the Khmer Rouge had been allies for 13 years, from 
1979 to 1992, fighting the Phnom Penh government, Tie Banh said 
Funcinpec and the Cambodian Peoples Party did not have any 
conflict over military policy. "Our policy is to clear the 
country of outlaw forces responsible for public unrest," he 
said. According to Tie Banh, it would be against the public 
will for the army to be reluctant to suppress the Khmer Rouge. 
"In the past, they were allies, but now they must be broken up 
as we have to follow the rules," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Co-Defence Minister Tea Chamrat of Funcinpec said 
military forces would not always be able to end every conflict 
but "political approaches" in many cases would be more 
successful. He cited as an example Thailand's long-unsuccessful 
fight against the communist party which finally was resolved 
through a combined political-social approach. "Cambodia would 
do well to follow suit," he said.

<F P=106> ["Clarification" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea spokesman on 14 March; place not given] 
  [Text] I. The Vietnamese communist puppets and the 
two-headed government, along with the alliance's propaganda 
apparatus, have been performing a new trick lately. They have 
been taking turns lying about their invading forces putting off 
military operations in the Pailin region in compliance with King 
Norodom Sihanouk's appeal. 
  II. What is the reality on the ground? The reality is that 
the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
two-headed government have earnestly pursued military operations 
in the Pailin region and western Cambodia without interruption. 
  While their propaganda machine broadcast lies on 10 March 
about their invading forces postponing military operations, the 
invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
two-headed government were ordered to conduct a two-pronged 
offensive on the battlefield. The first prong was launched from 
Treng along National Route 10, and the second prong was launched 
from the Komping Puoy Dam. Military operations were also 
launched on the south Sisophon, Samlot, and Malai battlefields. 
The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] 
resistance joined hands to resist, attack, and disperse the 
invading forces. They inflicted heavy losses. 
  III. What is the purpose of the deceitful propaganda 
disseminated by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese lackey 
puppets, the alliance, and the two-headed government? It has 
two main objectives: 
  1. To fool the national and international public into 
believing that they have respected and implemented King Norodom 
Sihanouk's appeal. Actually, they oppose the king's five 
points, national reconciliation, and peace. They continue to 
talk about sending thousands or even tens of thousands of 
troops, tanks, and heavy guns to launch military operations in 
various areas, including the Pailin region. The same deceitful 
maneuver was employed by the Vietnamese communists -- the master 
of the one-eyed Jack [Hun Sen] and his cronies -- to fool the 
United States between 1960 and 1973, especially during the Tet 
season. This is why his majesty the king says he cannot call a 
meeting or organize talks on his five points; because the two 
premiers disagree. 
  2. They are acting in this manner because they can 
increasingly smell the smoke of their defeat. As a matter of 
fact, on 28 February -- when they launched their first major 
military offensive in the Pailin region -- they were routed 
after four hours of fighting. On 4 March their second attempt 
was also severely defeated. On 8 and 10 March, they were again 
severely routed by the people and Democratic Kampuchea. 
  IV. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the NADK, 
along with the entire Cambodian nation and people, yearn for 
peace and the end of the bloody war triggered by the Vietnamese 
war of aggression. The PDK fully and unreservedly supports his 
majesty the king's five points. Nevertheless, in the face of 
the invasion by the forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets 
and the two-headed government -- carried out in accordance with 
the policies and strategies of the Vietnamese communists and the 
alliance aimed at destroying the NADK and thereby allowing the 
Vietnamese communists to do away with the Cambodian nation and 
race -- the people and the NADK resistance have no alternative 
but to continue their struggle to implement the king's 
five-point policy in order to achieve national reconciliation, 
restore national unity and peace in Cambodia, and finally end 
the war. 
  [Dated] 14 March 1994 
  [Signed] The NADK spokesman

  [Text] The following is a report on the Pailin battlefield 
situation on 11, 12, and 13 March: 
  1. During these three days, the two-headed government's 
invading forces painstakingly carried out an offensive with 
infantry, artillery, and tanks. Their warplanes bombarded and 
attacked many areas. 
  2. All of their troops came from National Route 10. 
  3. The invading forces were backed by 18 heavy guns and 
tanks. 
  4. Their military maneuvers were the same that they 
employed on the Anlung Veng battlefield; that is, small special 
units were sent to carry out swift attacks and fool us into 
pursuing them, while their ground troops and tanks attacked us 
from behind. Although they had many thousands of ground troops, 
most of them were new recruits who lacked fighting spirit. 
  5. Their fighting spirit was low. We attacked and routed 
many of their columns; after a short battle, they were 
dispersed. They only showed the might of their artillery and 
tanks from a distance; they did not dare move them close to the 
fighting. We were able to attack them from remote areas, and we 
intercepted them when they moved forward, just as we did at

  6. They used L-19 warplanes and helicopters to bombard 
and shoot at us, but they did not dare come closer because they 
were afraid of losing their aircraft. 
  7. We are continuing to counterattack and rout the enemy 
troops in the north and south. 
  8. Our commanders were together with our troops, who 
stayed permanently at the frontline. We are now following a 
strategy of attacking the invading enemy forces with a high 
sense of responsibility and lively initiative. We are 
determined to defend our bases and people and thus contribute to 
defending our nation and people. We are especially determined 
to annihilate as many of the invading enemy forces as possible. 
  9. As always, our forces on the front and in the rear are 
ready to fight with a high spirit to annihilate the invading 
forces.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference of President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila--live, italicized passages in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Sir, in all your past foreign 
visits, the thrust was to attract investors to invest in the 
Philippines. In your forthcoming visit to Vietnam, what would 
be the thrust considering that the Vietnamese are not in a 
position to invest here in the Philippines? 
  [Ramos] Why, am I going to Vietnam? [laughter] Anyway, 
seriously speaking, Ellen, in all of our trips, trade promotion 
was just one of the major goals. But the paramount goal in all 
of those trips was the improvement of bilateral relations, and 
that is very important for the Philippines which is in the 
center of Asia and the Pacific rim. And I think we accomplished 
those objectives in 1992 and 1993. 
  Another major mission aside from trade promotion, investment 
promotion, tourism promotion, and improvement of bilateral 
relations is enhancing our regional stability, security, and 
cooperation. And this is where such networks and organizations 
as ASEAN, APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], EAGA [East 
ASEAN Growth Area], and now the newly formed ARF which is the 
ASEAN Regional Forum which includes the dialogue partners of 
ASEAN participating in the discussion now of defense and 
security matters which is unprecedented in the more than 25 
years of the existence of ASEAN, are matters of extreme 
importance to the Philippines. 
  Now, of course, it is always nice if you can bring in 
investments. But in the case of Vietnam, which is the example 
that you are citing, we must make sure that our bilateral issues 
pertaining to the restoration of our very close cooperation and 
goodwill are restored. I think I can safely say that among the 
countries in ASEAN, it was the Philippines that had very close 
relations with the Indo-Chinese states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and 
Laos. And this dates back to the early 50s during the time of 
President Ramon Magsaysay. And that is why the name Filipino in 
Vietnam, for instance, is associated with being number one. You 
ask (Percy Picardo) there who was in Vietnam with me. 
What they said in Vietnam is Filotan number one. 
Filotan means Filipino. And it's not only because of that 
assistance that was given by President Magsaysay, but also the 
initiatives of our socio-civic and veterans organizations. The 
likes of the Freedom Company; the (Instance) Construction; the 
OB, or Operations for Brotherhood, still are highly regarded 
institutions there. So, this is something that we want to renew 
and certainly enhance. 
  Now, another important reason is we are all neighbors, 
claimants in a certain area of the South China Sea, collectively 
now called the Spratlys. I think it is important to pursue 
again the commitments to the peaceful, joint development, and 
exploration of the Spratlys. For your information, among the 
claimants there, it is the Philippines and the Vietnamese that 
are in closest contact. It's just almost as close as from here 
to Makati [Philippines' financial district]; the islands 
that we are occupying are very near. So it's important to 
make sure that the commitments made in the Manila Declaration of 
July 1992, which was the foreign ministerial meeting that we 
hosted at that time and in which the dialogue partners also made 
similar commitments, be strengthened by these visits. 
  You should also realize that we have hosted tens of 
thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Vietnamese refugees 
-- the so-called boat people -- in Palawan, in Morong, 
Paranaque, and other places. And again, there must be some kind 
of a dialogue that should take place as to the future of these 
Vietnamese nationals. 
  There is the matter also of complimentation of our products 
and raw materials. While generally it is true that we have a 
similar kind of economy with Vietnam, similar products, and 
agricultural and mineral resources, there is complimentation 
that could take place, meaning cooperation to the mutual benefit 
of both. Inasmuch as right now we are at a higher developmental 
stage, if you are looking at the entire spectrum of human 
skills, education, health and medical services, management, 
banking, and financial services, as well as infrastructure for 
transportation, communications, etcetera. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Sir, the Thai foreign minister when he was 
here about a week ago, mentioned about the possibility of 
getting together the leaders of ASEAN and the Indo-Chinese 
states? 
  [Ramos] Minister Prasong? 
  [Correspondent] Yes, Sir. 
  [Ramos] Well, as you may recall, I said that already in my 
speech last May, in the PBEC -- Pacific Basin Economic Council 
in Seoul -- which was hosted by Korea. Prime Minister Mahathir 
and I in fact spoke from the same platform on the same morning, 
and that was the thrust of my message. The CAN concept -- 
C-A-N, Community of Asian Nations -- was officially proposed by 
me. And this one is a follow-up of that, this one of Foreign 
Minister Prasong. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, will this not be a block within, say, 
APEC? 
  [Ramos] I'll just give you a copy of that speech last May 
because it's all described there. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, thank you. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has 
intensified its campaign to protect intellectual property rights 
[IPR]. Earlier today, DTI filed counterfeiting charges against 
two clothing retail outlets of Walt Disney products that have no 
authorization from the legitimate copyright owners. DTI 
Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez headed the raiding team which 
filed the charge sheets against the two outlets in Shoppesville 
Complex in Greenhills, San Juan. 
  Those charged will face a fine of up to P150,000 [Philippine 
pesos] or cancellation of permit and other penalties. Ordonez 
assured that DTI is following a more speedy procedure in filing 
charges. 
  [Begin recording] [Ordonez in progress] ...because what I 
have here [displaying child's clothing] is Walt Disney, but this 
is fake -- counterfeit. This is not right, okay? We need not 
go to the police, go to the court, go to the judge, and go to 
the mayor. No need. As long as there is a consumer that comes 
to us and has the receipt and brings something like this, the 
consumer can make a complaint at our office. Within three to 
five days, the violators were arrested. That was what happened. 
  This one, I was the one who personally bought it. So, they 
can not fool us anymore. Aside from this, even if I did not buy 
this one, if there is a complaint, and there is a receipt and 
the product is presented, they will be caught. 
  [Disney representative, in English] I'm very glad that DTI 
has decided to take corrective action on counterfeiting in the 
Philippines because it is really a big problem here. We have 
local manufacturers paying taxes to the government, and they are 
badly affected by the counterfeits. Now, stopping counterfeits 
from retailers will really help solve the problem. [end

<F P=106> [By Malou L. Sayson] </F>
  [Text] Southern Mindanao is fast shedding off its image as 
the country's traditional economic backdoor and in no time will 
emerge as the new growth area in the east of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The reason for this change is 
its abundant agriculture and natural resources which have 
continued luring unprecedented investments since the early 
1990's. Southern Mindanao's passport to a grandiose 
transformation is its so-called SOCSARGEN (South Cotabato, 
Sarangani, General Santos City) growth corridor, dubbed as the 
"agricultural paradise" of the south. 
  Agriculture Secretary Roberto S. Sebastian said the 
diversified agricultural potential highlighted by the vast and 
rich fishing grounds of the Celebes and Solomon seas could 
easily make the area the main gateway to East ASEAN markets. 
  The growth trend has emerged in the early 1990's when 
investments jumped 800 million to around one billion pesos at 
present. New firms have also been noted to have mushroomed. 
Sebastian said there are about 200 big local and foreign 
investors who have confirmed investing in SOCSARGEN. 
  Malaysia is one of the leading investors in the area as 
signalled by the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir bin Mohamed. Sebastian said a Philippine trade mission 
is set to visit Malaysia to discuss agriculture complementation 
between the two countries, especially in the aspect of fishing. 
  A world-class fishport, 20 minutes away from Polomoloc, 
South 
Cotabato, is just a part of the infrastructure investments of 
over $200 million committed by the governments of the 
Philippines, the United States and Japan. Sebastian said the 
fishport complex, designed to cover a one-kilometer shoreline 
with a projected daily capacity of 1,000 metric tons of fish 
catch, could make SOCSARGEN competitive with Thailand's port. He 
said fish processing activities are concentrated in Thailand; 
but once the fishport complex is established, the country can 
capture part of the fish market. This is due to SOCSARGEN's 
proximity to the rich fishing grounds of the Solomon and Celebes 
seas located east of the country. 
  Just by cutting the transit time is enough to lure 
commercial 
fishing vessels to land their catch in Southern Mindanao instead 
of Thailand, Sebastian added. Commercial fishing firms operating 
in General Santos City are leading participants in this 
lucrative regional fishing market. There are 34 commercial 
deep-sea fishing firms with a combined fleet of over 600 
commercial fishing vessels' based in the city, making it the 
second port next to Navotas in fish landings and the leading 
port for tuna. The five fish canning plants producing as much as 
$30.8 million worth of products are also projected to increase 
production with the building of the fishport complex. 
  Sebastian said by 1996, the $30-million Japanese-financed 
fish port will be completed to consist of a 300 meter wharf for 
2,000 gross ton reefer carriers, a 750 meter landing quay and a 
cold storage for 1,500 metric tons of large tuna. The port has 
also the capability to accommodate a 60-ton ice plant, brine 
airblast and contact freezers and some 4,500 square meters of 
fish market stalls. 
  SOCSARGEN's great marine wealth is completed by high 
agricultural productivity contributed by the unrivaled soil 
fertility of the Allah and Koronadal valleys. He said the area 
produces 40 percent of the country's pineapples, 23 percent of 
its corn, 75 percent of its cotton, and eight percent of its 
coconuts. 
  SOCSARGEN is also a major production area for countries area 
for cut flowers, prawns, bananas, asparagus, seed corn and a 
leading production site for hogs, livestock and feedgrains.

<F P=106> [By Achara Phongwutthitham] </F>
  [Text] In an attempt to conclude the long-awaited bilateral 
textile agreement during the round of talks to take place at the 
end of this month, Thai officials are considering the wording of 
the illegal shipment circumvention clause. Thai and US officials 
are scheduled to hold their third round of talks this month. 
They are expected to focus on the illegal shipment clause as it 
is the last crucial and contentious issue to be resolved in the 
negotiations. 
  The United States has already proposed some wording it would 
like to see included in the agreement, but the Thai side did not 
want to see the final agreement based on a US draft alone. The 
wording proposed by the US may conflict with some of Gatt's 
multilateral trade principles. And Thailand's agreement to such 
a clause might have put the country at a disadvantage on other 
issues in the future. 
  A source in the Thai Garment Manufacturers Association said 
the US proposed very tough penalties for circumvention of the 
country-of-origin rules. Thai garment exporters would stand to 
lose portions of their quota if their products are found to have 
been trans-shipped to third countries before entering the US. 
  The condition suggested by the Americans would give the 
United States the rights to inspect any plant in Thailand 
suspected of trans-shipping its output to the United States 
without advance notice. If any plant were shown to be guilty, 
the firm would be subject to being punished by the reduction of 
its quota by triple the amount of product illegally transshipped. 
  The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (Gatt) calls for 
giving accused countries the chance to clear themselves by 
submitting documentation in support of their innocence. The US 
wants to be able to check things out at the source. 
  The source said two previous negotiating sessions had failed 
to extend the textiles and garments agreement because the Thai 
side could not accept the US proposal. 
  Many other textile and garment exporters like Hong Kong and 
China have agreed to sign bilateral textile quota agreements 
with the United States. The circumvention penalties insisted on 
by the United States differ for each country such an agreement 
has been concluded with. 
  The old bilateral agreement which allowed for a limited 
amount of Thai textiles to be exported to the US without harming 
its domestic garment industry expired on Dec 31 of last year. 
  Wirot Amatakunchai, president of the Thai Garment 
Manufacturers Association, said Thailand proposed a 20 per cent 
increase over its former quota of 202 million square metres for 
the new agreement, since Thailand used up all of the quota 
granted under the old agreement last year. 
  The upcoming third round of negotiations have been delayed 
until April or May after a big meeting of the Thai Chamber 
Commerce. 
  Phongsak Atsakun, president of the Thai Textile 
Manufacturing 
Association, said the 30 per cent decrease in sales of cotton 
products around the world would affect exporters only in the 
short term. Prices of imported raw cotton, of which Thailand 
imports 300,000 tonnes annually, have risen by 40-50 per cent 
over the past two month. 
  Wirot said the finished-clothes industry has also been 
affected. Cotton thread is currently priced 30 per cent higher 
with TC thread priced 10 per cent higher as well. Cotton 
clothing is expected to increase in price by 20 per cent as a 
consequence.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "US economic sabre-rattling in Asia to force </F>
trade concessions"] 
  [Text] The recent objection raised by the European Union on 
the methods adopted by the United States in its efforts to get 
into Asian markets by force represents the "stick and carrot" 
approach, which is counter to the GATT agreements, should serve 
as an eye-opener to the leaders of this region. 
  In the US endeavor to penetrate the markets of China, 
Indonesia, Japan and Thailand, talking to them as individual 
countries, exploiting its adept diplomacy for its own survival, 
exposes the US designs of not willing to come to terms with a 
collective Asian forum. 
  The objections raised by the United States during the time 
of 
President Bush and the diplomatic shuttle across Asian capitals 
by the then Secretary of State James Baker against the East Asia 
Economic Group proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, is 
now becoming clearer by their latest efforts now undertaken by 
incumbent Warren Christopher to keep other East Asian countries 
from joining hands with ASEAN and speak out as a single voice. 
  It is incumbent upon the leaders of this region, and they 
owe 
it to the generations yet unborn, to play a productive role in 
the making of the new international economic order with a 
collective consensus and to refuse to play into American hands. 
  This is a time for the most creative ASEAN initiatives for a 
productive role and continued progress. Our joint collaboration 
should extend beyond the ASEAN and the ASEAN sub-region, beyond 
Southeast Asia, beyond East Asia and even beyond the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  ASEAN must of course be aware of its own limited weight in 
the international arena. Japan -- the Asian economic giant -- 
on the other hand, should realize and do some soul searching 
concerning her own position, both in the economic and political 
areas in the region is weakened, unless Japan inclines towards 
ASEAN and other Asian countries in her own interest. 
  Whatever the political beliefs in China, the "one country 
with two policies" has to be taken seriously. China has been 
opening up her economy to world trade and investments for the 
past decade and has fairly successfully juxtaposed a free market 
system with a centrally-planned economy. 
  There is no doubt that China today is economically healthier 
than the China of the Cultural Revolution and Maoism. ASEAN and 
other Asian states cannot ignore China in any "Asian" regional 
economic forum of the future apart from APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation]. ASEAN leaders, from its inception in 
1967, have reviewed progress achieved and so plan new directions 
for the future. Unfortunately the record of achievements, 
particularly in the field of economic cooperation, has been 
dismal. 
  The political and economic scenario of the world under ASEAN 
which existed in the 70s and 80s has been radically transformed. 
The socialist command economics of Eastern Europe have collapsed 
and are being replaced by a free market system. The Soviet 
Union is undergoing a political and economic upheaval of 
unprecedented proportions which will move it away from the rigid 
centrally-planned economies of the past to a more 
market-oriented system. We witness now the early failures of 
the free market and democracy in the former Communist countries. 
Indeed their situation now is worse than when their economies 
were centrally planned. 
  On the other hand, there are a host of problems for the 
world 
arising out of the structural weakness on the world's biggest 
economy and the biggest debtor nation -- the United States. We 
now live in a world where the developing countries are deprived 
of the past leverage of "defection to the other side". There is 
the sole American giant, with immense problems at home and no 
longer driven by the imperatives of the Cold War, forcing its 
way into the growing Asian economies with a carrot and stick, 
"look our way or else" threat. 
  We see a situation today of a dramatic rise in the 
political, 
diplomatic and military clout on the US and a severe erosion in 
its economic position. The increased pressures will be 
political and social as well as economic and deviation from the 
principles of democracy towards total "plutocracy", which sees 
the driving force of the US establishment gearing an economic 
war where the growth is -- in Asia.

  [Text] Phalang Tham [PDP] Secretary-General Winai Somphong 
has severely criticized party de facto leader Chamlong Simuang 
and a religious wing in the party for rocking the boat of the 
Chuan coalition, signalling the most serious rift in the 
third-largest government partner. Winai called for Chamlong, the 
party founder who is known to have the final say on party 
policies, to make a decision once and for all as to whether the 
Phalang Tham would remain within the coalition or not. 
  In an interview with THE NATION on Saturday, Winai did not 
mention Chamlong by name but he was apparently referring to the 
party founder, who has come out to attack the coalition on 
several issues and occasions. "If (Chamlong and the religious 
wing) feel that the Phalang Tham stands to lose from remaining 
in the coalition, they should discuss it inside the party," 
Winai said. "It's okay if they announce a pullout from the 
government. I won't object to it. But we should not be a cry 
baby in public." 
  Winai said the Phalang Tham members who were not happy 
working with the government should have proposed a pull-out to a 
party meeting. "So far, no one has proposed it to any party 
meeting. You can check with any deputy party leader...had this 
proposal been made in a party meeting, everything would have 
ended," Winai said. 
  Winai's comments indicated serious rifts in the Phalang Tham 
between the religious wing and those who hold Cabinet posts. 
Earlier reports had it that the religious wing would like to 
pull out of the coalition, but Phalang Tham's Cabinet members 
resisted. Several Phalang Tham leaders have denied the reports. 
  Winai was being interviewed by THE NATION shortly after a 
member of the religious wing, Chaiwat Sinsuwong, quit as deputy 
Bangkok governor. Chaiwat, known to be loyal to Chamlong, 
called on the party to review its role as a coalition partner 
after Phalang Tham lost local elections in Bangkok on March 6. 
"Don't shout outside the party. Don't act as somebody's 
follower or somebody else's mouthpiece," Winai said, apparently 
referring to Chaiwat and Chamlong. The communications minister 
said it would be "justified" for the Phalang Tham to criticize 
the government if it was an opposition party. 
  "I worry that what has happened will affect the 
government('s 
stability). One party should not be allowed to sink a boat 
that's being rowed by five parties." Winai said the Phalang Tham 
was acting like it was rocking the coalition boat instead of 
trying to learn to work with other government partners. "To work 
in a five-partner coalition, we must not put our foot in the 
water while others are rowing. 
  "I am sure that we and our friends in the government feel 
uneasy about our criticizing our own coalition every night and 
day. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai must be very frustrated to 
see the coalition criticized by its own members." 
  Winai said he feared "internal enemies", not rivals from the 
outside. He said Phalang Tham secretaries general had always 
been "battered, chased, harassed," by the religious wing.

  [Text] Sophon Wichitkon, president of the textile group of 
the Thai Industries Council, says the increase in the minimum 
wage for Bangkok and surrounding areas from 125 to 132 baht, or 
5.6 percent, will have an impact on the apparel industry, which 
uses a lot of manual labor. He anticipates that investors who 
were planning to move production bases to Vietnam and China will 
implement their moves quickly. The current daily wage in China 
is about 40 baht, about the same as in Vietnam. 
  Sophon said the new wage may force small apparel factories 
to 
close. The medium-sized plants may have to replace their work 
force with machines. He said only factories catering to lower 
markets will be forced to consider moving their bases. 
Factories catering to higher markets use a skilled work force 
and will therefore remain in Thailand. 
  Sophon said: "The new wage increase does not mean that the 
price of clothes will follow suit. The factories will have to 
bear the burden and try to cut costs to compete in foreign 
markets." 
  Krungthep Thopha Factory manager Phongsak Atsakun says every 
industry will be affected by the new wage increase, particularly 
industries that are labor-intensive. They will be forced to 
move to countries with lower wages or replace their work force 
with machines. The textile industry now employs about 1 million 
workers. 
  Kanyong Electric Company manager Praphat Phoworakun said the 
electric appliance industry is not likely to be affected by the 
new wage because its work force is not big. He feels that the 
new minimum wage suits the current economy, though, and notes 
that the new wage increase will impact differently on different 
industries.

  [Text] During an exclusive interview with PHUCHATKAN in 
Hanoi on 15 March, SRV Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said 
that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's visit to the SRV beginning 
today will further strengthen relations between Thailand and SRV 
in all aspects. He noted: "Relations between Thailand and 
Vietnam are currently the best they have been since the 
establishment of relations between the two countries." 
  The two countries will have to make joint efforts, however, 
to solve the remaining problem of fishing in overlapping 
territorial waters. The SRV foreign minister revealed that 
officials from all provinces concerned must also sit down 
together to work out a solution. He said: "The sea is still not 
calm in this area because foreign trawlers regularly encroach on 
our waters. I feel that this problem must be solved quickly and 
a new order must be worked out. We must join hands and trust 
each other in the name of our mutual interests." 
  Nguyen Manh Cam disclosed that the Vietnamese side has 
sought 
cooperation from the Thai side in tackling the sea dispute since 
July 1993, but the problem still persists and has led to the 
capture of illegal fishing trawlers. He said: "We have been 
waiting for a reply from the Thai side." 
  Nguyen Manh Cam said the two countries have already held two 
meetings on the problem of the overlapping area, and Vietnam is 
looking forward to the next meeting. The date and venue of this 
meeting have not been fixed. 
  He said: "Vietnam has some experience in this regard. We 
worked together with Malaysia to establish the joint development 
zone many years ago. The problem can be solved if the two sides 
have strong determination and good intentions toward each other. 
Both sides stand to profit. In fact, we should hold bilateral 
negotiations before inviting any third party to join." 
  Asked about cooperation between the two countries in the 
international arena, Nguyen Manh Cam replied that Vietnam, 
Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia are working together under the 
framework of the Mekong River Committee. A working group has 
been set up to draft a basic agreement. He said: "The working 
group has reached agreement on major principles. Only small 
issues are being discussed. We can solve the problems. Our 
policy is that we must respect the interests of all countries, 
particularly riparian states in the lower basin. Regional 
interests must also be considered. The amount of Mekong River 
water used by each country will certainly affect the others." 
  The foreign minister said his country has to rely on water 
from the Mekong River during the dry season to prevent the 
inflow of seawater into the southern delta region. 
  During the one-hour interview, the SRV foreign minister 
anticipated further improvement in relations and contacts 
between Thailand and Vietnam provided the two countries 
understand each other and work for their common interests. 
  Nguyen Manh Cam said: "We can view Vietnam and Thailand as 
economic competitors. Speaking optimistically, however, 
competition brings incentives for further economic development. 
It is good for all countries to compete rather than oppose each 
other. I believe that we should join hands in the interest of 
our countries."

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Excerpts] Detroit, March 14 KYODO -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton Monday [14 March] urged Japan and Europe to stimulate 
their economies, warning that no country can tackle employment 
issues on its own in an economically interdependent world. 
  Clinton sounded the clarion call for joint action among the 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations as he opened a G-7 
ministerial conference to examine why job security and high 
wages appear hard to reconcile in much of the industrial world. 
[passage omitted on Clinton remarks] 
  In industrial Europe, workers are cushioned by generous 
welfare perks, but the jobless rates have stuck in double digits. 
  Even in Japan, a country known for its low unemployment 
rates, the government is considering broad restructuring in 
order to protect the so-called "lifetime" employment system. 
  "At a time when vast changes are taking place in industries 
and at a time when workers too are changing their way of 
thinking, we too should realize there will be more labor 
movement across companies and industries in Japan over the long 
run," Japan's Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi told the G-7 jobs 
conference. 
  Japan also urged its G-7 partners to maintain "sound 
macroeconomic policies and the multilateral trade system" in 
order to create more jobs. 
  The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, 
represented in the G-7 jobs conference by Parliamentary Vice 
Trade Minister Otohiko Endo, also proposed easing government 
regulations, making capital more readily accessible to 
entrepreneurs, and expanding job-skills training, as answers to 
job creation. 
  But Clinton acknowledged that there are no easy answers. 
  "We are here because we have something to learn from each 
other and, hopefully, something to teach each other," Clinton 
said in his opening speech. 
  No binding policy statement will be issued by the jobs 
conference, which is largely a closed-door forum among G-7 
finance, economic and labor ministers. 
  During four separate discussion sessions, spread over two 
days, the G-7 ministers were expected to discuss a vast range of 
labor-related issues, ranging from the impact of macroeconomic 
policies to the structure of the labor systems in each of the 
G-7 member countries. 
  The exercise, Clinton said, should help produce a "real 
agenda" when the G-7 heads of state and government head to Italy 
in July for their annual summit meeting.

  [Text] Detroit, March 14 KYODO -- Japan's Labor Minister 
Chikara Sakaguchi assured his Group of Seven partners Monday [14 
March] that Japan's so-called lifetime employment system is 
alive and well, even though the nation's economy is in the 
doldrums. 
  Sakaguchi, speaking at the G-7 jobs conference in Detroit, 
acknowledged that the weak economy has made unemployment an 
"increasingly serious" problem in Japan but argued that the 
vaunted Japanese employment practice is under no threat of 
extinction. 
  Sakaguchi put up a spirited defense of lifetime employment 
in 
Japan in response to a "theme" paper the U.S. Government 
prepared for the jobs meeting that appeared to challenge the 
Japanese employment system. 
  The U.S. paper, prepared by White House chief economist 
Laura 
Tyson, argues that the low Japanese unemployment rate -- 2.5 
percent last year -- reflects a tendency among Japanese firms to 
retain workers even during cyclical downturns. 
  Tyson described the bloated payroll in Japanese companies as 
a form of "hidden unemployment" which she said is "sizable and 
rising." 
  "This along with other changes (in the Japanese economy) are 
putting the Japanese 'lifetime' employment under real strain," 
the Tyson report said. 
  Sakaguchi said Tyson's characterization of the Japanese 
employment system is off the mark. 
  "As a matter of solemn fact, those workers remain employed. 
They are actually working at the workplace and drawing their 
pay. I think it's not appropriate to describe the situation as 
`hidden unemployment'," Sakaguchi said in a prepared statement. 
  Sakaguchi, the sole Japanese cabinet minister represented in 
the G-7 jobs conference, told his G-7 colleagues that Japan's 
private-sector businesses are under no "forced obligation" to 
retain their workers. 
  Japanese managers do so, he said, because they believe 
employees' "understanding and good will" is essential for a 
company's long-term well-being. 
  Sakaguchi said Japanese employers are by no means abandoning 
their lifetime employment system, noting that Japanese firms 
usually use natural attrition -- rather than outright dismissal 
-- in restructuring their businesses. 
  "Japanese firms still pay a lot of attention to maintaining 
long-term stability in their employment system," Sakaguchi said. 
  The Japanese labor minister, however, acknowledged that 
Japan 
itself has a thing or two to learn from its G-7 partners when it 
comes to employment policy. 
  One such factor, he said, is inflexibility in the Japanese 
pay system. 
  Sakaguchi said Japanese firms that give their employees the 
assurance of job stability should change their pay system, which 
is largely based on the number of years an employee has worked 
in the company rather than job performance. 
  Japanese companies should, therefore, introduce a more 
efficient job evaluation system, such as those already 
established in other G-7 countries, Sakaguchi said. 
  Another lesson Sakaguchi said Japan should learn from its 
G-7 
partners is to foster a job market that would enable workers to 
change companies more easily, when requiring a new job. 
  "At a time when vast changes are taking place in industries 
and at a time when workers too are changing their way of 
thinking, we too should realize there will be more labor 
movement across companies and industries in Japan over the long 
run," he said.

  [Text] Detroit, March 14 KYODO -- Few critical comments 
were made against Japanese policies at the Group of Seven (G-7) 
jobs conference in Detroit on Monday [14 March], Labor Minister 
Chikara Sakaguchi disclosed. 
  There had been speculation that delegates from the other G-7 
nations might criticize Japan in connection with its employment 
and macroeconomic policies. 
  Sakaguchi, leading the Japanese delegation to the meeting, 
told reporters that the ministerial meeting was highly 
meaningful as the first G-7 conference to discuss employment 
problems. 
  Some foreign delegates told the meeting that the other 
industrial nations should learn from Japan's low unemployment 
rate -- 2.5 percent last year, Sakaguchi said. 
  He also said there was no criticism against his statement 
that Japan is doing its best to stimulate its economy. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a speech earlier Monday to 
the conference, urged Japan to increase domestic demand as part 
of more aggressive macroeconomic policies in the industrial 
world. 
  Sakaguchi also suggested that employment will be an 
important 
issue at the G-7 summit scheduled to be held in Naples, Italy, 
in July.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The U.S. Government has 
notified Japan it will postpone approval of a new flight between 
Sendai in northern Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii, which Japan 
Airlines (JAL) had been planning to inaugurate, the Transport 
Ministry said Wednesday. 
  Ministry officials said the United States has not given an 
explanation for the postponement, but said their stance is 
probably in response to Japan's refusal to expand "beyond 
rights" for U.S. airlines that would allow them to extend their 
routes beyond Japan to third countries. 
  The Japanese Government expressed its regrets over the U.S. 
move through the Japanese Embassy in Washington, ministry 
officials said. 
  The government protested that it is a breach of promise by 
the U.S. side to defer approval of the rights which are based on 
a 1989 bilateral interim agreement, the officials said. 
  JAL officials said the company will operate chartered 
flights 
for the Sendai-Honolulu route to avoid confusion among 
passengers. 
  The once-a-week flights were scheduled to start from 
Thursday, and reservations until June had reached 75 to 85 
percent, they said. 
  An aviation official of the Miyagi Prefectural Government 
said he was bewildered by the sudden postponement. "It comes as 
a shock since we are hoping to increase our international routes 
in the future," he said. 
  At the beginning of this year, JAL decided to initiate 
flights on the route and applied for approval with the U.S. 
Transport Department on February 10. 
  Japanese officials said the U.S. probably postponed its 
approval in light of opposition from U.S. airlines, United 
Airlines and Federal Express, which have met with Japanese 
resistance in securing expansion of "beyond rights." 
  The Hawaiian authorities are in favor of the new route. 
  The U.S. apparently wants to make approval of the Sendai- 
Honolulu route an issue to be taken up in bilateral aviation 
talks, the officials said. 
  The aviation negotiations have been stalled due to such 
factors as Japan's refusal to expand "beyond rights," and a 
timetable for the next round of talks has yet to be set. 
  They said there is only a slim chance of the U.S. granting 
approval of the Sendai-Honolulu route in the near future.

  [Excerpts] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
speaking about Japanese automakers' plans to purchase auto 
parts, said that these plans need the Japanese Government's 
guarantee to make them effective. Kantor made the remarks in 
testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives' Ways and 
Means Committee on 15 March. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the remarks of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, 
the government said that in the automobile sector, the amounts 
to be imported are decided entirely by the thinking of consumers 
and automakers, and that the government's making a guarantee 
would lead to the government's meddling in private sector 
activities. 
  A government source stated that the recent remarks of U.S. 
Trade Representative Kantor are aimed at securing some kind of 
guarantee from the Japanese Government with respect to Japanese 
automakers' plans to procure auto parts in a way similar to that 
found in agreements concluded between private companies of Japan 
and the United States and also between the governments of the 
two countries last week regarding the facilitation of plant and 
equipment investment to benefit a U.S. cellular phone company.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
cannot act as a guarantor for voluntary market opening measures 
pledged by Japan's auto industry, a Japanese trade official said 
Wednesday. 
  Government guarantees "mean the government controls business 
activities and this runs counter to the government's policy of 
deregulation," said a top official with the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. 
  The comments were made after U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey 
Kantor pointed to a need for "guarantees of progress" shared 
equally by Japan's auto industry and government. 
  Kantor, speaking before the House trade subcommittee on 
Tuesday, said he is dubious whether voluntary efforts by the 
auto sector will be effective without government guarantees. 
  Kantor cited an accord involving Motorola Inc.'s access to 
Japan's cellular telephone market as a model for deeper 
involvement by the Japanese Government in ensuring market 
deregulation. 
  The government assumed responsibility under the accord for 
seeing that Japan's Nippon Idou Tsushin [Japan Mobile 
Communications Corporation] implements the agreement, which will 
to widen [as received] Motorola's access to the lucrative 
Tokyo-Nagoya cellular phone market. 
  In a related development, a Japanese diplomat in Washington 
said the scope of the government's responsibility for 
implementing the weekend deal is "limited." 
  The Japanese diplomat said he could not discuss the content 
of terms of the cellular deal because the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments have not exchanged official notes on it. 
  The accord is a very special case and is not related to 
ongoing bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the diplomat 
said. 
  "The framework talks are not aimed at resolving a complaint 
by a company," he said. 
  The diplomat made the remark in reference to comments by 
some 
U.S. trade officials who said the cellular phone agreement could 
serve as a model for issues covered under the framework talks. 
  The dispute over Motorola's access to Japan's cellular phone 
market was seen as a flashpoint in bilateral trade relations. 
  Washington had threatened to impose sanctions against Japan 
for allegedly not abiding by a 1989 agreement on widening U.S. 
access to Japan's cellular phone market.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The solution to a 
Japan-U.S. dispute over cellular phone trade cannot be applied 
to other trade issues, a senior Japanese trade ministry official 
said Wednesday. 
  The approach taken by Japan's Posts and Telecommunications 
Ministry in settling the dispute involving Motorola Inc. and 
Nippon Idou Tshushin Corp. (IDO) is of a different nature from 
autos and other trade issues covered under the "framework" 
talks, said Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy international trade and 
industry minister for international affairs. 
  At a luncheon sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents Club 
of 
Japan, Okamatsu was responding to remarks by U.S. Ambassador to 
Japan Walter Mondale in which he welcomed last Saturday's phone 
trade accord as "a model" for getting the stalled framework 
talks rolling again. 
  Citing part of the accord that says Tokyo will take "all 
available measures to ensure compliance with the commitments" 
shown by IDO, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the 
Japanese Government "guaranteed the fulfillment of the 
agreement." 
  Telecommunications trade is a regulated sector, requiring a 
government license or permission to start business while autos 
and auto components are "completely free trade areas," Okamatsu 
said. 
  This remark indicates Japan's renewed opposition to setting 
"numerical targets" guaranteed by the government by clarifying 
it has no control over private businesses such as the auto 
industry. 
  Okamatsu said a market-opening package to be announced at 
the 
end of this month will contain macroeconomic measures. 
  But he withheld comment on details of the measures, 
including 
whether or not the politically sensitive issue of tax cuts will 
be included. 
  A specific framework of macroeconomic measures, which is 
being worked out at the moment, will not be announced at the end 
of March but will be unveiled around the time of the Naples 
summit of the seven leading industrialized countries in July, 
Okamatsu said, echoing an earlier remark made by Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Okamatsu denied rumors that a discrepancy of views exists 
over Japan's macroeconomic policy among the trade, finance and 
foreign ministries. 
  The Foreign Ministry is said to be receptive toward setting 
objective criteria on the macroeconomic front, taking into 
account Japan's current-account surplus as against its gross 
domestic product, while the Finance Ministry is opposed to the 
idea. "We have no discrepancy over the issue at 
vice-ministerial levels," Okamatsu said. 
  On voluntary plans now being formulated by Japanese 
automakers to increase imports of U.S.-made auto parts and 
automobiles, Okamatsu said such plans will not be included in 
the market-opening package. 
  "Auto trade is an activity of the private sector," Okamatsu 
said. "MITI is not in a position to force automakers to do this 
or that." 
  Okamatsu said MITI has yet to decide if Japan will extend 
voluntary restraints on auto exports to the United States for 
fiscal 1994 starting in April. 
  He said MITI will "carefully watch the situation" and make a 
decision on the issue in line with a global trade accord under 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that calls for the 
repeal of such practices within four years.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The foreign share of 
Japan's semiconductor market is expected to have fallen below 20 
percent for the final quarter of 1993, a Japanese Government 
source said Wednesday. 
  "It seems difficult" for the share to reach the 20 percent 
level because there is no room for U.S. suppliers to export 
because the American economy is strong, the source said. 
  Under a 1991 agreement on semiconductor trade, Japan and the 
United States agreed to a 20 percent goal for foreign market 
share by the end of 1992. 
  In the final quarter of 1992, the foreign share exceeded 
that 
goal, but has been on the decline since. 
  The foreign share of Japan's microchip market has been a 
major source of contention between Washington and Tokyo, as the 
20 percent share is viewed as a commitment by the United States 
but as a nonbinding target by Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii on Wednesday did not rule out including a tax reform 
promise in a package of market-opening measures now being 
compiled. 
  Fujii indicated no objections at a regular news conference 
to 
including the government's commitment to overhaul the tax system 
this year in the market measures due this month. 
  He was asked about a suggestion Tuesday by Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to include the tax reform plan in 
the "voluntary" market-opening steps to address Japan-U.S. trade 
disputes. 
  Fujii repeated that the governing coalition has already 
vowed 
to enact in this Diet session a permanent tax overhaul that 
shifts the tax burden away from direct taxes, such as those on 
income, toward such indirect levies as the consumption tax. 
  Washington has called Japan's fiscal stimulus steps too 
paltry to boost domestic demand to help curb Japan's trade 
surplus. U.S. officials fault the one-year nature of the 6 
trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts decided on last 
month. 
  Fujii refused to comment on reports that the fiscal 1994 
budget might be delayed or that his ministry is preparing a 
provisional budget as opposition lawmakers are blocking the 
budget debate by wrangling over a questionable loan to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The finance minister repeatedly stressed that the ministry 
wants the budget debate and enactment to proceed as quickly as 
possible but would not offer a time frame. 
  He said quick enactment would be "a plus for real demand" 
but 
would not say whether delays would hurt the economy. 
  He repeated that Japan does not plan to offer any new trade 
measures to the U.S. when Fujii meets U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen this weekend at a conference of Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum members. 
  Whether he will meet separately with Bentsen at the Hawaii 
meeting has not been decided, Fujii said, repeating that the 
APEC conference is for discussing regional economics and "is not 
a place for negotiating."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Japan has prepared a draft 
amendment to legislation that would partially lift curbs on 
foreign lawyers wishing to practice in Japan, officials said 
Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The draft, released to members of the House of 
Representatives justice committee, constitutes a proposed 
amendment to a law regulating the professional activities of 
foreign lawyers in Japan. 
  The draft bill envisions conditionally authorizing Japanese 
and foreign lawyers to run a joint law firm and provide legal 
consultation services, although it will keep a ban on the 
personal hiring by foreign lawyers of Japanese lawyers in Japan. 
  One of the two conditions mandates that Japanese lawyers 
wishing to start a joint law firm must have practiced for more 
than five years since registering with the Japan Federation of 
Bar Associations. 
  Under the other condition, however, the proposed legislation 
will continue to bar foreign lawyers from arguing both criminal 
and civil cases in Japanese courts. 
  If the two conditions are met, a joint law firm as an entity 
will be authorized to hire Japanese lawyers, according to the 
text of the bill. 
  If enacted, the amendment will allow a client to receive 
consultation services regarding Japanese and foreign laws from a 
single law firm. 
  The government plans to introduce the amendment in 
parliament 
in early April. If approved, it will come into force within a 
year. 
  The amendment will also soften the current law's principle 
of 
mutual benefits, thereby authorizing lawyers from countries that 
ban foreign lawyers' activities to practice law in Japan. 
  The amendment calls for qualifying foreign lawyers, who have 
practiced law for more than five years in countries where they 
obtained licenses, to practice law in Japan. 
  It will also soften a five-year requirement by allowing such 
lawyers to count up to two years of practicing law in Japan as a 
legal trainee as part of the five-year requirement. 
  The legislation will allow foreign law firms to use in Japan 
the corporate names they use in their countries of origin. 
  The amendment was sketched out as a result of joint study by 
the Japan Federation of Bar Associations and the Justice 
Ministry. 
  Its broad outline was released as part of a package of pump- 
priming economic measures in February by the government of Prime 
Minister Horihiro Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will tell Chinese leaders during his March 19-21 visit 
to China that Japan is concerned about China's increasing 
defense expenditure, government sources said Wednesday [16 
March]. 
  The sources said Hosokawa will also express Japan's hope 
that 
China will institute a permanent moratorium on nuclear tests and 
ensure the peaceful transition of Hong Kong from Britain to 
China in 1997. 
  China resumed nuclear tests in October and the sources said 
Hosokawa will explain that Japan harbors deep concern over the 
tests as a country which has been on the receiving end of two 
atomic bombs. 
  The same sources said Hosokawa will explain during his 
meetings with Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin that 
China's neighbors are concerned about its defense buildup. 
  He will also explain that greater openness or "transparency" 
in China's defense budget would help alleviate concerns. 
  They said Hosokawa will tell the Chinese that they need to 
curb their defense expenditure if they are to ensure the 
continuation of their most-favored-nation (MFN) status with the 
United States and join the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). 
  He will also tell the Chinese that Japan will only give aid 
to a country if it can be sure the money will not be used for 
military purposes and that Japan will also take the country's 
arms exports into account when assessing the amount of aid, the 
sources said. 
  Last week China announced an increase of some 22.4 percent 
over 1993 in its defense budget to 52.04 billion yuan (about 653 
billion yen), up from last year's 42.5 billion yuan (about 533 
billion yen).

<F P=106> ["News focus" by Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- When Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa meets Chinese leaders during his trip this 
weekend, he is expected to speak more frankly on the human 
rights issue than his Japanese predecessors, though in softer 
tones than U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who 
visited China earlier this month. 
  "We are very much interested in the question" of China's 
human rights, Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said, 
confirming that the issue will be on the agenda in Hosokawa's 
meetings with President and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin 
and Premier Li Peng between March 19 and 21. 
  "We are in a position to offer the Chinese Government 
friendly advice" on the human rights problems, the spokesman 
said. 
  He did not elaborate on what this "advice" would be, but 
government sources have suggested Japan is likely to call on 
Beijing to urgently tackle the problem "in an internationally 
understandable way," without mentioning specific cases such as 
the recent detainment of prodemocracy activists. 
  Following the intense exchanges on human rights during 
Christopher's trip to Beijing last weekend, the Japanese 
Government is in a quandary over the extent to which Hosokawa 
should refer to the problem. 
  Japan, which has traditionally taken a different approach on 
human rights issues from Western countries, is torn between the 
United States and China. 
  Hosokawa agreed to Christopher's request to bring up the 
human rights issue in his talks with Chinese leaders. 
  Christopher told Japanese leaders last week the U.S. 
considers improvement in the human rights area as an important 
condition to extend most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status to 
Beijing and called for Japanese support in pushing China's 
leadership to improve its human rights records. 
  Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Ronghi told Hosokawa in 
Tokyo last month he does not think it appropriate to link 
China's human rights record to the renewal of MFN status. 
  China's MFN status, which must be extended every year under 
U.S. law, ends in June. Washington has linked further extension 
this year to a "significant overall improvement" in China's 
human rights record. 
  Japan, whose ties with Washington have soured during the 
past 
month over trade disputes, does not want to upset the U.S. 
further in either the political or security arenas -- the other 
two main areas of bilateral relations -- and thus wants to avoid 
seeming too restrained in persuading China on human rights 
improvement. 
  But Japan also does not want to upset Beijing, which insists 
that human rights are an internal affair, by pushing the issue 
too hard lest it damage Sino-Japanese relations. 
  Tadashi Ikeda, the incumbent deputy foreign minister and 
former director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs 
Bureau, explained the nature of Japan's approach on human rights 
in the February issue of "GAIKO FORUM," a monthly magazine on 
diplomacy. 
  Japan considers "confrontational approaches" on human rights 
problems ineffective, and regards an approach which takes 
account of a country's social, economic and political situations 
as more realistic, Ikeda wrote. 
  Since Western countries have themselves developed in those 
areas over a long period, Japan thinks it unrealistic to urge 
developing nations to ensure human rights immediately or put 
pressure on them, he wrote. 
  It was this policy which led Japan to break with its Group 
of 
Seven (G-7) partners and resume official loans to China in 1990 
after the G-7 had announced sanctions against Beijing at the 
Paris summit in July 1989 following the military crackdown on 
the prodemocracy movement at Tiananmen Square the previous month. 
  In August 1991, then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was also 
the first leader among major developed countries to visit China 
since the Tiananmen Square incident. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said the expression Hosokawa is 
to 
use in calling on China to improve its human rights record is 
not yet decided. 
  Hosokawa told his aides he wants to say what he "ought to 
say" concerning the matter, suggesting that he would speak out 
on the issue more frankly than the previous prime ministers from 
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), according to government 
sources. 
  Since assuming the premiership last August, Hosokawa has 
been 
trying to break away from nearly four decades of LDP traditions 
and develop more originality -- in everything from the way he 
gives news conferences to expressing apologies for Japanese 
actions during World War II, which was something of a taboo for 
his predecessors. 
  Using strong expressions or not, Hosokawa will urge China to 
improve its human rights record by suggesting that Beijing could 
better win international support and understanding for its 
economic reform policy if it convinces other nations of its 
desire to improve internal problems, including human rights, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata leaves for Russia on Saturday [19 March] for talks with 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, but no major progress on a long-standing 
bilateral territorial dispute is expected from the meetings. 
  All indications are that Tokyo and Moscow will achieve no 
major breakthrough on the territorial row during Hata's 
three-day visit, since the new Russian parliament is dominated 
by ultrarightists and conservatives opposed to returning the 
four disputed islands in question to Japan. 
  Hata is scheduled to meet Chernomyrdin and Kozyrev on 
Monday. 
  Government sources said Hata is likely to agree to Japanese 
financial and technical assistance for the construction of 
radioactive liquid waste disposal facilities to avert further 
dumping of such waste by Russia into the Sea of Japan. 
  They said the foreign minister, who doubles as deputy prime 
minister, will also strongly press Russia to exert its influence 
over North Korea toward a resolution of the nuclear issue. 
  A meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin is seen as 
unlikely since Hata's visit coincides with Yeltsin's vacation. 
  The sources said Hata will agree to provide Russia with 
additional humanitarian assistance and will convey Japan's 
readiness to help train Russians to acquire a basic knowledge of 
the market economy system and in business management. 
  To that end, Japan plans to establish several "Japan Center" 
facilities in such cities as Moscow, Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. 
In addition, hundreds of young Russian entrepreneurs will be 
invited to Japan. 
  Hata is expected to face calls from the Russian side for the 
Group of Seven major industrialized nations to be expanded to a 
Group of Eight to include Russia.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- Japan is to grant Ecuador 
a total of 1,123 million yen to improve medical services and 
help buy equipment for a national theater, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Tuesday [15 March]. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and his counterpart from 
Ecuador, Diego Paredes Pena, exchanged documents on the 
assistance, which comprises 1,074 million yen for medical 
equipment in major hospitals and 49 million yen in cultural 
grant-in-aid for equipment for the national Sucre theater, the 
officials said. 
  There is a chronic shortage of medical equipment in major 
cities despite an increase in the number of patients, they said. 
  The Ecuadoran Government has a project to beef up medical 
equipment in major hospitals in three cities -- the capital city 
of Quito, Guayaquil and Portoviejo, and had asked Japan to help 
with equipment for surgery, gynecological treatment and for 
intensive care units, they said. 
  The aid will be used to pay for equipment for four of the 
eight hospitals in the three cities, they said. 
  It brings the total amount of Japanese grant-in-aid to 
Ecuador to some 1.6 billion yen, the officials said. 
  Meanwhile, the cultural grant-in-aid will be used to 
purchase 
sound, lighting and audiovisual equipment for the national Sucre 
theater in Quito, which has audiences totaling 40,000 people a 
year, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Ecuador's President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen asked Japan on Wednesday [16 March] to implement a 
lenient rescheduling plan for its foreign debt repayment. 
  Duran-Ballen, speaking to reporters at the Japan National 
Press Club, said Ecuador hopes Japan will allow it to defer 
payment of its debts to Japan totaling 6.9 billion yen as of 
August 1992. 
  He also said Ecuador will not return to the 12-member 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 
  Ecuador, citing dissatisfaction with oil production quotas 
set by OPEC, withdrew from the organization in November 1992. 
  Duran arrived in Japan on Monday on his first leg of a 
two-nation tour. He met Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday. He will leave for 
China on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa denied Wednesday [16 March] being asked by 
disgraced kingpin Shin Kanemaru to convey his message on the 
government fair trade watchdog that he was willing to cooperate 
in toughening antimonopoly law penalties in exchange for not 
filing a criminal complaint in a bid-rigging case. 
  Informed sources said Kanemaru, a former power broker in the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), visited Miyazawa twice between 
December 1991 and January 1992 to call for his support to 
prevent an accusation by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) against 
a 66-member cartel of building contractors in Saitama Prefecture 
over a bid- rigging practice. 
  Kanemaru promised Miyazawa to cooperate with an FTC plan to 
raise the maximum penalty on corporations which violate the 
antimonopoly law, the sources said. 
  At that time Japan was urged by the United States to raise 
penalties against violators of the law during the Structural 
Impediments Initiative talks. 
  The former prime minister summoned then FTC chairman Setsuo 
Umezawa to the prime minister's official residence in February 
1992 and conveyed Kanemaru's message, the sources said. 
  Following the meeting, Umezawa met former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who was arrested last Friday for 
allegedly accepting a 10 million yen bribe from major contractor 
Kajima Corp. in January 1992, the sources said. 
  Kajima was the key member of the cartel. Prosecutors said 
the money was intended as a reward for using his influence to 
help prevent the FTC from filing an accusation against the 
cartel. 
  Nakamura, then deputy chairman of the LDP panel on 
antimonopoly laws, who quit the LDP last Wednesday, reversed his 
initial reluctance to support the penalty hikes. 
  The LDP agreed in March of that year to raise the penalty 
from 5 million yen to 100 million yen. 
  The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an 
accusation with prosecutors against the cartel. 
  Miyazawa said, "The integrity of the FTC must be respected 
and I have respected it." 
  Kanemaru retired from politics in October 1992 and is 
currently on trial on charges of evading more than 1 billion yen 
in taxes.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The No. 2 man of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) urged coalition partners Wednesday 
[16 March] to come closer to its policy on defense and 
peacekeeping issues as a prerequisite to fielding joint 
candidates in the next general election. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told reporters at the 
Japan 
National Press Club, "our party opposes a proposal to develop 
Japan's military capability under the slogan of making Japan a 
normal country." 
  He apparently was alluding to a best-selling book by 
coalition strongman Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito, a core party in the coalition. 
  "It is our goal to make Japan an unarmed country and 
eventually eliminate military forces from the world," said Kubo, 
secretary general of the biggest force in the seven-party 
coalition. 
  In the book "Nihon Retto Kaizo Keikaku" (program to reform 
the Japanese archipelago), Ozawa proposed that Japan expand its 
role in UN peacekeeping operations so that it is perceived 
overseas as a "normal country." 
  "I believe we need to maintain some intra-coalition 
differences on this issue to pursue our goal and live up to the 
spirit of the Constitution," he said, referring to Article 9 of 
the Constitution that bans the use of force to settle 
international disputes. 
  Kubo said the coalition should hammer out a policy 
coordination accord similar to an agreement reached July 29, 
1993 under which they formed an alliance by reconciling policy 
differences on key issues such as foreign, defense and farm 
policies. 
  "At that time, the SDP urged other partners to include 
wording on reform of foreign and defense policies into the text 
of the seven- party accord document. As a result, it adopted a 
phrase that says Japan should assume the responsibility of 
pursuing peace and disarmament," he said. 
  "If the coalition parties want to merge into a new large 
party, we should sketch out a firm policy coordination agreement 
as a vital first step that would enable such joint fielding of 
candidates." 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has argued that unity among 
candidates of the seven coalition parties is crucial to 
defeating the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  A political reform package passed in late January is 
designed 
to introduce 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats chosen 
through proportional representation in elections for the House 
of Representatives.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Leaders of the key 
coalition party Shinseito stepped up efforts Wednesday [16 
March] to form a closer alliance with Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP), officials said. 
  However, new party Sakigake, another member of the 
seven-party coalition, criticized the move as a betrayal of an 
agreement it reached with the JNP eight months earlier to form a 
new party. 
  Hosokawa, who is JNP head, swiftly responded to Sakigake's 
criticism and said he has never talked about such an alliance 
plan with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is 
regarded as the chief coalition strategist. "I have never 
discussed (with Ozawa) a plan to form a large parliamentary 
group," he said. 
  On Tuesday, coalition sources said the JNP and Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) have agreed to form a single parliamentary 
group in the House of Representatives in late April. 
  Kozo Watanabe, Shinseito's deputy secretary general, sought 
to salvage the alliance plan, telling reporters, "We intend to 
aim at forming such a group, although it may not be called an 
agreement." 
  "It is desirable for coalition parties to form a unified new 
party, so we want to strike a merger deal primarily with the 
Japan New Party and Sakigake," he said. 
  Ozawa's close associate Keisuke Nakanishi, who was former 
Defense Agency director general, agreed with the secretary 
general of another coalition party, the Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP), to initiate talks among rank-and-file legislators 
from the two parties with an eye to forming a large 
parliamentary group inside the lower chamber, the officials said. 
  Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at 
a 
disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame 
internal rivalry and agreed to file a joint candidate in each of 
the 300 newly created single-seat constituencies in the lower 
chamber.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The approval rating for the 
cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa remains around 60 
percent, but the ratio of those disapproving grew by 7.5 
percentage points since December, according to a poll published 
Wednesday [16 March] by KYODO news service. 
  Nearly one-third of the respondents expressing disapproval 
of 
the cabinet cited Hosokawa's "lack of leadership" as their 
reason for not believing in the seven-month-old government. 
  The public opinion survey on March 12 and 13 asked 3,000 
eligible voters nationwide for their views and received 
responses from 1,995 people. The results were compared with a 
similar poll conducted in December. 
  The pollsters found that the approval rating for the cabinet 
slipped from 62.8 percent to 61.5 percent. 
  Of the cabinet supporters, 31.9 percent said there is no 
other appropriate person to head the government, while another 
23.9 percent said they trusted the prime minister. 
  Another 17.9 percent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage 
points, said they approved of the cabinet because it was not a 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) cabinet. The LDP was ousted last 
summer by the Hosokawa-led coalition after 38 years as the party 
in power. 
  Meanwhile, the cabinet's disapproval rating grew from 24.4 
percent to 31.9 percent over the last three months. 
  A total of 31 percent of the people disapproving of the 
cabinet saw the prime minister as lacking the ability to lead, 
three times the number in the previous survey. 
  Hosokawa's plan, later withdrawn, of creating a "social 
welfare tax" and his aborted plan to reorganize his cabinet have 
been cited by political pundits as evidence of weak leadership. 
  Instability within the coalition government was cited as a 
reason for nonsupport by 17.6 percent of the people, but that 
was about half the ratio in the previous poll. Still, 16.6 
percent of the discontented respondents do not like the 
cabinet's economic policies. 
  As for the individual political parties, support for the 
opposition LDP was still the largest, but slipped from 27.9 
percent to 25.4 percent. 
  Support for Hosokawa's Japan New Party remained about the 
same at 13.2 percent, while Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
said to be the key force behind the coalition government, was 
supported by 12.1 percent of the respondents. 
  The support rate for new party Sakigake [Harbinger], nearly 
tripled from 2.6 percent to 7.2 percent. 
  Still, 19.4 percent of the respondents said they do not 
support any political party.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry on 
Wednesday [16 March] began compiling a 50-day provisional budget 
for fiscal 1994, which starts next month, with record spending 
of about 11 trillion yen, government sources said. 
  They said the ministry intends to complete and submit the 
provisional budget by March 29. 
  The budget is expected to pass the House of Representatives 
on March 30 and the House of Councillors the following day to 
become law, they said. 
  The Diet is now stalled in its deliberations on the fiscal 
1994 budget package and it seems certain that the measures will 
be passed well beyond the April 1 start of fiscal 1994. 
  The current ordinary Diet session is at an impasse over 
demands by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party for a full 
accounting from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of a 100 
million yen loan he received from a scandal-ridden company. 
  The delay in enacting the budget has dampened hopes of a 
quick economic upturn. The budget focuses on policy spending to 
put the economy on the path of full-fledged recovery. 
  The sources said the provisional budget will incorporate 
labor, operating and other expenses to keep administrative 
machinery functioning as well as social welfare spending and tax 
grants to local governments. 
  Outlays for ongoing public works to be carried over from 
fiscal 1993 will also be included but new policy spending is not 
subject to the bridge budget. 
  This is because the economy will be supported on the fiscal 
side by the recently enacted fiscal 1993 third supplementary 
budget that finances large chunks of a previous 15.25 trillion 
yen stimulus package, the sources said. 
  On the revenue side, they said the ministry is to raise 
funds 
mainly through treasury bills to cover an expected revenue 
shortfall at the onset of the fiscal year when tax revenues are 
normally low. 
  The 50-day provisional period is the second longest in 
post-World War II history, matching that of bridge budgets 
formed in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990. 
  The total amount of about 11 trillion is a rough calculation 
that adds increased labor and other necessary expenses on a 
50-day provisional budget worth 10.2 trillion yen in fiscal 
1990, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The government plans to 
allow firms to set up power companies to sell electricity to 
electric power companies from spring next year, government 
officials said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The Electicity Utility Industry Council, an advisory body to 
the international trade and industry minister, set up a panel 
Wednesday to discuss easing rules and will come up with a 
detailed plan by the end of June. 
  Currently, firms can only sell electric power that has been 
left over at power generators being used in their plants. 
  If firms are allowed to join the wholesale electricity 
market, "the competition should help lower fees for general use 
in the long term," an official at the trade ministry said. 
  Firms that have a certain standard of technology will in 
principle be allowed to freely start the business, instead of 
getting a license from the trade minister as currently required, 
the officials said.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference of President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila--live, italicized passages in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Sir, in all your past foreign 
visits, the thrust was to attract investors to invest in the 
Philippines. In your forthcoming visit to Vietnam, what would 
be the thrust considering that the Vietnamese are not in a 
position to invest here in the Philippines? 
  [Ramos] Why, am I going to Vietnam? [laughter] Anyway, 
seriously speaking, Ellen, in all of our trips, trade promotion 
was just one of the major goals. But the paramount goal in all 
of those trips was the improvement of bilateral relations, and 
that is very important for the Philippines which is in the 
center of Asia and the Pacific rim. And I think we accomplished 
those objectives in 1992 and 1993. 
  Another major mission aside from trade promotion, investment 
promotion, tourism promotion, and improvement of bilateral 
relations is enhancing our regional stability, security, and 
cooperation. And this is where such networks and organizations 
as ASEAN, APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], EAGA [East 
ASEAN Growth Area], and now the newly formed ARF which is the 
ASEAN Regional Forum which includes the dialogue partners of 
ASEAN participating in the discussion now of defense and 
security matters which is unprecedented in the more than 25 
years of the existence of ASEAN, are matters of extreme 
importance to the Philippines. 
  Now, of course, it is always nice if you can bring in 
investments. But in the case of Vietnam, which is the example 
that you are citing, we must make sure that our bilateral issues 
pertaining to the restoration of our very close cooperation and 
goodwill are restored. I think I can safely say that among the 
countries in ASEAN, it was the Philippines that had very close 
relations with the Indo-Chinese states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and 
Laos. And this dates back to the early 50s during the time of 
President Ramon Magsaysay. And that is why the name Filipino in 
Vietnam, for instance, is associated with being number one. You 
ask (Percy Picardo) there who was in Vietnam with me. 
What they said in Vietnam is Filotan number one. 
Filotan means Filipino. And it's not only because of that 
assistance that was given by President Magsaysay, but also the 
initiatives of our socio-civic and veterans organizations. The 
likes of the Freedom Company; the (Instance) Construction; the 
OB, or Operations for Brotherhood, still are highly regarded 
institutions there. So, this is something that we want to renew 
and certainly enhance. 
  Now, another important reason is we are all neighbors, 
claimants in a certain area of the South China Sea, collectively 
now called the Spratlys. I think it is important to pursue 
again the commitments to the peaceful, joint development, and 
exploration of the Spratlys. For your information, among the 
claimants there, it is the Philippines and the Vietnamese that 
are in closest contact. It's just almost as close as from here 
to Makati [Philippines' financial district]; the islands 
that we are occupying are very near. So it's important to 
make sure that the commitments made in the Manila Declaration of 
July 1992, which was the foreign ministerial meeting that we 
hosted at that time and in which the dialogue partners also made 
similar commitments, be strengthened by these visits. 
  You should also realize that we have hosted tens of 
thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Vietnamese refugees 
-- the so-called boat people -- in Palawan, in Morong, 
Paranaque, and other places. And again, there must be some kind 
of a dialogue that should take place as to the future of these 
Vietnamese nationals. 
  There is the matter also of complimentation of our products 
and raw materials. While generally it is true that we have a 
similar kind of economy with Vietnam, similar products, and 
agricultural and mineral resources, there is complimentation 
that could take place, meaning cooperation to the mutual benefit 
of both. Inasmuch as right now we are at a higher developmental 
stage, if you are looking at the entire spectrum of human 
skills, education, health and medical services, management, 
banking, and financial services, as well as infrastructure for 
transportation, communications, etcetera. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Sir, the Thai foreign minister when he was 
here about a week ago, mentioned about the possibility of 
getting together the leaders of ASEAN and the Indo-Chinese 
states? 
  [Ramos] Minister Prasong? 
  [Correspondent] Yes, Sir. 
  [Ramos] Well, as you may recall, I said that already in my 
speech last May, in the PBEC -- Pacific Basin Economic Council 
in Seoul -- which was hosted by Korea. Prime Minister Mahathir 
and I in fact spoke from the same platform on the same morning, 
and that was the thrust of my message. The CAN concept -- 
C-A-N, Community of Asian Nations -- was officially proposed by 
me. And this one is a follow-up of that, this one of Foreign 
Minister Prasong. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, will this not be a block within, say, 
APEC? 
  [Ramos] I'll just give you a copy of that speech last May 
because it's all described there. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, thank you. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has 
intensified its campaign to protect intellectual property rights 
[IPR]. Earlier today, DTI filed counterfeiting charges against 
two clothing retail outlets of Walt Disney products that have no 
authorization from the legitimate copyright owners. DTI 
Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez headed the raiding team which 
filed the charge sheets against the two outlets in Shoppesville 
Complex in Greenhills, San Juan. 
  Those charged will face a fine of up to P150,000 [Philippine 
pesos] or cancellation of permit and other penalties. Ordonez 
assured that DTI is following a more speedy procedure in filing 
charges. 
  [Begin recording] [Ordonez in progress] ...because what I 
have here [displaying child's clothing] is Walt Disney, but this 
is fake -- counterfeit. This is not right, okay? We need not 
go to the police, go to the court, go to the judge, and go to 
the mayor. No need. As long as there is a consumer that comes 
to us and has the receipt and brings something like this, the 
consumer can make a complaint at our office. Within three to 
five days, the violators were arrested. That was what happened. 
  This one, I was the one who personally bought it. So, they 
can not fool us anymore. Aside from this, even if I did not buy 
this one, if there is a complaint, and there is a receipt and 
the product is presented, they will be caught. 
  [Disney representative, in English] I'm very glad that DTI 
has decided to take corrective action on counterfeiting in the 
Philippines because it is really a big problem here. We have 
local manufacturers paying taxes to the government, and they are 
badly affected by the counterfeits. Now, stopping counterfeits 
from retailers will really help solve the problem. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [By Malou L. Sayson] </F>
  [Text] Southern Mindanao is fast shedding off its image as 
the country's traditional economic backdoor and in no time will 
emerge as the new growth area in the east of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The reason for this change is 
its abundant agriculture and natural resources which have 
continued luring unprecedented investments since the early 
1990's. Southern Mindanao's passport to a grandiose 
transformation is its so-called SOCSARGEN (South Cotabato, 
Sarangani, General Santos City) growth corridor, dubbed as the 
"agricultural paradise" of the south. 
  Agriculture Secretary Roberto S. Sebastian said the 
diversified agricultural potential highlighted by the vast and 
rich fishing grounds of the Celebes and Solomon seas could 
easily make the area the main gateway to East ASEAN markets. 
  The growth trend has emerged in the early 1990's when 
investments jumped 800 million to around one billion pesos at 
present. New firms have also been noted to have mushroomed. 
Sebastian said there are about 200 big local and foreign 
investors who have confirmed investing in SOCSARGEN. 
  Malaysia is one of the leading investors in the area as 
signalled by the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir bin Mohamed. Sebastian said a Philippine trade mission 
is set to visit Malaysia to discuss agriculture complementation 
between the two countries, especially in the aspect of fishing. 
  A world-class fishport, 20 minutes away from Polomoloc, 
South 
Cotabato, is just a part of the infrastructure investments of 
over $200 million committed by the governments of the 
Philippines, the United States and Japan. Sebastian said the 
fishport complex, designed to cover a one-kilometer shoreline 
with a projected daily capacity of 1,000 metric tons of fish 
catch, could make SOCSARGEN competitive with Thailand's port. He 
said fish processing activities are concentrated in Thailand; 
but once the fishport complex is established, the country can 
capture part of the fish market. This is due to SOCSARGEN's 
proximity to the rich fishing grounds of the Solomon and Celebes 
seas located east of the country. 
  Just by cutting the transit time is enough to lure 
commercial 
fishing vessels to land their catch in Southern Mindanao instead 
of Thailand, Sebastian added. Commercial fishing firms operating 
in General Santos City are leading participants in this 
lucrative regional fishing market. There are 34 commercial 
deep-sea fishing firms with a combined fleet of over 600 
commercial fishing vessels' based in the city, making it the 
second port next to Navotas in fish landings and the leading 
port for tuna. The five fish canning plants producing as much as 
$30.8 million worth of products are also projected to increase 
production with the building of the fishport complex. 
  Sebastian said by 1996, the $30-million Japanese-financed 
fish port will be completed to consist of a 300 meter wharf for 
2,000 gross ton reefer carriers, a 750 meter landing quay and a 
cold storage for 1,500 metric tons of large tuna. The port has 
also the capability to accommodate a 60-ton ice plant, brine 
airblast and contact freezers and some 4,500 square meters of 
fish market stalls. 
  SOCSARGEN's great marine wealth is completed by high 
agricultural productivity contributed by the unrivaled soil 
fertility of the Allah and Koronadal valleys. He said the area 
produces 40 percent of the country's pineapples, 23 percent of 
its corn, 75 percent of its cotton, and eight percent of its 
coconuts. 
  SOCSARGEN is also a major production area for countries area 
for cut flowers, prawns, bananas, asparagus, seed corn and a 
leading production site for hogs, livestock and feedgrains.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 16 (KCNA) -- The seventh 
working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys 
between the North and the South was held behind closed doors at 
the Tongil House in the northern portion of Panmunjom today. 
  At the end of the contact the head of the North side's 
delegation briefed home and foreign reporters on the contact 
here. 
  According to him, the North side at the contact urged the 
South side to accept the reasonable proposal it had made at the 
sixth contact, a proposal to announce in a joint communique that 
the sides confirmed again each other's will for the exchange of 
special envoys and agreed on their early exchange. At today's 
contact it also proposed to the South side to clinch the 
discussion of working procedures on the basis of the 
North-tabled "Agreement on the Exchange of Presidential Envoys 
Between the North and the South" and sign the agreement. 
  The South side, however, repeated trite words this time, 
too. 
It categorically objected to the North side's proposal of 
publishing a joint communique and to its suggestion that the 
questions of observing the principle of national independence, 
deciding on the way of national reunification and of promoting 
the great unity of the whole nation be stipulated in the draft 
agreement with regard to the mission of special envoys. 
  Drawing attention to the fact that the South side's 
"minister 
of the unification board" yesterday officially predicted that 
Wednesday's working-level contact would end in failure, the 
North side said this remark itself showed a very dangerous 
position. 
  Much upset, the South side tried to parry it with the 
subterfuge that reporters gave a wrong account of what the 
"minister of the unification board" said. 
  The process of the contact today clearly showed that the 
South side was taking a stand to put the brakes on the third 
round of DPRK-USA talks by deliberately creating difficulties in 
the way of discussion of working matters for the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  It was agreed to have the next, 8th working contact in the 
Southern portion of Panmunjom on March 19.

  [Text] The seventh working-level delegates contact for the 
exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South was 
held on 16 March behind closed doors at Tongilgak in our side's 
area of Panmunjom. 
  After the end of the contact, our side's head delegate 
briefed domestic and foreign reporters on the contact on the 
spot. 
  In the contact, our side first of all talked about the 
justness of our broad-minded measure and proposal on announcing 
a joint communique at the sixth working-level delegates contact, 
and pointed out as follows on the South side's unreasonable 
position on rejecting the demand to announce the joint 
communique. 
  As already known, at the sixth working-level delegates 
contact, from the position to realize as soon as possible the 
exchange of special envoys of the North and South in whatever 
way and amid a good atmosphere, our side took a broad-minded and 
epoch-making measure by paying attention to the South side's 
expression on several occasions that it (?understands) the 
validity regarding the four just demands which we already put 
forth, even though it is insufficient. 
  Thus, a firm prospect was opened between the North and South 
for the exchange of special envoys. Henceforth, at the last 
contact our side put forth a constructive proposal to announce 
at home and abroad a joint communique that both sides 
reconfirmed the intention to exchange special envoys, and agreed 
to realize the exchange of special envoys as soon as possible. 
  Nevertheless, at that time, rather than showing a positive 
response to our sincere proposal, the South side assumed a 
self-complacent [toksonjogin] attitude and persistently opposed 
our proposal. Therefore, in today's contact, our side insisted 
that the South side return to the position of reconciliation and 
unity to accept our side's just proposal to announce the joint 
communique, tie the knot [maedup chitgo] on the discussion of 
the working procedures based on the agreement on the exchange of 
top-level special envoys of the North and South, which we put 
forth, and sign the agreement. 
  However, the South side again objected to our side's 
proposal repeating trite [kutae uiyonhan] words. Without any 
reason, the South side objected to our side's proposal to issue 
a joint communique stating that the two sides reconfirmed their 
will to exchange special envoys and decided to exchange special 
envoys at an earliest date, and to our suggestion that the 
questions of observing the principle of national independence, 
finalizing the method of national reunification, and of seeking 
after the great unity of the whole nation be stipulated in the 
draft agreement regarding the mission of the special envoys. 
  In connection with the South side's insincere attitude, our 
side expressed deep regret and disappointment, urged that if the 
South side has no intention to exchange special envoys or if it 
wants to give up it should say so, and strongly demanded a clear 
attitude without no further delay. 
  Drawing attention to the fact that the South side's minister 
of the National Unification Board [NUB] yesterday said that the 
working-level contact would end in failure, our side also 
pointed out that this remark itself shows a very dangerous 
position. Our side stressed that this is why we became more 
suspicious [uisim] over the South side's position on the special 
envoy exchange, and demanded the South side to show its clear 
attitude. 
  The South side avoided answering our side's reasonable 
assertion [sarijongyonhan chujang] and demands which are based 
on principle. 
  After the opening remarks, the two sides began discussions 
on 
the working procedures. Here, our side again refuted the fact 
that the South side is not accepting our side's just demand 
regarding the mission of special envoys. Asserting that 
independence is the life of the nation, our side questioned why 
the South side insists on objecting to defining the question of 
observing the principle of national independence as one of the 
missions of the special envoys, while the South side is far off 
the track [molli talsonhae innunde] of keeping an independent 
position. 
  Our side also questioned why the South side is afraid of 
the great unity of the nation and why it objects to this while 
it is necessary to seek after the great unity of the whole 
nation in order to achieve the nation's reunification, and 
demanded to define the missions of the special envoys in 
accordance with the nation's interest and the reality of 
North-South relations. 
  However, the South side arbitrarily [topo notko] took an 
attitude to object to this again without being able to give an 
acceptable reason. 
  Our side questioned why the South side asks [chongtak] the 
outside force to make the exchange of special envoys of the 
North and the South a precondition for the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks and why it uses the issue of the exchange of 
special envoys as a means to put a brake on and interfere with 
the DPRK-U.S. talks--shouldn't the South side live on its own 
decision in its right mind by now?--and urged it to answer the 
questions. 
  The South side kept avoiding answering the questions and 
insisted on working out the working procedures only in 
conformity with its proposal. 
  Our side pointed out that the South side's attitude in 
today's contact well proves that the hasty remark made by the 
South side's NUB minister that the working-level delegates 
contact will result in a failure is by no means a coincidence 
under the condition that it did not show sincerity in our 
broadminded and tolerant [taebomhagodo aryangitnun] position. 
Our side once again insisted that so as not to give any more 
disappointment to the nation, we should announce the fact in the 
form of a joint communique that both sides agreed to exchange 
special envoys as soon as possible, which is to give happiness 
to the nation. 
  Nevertheless, the South side made excuses regarding the 
remark by its side's NUB minister as a false report by 
reporters. It rejected to the end our proposal to announce a 
joint communique. 
  It was clearly proven in the process of the contact that if 
our side's position is to realize as soon as possible the 
exchange of special envoys in accordance with the nation's 
desire, the South side's position is to put the brakes on the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks by creating an artificial barrier 
in the discussion of the working procedures for the exchange of 
special envoys. 
  It was agreed that the eighth working-level delegates 
contact 
will be held on 19 March in the South side area of Panmunjom.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Dienemann: "Khmer Rouge Capitalists"] </F>
  [Text] Officially, they should have been bankrupt a long 
time ago. Since the Paris peace agreement on Cambodia, China 
and some Western countries have withdrawn all support from the 
Khmer Rouge [KR]. However, the communist guerrillas are 
continuing their war against the elected government in Phnom 
Penh. 
  The Khmer Rouge actually possesses millions of dollars and 
an 
arms arsenal that, in the opinion of Western intelligence 
services, "is more than enough for another five years of 
fighting." The Marxists, who tried to turn the country into a 
peasant state under their terror regime from 1975 to the end of 
1978, have become capitalists. 
  "The Khmer Rouge are plundering our country's natural 
resources in order to be able to continue their war," Phnom 
Penh's Information Minister Ieng Muli complained to FOCUS. 
Their main source of income is from the exploitation of 
precious stones in Pailin. The city, about 40 km from the Thai 
border, is in the fourth of the country controlled by the Khmer 
Rouge. "The Khmer Rouge's monthly income from granting licenses 
for the exploitation of sapphires and rubies is about $10 
million a month," Muli stated. 
  Cambodian Government troops are planning a major attack on 
Pailin. This strategic base should be conquered by the end of 
the dry season in June, a high-ranking officer in Phnom Penh 
predicts. Against the background of the continuing guerrilla 
warfare, Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk has called for 
reconciliation between the Khmer Rouge and the government. If 
the fighting is not brought to an end, it will mean "the death 
of Cambodia." 
  The Marxists earn another $2 million a month with wood. The 
illegally felled timber, mainly fine wood from the north of 
Cambodia, crosses the border to Thailand on secret paths. 
Japanese firms have built sawmills in the land of the Khmer. 
  The business is hard to prevent on the Thai side. 
High-ranking army officers have shares in the companies. If 
vigorous action is taken against them, Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai can expect a new putsch.

<F P=106> [By Usani Mongkhonpon] </F>
  [Text] Now is not a good time for Thailand to resume 
negotiations on aviation rights with the United States because 
the existing temporary agreement is efficient and fair to both 
countries, an aviation industry source said. But Permanent 
Secretary for Transport and Communications Mahidon 
Chantharangkun confirmed, "We'd better talk to them." 
  A Thai delegation headed by Mahidon will go to Washington 
April 5-6 following a US invitation. The United States wants 
Thailand to adopt its "Open Skies" policy allowing for 
unrestricted cargo and passenger capacity on a mutual basis. 
Mahidon said the Thai delegation is unlikely to go along with 
the US Open Skies idea but stand firm in defending this 
country's interests first. 
  The industry source said Thailand is now in an advantageous 
position vis-a-vis the United States since there is now no 
permanent agreement obliging this country to make any 
concessions. The latter has tried to help its airlines gain 
more access to the growing Asian markets. Thailand would be at a 
disadvantage in an openly competitive competitive [as published] 
situation. Thai Airways International is the only large 
international carrier based here and it does not have the 
capability to fight with the four strong US airlines flying 
here, including United, Delta, Northwest and Federal Express. 
  The United States successfully concluded open-skies 
agreements with the Netherlands for an unlimited time frame and 
with Germany for a four-year term. Negotiations with the United 
Kingdom are now under way. He emphasized however that it is time 
for the two countries to resume talks, four years having passed 
since the cancellation of the last aviation pact. "How could 
people be angry for four years? We should have a little bit of 
talking. If the negotiations show no sign of accomplishment, we 
will just quit," Mahidon said. 
  The United States on March 11 informed Thailand that it 
wants 
to see three main topics discussed, including Thai restrictions 
on seat sales by Delta and United Airlines, possible capacity 
limitations by Thai and US carriers and more flexibility for 
cargo carriers. 
  Asked if the US might impose sanctions under the US 
301-trade 
law on Thailand for not consenting to its demands, Mahidon said 
that he believes the US would not, without however giving a 
reason. "It depends on who is leading the negotiations," he 
added. 
  A source in the Aviation Department pointed out that the US 
has already softened its stance on Thai Airways International's 
operation in the US market in the hopes of Thailand easing its 
resistance. 
  Another temporary agreement between the two countries, valid 
from Mar 7 to Sept 1 was just completed.

<F P=106> [Editorial from 16 March NHAN DAN: "Vietnamese-Thai </F>
Relations of Friendship and Cooperation Are Developing"] 
  [Text] Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's official 
friendship visit to Vietnam today follows the recent visit to 
our country by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. It is 
significant that the prime ministers of two ASEAN countries are 
paying official visits to Vietnam in a short period of time. 
This is yet another manifestation of the common aspirations of 
Vietnam and other friendly countries to accelerate bilateral 
relations and promote cooperation in the region in accordance 
with the trend of peace, stability, and development in Southeast 
Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Thailand, a beautiful country with a long traditional 
culture, is enjoying rapid economic growth. Over the past 
several years, the government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
has led the Thai people in overcoming numerous difficulties, 
stabilizing the political situation, and accelerating economic 
reform. In 1993, Thailand attained a GDP increase of 7.7 
percent and was ranked among the countries of the world with a 
rapid developmental pace. Its industrial production increased by 
10 percent; agriculture by 2.3 percent; exports by 12.8 percent; 
tourism by 13 percent; investment in the government sector by 54 
percent; and investment in the private sector by 85.7 percent. 
Its foreign currency reserves reached $25 billion, and it was 
ranked among the 10 countries in the world with the highest 
foreign currency reserves. Thailand's per capita income is 
$1,660. Given this development pace, Thailand's economy will 
certainly grow by 8.3 percent this year. 
  Vietnam and Thailand are two close neighbors with 
longstanding cultural ties. The two countries established 
diplomatic relations in 1976. In recent years, relations 
between the two countries have developed favorably, especially 
in the economic and cultural domains. Various bilateral 
agreements have been signed in the fields of trade, economic and 
scientific-technological cooperation, aviation services, and 
promotion and insurance of investments. The two countries have 
established joint committee for economic cooperation and have 
reached an agreement on avoiding double taxation. These 
bilateral agreements are being effectively implemented, thus 
creating a good basis for achieving high results in economic and 
trade cooperation between the two countries. The value of 
two-way trade in 1993 increased by $200 million, compared to $12 
million in 1988. 
  Today, Thailand has 43 investment projects in Vietnam with a 
total capital of $149 million -- third among the ASEAN 
countries. The Thai Government has also helped Vietnam with the 
purchase of essential equipment and in education and training. 
  The Vietnamese people would like to thank the Thai 
Government 
and people for their high appraisal of Vietnam's achievements in 
the renovation undertaking, their special attention to 
accelerating relations of friendship and cooperation with 
Vietnam, and their readiness to share with Vietnam their 
experiences in national development. 
  Through recent visits and meetings between Vietnamese and 
Thai leaders, the two countries have expressed a common desire 
to resolve various outstanding problems and create an atmosphere 
of peace and stability in the region, thereby creating favorable 
conditions for multifaceted cooperation between the two nations. 
Thailand encourages and supports Vietnam to participate in 
various ASEAN development programs and join the organization, so 
as to contribute to restoring peace, stability, and development 
in the region. 
  During his official visit to Thailand in October 1993, party 
General Secretary Do Muoi expressed an earnest wish to see 
Vietnam and Thailand further expand their multifaceted 
cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect, 
noninterference to each other's internal affairs, equality, 
mutual interest, and good neighborliness.

  [Text] Washington, March 15 KYODO -- Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa is likely to 
reschedule a canceled visit to the United States, Japanese 
Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama said Tuesday. 
  "His visit to the U.S. for a lecture meeting has been 
canceled, but I think he will eventually be able to make the 
trip," Kuriyama said at a press conference. 
  Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was 
expected 
to travel to Washington next week ostensibly to deliver a speech 
at the National Press Club. 
  He was also expected to act as a trouble-shooting envoy for 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in a bid to mend bilateral ties 
frayed by the breakdown of trade talks last month. 
  Ozawa told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that it would be 
difficult to make the trip because he has not made any 
preparations. 
  He said he would consider making the visit after the intense 
media speculation over the trip dies down. 
  In Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor said he would like to meet Ozawa if he receives such a 
request. 
  Kantor reportedly told lawmakers that the U.S.-Japan 
economic 
relationship "is in serious disrepair," but on reports of an 
imminent trade war, said "this is not going to happen."

  [Text] Beijing, March 17 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Beijing this weekend comes just one 
week after China's bashing of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  The visit, set to begin Saturday [19 March] and end Monday, 
is the first by Hosokawa as Japan's prime minister and is 
expected to set the tone for a new triangular balance between 
the two economic superpowers and China's emerging market. 
  Political analysts in Beijing believe that after the verbal 
thrashing that Christopher took, the Chinese leadership will 
most likely greet Hosokawa with open arms. 
  Hosokawa's busy but relaxed agenda, which will take him to a 
Beijing subway station and a free market, attests to the cordial 
atmosphere that is expected to surround the trip. He is also 
scheduled to have meetings with President Jiang Zemin, Premier 
Li Peng and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. 
  Japanese-Chinese economic relations have made giant strides 
over the last two years with bilateral trade hitting an all-time 
high of about 38 billion dollars in 1993. 
  Japanese economic clout will be needed more than ever if the 
U.S. Administration of President Bill Clinton decides to pull 
the plug on China's most-favored-nation trading status. 
  China, of course, needs all the help it can get if its 
transformation from a centralized economy, burdened by a huge 
inefficient state sector, to an economy capable of responding to 
market forces is to be successful. 
  Hosokawa, however, is relatively unknown to a Chinese 
leadership that views him only as a transitional leader and 
which longs for the pandering meted out by the Liberal 
Democratic Party to continue. 
  For Hosokawa, the trip should offer a good opportunity to be 
firm with the Chinese leadership and to seek to use the trip in 
any way possible to shore up his domestic image, analysts said. 
Although he is expected to continue his policy of apologizing 
for Japanese war crimes, reports have also said he will push the 
Chinese on human rights issues and environmental protection. 
  Hosokawa is also expected to seek a sound explanation for 
the 
22 percent increase in China's military expenditures announced 
last Friday at the ongoing National People's Congress, China's 
legislature. He will push the Chinese to play a bigger role in 
helping solve international disputes stemming from North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development program, while calling for China 
to ban the testing of nuclear weapons. 
  After two days in Beijing, the prime minister will visit 
Shanghai on Monday and tour the Pudong development area before 
returning to Japan later in the day.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Japan voiced concern 
Thursday [17 March] over North Korea's reported obstruction of 
international inspections at one of its nuclear facilities. "We 
can't but feel concerned that North Korea did not fully and 
sincerely uphold its agreement with the IAEA (International 
Atomic Energy Agency) and that diversion of nuclear material for 
military purposes could not be verified," Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata told a press conference. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also said during 
an earlier press conference that Japan is "deeply concerned." 
  The IAEA said Wednesday Pyongyang obstructed checks at a key 
nuclear facility and that the agency would hold a special 
meeting of its board of governors next Monday, as the 
long-standing nuclear controversy with North Korea soared to new 
heights. 
  The Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog said North 
Korea barred a team of its inspectors from carrying out 
"important measures" at a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon 
which the IAEA regards as a nuclear reprocessing plant. 
  The United States also said a third round of talks with 
North 
Korea, scheduled for next Monday in Geneva, would be postponed 
due to North Korea's refusal to cooperate. 
  Hata and Takemura both cited the necessity of renewed calls 
to North Korea to completely accept international inspections of 
all its facilities. Hata said the problem of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear program would naturally be discussed when 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits China from Saturday to 
Monday. 
  Government officials have said Hosokawa is expected to call 
for China's continued role in persuading Pyongyang to accept 
full inspections to sweep away international concern over its 
alleged nuclear program. 
  Hata said Japan wants to seek a solution to the problem 
through negotiations. He declined to say what the Japanese 
Government would do if the IAEA meeting adopted a resolution 
referring the matter to the United Nations Security Council, 
saying it is too early to comment. 
  If the IAEA meeting declares North Korea in breach of 
nuclear 
safeguard accords, the matter would be referred to the U.N. 
Security Council, which might impose economic sanctions on 
Pyongyang. 
  A South Korean Foreign Ministry official said Thursday that 
the nuclear watchdog is likely to demand that North Korea grant 
complete inspections of its radiochemical laboratory instead of 
opting for sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The South Korean 
shipbuilding industry has not agreed to exercise self-restraint 
in stepping up their shipbuilding capacity in talks held between 
industry leaders of Japan, South Korea and Europe, a Japanese 
industry leader said Wednesday [16 March]. "The three sides 
could not reach an agreement," said Shigeru Goda, chairman of 
the Shipbuilders Association of Japan, at a regular press 
conference. 
  Japan and Europe have been asking South Korea to voluntarily 
reduce its shipbuilding capacity which has strengthened 
noticeably this year since the abolition in late 1993 of a South 
Korean law restricting the growth of shipbuilding capacity. The 
South Korean shipbuilding industry has become even more 
conspicuous as the competitiveness of Japanese shipbuilders has 
declined with the appreciation of the Japanese currency. 
  Goda said that during the Japan-South Korea, and Japan-South 
Korea-Europe talks held from March 12 to 14, Japanese and 
European officials said the global shipbuilding industry would 
be able to meet future demand at the current level of 
shipbuilding capacity. They pointed to the danger of excess 
shipbuilding capacity leading to lower prices and an eventual 
slump in the industry, Goda said. 
  South Korea responded that their government is pursuing a 
policy of easing restrictions, and that they have no intention 
of extending their share of the market by cheaper prices, Goda 
said. 
  In 1993, South Korea surpassed Japan to become the world's 
largest shipbuilder, with orders totaling 9.52 million tons.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Japan will loan Peru up to 
2.24 billion yen to cooperate in its project to beef up its 
public welfare services, Foreign Ministry officials said 
Wednesday [16 March]. Japanese Parliamentary Vice Foreign 
Minister Syozo Azuma and Peruvian Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Efrain Gordenberg Schreiber exchanged documents on the 
Japanese loan in Lima. 
  Azuma told Gordenberg the Japanese Government will provide 
emergency relief materials worth 19 million yen to help the 
victims of heavy rains, which have killed more than 71 people in 
Peru. The loan, to be extended in coordination with the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), will be used for Peru's 
program to improve and modernize the basic equipment in public 
medical organizations which offer medical services to people on 
low incomes, the officials said. 
  Because of the lack of basic medical equipment and funds, 
there are insufficient medical services for such people in Peru, 
and epidemics such as cholera and malaria are common in the 
country. 
  The 30-year loan, with a 10-year grace period, carries an 
annual interest rate of 3 percent. It brings the total amount 
of Japanese loans extended to the Latin American nation to 
153.87 billion yen, the officials said. 
  The emergency relief materials from Japan include blankets, 
tents and medical goods, they said. 
  According to the officials, heavy rains have been falling on 
the mountainous regions of Peru since mid-January. As of March 
1, the subsequent floods and landslides had killed 71 people and 
affected another 70,000. 
  The officials said the Peruvian Government has requested 
emergency relief goods from Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The Agriculture Ministry 
will have no domestic-produced rice in stock at the end of the 
1993-94 rice year in October because of the worst postwar 
harvest last year, ministry sources said Wednesday [16 March]. 
Japan may be forced to import rice for the second straight year 
in 1995 if the 1994 domestic harvest is also affected by bad 
weather. 
  According to the outline of an annual production-supply plan 
to be formulated at the end of March, the ministry will have no 
rice left in stock to carry over to the new rice year. "Such a 
situation is unavoidable after last year's extremely poor 
harvest," a ministry official said. 
  The plan calls for the ministry to ease the rice production 
adjustment this year to ensure a government stock of 660,000 
tons at the end of October 1995. The program will have to be 
overhauled if rice production is poor again this year. 
  A rice production target of 10.58 million tons was set for 
1994, an increase of 320,000 tons over the previous year's 
original target. To achieve this goal, rice acreage reduction 
this year will be limited to 600,000 hectares rather than the 
676,000 hectares originally planned, and additional 32,000 
hectares of land will be restored to production to bring the 
total restored acreage for rice production to 108,000 hectares. 
  The ministry estimates domestic rice demand of 9.92 million 
tons for the year ending October 1995, down from the preceding 
year by approximately 30,000 to 130,000 tons. 
  Japan will also import an estimated 379,000 tons of rice in 
1995 in accordance with an agreement reached under the Uruguay 
Round of world trade talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata apologized Thursday for confusion 
over the supply of rice and assured consumers that there will 
not be any serious shortage. 
  Speaking before the House of Councillors' Committee on 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Hata said there will not be 
any "quantitative problem" because the government has secured 
rice to meet needs until August. Hata was replying to a 
question by an opposition lawmaker about the mounting public 
outrage as Japanese rice has disappeared from store shelves and 
many consumers shun imported rice. 
  Hata said a total of three million tons of rice is needed 
for 
consumption until August and the need will be fulfilled by some 
1.2 million tons of domestically grown rice left in stock, 1.7 
million tons in imports and 100,000 tons of early crop rice from 
this year's harvest. The government will step up efforts to 
import more rice, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Japan's largest trade 
union confederation said Thursday [17 March] it will set up a 
consultative forum in early June to discuss policies with and 
support the ruling coalition. 
  Akira Yamagishi, president of the eight-million strong 
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), told a meeting of 
Rengo's central committee that the forum "is intended to back 
the ruling coalition and to develop and establish a political 
system for changes of governments." He said the forum "will 
study designs for a broader spectrum of policies." 
  Yamagishi said Rengo will set up a preparatory panel in 
early 
April as a prelude to founding the forum. 
  On Rengo's support for political parties, Yamagishi said the 
confederation will not only cooperate with the Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party 
(DSP) and the Democratic Reform Party (DRP), a political arm of 
Rengo, but also other parties. 
  Rengo, founded in November 1989, has backed the governing 
coalition since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took power last 
August. 
  Yamagishi has envisioned a future reorganization of Japanese 
politics with three main political forces -- the conservative 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), new conservative forces, and 
liberals. He has reiterated Rengo will back the liberals 
comprising the SDPJ, the DSP, the DRP, new party Sakigake, the 
Japan New Party and the more liberal elements of the LDP after 
the political reorganization. 
  Yamagishi indicated at the committee meeting that Rengo will 
shape its own tax reform plan and submit it to the government. 
The governing coalition has set up a panel to conclude ways of 
financing tax cuts of some 6 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 
state budget by the end of the current 150-day ordinary Diet 
session that began January 31.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) has ordered 15 paint manufacturers to pay 470 million yen 
in fines for operating an unauthorized cartel, FTC officials 
said Wednesday [16 March]. Among the firms fined by the FTC, 
Atom Chemical Paint Co. was ordered to pay 87 million yen, 
Hitachi Chemical Co. 70 million yen and Sekisui Jushi Corp. 51 
million yen. 
  According to the FTC, the companies concluded an 
unauthorized 
cartel in October 1990 that served as a front for bid-rigging 
activities and manipulated the price of paint until December 
1991. In December 1992, the FTC ordered the firms to stop the 
unfair practice.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) ordered 29 aerial survey contractors to pay penalties 
totaling 790 million yen for bid-rigging practices that it says 
violated the Antimonopoly Law, commission officials said 
Thursday [17 March]. The companies include such leading firms 
as Pasco Corp., Asia Air Survey Co. and Kokusai Kogyo Co. 
  Pasco and Asia Air Survey Co. were each told to pay 200 
million yen, the highest penalty ever brought against a private 
company for bid-rigging in relation to public works projects. 
  The total of fines also marks the third highest sought by 
the 
FTC in such cases. The highest penalties in a bid-rigging case 
totaled some 1 billion yen against contractors in Saitama 
Prefecture, near Tokyo, in 1992. 
  The FTC said the aerial survey companies, through one 
Tokyo-based land measurement association, continued prearranged 
biddings from around 1984 for map production orders placed by 
the Construction Ministry's Geographical Survey Institute. 
  The firms also arranged illegal bidding for tenders held by 
the government and municipal governments for aerial photographic 
surveys from 1988 to 1992. They reportedly set up intercompany 
cooperative bodies in several regions to fix successful bidders 
and contract prices beforehand, the commission said. 
  In February 1993, the FTC ordered the contractors and 
association to end bid-rigging practices.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A top-ranking Trade 
Ministry official on Thursday [17 March] called for the ruling 
coalition to reach a consensus on comprehensive tax reforms by 
the end of May. In view of administrative and other technical 
works to be required, agreement around late June, as widely 
sought, is too late, said the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry ministry official, who requested anonymity. 
  A forum set up by the seven-party coalition is working on 
tax 
reforms, including multiyear tax cuts designed to spur domestic 
demand, to show Japan's commitment to the plan at the Naples 
summit of the seven industrialized countries in early July. 
  The official said he has no knowledge on whether Ichiro 
Ozawa, a coalition key figure, will fly to Washington shortly in 
search of a breakthrough in the trade framework talks. 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, is said to have a 
considerable clout in the government of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and is believed to have played a major role in last 
week's settlement of the cellular phone trade dispute between 
Tokyo and Washington. It is not desirable for men such as 
Ozawa, who is not the leader of Japan, to play a part in getting 
the stalled talks moving again, the MITI official said.

<F P=106> ["Statement of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman of </F>
the Kingdom of Cambodia to his compatriots concerning rights and 
freedom of the press;" dated 14 March -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Beijing General Hospital, 14 March 1994 
  Beloved compatriots: I have the honor to inform my beloved 
compatriots the following: 
  1. Several Cambodian and foreign newspapers have become very 
worried and disappointed with what they call the desire of our 
Cambodian Royal Government [RCG] and National Assembly to issue 
a law to restrict the rights and freedom of the press, 
particularly the foreign press. 
  2. I do hope that the beloved RCG and National Assembly of 
Cambodia will continue allowing all Cambodian and foreign 
newspapers to enjoy full rights and freedoms and provide all 
facilities for those journalists to carry out their work 
conveniently. 
  I believe that we need not arrange any regulations nor draft 
any laws for the Cambodian and foreign press. 
  During the 1991-92 period, in my capacity as the chairman of 
the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, I promised, on behalf 
of the new Cambodia, to all journalists that Cambodia, which 
desired to pursue a modern liberal democratic system, would 
allow all newspapers to enjoy every right and freedom this 
system permits. In the event that a newspaper article presents 
groundless information that affects our interests, we should 
have the right and duty to ask that newspaper to issue a 
responsible correction. 
  3. I do understand that the king reigns but does not control 
state power. Therefore, I would like the beloved RCG and 
National Assembly to freely make their own decision on this 
matter as well as on other issues. 
  I have said this only in view of the interests of our 
Kingdom 
of Cambodia which desires to gain prestige as a champion of 
press freedom. Nevertheless, we do not have to strive to 
overcome any journalists who oppose us. I have gained quite a 
lot of experience concerning this matter from my numerous 
struggles in the past vis-a- vis journalists and researchers. 
Although my cause was right, I was all along the big loser 
while they remained the everlasting winners. 
  [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk

  [Text] Vientiane, March 17 (KPL) -- A memorandum of 
understanding was signed here on March 15, concerning the 
construction of cement, oil refinery, and electricity factories 
in the central province of Khammouane. 
  The document was inked between Mr. Leuan Sombouanekhan, 
vice-president of the Committee for Planning and Cooperation, 
and Dr. Pramuan Liaophilat, executive general manager of the TPI 
Company of Thailand. Vice Prime Minister and President of the 
Committee for Planning and Cooperation Khamphoui Keoboualapha, 
and Thai Ambassador to Laos Somphan Kokilanon were seen at the 
signing among others concerned from both sides. 
  The memorandum provides that the Lao Government has 
authorized the Thai company to make a survey to prepare an 
economic, technical report on the prospective factories of 
cement, oil refinery and electricity in the province of Laos. 
The report will then be submitted to the Lao Government for 
review and approval that will lead to the signing of another 
document. The survey will take about six months. 
  The cement factory alone, once completed, will be capable of 
producing 3 million tons of cement per year and will employ 
about 2,000 people. Its building cost is estimated at U.S. 400 
million. A total capital of U.S. 800 million will be used to 
build the oil refinery factory that is capable of refining 1.2 
million tons of oil per year. Raw materials will be imported 
from overseas to feed the factory that will employ about 3,000 
people. The construction of the electricity factory will need a 
total capital of U.S. 150 million, and its power generating 
capacity is 150 mgw [megawatts] per year. 
  At the signing ceremony, the Thai TPI company presented some 
100 tons of cement to the Lao Government.

<F P=106> [Speech by Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National </F>
Assembly, delivered at the closing ceremony of the third 
ordinary session of the Third National Assembly in Vientiane on 
14 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Our meeting studied and endorsed the amendment to 
the Law on the Promotion and Management of Foreign Investment in 
the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and the Labor Law. 
This is another important part in the implementation of the 
primary task of our legislative organization. 
  In studying and considering the two draft laws, members of 
the National Assembly made impressive efforts to contribute 
invaluable views to the improvement of the two laws by linking 
them to realities. This clearly shows that our National 
Assembly members always adhere to the party's stand and the 
roles of the National Assembly. That is why they have again 
firmly maintained a sense of mastery and held aloft a sense of 
political responsibility. 
  Compared with the old laws, the two new laws that have been 
amended and endorsed are more exemplary and conform to the 
current reality. Almost all articles in the Law on the Promotion 
and Management of Foreign Investment in the LPDR have been 
amended to conform to our party and state policy of broadening 
economic relations and cooperation with foreign couuntries. The 
amended law will serve to attract, persuade, and create 
confidence for friendly countries, international organizations, 
and foreign investors to invest in Laos; to ensure the rights 
and interests of investors as well as the interests and 
sovereignty of our country; and to create favorable conditions 
for foreign investors in our country. Some articles of the Labor 
Law have also been amended and added to. This is to plug 
certain loopholes, ensure and protect the legitimate rights and 
interests of both employees and employers, thereby encouraging 
them to fulfill their respective obligations, gradually making 
its contents more universal and accommodating to the 
requirements in the implementation of the party's policy of 
restructuring and the state's socioeconomic plan, effectively 
contributing to the development of human resources in our 
country. 
  Our meeting studied, considered, and elected the chairman of 
the Supreme People's Court and the people's general prosecutor. 
Their election was carried out through secret ballot. This is 
the first time National Assembly members have exercised their 
voting rights through secret ballot to elect suitable persons to 
two important judiciary organizations. The process reaffirms 
the full exercise of democratic rights by National Assembly 
members. 
  The meeting also studied and contributed views to the draft 
internal regulations of the National Assembly. This shows that 
we have transformed the contents of the National Assembly Law 
into details to suit the reality of resolving assembly work. 
This law serves to further consolidate and perfect the National 
Assembly machinery and to create favorable conditions for 
members to conduct their duties of representing the people and 
safeguarding their rights and interests. 
  The meeting reviewed and assessed the strengths and 
weaknesses and drew lessons from National Assembly activities 
carried out since the convening of the second ordinary session. 
  It assessed that these activities have just begun and that 
we 
must continue to endeavor to overcome numerous obstacles with a 
sense of revolutionary enthusiasm to fulfill all historical 
obligations entrusted by the people. 
  Respected personages, the enactment, amendment, and 
promulgation of a law is always important. But the most 
important thing reflecting the effectiveness of the promulgated 
law is its implementation and translation into reality. To 
effectively implement a law, first of all, I would like to ask 
the government to adopt appropriate measures to facilitate its 
implementation. Meanwhile, National Assembly members also have 
the duty to train, educate, and mobilize the people of all 
strata to take part in the revolution. 
  Our meeting elected the chairman of the Supreme People's 
Court and the people's general prosecutor. This is to further 
consolidate and invigorate the two judiciary organizations in 
implementing the Constitution and other laws. To achieve this, 
we must continue assisting these organizations to carry out 
their tasks to ensure justice in our society. 
  To put the successful results of this meeting into practice, 
I call on all National Assembly members to consider again Party 
Chairman Khamtai Siphandon's speech at the second ordinary 
session of the Third National Assembly on the duties and 
responsibilities of the National Assembly and its members. 
  To raise our political responsibility as representatives of 
the rights and interests of the multiethnic people, let us 
strive to overcome all obstacles and difficulties in 
disseminating the successful results of this meeting among the 
people in all regions, and mobilize them to translate the 
resolution adopted at this meeting into reality. At the same 
time, I call on all of you to begin drafting the substance of 
certain laws which will be deliberated in the coming ordinary 
session to ensure the quality of the laws enacted and amended, 
thereby gradually perfecting our legal system. This is the 
urgent central task which National Assembly members must fulfill 
in the immediate future. 
  I call on all compatriots of all strata, ethnic groups, and 
ages to further enhance the tradition of patriotism and a sense 
of mastery, to unite in implementing the tasks of national 
defense and reconstruction, and to translate into reality the 
1993-94 socioeconomic development plan and the Constitution and 
other laws. 
  I call on all party, state, and mass organizations as well 
as 
administrative organizations and services at all levels to 
cooperate and to create favorable conditions for National 
Assembly members to carry out their role as people's 
representatives to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the party and 
people. 
  On this auspicious occasion, on behalf of the National 
Assembly, I would like to once again thank the party chairman, 
all members of the Political Bureau, and advisers to the party 
Central Committee for sacrificing your precious time to attend 
this meeting. 
  I hereby officially declare the third ordinary session of 
the 
Third National Assembly closed. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] This week's meeting of Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers will not be a forum for 
negotiating trade and services liberalisation, Finance Minister 
Tharin Nimmanhemin said yesterday. 
  Speaking before his departure for the talks in Honolulu, Mr 
Tharin described the meeting as "no big deal" for Thailand. The 
discussions will only cover general assessments of the economic 
climate, he said. 
  US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who will host the 
talks, 
has said they will be informal and that the Americans would 
remain flexible on the agenda. 
  Negotiations on opening financial markets will be left for 
the concluding ministerial meeting of the Uruguay Round of world 
trade talks in Marrakesh, Morroco next month, said Mr Tharin. 
  There will be no talks on trading, services and double 
taxation. The discussions will cover situations of the world 
economy such as economic growth, capital flow and development of 
capital markets in the APEC countries, said Mr Tharin. 
  He added that officials from the Ministry of Finance had 
been 
assigned to present a study on the effects of capital flows in 
the country's development. 
  Bank of Thailand and Stock Exchange Commission officials 
will 
attend the meeting to provide additional information. The APEC 
discussions will take only one day, commented Mr Tharin. 
  Mr Tharin said ASEAN Finance Ministers will arrange a 
meeting 
among themselves prior to presenting their positions and data 
one day before the full meeting takes place. 
  Thailand is the host for this meeting. This does not mean, 
he added, that Thailand will present itself as the core for the 
ASEAN countries in the APEC meeting. 
  Regarding the recent trade conflict between the US and 
Japan. 
Mr Tharin said the conflict did not directly involve APEC 
members. 
  He believes the US will not involve APEC member countries in 
its dispute with Japan. Their effort to enforce the Japanese to 
open their markets will not affect Thai products in the US 
market as Thailand has already adopted free trade policies. 
  Therefore, the US has no reason to pressure Thailand to open 
its market for US products, commented Mr Tharin. 
  "Thailand has opened its markets for US products such as 
software and computer chips. Thus, I believe the US will have 
sufficient reason not to enlarge the trade war. Also US 
officials have assured the participants that this matter will be 
precluded from discussion," said Mr Tharin.

  [Text] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin says it has 
been agreed that the meeting of APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation] finance ministers, to be held during 18-19 March in 
Hawaii, will discuss economic growth strategies, the role of 
revolving funds in national development, and the development of 
local financial markets. It has also been agreed that the 
meeting will not be used for forced access to financial markets 
or examination of a country's economic policies. He said that 
he would head the seminar on the topic of the role of revolving 
funds in national development. 
  The finance minister disclosed that his delegation has been 
changed to include a representative of the office of the 
securities exchange management committee to cover the meeting's 
agenda. The delegation originally included only representatives 
of the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand.

  [Text] Police authorities today found a dead body and a 
large quantity of explosives on a truck that was towed to 
Lumpini Police Station on 11 March. The truck belongs to 
Thammawutkan Transport Company. Mr. Thawin Pawaratphichit, 
owner of the company, informed the police that the truck and its 
driver disappeared on 11 March. The police inspected the truck 
and found a large water container connected with electrical 
wires. The police rescue unit was asked to disconnect the 
wires. Master Sergeant Somkiat Nakon told reporters that the 
explosive is C-4 buried in ammonium nitrate mixed with diesel 
oil, and it could have been powerful if detonated. He said: 
  [Begin Somkiat recording] The bomb was connected to almost a 
complete circuit and was ready to explode if someone pushed the 
switch. The local police opened the water tank and shoveled off 
the fertilizer. After seeing electrical wires, they called my 
unit in and I disconnected the wires. [end recording] 
  The truck was later driven into Lumpini Park, which was not 
crowded during the daytime. The operation to defuse the 
explosive was observed by a large crowd. The authorities found 
three pounds of C-4 explosives and 14 detonators. A dead male 
body wrapped in a plastic sheet was then found at the bottom of 
the water tank. Police Major General Nithat Sawettanan, the 
commander of the Southern Metropolitan Police Commission, said 
that Thawin rented his truck to foreigners for 12,000 baht on 9 
March. The truck was to load cargo at Makro wholesale center in 
the Bangkapi area on 10 March. The driver telephoned Thawin on 
the same day and said that he had already received the money, 
but then was not heard from since. But on 11 March, the truck 
was involved in an accident with a motorcycle in front of 
Central Chitlom department store. The driver was a foreigner 
who disappeared after paying for the damage to the motorcycle. 
Police authorities later drove the truck to the police station. 
  A police expert disclosed that if detonated in the open air, 
the destruction could extend as far as one kilometer. The 
police believe that the production of this large bomb needed 
five or six hours and a secluded area, possibly the department 
store's underground parking lot or a nearby place. 
  Lieutenant General Chaiyasit Kanchanakit of the Metropolitan 
Police Commission inspected the truck but refused to comment. 
However, many people suspected that the bomb may have been 
intended to sabotage several important places such as embassies 
in the area.

forum on security to be held in Bangkok in July 1994. The two 
sides held that the promotion of cooperation between Vietnam and 
ASEAN and Vietnam's participation in the forum conformed to the 
trend for cooperation in the region.

<F P=106> [By Suphaphon Kanwirayothin in Hanoi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Thailand and Vietnam, in a bid to remove a major 
thorn in bilateral relations, yesterday agreed to set up a joint 
task force at ministerial level to resolve the problem of 
fishing rights in the Gulf of Thailand. They agreed on the move, 
which was proposed by Thailand, during talks held shortly after 
the arrival here of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for a four-day 
official visit. 
  Fishery questions topped the agenda of a dozen issues the 
two 
delegations touched on during the plenary talks chaired by Mr 
Chuan and Vietnam's Premier Vo Van Kiet. Fisheries Department 
chief Plotprasop Suratsawat affirmed Thailand's eagerness to 
settle the fishery row. He told the BANGKOK POST he hoped the 
joint task force would be able to recommend a solution within 
the first two months of its inception. "Both sides shared the 
feeling that this problem must be resolved urgently but with 
extreme caution as it has implications encompassing aspects of 
national security, economy and the livelihoods of the two 
peoples. And a rash solution could be damaging," Mr Plotprasop 
said. [passage omitted] 
  The question of fishing rights will be discussed in depth 
today in a separate meeting between Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam. Mr 
Plotprasop will also attend the meeting. According to Mr 
Plotprasop, the Thai delegation yesterday made clear to the 
Vietnamese side that if there were no solution to the fishery 
problem, cooperation in other fields might be affected, for 
instance that of agriculture. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak is due to hold 
bilateral talks with Vietnam's Defence Minister Doan Khue this 
morning.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai paid a courtesy call on 
Do Muoi, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam 
[CPV], at the party Central Committee Office in Hanoi at 1700 
yesterday. Both the CPV general secretary and the Thai prime 
minister agreed that both countries will follow up agreements 
reached in various fields so they will bear fruit effectively. 
  On the same occasion, the CPV general secretary expressed 
his 
admiration to His Majesty the King and members of the royal 
family of Thailand. The CPV general secretary greatly admired 
the royally initiated projects dealing with agriculture and 
water resources and he wants to request Thai assistance on this 
field. Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's 
Office, granted an interview to this reporter on the event. 
  [Begin recording] [Aphisit] The Vietnamese party Central 
Committee general secretary expressed his profound admiration 
and gratitude to His Majesty the King, who once granted him an 
audience. He also expressed his admiration to members of the 
Thai Royal Family and royally initiated projects in various 
fields. He noted that the relationship between the two 
countries has significantly improved in the past few years. He 
wanted the bilateral cooperation to further develop for 
economic, social, and political interests in this region. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What royally initiated projects is 
the CPV chairman [as heard] interested in and admires? 
  [Aphisit] He said he is greatly impressed by royally 
initiated projects, especially in the field of agriculture 
dealing with water. This is because Vietnam wants to improve 
agricultural production efficiency. Despite success at a 
certain level in economic reform, Vietnam still has problems due 
to a lack of technology and improvement in production 
efficiency, which is becoming more competitive. He specifically 
admired the king's ability in agriculture and royally initiated 
projects in various fields. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Aphisit] He mentioned Thailand providing assistance 
through royally initiated projects to other countries, such as 
Laos. Such forms of assistance are aimed to be models. Vietnam 
has also requested such assistance from Thailand. 
  [Reporter] Does he want royally initiated projects to be in 
his country? 
  [Aphisit] Right. 
  [Reporter] Did they discuss possible steps to be taken? 
  [Aphisit] The king will be informed of this matter and I 
think it could be possible because the king also mentioned this 
in an audience once given to him. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Text" of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's speech at 16 March </F>
banquet in honor of Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] Your Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, 
distinguished Thai guests, dear friends: On behalf of the 
Vietnamese government and people, I would like to warmly welcome 
Your Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other 
distinguished Thai guests. You have brought with you the Thai 
people's friendship for the Vietnamese people. For myself, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to return the hospitality 
that Your Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai has accorded 
to the Vietnamese leaders during their visits to Thailand, which 
have achieved much in terms of economic development. 
  I am very pleased to note that since October 1991, when I 
had 
the opportunity to pay an official visit to Thailand, the 
relations between our two countries have reached a new level of 
development. Comrade Do Muoi, our party general secretary, paid 
a visit to Thailand and the Vietnamese people had the 
opportunity to welcome the Thai Prince and Princess. Those 
visits were of great significance because they have contributed 
to consolidating and strengthening our bilateral relations. 
  We have exchanged honest views on issues of common concern 
in 
an effort to strengthen the friendly relations between our two 
countries. Bilateral economic, trade, scientific, technical, 
and tourist cooperation has been expanded. The signing of 
agreements on bilateral tourist cooperation and cooperation 
between the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the 
Federation of Thai Industries during your current visit to 
Vietnam is a new indication of that positive trend of 
development. 
  Vietnam and Thailand are two neighboring countries with many 
cultural similarities and long-lasting relations throughout the 
course of history. The harmonious relations between our two 
peoples are a very important factor for the prosperity of each 
country and also a great contribution to stability and 
cooperation in Southeast Asia. 
  Being fully aware of this, our government and people have 
done all we can to contribute to consolidating and promoting 
good friendship and neighborliness. We are persisting in a 
comprehensive national renovation policy while at the same 
implementing a foreign policy of openness for the sake of peace, 
cooperation, and development. That policy is in conformity with 
the great trends of development in the region and other parts of 
the world. Consequently, it is gaining the full support of our 
entire people and of broad sections of world public opinion, and 
is bringing about important results. 
  Against such a backdrop is our resolve to join efforts with 
countries in the region in turning Southeast Asia into a region 
of peace, independence, cooperation, and development. Prompted 
by that resolve, Vietnam will make a constructive contribution 
to the upcoming Regional Security Forum in Bangkok. 
  Your Excellency the Prime Minister and distinguished guests, 
I would like to invite you to toast the health of the King and 
Royal Family, the president of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam, and His Excellency the Prime Minister and other 
distinguished Thai guests. May the friendship and comprehensive 
cooperation between Vietnam and Thailand continue to be 
consolidated and developed with each passing day. Let us toast 
the health of all those who are present here.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai at a banquet held in </F>
his honor by SRV Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in Hanoi on 16 March 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I am very pleased to learn 
that our countries have closely cooperated with each other in 
financial services and investment markets. The Bank of Thailand 
and the Securities Exchange of Thailand will render cooperation 
to and closely coordinate with the Vietnamese national bank. 
Such exchanges of experience and information will help 
strengthen the financial services of the two countries. I 
believe we all agree that the present world economic system will 
advance firmly if we can build up and develop a strong base in 
financial services. We must be prepared for rapidly increasing 
competition. The cooperation which exists under the principle 
of good understanding and mutual benefit will form an important 
foundation for multilateral relations, which will lead to a 
collaboration of quality power [khunaphap phalang]. I believe 
that good relations among the countries in the region, 
especially the countries in the Mekong River basin, will enable 
us to cope with problems that may arise in sharing the use of 
natural resources. We will work to jointly preserve and improve 
the environment to benefit our present and future generations. 
[passage omitted] 
  During my visit to Vietnam, leading figures from business 
institutions in major fields are joining the trip so they will 
be directly informed of certain policies of both Thailand and 
Vietnam that will promote trade and investment. This will 
create mutual benefit within a definite framework and 
regulations. They will be able to observe the economic 
potential of Vietnam. Furthermore, both sides must carry out 
necessary activities to promote trade and investment cooperation 
by supplying each other with clear and correct information. 
Therefore, I am pleased that Thai and Vietnamese investment 
promotion organizations have jointly organized a seminar to seek 
ways to further expand trade and investment cooperation.

investment would be strengthened a step further in the days 
ahead.

  [Text] On the second day of his visit to Vietnam, Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai will today witness the signing of four 
contracts for joint ventures considered the most substantive 
ever concluded between Thai and Vietnamese businessmen. 
Sathaphon Kawitanon, the secretary-general of the Board of 
Investment [BoI], said the ceremony will be held before the 
seminar on investment in Vietnam co-organised by the State 
Committee for Cooperation and Investment and the BoI. 
  The four projects comprise: 
  -- the joint investment to establish the Siam-Vina Bank 
between Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank, the Charoen Phokhaphan 
Group and the Vietnam Bank of Agriculture 
  -- joint cooperation in developing an industrial estate 
between the Bang Pakong Industrial Park and Sonadezi Bien Hoa; 
  -- a joint investment project worth 400 million baht 
involving mining by the U-Surint Industrial Group with 
Vietnamese state-run authority partners, and 
  -- a contract between Thailand's Advance Paint and 
Chemical Co and Vietnam's Ngan Hua Economic and Engineering 
Consultants and Dong Tam. 
  Mr Sathaphon, who led a group of 70 prominent Thai 
businessmen joining the Chuan delegation, said the visit would 
boost confidence in investment here and remind businessmen to 
take genuine action for investment on a long-term basis. He said 
the failure of previous visits by groups of businessmen several 
years ago was because of improper investment regulations on the 
Vietnamese side. The situation had now changed, especially 
Hanoi's investment rules and regulations, which would help 
induce more investment from overseas. "I don't think it is too 
late for Thai businessmen to invest in Vietnam. We are not a 
very rich country, so we have to be careful where we put our 
money. We have to take time surveying places where there is 
high potential. 
  Mr Chuan yesterday witnessed two agreement signing 
ceremonies, on tourism cooperation between the two countries and 
a joint business council between the Federation of Thai 
Industries and Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  PM's Office Minister Sawit Phothiwihok said cooperation in 
tourism would cover the liberalisation of air territories for 
Vietnamese airlines to fly over Thailand to other destinations 
worldwide. Cooperation on air traffic control between the two 
countries would be processed under the agreement. 
  Consultation on further investment in tourism-related 
businesses including hotels and tourist companies, would take 
place later. 
  Meanwhile, Vietnam's request for a loan of US$100 million 
from Thailand to develop its infrastructure has been agreed in 
principle by the Finance Ministry, according to Wichit Suphinit, 
the governor of the Bank of Thailand. Mr Wichit revealed after a 
meeting with Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday that 
the Hanoi Government had submitted a letter asking for a 
$100-million loan from the Thai Government through the Bank of 
Thailand. The central bank approved the request and agreed to 
find the funds as soon as possible because the loan was 
indispensable for the development of the country, he said. The 
loan will be a syndicated one since Thailand does not have 
adequate funds allocated for the purpose. The Krung Thai Bank 
and the Export-Import Bank of Thailand were asked to coordinate 
with local and foreign banks to mobilise the funds. "The 
interest rate has not been discussed as Hanoi has yet to send a 
withdrawal plan to the central bank and terms and conditions 
must be agreed upon among syndicated banks. But the rate will 
be fixed as is the normal practice for syndicated loans," said 
Mr Wichit. 
  A Thai working group is already present in Vietnam. It will 
negotiate at a certain level with the Hanoi Government prior to 
Mr Wichit's arrival. The negotiations will be finalised in 
Chiang Mai next Friday. Mr Wichit added that after discussing 
the issue with Krung Thai Bank president Sirin Nimmanhemin -- 
the coordinator of the loan -- that proceedings for implementing 
the loan would go ahead as soon as possible. Coordination among 
syndicated banks will be concluded by next Wednesday and the 
contract is expected to be signed by Friday. The loan marks one 
of the most important syndicated loans between Thailand and 
Vietnam. It would indirectly serve as an instrument to promote 
Thai investment in Vietnam, he added. Mr Wichit said the loan 
was quite similar to the Indochina Fund, except for certain 
terms and conditions. The funds would be injected into 
infrastructure projects or re-lent to the private sector for the 
same purpose. The Indochina Fund lends directly to each 
project, with the feasibility and validity of each project 
evaluated by a special unit. 
  The Bank of Thailand is also considering setting up such a 
unit to support the continued and quickly expanding investments 
in the country, he said. Should Thailand ignore the opportunity, 
it will fail to benefit from the current favourable liquidity 
situation, part of which will come from foreign funds using 
Thailand as a base to distribute their capital to Indochina. 
Finance Minister Tharin said he had discussed with M.R. 
Pridiyathon Thewakun, the president of the Export-Import Bank, 
seeking banks to join the syndicated loan. He said the loan 
would be long-term and the rate would not be a major concern as 
Vietnam was mobilising funds to develop itself. The loan would 
serve as an index for Thai banks lending to Indochinese 
countries, including foreign banks operating in Thailand, said 
Mr Tharin. 
  "The loan is endorsed by the credit of the Hanoi Government. 
Therefore, the types and specifications of projects will not be 
required. The Vietnam Government has full authority to decide 
which projects will get the money," said Mr Tharin.

<F P=106> ["Unreasonable Attempt To Block North-South Dialogue" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- Yi Yong-tok, South 
Korean puppet Unification Board minister, told the press on 
March 15 that the Panmunjom working-level contact for the 
exchange of special envoys would "end in failure", according to 
a radio report from Seoul. 
  The puppet defence minister, Yi Pyong-Tae, too, openly 
talked 
about resuming "Team Spirit" joint military exercises this year 
when he met with a U.S. undersecretary of defense that day, 
saying "the exchange of special envoys between the North and the 
South was unlikely to be realized". 
  Such ill-boding remarks vividly show that the Kim Yong-sam 
group has no intention to discuss the pending issues between the 
North and the South. 
  The puppets now lay the blame for the failure to make a 
progress in the working-level contact at the North's door. This 
is, indeed, an act reminding one of a thief crying "stop thief!" 
  It is entirely because of the South Korean puppet clique's 
unjust behavior that the four rounds of working contact held in 
March failed to get anywhere. The South side objected to the 
North side's proposal to announce in a joint communique that the 
sides confirmed again the will for the exchange of special 
envoys and agreed on their early exchange. It categorically 
took exception to the North side's suggestion that the questions 
of observing the principle of national independence, deciding on 
the way of national reunification and of promoting the great 
unity of the whole nation be stipulated in the draft agreement 
with regard to the duty of special envoys. 
  Their acts of dragging on the working-level contact, while 
objecting to the North side's principled proposals without any 
justification and reasons, are nothing but a despicable intrigue 
to reduce the talks to ostensible and nominal one. 
  It is not hard to gather that lurking behind such perfidious 
acts of the puppets is their sinister intention to put the 
brakes on the third round of DPRK-USA talks at any cost by 
blocking the progress of the contact for the exchange of special 
envoys and overpower the North with the help of foreign forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must stop its adventurous 
rash 
acts of leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a very 
dangerous, catastrophic crisis, approach the dialogue with an 
honest attitude in response to the demand and aspirations of the 
fellow countrymen and make a bold decision to accept the North 
side's drastic proposal on working procedures at an early date.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists, 
on March 15, staged an exercise of returning to the base after 
dropping bombs in the air above Yongwol and Pyongchang, South 
Korea, with the mobilization of Japan-based F-15 fighter-bombers 
and FA-18 pursuit-assault planes, according to military sources. 
  On the 14th and the 15th, overseas-based KC-135s refueled 
more than 30 fighter-bombers and assault planes in an air war 
exercise above Kunsan and Kapyong. 
  Meanwhile the Kim Yong-sam group staged a war rehearsal on 
the 15th with the mobilization of many warships, attack 
helicopters, artillery pieces, tanks and armoured vehicles. 
  At that time, a "civilian defence training" was under way in 
Seoul. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets would be 
well advised to act with discretion, clearly mindful of the 
grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless belligerent 
moves increasing tension on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam showed up at a "graduation ceremony of the police 
college" on March 14 and fostered fascist suppression, blaring 
that a "powerful police" must be built up and it must "cope with 
illegal violent demonstrations," according to a radio report 
from Seoul. 
  This is a last-ditch effort of the traitor to suppress and 
stamp out with "government" power the people's struggle for an 
end to the "civilian" fascist rule and thus prop up his power on 
thin ice. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is now much embarrassed by the 
situation that has turned unfavourable to him. 
  The South Korean people are waging a relentless struggle 
against the treacherous opening of rice market and for the 
abolition of the fascist "National Security Law." The 
opposition camp, too, is pointing an accusing finger at the 
traitor. 
  At a time when the world public circles including the 
Amnesty 
International lifted up their voices condemning the fascist 
repressive rule and human rights abuses in South Korea, even the 
United States, his master, urged the abrogation of the notorious 
"National Security Law," driving him into a sorry plight. 
  All this is a mortal blow and an ominous symptom for the 
traitor. 
  His remarks whipping up fascist suppression are interpreted 
as a product of consciousness of crisis in the position of a 
fish out of water.

<F P=106> ["Only Grave Awaits `Civilian President'" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- Only the grave awaits 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a "civilian president" forsaken and 
rejected by the people for his anti-national, anti-popular 
crimes, says NODONG SINMUN in an article today. 
  The author of the article says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "civilian" regime are 
destined to meet a miserable doom. The puppet Kim Young-sam had 
been a target of hatred among the people before he took the 
"presidential" seat as a thorough-paced traitor and turncoat. 
When the traitor chose to live under the same roof with 
military blackguards, openly kissing them with the patronage and 
backing of the United States, his master, people of all walks of 
life lifted up voices of condemnation, branding him as a 
power-thirsty shyster, betrayer and political prostitute. At 
the time of "presidential elections" people who account for 
nearly 20 percent of the total number of electors boycotted 
voting to express their opposition to Kim Yong-sam. This 
virtually means that more than two thirds of the population 
voted against him. Thus, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime had a 
gloomy future from the first step as it came into being amidst 
opposition and rejection by an overwhelming majority of the 
people. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique also took upon itself a 
timebomb by getting into the same boat with the preceding 
military dictators. For the traitor Kim Yong-sam to join hands 
with the military dictatorial forces denounced by the people was 
an act of turning his back on the people, and for him to promise 
those forces to "protect" them after his assumption of office 
was an unpardonable criminal act. 
  After putting up the "civilian" signboard the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique honored its commitment to the preceding military 
dictatorial forces, while breaking all his "promises" to the 
people. That is why the South Korean people view "in the same 
light" Chun Doo hwan- No Tae-u clique, a target of purge and 
punishment, and the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is zealously 
defending them. 
  The traitor's much-touted, fine-sounding "civilian politics" 
has punctured. It is as clear as noonday what fate will befall 
him.

<F P=106> ["`Civilian' Dictator Vomits Poison" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam showed up at a "graduation ceremony of the police 
college" a few days ago and called for the buildup of a 
"powerful police", contending that "any violation of order", not 
to speak of "a violent demonstration", could not be justified 
and tolerated under the "civilian government". 
  Branding this as an outburst of the "civilian"-veiled 
fascist 
revealing his sinister intention to tighten the repressive rule, 
a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  Dictatorship is incompatible with democracy. It is shameful 
of the puppets to talk about "civilian government" and 
"democracy" while wielding the sword of dictatorship. 
  The ever more outrageous and vicious suppression by the 
puppets is hysterics of those who are floundering in the crisis 
of a fish out of water, rejected and denounced by the people. 
  Sword-brandishing, however, can never be a means of 
prolonging life. The struggle of the South Korean people for 
independence, democracy, reunification and the vital rights is 
justifiable. It cannot be criminalized under any circumstances. 
  To suppress this struggle by branding it as "illegal" is a 
lawless violence and an unpardonable fascist outrage. The 
harsher the fascist suppression by the puppets, the stronger the 
resistance of the people. 
  The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique had better act with 
discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- South Korean believers 
of Taejonggyo worshiping Tangun deeply revere the great leader 
President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. 
  A believer Yi Se-chun in Kyongsan, North Kyongsang Province, 
told his colleagues after a mass on the day of the founding of 
Taejonggyo: 
  "Historians of the North, encouraged by the instructions of 
President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il, proved 
that Tangun was not a legendary mythical being but a real 
person, the founder of Kojoson (ancient Korea). So, the desire 
of the believers of Taejonggyo has been realised and it has been 
demonstrated worldwide that our nation is a resourceful, 
homogeneous nation with a history spanning 5,000 years." 
  Agreeing with him, a believer Choe Sun-kyo said: 
  "We, believers of Taejonggyo, must revere them as the 
leaders 
of Tangun's Korea. Only when we hold them in high esteem, is it 
possible to glorify the history of our nation and guarantee a 
bright future of the reunified country and the restored nation." 
  Pleased that the tomb of Tangun is now being reconstructed, 
a 
believer Yu Pae-sun said: 
  "When the country is reunified, let us go to the North 
before 
anyone else to express thanks to President Kim Il-song and the 
dear leader Kim Chong-il, the leaders of the Korean nation 
peerless in the 5,000 year long history, and add lustre to 
Tangun's Korea, remaining faithful to them."

<F P=106> ["Another Flunkeyist Treachery" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities recently announced a "policy" of introducing "mass 
culture" of Japan stage by stage from June and are advertising 
it as a "policy" pursuant to the trend of "internationalization" 
and "opening." 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says the Kim Yong-sam 
group is committing another flunkeyist treachery by scheming to 
fling open the door wider to the corrupt culture of Japan this 
year and turn society into a dark sphere where Japanese fashion 
and Japanese way of life will hold sway. 
  The news anlayst says: 
  The decadent American ideologies and culture and the corrupt 
culture of the Japanese reactionaries have made their way into 
South Korea to paralyze the consciousness of the people and 
degenerate society. 
  When more immoral ideologies and culture flood into South 
Korea where people and society are already corrupt and ailing 
with the infiltration of Japan's reactionary culture, the 
aftereffects will be monstrous. 
  If the South Korean puppets massively introduce Japanese 
culture under the cloak of "internationalisation" and "opening," 
South Korea will, no doubt, become more dependent on Japan not 
only in politics and economy but in culture as well. 
Unpardonable is the treachery of the Kim Yong-sam group which 
is trying to prolong its remaining days with the support of its 
masters at the expense of the interests of the nation, fawning 
upon and submitting to foreign forces.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
The leading officials of organisations under the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) released 
statements denouncing criminal dumping of nuclear waste by the 
South Korean authorities. 
  Om Chang-pom, chief director of the Federation of Korean 
Traders and Industrialists in Japan, charged that the Kim 
Yong-sam clique which has dumped radioactive substances into the 
sea, ignoring the international convention totally banning it, 
is, indeed, a group of savages who have no idea of the nation 
and international law. 
  He urged the Kim Yong-sam clique to immediately stop seeking 
confrontation and division in conspiracy with outside forces, 
scrap the "National Security Law," an anti-reunification law, 
and open to the public the amount of the nuclear waste they have 
already dumped into the sea, its kinds and the dumping places 
and apologize to the nation. 
  The chairman of the League of Korean Youth in Japan, Pak 
Ku-ho, said that the grave anti-national, anti-human criminal 
act committed by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is directly 
linked with the nuclear weapon development that has been 
promoted in secrecy and has already reached a dangerous stage in 
South Korea. 
  "The purpose sought by the Kim Yong-sam group in its 
malicious anti-DPRK smear campaign over the fictitious `nuclear 
issue of the North' is to divert the attention of the people at 
home and abroad to the North and then hasten its nuclear weapon 
development," he emphasized. 
  So Cha-yon, chairwoman of the Democratic Union of Korean 
Women in Japan, Pak Yong-kon, chairman of the Association of 
Korean Social Scientists in Japan, and Kim Chong-su, chairman of 
the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification, 
also denounced the nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam 
group as a towering crime against the nation and mankind.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- A national seminar was 
held at the People's Palace of Culture here Wednesday to mark 
the 30th anniversary of the publication of the famous work of 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il "Position and Role of the 
County in Socialist Construction". 
  Present at the seminar were Politburo member of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and 
Vice-President Yi Chong-ok, Secretary of the WPK Central 
Committee Kim Chung-nin, Vice-Premier of the Administration 
Council Chang Chol, and other officials concerned and personnel 
of party cadres training organs, men of science, education and 
the press. 
  At the seminar the speakers said the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in his work proved the validity and truthfulness of the 
idea of the great leader President Kim Il-song on the position 
and role of the county in socialist construction with his lucid 
logic and persuasive power and further developed it in depth 
with his profound, unique idea and new scientific and 
theoretical propositions. 
  The dear leader, they noted, put it forward as a strategic 
task that should certainly be carried out by a working-class 
party and state after the establishment of the socialist system 
to clear away the differences between town and country, between 
the working class and peasantry by raising the role of the 
county as a regional base, and made clear the revolutionary 
essence and importance of the question of raising the role of 
the county. 
  They said the work that gives a profound, unique scientific 
explanation of the role of the county as a comprehensive unit of 
developing the local economy and as a base of economic links 
between town and country is a highly important one in which the 
dear leader developed in depth the theory of socialist 
construction from a new angle with his rare ideological and 
theoretical wisdom. 
  The speakers pointed out that the dear leader's work is a 
highly important work that developed the theory of socialist 
construction because, by giving a scientific exposition of the 
question of raising the position and role of the county in the 
socialist rural construction, it provides a firm guideline in 
leading the socialist rural construction and socialist 
construction as a whole along a straight road to victory. 
  They said the idea of the regional base expounded in the 
work 
indicates the way of bringing earlier the complete victory of 
socialism and making the popular masses masters of the state and 
society by raising the role of the county. 
  They explained and proved that to strengthen economic links 
between town and country as expounded in the work is the mighty 
way of finally solving the rural question and dynamically 
accelerating the building of socialism and communism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The mass gymnastic 
display "Great Victory of Rural Theses" had been performed in 
Pyongyang before full houses from early March to the middle of 
the month on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the rural theses. 
  10,000 school youths and children performed the gymnastic 
display three times a day at the Grand Pyongyang Indoor Stadium. 
  They epically delineated the undying leadership exploits of 
the great leader President Kim Il-song, who unfolded a great 
programme of socialist rural construction and set a brilliant 
example in the solution of the rural question, and the happy 
life of farmers. 
  The display of gymnastic exercises, dances and acrobatics 
against magic lantern style background was highly acclaimed by 
the spectators for its high ideological and artistic level and 
refined skill of performers and well-harmonized ensemble. 
  The display leading the spectators to ecstasies was produced 
by the creative group of the mass gymnastic display. 
  It was formed in November 1971. It is now playing a big role 
in the development of the chuche-based gymnastic art of Korea. 
  The group consisting of the creation and production, 
gymnastic exercise, background, music and other specialized 
creative sections, has hundreds of competent creators including 
more than 40 people's and merited sportsmen and sportswomen. 
  It produced scores of monumental works in the past. 
  The mass gymnastic displays "Chollima Korea", "Song of 
Korea", "People Sing of the Leader", "Singlehearted Unity" and 
other works won the people's prize and are widely known to the 
world as comprehensive sports art consisting of courageous, 
powerful and lively gymnastic movements, beautiful rhythms, 
plastic etude combining collective harmony well with individual 
skills and organic harmonisation of gymnastic ground, background 
and music. 
  The group produces and disseminates gymnastic works to be 
performed in all parts of the country. And it organises 
training courses and provincial contests of mass gymnastic 
display every year, thus playing a big role in improving the 
physical conditions of children and students and working people. 
  In the past, it sent experts to more than 40 Asian, African 
and Latin American countries on over 90 occasions and helped in 
the creation of mass gymnastic displays.

  PBS [Sabah United Party] state assemblymen have, meanwhile, 
indicated that they are to join Barisan Nasional. The deputy 
chief minister of Sabah, Datuk Bernard Dompok, accompanied by 10 
others conveyed a message to Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim when they 
called on the deputy prime minister in Kuala Lumpur this 
afternoon. 
  Speaking to newsmen after the meeting, Datuk Bernard Dompok 
said they have planned to set up a new party which will apply to 
join Barisan Nasional. He also said that he will talk to other 
former PBS leaders, including Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan about 
the plan.

  [Text] Inflation this year is not expected to exceed 5.5 
percent and is likely to be even lower with the many offsets for 
the Goods and Services Tax [GST], said Mr. Yeo Cheow Tong 
yesterday. The trade and industry minister gave the assurance 
after noting that the underlying inflation rate was around 2.5 
percent and assuming a full 3 percent additional rate due to the 
GST. "And since we have a lot of offsets, it is likely to be 
below 5.5 percent," he added. Offsets to cushion the impact of 
the GST include rebates on service and conservancy charges and 
tax cuts. 
  Mr. Yeo made this assessment in reply to MPs who expressed 
worry last week that GST-induced inflation could lead to a price 
spiral. Some had predicted inflation of 6 percent, while others 
feared it would hit 9 percent, more than thrice last year's 2.4 
percent. 
  Yesterday, the minister assured the House repeatedly that 
the 
new tax, to be launched next month, will not lead to high 
inflation. 
  He cited a 1986 International Monetary Fund study of 35 
countries which introduced GST and found that 29 only had a 
one-off rise in inflation. The rate went back to normal 
subsequently. For many, the increase was also lower than the tax 
rate. 
  Addressing calls to combat profiteering, he revealed that 
the 
reactivated Committee on Profiteering and Inflation had met 
major retailers to gauge how they would respond to the GST. 
Many said they would absorb the tax for most of their 
lower-priced items and pledged not to raise prices by more than 
3 percent for higher-priced goods. On the possibility of people 
taking advantage of the GST to jack up prices, he said the keen 
competition in Singapore's very open economy with no supply 
shortages left little scope for this. But, he added it was also 
difficult to determine what constituted profiteering. 
  Price differences occurred all the time at different places. 
As long as people were willing to pay, who could say shops were 
profiteering, he asked. It could only exist if consumers had no 
choice. Noting that the government was nevertheless mindful of 
the public's concern, he cited several other measures, including 
the Department of Statistics' regular survey of hawker prices. 
Its finding so far: Only 4 percent have raised prices. "So 
this concern about runaway prices, therefore, has no basis at 
all," he said. 
  The department, he added, will assist the Consumers' 
Association of Singapore [Case] by helping it to publish a list 
of the best and worst deals for consumers. The latter will be a 
blacklist, similar to the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board's 
blacklist of shops for tourists, he said, adding that Case 
should be bold in protecting the consumer. 
  He also said that those who ganged up to form a monopoly 
would face the consequences of the Price Control Act. Under the 
act, the government can set maximum prices for goods which it 
thinks suppliers are profiteering from. 
  Mr. Yeo's final message: The comprehensive measures could 
only work if consumers exercised their rights. "We have to teach 
the retailers that greed does not pay, and the consumer is in 
the best position to do that." 
  Parliament passed the Trade and Industry Ministry's budget 
and began scrutiny of the Ministry of Information and the Arts. 
Debate continues today.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government expressed "deep concern and regrets" Thursday over 
North Korea's refusal to allow full nuclear inspections and 
called attention to the special board meeting of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) slated for March 21. 
  "The government cannot but express deep concern and regrets 
at the results that are due from North Korea's uncooperative 
actions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a 
statement, referring to the IAEA announcement in Vienna that its 
inspection activities in North Korea were restricted. 
  The agency further said it could not verify that North Korea 
had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes. 
  "The government urges that the IAEA inspections of 
unfulfilled parts be carried out immediately without delay," 
Chang said. "We will watch closely the decision by the IAEA 
special board of governors meeting." 
  Seoul also called on Pyongyang to be sincere in talks on 
exchanging envoys, voicing hope that the nuclear issue would be 
discussed substantively through the exchange. 
  "The government reconfirms (there is) no change in its 
original stance that the IAEA inspections of North Korean 
nuclear facilities must conclude successfully and that the 
inter-Korean special envoy exchange for solution of the nuclear 
problem must be implemented before the third round of North 
Korea-U.S. dialogue," Chang said.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) failed to verify that North Korea had not 
diverted nuclear material, but most likely kept alive the 
continuous flow of inspections, a Foreign Ministry official said 
here Thursday. 
  "The IAEA did not say anything specific on that part," Ham 
Myong-chol, director-general of the International Organizations 
Bureau, said when asked if IAEA safeguards in North Korea had 
been compromised. 
  "The agency only concluded that it could not verify the 
diversion, but it seems that there wasn't a problem on that part 
(continuity of safeguards) of the issue," he said. 
  If true, the international community would still have room 
for diplomatic negotiations with North Korea on resolving the 
inspection issue before taking it to the Security Council for 
punitive measures. 
  The IAEA issued a statement from its Vienna headquarters 
that 
its inspectors were not allowed full access to the North Korean 
radiochemical laboratory, regarded by the agency as a nuclear 
reprocessing plant and the key part of Pyongyang's covert 
weapons program. 
  The U.N. agency has decided to convene a special Board of 
Governors meeting on March 21. 
  Ham said the inspectors saw all but a few important parts of 
the radiochemical laboratory. "The question of diversion will 
be the key issue at the March 21 meeting," he said. 
  The results of the meeting will be reported automatically to 
the U.N. Security Council, which alone must decide on whether to 
intervene, Ham said. 
  The IAEA board is expected to adopt a resolution expressing 
concern and regret over the restricted inspections and demanding 
immediate access to relevant areas, he said.

  [Text] The government is in the process of actively 
considering taking strong measures by mobilizing all possible 
means, including handing this issue over to the UN Security 
Council and imposing sanctions on North Korea, if North Korea 
does not respond to an additional inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and the South-North exchange 
of special envoys. 
  In a news conference on the afternoon of 17 March, Kim 
Sam-hun, nuclear ambassador of the Foreign Ministry, revealed 
such a policy by saying that the government has strong doubts on 
whether it should continue its dialogue efforts with North Korea 
and if that is possible at all. He also stated that now is the 
time to take all possible proper steps. 
  In connection with resolving North Korea's nuclear issue, he 
said that the government's policy on the North Korean nuclear 
issue maintained the basic framework of peaceful resolution 
through dialogue in the past. However, the government's policy 
revealed today is very noteworthy because it hints that the 
government's policy on North Korea will turn to strong measures, 
including sanctions.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government is reviewing a policy to cope resolutely with North 
Korea unless Pyongyang agrees to an additional inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to carry out the 
proposed inter-Korean exchange of special envoys. 
  Ambassador for Nuclear Affairs Kim Sam-hun told a press 
conference Thursday afternoon, "Now is a time when we should 
mobilize all possible means." He said his government has been 
led to doubt if the government should or can carry on efforts to 
resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. "We cannot fulfill 
what have been agreed on at this time when North Korea has not 
kept agreed matters," Ambassador Kim said. He thus hinted that 
the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks could be put 
off indefinitely and the `94 Team Spirit exercise carried out. 
  Kim said North Korea has expressly violated the agreement it 
reached with the IAEA on last Feb. 15 and another it made with 
the United States on Feb. 25. 
  Saying that a final decision would depend on the outcomes of 
the next inter-Korean working-level contact slated for March 19 
and a special IAEA Board of Governors meeting on March 21, the 
ambassador said, however, "The patience of the international 
community let alone our government's has almost exhausted." 
  Regarding the issue of Patriot missiles, he said that no 
final decision has been made yet on the matter. "But, if it 
becomes impossible to resolve the nuclear issue through 
dialogue, we don't see any reason why we should delay their 
deployment in Korea especially because the Patriots are 
basically defensive weapons," Kim said. 
  He said that if and when the special IAEA Board of Governors 
meeting refers the North Korean nuclear issue to the United 
Nations Security Council, the Seoul government would respect and 
follow the decision. "At this moment, our government is really 
tired and feels the strong skepticism if we should continue to 
regard North Korea as the other side in dialogue," Kim said.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- Seoul, Washington and 
Vienna were all in limbo Thursday, faced with having to make a 
crucial political decision within days on the North Korean 
nuclear row. 
  The decision due on March 21 will determine whether the 
international community continues to pursue peaceful dialogue 
with North Korea or seeks punitive measures through the UN 
Security Council. 
  While the likelihood of the latter option is higher now, the 
inclination in Seoul is still toward dialogue. 
  The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
wasted no time in briefing its board of governors on the status 
of two-week inspections in North Korea that ended Tuesday. IAEA 
inspectors hurried back to Vienna and reported directly to 
Director-General Hans Blix, who immediately briefed the governor 
states. 
  A statement issued after the briefing said "important 
measures " agreed between the agency and North Korea had not 
been carried out at the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, 
widely regarded as a reprocessing plant and the core of 
Pyongyang's suspected nuclear program. 
  The IAEA went to North Korea to verify that the stalinist 
state had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses 
since the last visit in August, but after the fortnight of 
inspections, the agency ruled it "was not in a position to 
verify." 
  In a wild twist, the North Korean nuclear situation has gone 
back beyond the starting point -- March 12 last year when 
Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  Before then, at least, the seals on equipment at the 
radiochemical laboratory were intact and the IAEA had full 
access to all of North Korea's seven declared sites including 
this lab. 
  It's becoming clearer by the day that Pyongyang is pressing 
Washington to hold the promised third round of high-level 
dialogue while giving the bare minimum in return. 
  Seoul officials say this is why North Korea allowed 
something 
approaching -- but not quite -- full IAEA inspections and why 
Pyongyang keeps alive the inter-Korean dialogue while blocking 
progress on an envoy exchange, one precondition to the 
high-level talks. 
  The IAEA convenes a special board of governors meeting next 
Monday. The likelihood of the agency declaring a break in North 
Korean safeguards is low because the political consequences 
would be too heavy. 
  Such a declaration would automatically send the issue to the 
UN Security Council and start a process leading up to gradual 
economic sanctions. 
  Officials here say the decision is entirely up to the IAEA, 
but the agency won't be able to ignore the views of Seoul and 
Washington, which still see room for negotiation. 
  Seoul is expected to continue working-level dialogue with 
Pyongyang on exchanging envoys, helping fulfill this 
precondition. 
  Washington is likely to contact Pyongyang and press for 
further IAEA negotiations on checking the restricted 
installations so that they can go ahead with the high-level 
meeting, even if it is postponed to after March 21.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu and U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner 
discussed initiating a new phase of countermeasures in the North 
Korean nuclear dispute, Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday. 
  Wisner, in Seoul since Monday, met with Han for an hour-long 
talk to evaluate the current crisis over nuclear inspections in 
the North and stalled inter-Korean dialogue, said Chang 
Chae-yong, director-general of the American Affairs Bureau. 
  The two officials discussed what to expect next -- either 
North Korea meeting the South Korean and U.S. demands or 
continuing with its present attitude of refusal, he said. 
  In case of the latter, Han and Wisner agreed their countries 
may need to enter into a new phase of countermeasures. 
  "Countermeasures are under preparation for such an event," 
Chang said. 
  Asked whether they talked about deployment of Patriot 
missiles and resuming this year's South Korea-U.S. joint 
military drill "Team Spirit," Chang indirectly said yes by 
adding, "of course, issues related to security in light of the 
present situation were addressed."

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 17 March 
react to the seventh South-North working-level contact to 
exchange special envoys which was held at Panmunjom yesterday. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO, the conservative CHOSON ILBO, the 
moderate HANGUK ILBO, and the moderate CHUNGANG ILBO all carry 
800-word editorials on page 3, pointing out that the North 
side's insincere attitude resulted in the lack of results in the 
16 March inter-Korean contact. The CHOSON ILBO editorial, in 
particular, urges the government to come up with a new long-term 
policy on North Korea, noting that "we have lost the initiative 
in talks because our North Korean policy has no basis or 
principle." 
  CHOSON ILBO also carries a 900-word article by reporter An 
Hui-chang on page 3 which cites the analysis of observers that 
"North Korea's strategy is to link the issue of allowing 
additional inspections with the issue of holding the third-round 
North Korean-U.S. talks, because it believes that assuming a 
rigid attitude and utilizing the inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency as an ace card will result in 
the United States again acceding to negotiations." Meanwhile, a 
1,200 word article by Ku Pon-yong on page 4 in the 
pro-government SEOUL SINMUN attributes North Korea's "inactive 
attitude" on the envoy exchange to its concern that this will 
lead to a rapid improvement in South-North relations, which may 
then lead to popular unrest in North Korea where "systemic 
crisis caused by serious economic difficulties" exists. This 
article also points out that North Korea's insistence on direct 
negotiations with the United States aims to effect improved 
relations with the United States while gaining economic aid from 
it, and also serves to "estrange the ROK from the United States." 
  Chong Pyong-chin's 1,000-word article in the moderate HANGUK 
ILBO predicts that the voices of hardliners in the South Korean 
Government will likely increase with the lack of progress in the 
last inter-Korean working-level contact. The article says 
people are suspicious that "North Korea and the United States 
agreed on terms that the public is unaware of before announcing 
their agreement on 25 February" and that "the United States is 
conversely using the `North Korean card' against the ROK." The 
article adds that these reasons were cited by certain sections 
of the government in their "insistence" on reviewing ROK-U.S. 
relations. 
  Kang Tae-ho's 1,000-word article in the left-leaning 
HANGYORE 
SINMUN criticizes both the South and the North for the lack of 
progress in their working-level contacts. Remarking on the 
South side's "active and offensive" attitude and the North 
side's "inactive and defensive" posture in the dialogue, the 
article points out the South's "undesirable attitude of 
provoking the North by mentioning the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks." The article anticipates that South and 
North Korea will also fail to reach agreement in the next 
contact slated for 19 March, and that South and North Korea will 
probably enter again into "a phase of harsh confrontation" so 
that talk of the "uselessness of dialogue" abounds in South 
Korea, North Korea, and the United States. 
  Reporter An Song-ki of the CHUNGANG ILBO simply argues in a 
900-word article on page 5 that North Korea is insisting on the 
announcement of a joint South-North communique because it 
intends to "shift the responsibility to South Korea and the 
United States if the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks 
fail."

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
reportedly made an unofficial decision to designate the 
northwestern coast from Sinuiju to Nampo as its second free 
economic zone. 
  Pyongyang earlier sent officials to study China's coastal 
economic zones, who came to realize that the current 
Najin-Sonbong free trade zone on the northeastern coast was too 
regionally closed and less attractive to foreign investors due 
to insufficient infrastructure, according to a report by the 
Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (Kotra) representative in Beijing. 
  Instead, the North Koreans are expected to designate the 
northwestern coast bewtween Nampo and Sinuiju, which is adjacent 
to China, as a new economic zone. 
  North Korea has already started moving residents near the 
Amnok River and Sinuiju and is preparing to build a railway 
linking the far Western coastal city with Pyongyang. 
  The Stalinist country is expected to announce the opening of 
the two port cities on Sept. 9, timed with its 46th anniversary. 
  Once Sinuiju and Nampo are named a free economic zone, the 
area is likely to draw more foreign investment than the 
Najin-Sonbong zone in the initial stage, Kotra officials said. 
  The Najin-Sonbong zone is expected to be developed as a 
center for export-oriented industry and entrepot trade, while 
the Sinuiju-Nampo area will be promoted as a complex for light 
industry, the officials said.

  [Text] There are well-known spy organizations in the world, 
such as the U.S. CIA, the former Soviet Union's KGB, Israel's 
Mossad, and Britain's MI6. However, it is the North Korean spy 
organization that can do us direct harm. 
  President Kim Yong-sam, in a recent meeting with Yi Ki-taek, 
representative of the opposition Democratic Party, said that 
North Korea has continued to send its spies to the South. The 
North Korean spy organization is often called "Office Complex 
No. 3." Mr. An Myong-chin, former North Korean spy who defected 
to the South crossing the DMZ last September, disclosed the 
status of the North Korean spy organization in the April issue 
of Japanese monthly THIS IS YOMIURI. 
  The North Korean spy training institute has changed its name 
several times. It was called Kumgang School when its was 
established in 1945, Kumsong Political and Military School in 
the mid-sixties, Political School Directly Belonging to the 
Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee in the eighties, 
and Kim Chong-il Political and Military College in January 1992. 
The spy training school is located in the Yongsong District in 
Pyongyang, a mountainous area in the outskirts of Pyongyang. 
The school is under the WPK Operations Department, which 
specializes in southward operations. The school site covers an 
area of a 10 km radius. Kim Hyon-hui, the terrorist who blasted 
the Korean airliner, was also trained in this school. To become 
a student of this school, one has to have a clean record and a 
good background, good health, and a good brain. There are about 
400 trainers. 
  After graduation, the students are attached to the 
Operations 
Department (headed by O Kuk-yol), Social and Cultural Department 
(head unknown), the Reunification Front Department (headed by 
Kang Chu-il), or the External Information Investigation 
Department--commonly called the Investigation 
Department--(headed by Kwon Hui-kyong). All these departments 
are under the WPK. Of these, the Operations, Social and 
Cultural, and Reunification Front Departments are charged with 
southward operations. Spies attached to the Operations 
Department take the role of guiding other spies when they 
infiltrate the ROK through the DMZ, or sometimes they themselves 
infiltrate the South. The task of the Social and Cultural 
Department is to plant long-term permanent spies or intelligence 
organizations in the ROK. The role of the Reunification Front 
Department is to conduct open activities, such as the 
inter-Korean dialogue. 
  The Investigation Department is charged with overseas 
clandestine operations [haewoe kongjak]. Those from the spy 
training institute's branch schools are mostly assigned to these 
operations. Branch schools are called differently in each 
district, such as Kumgangsan District, Myohyangsan District, 
Chilbosan District. Kim Hyon-hui received his Investigation 
Department training in the Myohyangsan District branch school 
for one year beginning in 1981. The spy training institute, 
currently called Kim Chong-il Political and Military College, 
operates a model town -- also under the Social and Cultural 
Department -- where trainees can accustom themselves to the 
living environment of the South. 
  The trainees numbered 100 in 1945 when the training 
institute 
was first established, 450 in the eighties, and 300 in 1989, 
showing a considerable change between periods. The training 
period was one year initially. It was increased to three and 
four years, and then fixed at five years since 1991 because of 
the requirement for more sophisticated spy techniques with the 
passage of time. 
  Spy training, which begins at 0600 and ends at 2200, is 
harsh 
and varied, covering areas such as blasting, swimming, diving, 
parachuting, infiltration, abduction, martial arts, 
communications, and driving. In the case of shooting, the 
trainee is trained to shoot at a target from the front, the 
rear, and while running after it to ensure that the bullet hits 
the target under any conditions. Trainees learn to use various 
guns, such as Chinese, Russian, Czech, U.S., and Canadian guns. 
Trainees sometimes concentrate solely on shooting training for 
a month, and have to shoot about 25,000 bullets before 
graduation. Trainees are trained to infiltrate into the ROK; 
therefore, they have to learn thoroughly about the life in the 
ROK. For this, there is an 8-km-long miniature model town 
depicting the ROK landscape. There is a street with a 
restaurant, coffee shop, supermarket, stationery store, and 
movie theater. Traffic signals and pedestrian crossings are the 
same as those in Seoul. There is a subway and a bus terminal. 
The trainees buy things with South Korean money and see movies 
here and learn about life in the South. Mr. An, who defected to 
the South, testified that the subway and the bus terminal in 
Seoul are exactly the same as those in the model town. 
  Mr. An saw ROK movies and read newspapers in the model town. 
As for newspapers, CHOSON ILBO and TONG-A ILBO are delivered 
three days after they are published. 
  Mr. An was assigned to the "715 liaison office" and went 
through infiltration training twice, going as far as 2 km south 
of the DMZ and returning to the training base. The training's 
objective was to check the ROK Army's guard and develop 
infiltration routes. The training was mainly conducted at night. 
Mr. An said that he had heard from his trainer that 200 to 300 
of the 1,000 North Korean spies have infiltrated South Korea.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rash U.S. Trade Offensive--Application of </F>
Antimonopoly Act to Foreign Countries Hampers World Trade"] 
  [Text] The U.S. attitude in handling international issues 
has lost prudence and is now dashing toward a dangerous aspect. 
No one can dare confront the United States politically or 
militarily after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Economic 
relations issues are not simple because the forces that retain 
enough power to resist the United States economically still 
remain and because the stronghold in economy is economic power, 
just as the last stronghold in international politics is 
military power. These forces are none other than the European 
Union and Asian countries. The United States' economic offensive 
is now focused on the Asian region, including Japan. The weight 
of U.S. trade with Asia is greater than with Europe. In 
particular, there is a great trade U.S.-Japanese trade 
imbalance. This is precisely the very important reason for the 
United States to justify its offensive. 
  It was revealed that the United States pressured Japan to 
drastically relax its restrictions after it invoked the Super 
301 trade law -- defying public opinion of the world. In 
addition, a "rumor" that the United States will apply its 
domestic Anti-Monopoly Act to overseas countries spread. We 
have suspicions about the true intention of the U.S. 
indiscriminate offensive. We cannot but make precautions against 
consequences arising from such an offensive. The U.S. demand for 
Japan's relaxation of restrictions for 45 items includes some 
items that infringe upon Japanese sovereignty. In other words, 
this demand includes such requests as establishment of a 
third-party inspection organization independent from the 
government and participation of foreigners in examining 
relaxation of restrictions. Even the order for expanding 
facilities of airport storage facilities and for lowering the 
airport utility rate is included in the request. One can hardly 
judge whether this is a demand to ease trade barriers or an act 
to interfere in the administration of other countries. 
  The U.S. policy to apply the Anti-Monopoly Act overseas, 
which was put forward with "a new bayonet," is a retaliatory act 
that has lost reason. It was noted that the United States is 
going to apply this law so it affects not only the U.S. markets, 
but also U.S. exports. Based on a literal interpretation, it 
can be noted that all organizations that produce commodities 
that are not competitive belong in this category. For example, 
large business groups in the ROK must be immediately dissolved 
if they want to continue trading with the United States. We do 
not mean that we want to protect monopolizing acts of large 
business groups, but we wonder if such a reorganization of world 
trade is possible. Are U.S. business groups fully prepared for 
this? The U.S. act means that the United States will lecture on 
antimonopoly and will punish monopolies, while actually building 
barriers for its own monopolies in domains of various services 
and intellectual properties and collecting royalties on its 
monopolized sale. 
  The effort to establish world trade through transactions 
based on fair competition is a different issue from the U.S. act 
of enforcing its domestic order onto the world. Frankly 
speaking, we feel a great sense of danger and threat regarding 
the U.S. intention to reorganize the world into a "U.S.-style." 
When the Super 301 trade law was invoked, THE NEW YORK TIMES 
published prudent advice to Clinton that efforts to reduce 
domestic consumption should be made first, instead of adhering 
to an indiscriminate offensive overseas, to eliminate deficits 
in U.S. trade with Japan. It should be deservedly coped with if 
Japan and other countries repeatedly carry out unfair acts, 
including monopoly. Means and method, however, should not be 
decided on the basis of a U.S. yardstick. Some unreasonable 
steps that the United States has recently taken are regarded 
merely as acts to cause trade disputes rather than cause an 
increase in trade.

  [Text] Pusan, March 17 (YONHAP) -- As the American 
Consulate and the American Center here have been unduly using a 
state-owned building without paying rent, public voices are 
rising that the American authorities should pay back rent and 
return the building to Korea. Public criticism is directed also 
to the arbitrary expansion by the consulate of the first and 
third floors of the three-story building without obtaining 
permission from Pusan municipal authorities. 
  On Wednesday the consulate authorities even prevented Pusan 
Chung-ku Ward officials trying to look into the illegal floor 
space expansion from entering the building on the ground that 
they had come without giving an advance notice. The building, 
originally owned by a Japanese co. in 1919, was used by U.S. 
occupation forces upon national liberation and later by the 
American Consulate beginning September 1948 upon the 
inauguration of the Korean Government. 
  In 1970 the government had the Office of National Tax 
Administration own the building. The ownership of the building 
was turned over to the Chung-ku Ward of Pusan in 1983. However, 
the government failed to collect rent from or even conclude any 
lease agreement with the consulate on the excuse of special 
relationship between Korea and the United States. Chung-ku Ward 
officials say that the unauthorized expansion of the floor space 
is definitely a violation of the construction law, but they 
cannot take any action against it any longer because the 
three-year period of prescription expired long before. 
  Faced with the mounting public criticism, the American 
Consulate and Center plan to move to elsewhere. Consul Edward 
Kloth of the consulate called at the Pusan Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry on last March 11 and, while saying he would like to 
move their offices to elsewhere, inquired about rent and other 
conditions of the chamber and nearby commercial buildings.

  [Text] Seoul, March 17 (YONHAP) -- The chairman of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party, Kim Chong-pil, will visit China 
in the second half of this year at the invitation of the Chinese 
Communist Party, preceded by DLP Secretary-general Mun Chong-su, 
who may travel to Beijing as early as April. 
  DLP Deputy Secretary-general Cho Pu-yong met with the deputy 
head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese 
Communist Party, Zhu Shanqing, on Thursday here to discuss 
expanding cooperation and exchanges. At the working-level 
meeting, the two sides agreed that the DLP will send a five- to 
seven-member mission led by Secretary-general Mun to China as 
early as April. 
  But DLP Chairman Kim's visit to Beijing, which was scheduled 
for the first half of the year, has been postponed to the second 
half because President Kim Yong-sam will go to China soon. 
  In return for Mun's visit to China, Beijing will send a 
high-level delegation to Seoul headed by a party Politburo 
member or cabinet minister.

  [Text] Soldiers from Indonesia and Australia are to take 
part in military exercises over the next four weeks. A team of 
25 Australian soldiers from the Special Air Service will take 
part in Exercise Night Komodo in Indonesia. At the same time, a 
contingent from Indonesia's special forces will undergo training 
in Australia's Exercise Kookaburra. 
  A statement from the Australian Defense Department said the 
training will concentrate on basic military skills relevant to 
special forces, including weapons practice, parachuting, 
navigation, and communications. The department said Indonesian 
troops would use Australian facilities in Perth to train to 
retake an aircraft after a hijack.

  [Text] The Australian Defense Force is to train soldiers 
from an Indonesian Army unit that Amnesty International has 
linked with the torture of East Timorese. The program is part 
of the federal government's plan to develop closer links with 
the Indonesian military. Prime Minister Paul Keating says 
Australia's defense relationship with Indonesia is the key to 
establishing defense in and with Asia. David Pembrook asked 
Brigadier Adrian Danger to explain the training the Indonesians 
would undertake during their stay. 
  [Begin recording] [Danger] Well, the Indonesian Special 
Forces will be operating with our Special Forces in the west in 
counter hijack training. We have arguably one of the best 
facilities in the world for teaching people how to deal with 
(?quick) counter terrorist operations, and specifically how to 
deal with hijacked aircraft. 
  [Pembrook] Is that the only training they will be 
undertaking? 
  [Danger] Oh, they will be undertaking some other basic 
training such as communications and the like. But that is the 
major emphasis here and that is very important to the public of 
Australia and to the general public of Indonesia. We need to 
have a mutual confidence, if you like, that if a Qantas airliner 
with a whole bunch of Australians is hijacked in Indonesia, in 
Jakarta, that those skills are there to safeguard the traveling 
public. Conversely, we need to have confidence that the 
Indonesians need to have confidence that if Garuda is hijacked, 
at say, Mascot, then they know that we have those skills, and 
that exchange is reasonably common among Special Forces around 
the world. 
  [Pembrook] But do you as a spokesperson for the Defense 
Forces have any misgivings about training soldiers from a unit 
who were alleged to have been involved in the torture and 
suppression of minorities in their country. 
  [Danger] Look, Amnesty International from time to time will 
make remarks as they do against the internal affairs of 
Indonesia, against human rights issues in other countries around 
the world, including Australia. That is not the concern of our 
task in terms of counter hijack. 
  [Pembrook] But at the same time, do you have any misgivings 
that we are skilling these people up, even though it is to do 
with counter terrorism, that we are indeed improving the skills 
of these people, who according to Amnesty are involved in the 
suppression of minorities in Indonesia. 
  [Danger] No, we are not skilling these people to deal with 
internal affairs of Indonesia or any other country. These are 
skills which are specific to protecting the traveling public.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australia will next month play host to a regional 
conference on the issue of illegal movement of people -- 
so-called people smuggling. Eighteen Asian and Pacific nations 
are expected to take part as well as representatives from 
international bodies involved in immigration issues. 
  Australia's immigration minister, Nick Bolkus, says the 
practice amounts to slavery and has been growing in the 
Asia-Pacific region. Senator Bolkus told Linda Mottram it is a 
multi-billion dollar industry with organized crime links. 
  [Begin recording] [Bolkus] To the extent that people can be 
smuggled into places and money is there for this to be done, 
people are focussing on those countries that they can smuggle 
them into. Although I think for all of us there has been a 
cooperative spirit in the past in respect to these issues, but 
we think that by having this regional conference in Australia we 
can have a cooperative spirit building in a way that we can 
preempt some of the problems in our region. 
  [Mottram] What are the parallels specifically then between 
this consultation arrangement you have put in place and the 
agreed common plan of action in the eighties dealing with the 
Indochina boat people problem? 
  [Bolkus] Well, in respect to that I think that the plan of 
action -- the comprehensive plan of action -- had as its target 
the orderly processing of potential refugees, the orderly 
acceptance of those people, and of course, the orderly return of 
those who were determined not to be refugees. So, there is 
always an element of what to do with non bona fide refugees. 
When it comes to people smuggling, we have always got to accept 
that some people are bona fide refugees, but when you are 
talking about organized crime involvement in people smuggling, 
you have also got to accept that we are talking overwhelmingly, 
I think, of cases that do not fit within our refugee category. 
The current approach is worth dwelling on. The comprehensive 
plan of action we got together with other countries in our 
region had worked on the problem which dealt with both refugees 
and non refugees. In this case, we are getting together once 
again with the countries in our region and other international 
mechanisms to once again work at, in this case, for greater 
priority on illegal smuggling, but also recognizing a need to be 
sensitive to the bona fide refugees. 
  [Mottram] The Indochinese issue is of course a trigger for 
quite some significant regional attention from time to time. Do 
you see a similar regional heat being generated over people 
smuggling? 
  [Bolkus] I don't think so. I think already there have been 
discussions, for instance with the USA and China, on this issue. 
Our region is fully aware of the problem and I think many 
countries in the region can see themselves as being targets of 
this specific problem and they don't like it. So I think there 
is a common awareness, common direction in our region to: one, 
recognize the problem; two, define the extent of it; and three, 
work together to try and overcome it. But I think when you have 
got that common bond in the early stage that we have now, I 
think you are actually working toward overcoming the tensions 
down the road. 
  I think we should look at previous experience. Tensions 
arose because countries are caught flat footed. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia's annual economic growth rate is now 
stated at 4 percent, following the release of figures showing 
growth increase by 1.7 percent in the three months to last 
December. The figures confirmed that an economic recovery is 
underway in Australia. But economists say they are also likely 
to fuel renewed market speculation about an interest rate rise, 
despite comments by the prime minister, Paul Keating, last 
weekend that it was not the time for a rise. 
  The latest increase in growth is broadly based, with the 
official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing 
strengths in the housing sector, farming, retail spending, and 
manufacturing. The figures reflect a winding back of government 
spending as the recession eased, the slack being taken up in the 
private sector. However, growth in total business investment 
remained weak. Exports grew during the quarter by 2.2 percent, 
while imports were up by 1.3 percent.

  [Text] WELLINGTON, March 17 (AFP) -- New Zealand Thursday 
welcomed a United States decision to extend its moratorium on 
nuclear testing for another year and called on China to take 
similar action. 
  On Wednesday President Bill Clinton advised congress that 
the 
moratorium would be extended a year until September 1995. 
  Foreign Minister Don McKinnon welcomed the decision, saying 
it meant Clinton regarded worldwide restraint on testing as 
important in making progress in nuclear non-proliferation. 
  "New Zealand agrees," he said in a statement. "I hope other 
nuclear weapon states which have suspended testing programmes 
will be reassured by the US decision. I think we can take it 
that existing moratoria will be maintained. 
  "China still has to agree to a moratorium. 
  "It would be fitting for China to show restraint at a time 
when the world has justified expectations of an end to the 
development of these terrible weapons," McKinnon said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A Japanese auto industry 
leader Thursday [17 March] reacted strongly to a remark by U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in which he sought government 
guarantees of Japanese automakers' plans to expand purchases of 
U.S. auto parts. 
  Yutaka Kume, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association [AMA], told reporters that Kantor's comment, made 
earlier in the week, would dampen Japanese carmakers' efforts to 
help put Japan's trade ties with the United States back on a 
normal footing. Referring to a remark by International Trade 
and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai calling on Japanese 
automakers to quickly make public their auto parts purchase 
plans, Kume said it is an individual corporate problem and not a 
government issue. 
  Kume, who is also president of Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No. 
2 automaker, said the government should not comment on 
carmakers' plans, as this tends to cause misunderstanding.

  [Excerpts] Human resources development is the main topic to 
be proposed by Thailand in the upcoming informal meeting of the 
finance ministers of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, 
countries. Foreign Minister Prasong says the meeting -- to be 
held in Honolulu, Hawaii, during 18-19 March -- will be regarded 
as a consultation, not a negotiation. Finance Minister Tharin 
Nimmanhemin will represent Thailand at the meeting. [passage 
omitted] 
  Minister Prasong says the United States has proposed the 
setting up of a business convention center in Asia and the 
Pacific, if APEC countries will select two business people to 
attend the business conference as proposed by the United States. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has entrusted the Board of 
Trade of Thailand and the Federation of Thai Industries to 
select qualified persons to take part in the business conference.

<F P=106> [Report by Dinh Khai on the ceremony held in Hanoi on the </F>
morning of 16 March to welcome Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
-- recorded] 
  [Summary] At 1130 sharp, the motorcade escorting Prime

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Foot-Dragging Tactic Aimed </F>
at Attaining Sinister Purpose"] 
  [Text] The South side's maneuvers to use the issue of 
exchanging special envoys as a means to attain its sinister 
political aims are all the more viciously carried out. 
  As it has already been known, our side resumed the 
working-level contact for the exchange of North-South special 
envoys in accordance with the agreements reached at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, and thus made a series of 
progress in realizing the envoy exchange. 
  Out of the position to realize the exchange of North-South 
special envoys at the earliest possible date in a good 
atmosphere, our side took a magnanimous and momentous step at 
the sixth working- level contact, taking note of the fact that 
the South side has expressed understanding of the feasibility of 
the four just demands our side raised, even though on the whole 
is short of our expectations. As a result, a bright prospect 
for the exchange of special envoys was opened for the North and 
South. 
  Since then, our side again called on the South side at the 
recent contact to return to the position of reconciliation and 
unity and accept our side's just proposal on announcing a joint 
communique. In addition, our side urged that the two sides 
should wind up the discussion of working procedures and conclude 
an agreement on the basis of the North-tabled agreement on the 
exchange of North-South presidential envoys. 
  The reason we insisted on announcing the joint communique is 
because it would be a chance for the two sides to confirm that 
special envoys would certainly be exchanged. Thus, this would 
give hope to the fellow countrymen and mark a turning point for 
North-South relations. Announcing the joint communique would 
give an opportunity for the two sides to wind up the discussion 
of working procedures on the envoy exchange at an early date. 
  At a time when people at home and abroad express concern 
over 
the prospect for the envoy exchange, the fact that the North and 
South, the parties concerned, reaffirm their will for the envoy 
exchange and agree to exchange special envoys at the earliest 
possible date would be a good thing, seen from every point of 
view. 
  If the South side truly wants to exchange special envoys 
with 
us, it is reasonable to show its intention by welcoming and 
responding to our claim on announcing a joint communique 
regarding the issue of the exchange of special envoys. 
Nevertheless, the South side repeatedly made the same old 
remarks again and opposed our side's proposal. 
  It recklessly failed to agree with our proposal without a 
reasonable basis. This proves that it has no will for the 
exchange of special envoys, and that for it to come forth to the 
working-level delegates' contact for the exchange of special 
envoys is only to give the impression it is holding talks with 
the North. 
  Even in the discussion of the working procedures, the South 
side insisted on an unreasonable position, and did not accept 
principle and important issues such as the issue of defending 
the principle of national independence, of concluding the method 
for the fatherland's reunification, and of promoting great 
national unity, which is related to the duties of the special 
envoys. 
  The principle and important issues that our side put forth 
in 
connection with the duties of the special envoys of both sides 
all embody the three principles of the fatherland's 
reunification and guarantee the improvement of North-South 
relations. 
  The fact the South side did not accept the issue of 
defending 
the national independence shows that it will continue to prevent 
the fatherland's reunification by currying favor with outside 
forces. Also, not accepting the issue of concluding the method 
for the fatherland's reunification means to continue division. 
Moreover, opposing the issue of promoting great national unity 
is to continue to move toward the road of confrontation, not 
national reconciliation and unity. 
  On 15 March, a fellow called the puppet minister of the 
National Unification Board officially babbled that the 
working-level delegates' contact would end in failure. This is 
by no means a coincidence. 
  Ultimately, this clearly shows that the South Korean 
authorities do not have the intention to exchange special envoys 
nor the will to resolve the fatherland's reunification issue 
through the method of dialogue and negotiations. 
  The dark intention of the South side not accepting our 
principle issue was to delay the exchange of special envoys so 
as to cast a shadow in the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and 
plot to harm the fellow countrymen. 
  The people of the world came to correctly know who wants to 
achieve the exchange of special envoys and who opposes it, 
through the betrayal act of the South side, which is moving 
backward when the exchange of special envoys is at an important 
occasion of being realized. 
  It will be good for the South side to contemplate over the 
grave consequence the maneuver to delay the exchange of special 
envoys will bring about. Having regrets is always too late. 
  The South side must not play a double game to prevent the 
exchange of special envoys, but should sincerely come forth at 
the next contact. We will carefully watch over the South side's 
attitude.

  [Text] Following inspection of North Korea, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has concluded that it 
cannot exclude the possibility of additional plutonium 
production in North Korea and has decided to work out sanction 
measures against North Korea by convening a special Board of 
Governors meeting on 21 March. 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: 
  [Begin Cha recording] The IAEA has concluded that the recent 
inspection of North Korea is unsatisfactory [manjok suropchi 
motada]. 
  In an unofficial Board of Governors meeting urgently 
convened 
yesterday [16 March], Director-General Hans Blix revealed that 
North Korea refused to allow the inspection team to conduct 
various activities, including the extraction of sample materials 
from the radiochemical laboratory which is a core target of the 
current inspection. Thus, the IAEA director-general said that 
the IAEA could not examine whether or not nuclear material was 
diverted for other purposes and that the possibility of 
additional plutonium production in North Korea cannot be 
excluded. 
  During this inspection, North Korea refused any extraction 
by 
the the inspection team of sample material from the plutonium 
refining facility. In addition, it refused to allow inspection 
activities surveying (the ?uniformity) of radioactivity in many 
parts of the radiochemical laboratory. Therefore, the suspicion 
of additional plutonium production by North Korea has been 
raised. 
  The IAEA concluded that North Korea's breaking of the 
agreement it previously made by refusing inspections of its core 
facilities is a serious situation. Thus, the IAEA decided to 
convene a special Board of Governors meeting on 21 March with 
the consent of member states of the Board of Governors. 
  At the special Board of Governors meeting on 21 March, the 
IAEA will urge North Korea to sincerely fulfill the nuclear 
accords, will adopt a resolution on sanctions against North 
Korea, and will report the inspection result to the UN Security 
Council. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
cannot guarantee any market-opening measures to be announced by 
Japan's auto industry regarding imports of auto parts, a 
government source said Thursday. "It's impossible to do what is 
impossible even if U.S. Trade Representative (Mickey) Kantor 
cries out," the source said. 
  Kantor, speaking before the House Trade Subcommittee on 
Tuesday, pointed to a need for government guarantees to ensure 
that the planned steps by the auto industry are effective in 
boosting purchases of U.S. auto parts. 
  Japanese trade officials dismissed Kantor's remark, saying 
the government cannot control business activities as doing so 
runs counter to the government policy of deregulation.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Japan will not take 
additional steps to boost purchases of foreign-made 
semiconductors, a senior Trade Ministry official said Thursday. 
Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, 
told a press conference that Tokyo is doing its utmost to expand 
foreign chip buying. 
  Kumano was responding to newspaper reports that the United 
States has urged Tokyo to formulate new action plans on chip 
trade, including the government encouraging the auto and 
telecommunications sectors to step up foreign chip buying and 
extending the current chip accord calling for the 20 percent 
foreign share in the Japanese market for additional years. The 
reported U.S. requests are similar to those shown in the 
bilateral chip trade talks in January, Kumano said. 
  Washington may renew these demands in the ongoing Hawaii 
talks to assess the chip trade performance in October-December 
of 1993 but Japan has no intention of taking new measures, 
Kumano said. 
  Kumano said the latest accord between Tokyo and Washington 
over cellular phone trade cannot be applied to auto and other 
trade issues covered under the "framework" talks. 
  The comment came in response to Washington's reported 
request 
in the past several days for Tokyo to ensure results in auto 
trade areas on the basis of the approach used in settling the 
trade dispute between Motorola Inc. and Nippon Idou Tshushin 
Corp. (IDO). 
  Telecommunications trade is different from autos, Kumano 
said, explaining that the former sector is under government 
regulations, allowing room for government intervention. 
  It is "impossible" for the government to force automakers to 
guarantee the size of their parts buying from the U.S., Kumano 
said. Such a request would strip Tokyo of its willingness to 
make efforts to get the stalled framework talks rolling again, 
he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Japan wants to discuss 
with the United States legal systems for the advanced 
telecommunication tool called multimedia in the next bilateral 
talks to head off future trade friction in the area, government 
officials said Thursday [17 March]. 
  The officials of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry 
said the next regular telecommunication talks between the 
ministry and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission are 
slated in Tokyo this summer. They said, under the current legal 
systems in Japan, such services as telephones are regulated by 
telecommunication law, while services like cable television are 
controlled by broadcasting law. Legally, an organization can 
operate in both fields. 
  Providing multimedia services -- a combination of both 
telecommunications and broadcasting -- is therefore allowed to 
any company except for organizations like Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT), KDD [Kokusai Denshin Denwa] and Japan 
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK). Yet, the officials said, new 
regulations have to be considered in actual multimedia services, 
including ways to control privacy. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. Government, pushing for an advanced 
communication technology called information superhighway, is 
apparently considering changing laws which now prohibit 
organizations to operate in both telecommunication and 
broadcasting fields, the officials said. Japan therefore wants 
to suggest that this issue be taken up in the next talks so the 
two nations can adjust respective legal systems regarding the 
advanced telecommunication field, they said.

  [Text] Yokohama, March 17 KYODO -- Police arrested two 
U.S. Navy seamen Thursday [17 March] in the port city of 
Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, on suspicion of maliciously inflicting 
bodily harm to a Japanese man. Police said the two seamen, one 
19 and the other 20, of the Yokosuka U.S. Naval base, were 
suspected of attacking an employee of a local public office as 
he was returning home around Wednesday midnight. 
  The 31-year-old victim told police that three black men 
approached him on the pretext of asking directions, sprayed him 
with a mace-like substance and then punched him in the face. 
  Police said the two arrested men were among a group of three 
persons who fled when they were approached. One of the three 
escaped pursuit. 
  The 20-year-old was identified as Bernard Constantine, a 
petty officer, second class. The name of the 19-year-old was 
not released because of his status as a minor. 
  An investigation is continuing to see if the arrested seamen 
are linked to two muggings on Wednesday night perpetrated by a 
group of three black men.

<F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa wants his March 19-21 visit to China to emphasize the 
development of future ties with Japan's neighbor rather than 
dwell too much on the past, government officials said. 
  During the trip that will take him to Beijing and Shanghai, 
Hosokawa is scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin and Premier 
Li Peng to discuss bilateral and international affairs, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  In Shanghai, he will visit the Pudong development district 
and attend a luncheon hosted by Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. 
  The officials predict that recent exchanges between Japanese 
and Chinese leaders will result in "frank discussions." 
  Jiang visited Japan in April 1992, while Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko toured China in October of that year. 
  Under Hosokawa's government, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
met Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in September, and 
Hosokawa held talks with Jiang in Seattle in November. In 
January this year, Hata visited Beijing and Chinese Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji came to Japan last month. 
  Officials said Hosokawa will express Japan's continued 
support for Beijing's market-oriented reforms and backing for 
China's bid to become a member of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
  Hosokawa said earlier this week there are no major pending 
issues between the two nations. He cited the signing of a 
bilateral environmental treaty and discussions on North Korea's 
alleged development of nuclear weapons as events scheduled 
during the trip. 
  Japan has closely consulted with the United States, South 
Korea and China over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
program, agreeing to seek a "diplomatic solution" to the problem. 
  Hosokawa is expected to urge Beijing to continue its efforts 
to persuade Pyongyang to allow international inspections of all 
its nuclear cites to eliminate international concern that it is 
developing nuclear weapons, the officials said. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday 
that North Korea refused to allow IAEA inspectors to conduct 
tests at a laboratory in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers northwest 
of the capital. Washington said a third round of talks with 
Pyongyang, scheduled for Monday, would be postponed because of 
the refusal. 
  Among other topics on the agenda for talks between Hosokawa 
and the Chinese leaders are disarmament and bilateral 
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, the officials said. 
  The officials said both sides will confirm that Tokyo and 
Beijing should work together to maintain the free trade system 
in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum while 
taking into account the region's diversity. 
  Japan and China will also seek to increase their dialogue on 
security matters, they said. 
  Hosokawa may be briefed by the Chinese on Sino-U.S. 
relations 
in the wake of last week's visit by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, the officials said. In that connection, 
Hosokawa may urge China to take immediate steps to improve its 
human rights record "in a way understandable to the 
international community," according to government sources. 
  Hosokawa is also likely to voice concern over China's 
increasing defense expenditure and call for greater openness or 
"transparency" in its defense budget, the sources said. Last 
week China announced an increase of some 22.4 percent over 1993 
in its defense budget to 52.04 billion yuan (about 653 billion 
yen), up from last year's 42.5 billion yuan (about 533 billion 
yen). 
  The officials said Hosokawa will also call on Beijing to 
institute a permanent ban on nuclear tests and ensure the 
peaceful transition of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. 
China resumed nuclear tests in October. 
  Hosokawa also plans to offer an apology over Japan's wartime 
atrocities by citing examples of such actions by the Japanese 
Imperial Army, but the specific wording has yet to be worked 
out, sources close to the prime minister said. 
  Hosokawa is also expected to tell the Chinese side what kind 
of projects Japan is interested in extending yen loans for from 
fiscal 1996. The Chinese Government has not yet given Japan an 
official list of projects it wants the loans to cover. 
  Under the environment cooperation treaty to be signed during 
Hosokawa's visit, Japan will provide China with technology to 
combat acid rain, and air and water pollution in the wake of 
China's rapid industrialization the officials said. 
  In the cultural field, Hosokawa is to pledge Japanese 
financial cooperation to restore Sheyuan Palace in the ancient 
capital of Xian, the officials said.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
briefed delegates of 35 member states today on the activities of 
the inspection team for North Korean nuclear facilities and 
established a policy to seek follow-up measures, including 
convening an emergency Board of Governors meeting, if the 
inspection activities and results are concluded to be 
unsatisfactory. 
  Following is a report by correspondent Cha Man-sun from 
Vienna: 
  [Begin Cha recording] The IAEA is in a dilemma that it could 
not easily show dissatisfaction although inspections on North 
Korean nuclear facilities, which had been resumed after much 
effort, were insufficient. 
  The IAEA had a meeting this afternoon presided by Director- 
General Hans Blix to evaluate inspection activities on North 
Korea after receiving a general report from the inspection team 
which has just returned. It has been learned that during the 
meeting, the inspection team reported that although inspections 
on North Korea do not meet the requirements of IAEA's check list 
but, compared with past inspections, there had been improvement 
in inspection activities, including the replacement of 
surveillance devices, and that the continuity of inspections can 
be recovered if such inspections continue regularly. 
  The inspection team also reported that not enough samples 
were extracted to prove whether or not North Korea had used 
nuclear materials for other purposes. 
  It is not yet known whether Director-General Hans Blix has 
concluded the inspection to be satisfactory or not after 
receiving the inspection team's report. It is analyzed that the 
Director- General will have difficulty to make an immediate 
conclusion because he has to take into account both the 
inspection's technical aspect and international political aspect. 
  The 35 member states of the IAEA will hold an emergency 
nonofficial Board of Governors meeting late tonight to receive a 
general report from the Director-General and to discuss 
follow-up measures for the inspection results. [end recording]

  [Text] Japan's JIJI news agency said in a report dispatched 
from Seoul that North Korea once asked the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team to provide it with $300,000 
in return for its allowance of nuclear inspections. 
  Quoting Seoul sources, JIJI reported that, although the IAEA 
inspection team has conducted inspections mainly in Yongbyon 
since 3 March, at one point North Korea refused inspection of 
its nuclear fuel rod plant after already agreeing to include it 
on the inspection list, and demanded that the IAEA provide 
$300,000 if it wanted to inspect this facility.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 16 March 
carry articles and editorials on the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's (IAEA) recent inspections of North Korean nuclear 
facilities. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 a 700-word 
editorial entitled "North Korea's Hindrance During the Nuclear 
Inspection." The editorial says: If the IAEA's judgment that its 
current inspection activities were "not sufficient" due to North 
Korea's hindrance turns out to be true, and if the alleged 
report that North Korea refused the IAEA inspection team access 
to the radiochemical laboratory is true, and that some seals in 
the laboratory were found to be destroyed is true this is "a 
grave problem" and shows that there is a possibility that North 
Korea might have converted its nuclear materials for military 
purposes. 
  The editorial also analyzes that the reasons for North 
Korea's acceptance of the IAEA's inspection this time were to 
avoid sanctions by the UN Security Council and to use its 
nuclear card in its diplomatic bargaining with the United States 
by turning the issue of inspecting two undeclared sites over to 
the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. The editorial then urges North 
Korea to show sincerity in the on-going North-South level 
contact for the exchange of top- level special envoys, stressing 
the need for the IAEA to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to 
the UN Security Council and for the governments of the ROK and 
the United States to resume the Team Spirit exercise if North 
Korea fails to carry out the preconditions that the two 
government have put forth. The editorial concludes by saying 
that in view of North Korea's recent attitude, it is almost 
impossible to expect momentous changes in its attitude. 
  Additionally, SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 4 a 1,000-word 
article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon analyzing the results of the 
just ended IAEA inspection. The article notes the ROK Government 
assessment of the IAEA's inspection, quoting a high-ranking 
government official as saying: "the IAEA's inspection seems to 
be satisfactory from a quantitative viewpoint," but it "does not 
seem to be satisfactory from a qualitative viewpoint." However, 
the article notes the IAEA inspection team's failure to collect 
sample materials from the radiochemical laboratory as well as 
IAEA and U.S. Government officials' negative assessments of the 
inspection results. 
  Noting that a final report on the inspection results will be 
released three to four weeks from now, the article says that if 
the continuity of safeguards is confirmed in the report or if 
North Korea's conversion of nuclear materials to military 
purposes is discovered, a special IAEA Board of Governors 
meeting will be automatically held regardless of whether or not 
the ROK and U.S. Governments want and, accordingly, the issue of 
imposing sanctions against North Korea will be discussed at the 
UN Security Council. 
  In conclusion, the article analyzes that the IAEA will 
conclude the current inspection at the present stage because it 
does not want the third round of the U.S.-DPRK talks to be 
broken up and that it will, accordingly, assume the attitude 
that the North Korean nuclear issue should be settled at the 
U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,200-word 
article on the prospects of the nuclear issue after the North 
Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's warning that North Korea may 
stop cooperating with IAEA inspections. 
  The article reports that the government analyzes that North 
Korea's response is to utter in advance that it "could not keep 
the promise made in the (25 February) agreement because the 
United States is demanding the exchange of special envoys which 
is not in the agreement." 
  The article speculates that because there can be no 
flexibility in the policy to have the special envoy exchange 
first despite North Korea's warning, the nuclear issue has to go 
back to the point before the 25 February agreement, and North 
Korea will have to try to negotiate with the United States again 
for the third round of talks and the ROK and the United States 
will have to discuss anew international sanctions on North Korea. 
  The article adds, however, that time is not on North Korea's 
side this time because the IAEA will hurry to have a special 
Board of Governors meeting and speed up discussions on referring 
the issue to the United Nations. 
  The article reports a "positive reverse" is also possible if 
North Korea agrees to postpone the third-round U.S.-North Korea 
talks. The article continues that some ROK and U.S. 
commentators expect the third-round talks in mid-April because 
it will be difficult for North Korea to ignore the benefit from 
extending a one-time invitation to the ROK special envoy to 
Pyongyang. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "Urging a Firm Stance on North 
Korea's Nuclear Card." Referring to the "unsuccessful" IAEA 
inspections, the editorial warns that North Korea is only 
hurrying itself to become an international orphan saying that 
"having the seals broken is no different from asking the nuclear 
issue to be referred to the UN Security Council." 
  The editorial also warns that it is a mistake if North Korea 
thinks it is better to deal with the United Nations than the 
IAEA. 
  The editorial points out ROK "mistakes of appeasement" and 
misinterpreting the "full-scope inspection" by which North Korea 
meant to open seven declared facilities, not unlimited 
inspections on all of its nuclear facilities. 
  The editorial urges both U.S. and ROK Governments to take a 
firm and resolute stance on the nuclear issue by announcing the 
resumption of the Team Spirit exercise.

  [Text] "Kim Il-song fears his own army most. If nuclear 
program is frustrated, a revolt is possible within a year" View 
of Park Gab-dong of "National Salvation Front," organization of 
defectors from North Korea. 
  "It is the Army that Kim Il-song of North Korea fears the 
most. The army of North Korea, much dissatisfied with Kim 
Il-song's system, they even exchanged fire with each other in 
front of Kim Il-song's official hall in the spring of last year. 
After that, by the demand of Kim Il-song, the ammunition of the 
army around Pyongyang were confiscated. 
  Temporarily returned to South Korea after taking part in the 
"Rally for Democratization and Recovery of Human Rights of North 
Korea," held under the auspices of "National Salvation Front for 
Democratic Unification of Korea" (National Salvation Front is 
short for it) in Washington D.C. last October 22, Mr. Park 
Gab-dong (74), the standing chairman of National Salvation 
Front, said that he had heard that "the Army of North Korea was 
very agitated." He thought that an internal coup could possibly 
dismantle Kim Il-song's system within two years." 
  Mr. Park said that he had heard the following from the 
members of the Front who participated in the Washington Rally as 
well as its members living in exile in Russia and China, etc. If 
a coup occurs in North Korea, the new military authorities, 
officers who are higher in rank than the colonel who had studied 
in the old Soviet Union, will become the main power in place of 
Kim Il-song Faction. 
  The National Salvation Front, whose standing chairman is Mr. 
Park, is an anti-Kim Il-song organization which was formed in 
Moscow in January, 1992 by the defectors from North Korea. Its 
executives are made up of Mr. Lee Sang-jo, ex-North Korean 
ambassador to USSR (a lieutenant general of the People's Army); 
Mr. Suh Hui, ex-chairman of Pyongyang Special City Party Chapter 
of Korean Workers Party; and Mr. Park. 
  The Central Standing Committee are made up of 15 members, 
who 
have all served as ranking executive members in the Korean 
Workers Party and People's Army. It includes Kang Sang-ho 
(ex-Vice Minister of Home Affairs), Chung Sang-jin (ex-Vice 
Minister of Culture and Art), Park Byong-yul (ex-Director of 
Kang Dong Political School), Yu Song-chul (ex-Chief of Operation 
Bureau of Supreme Headquarters of the People's Army), Chang 
Hak-bong (ex-Head of the Military Academy), Shim Su-chol 
(ex-Assistant Chief of Bureau of Ministry of People's Armed 
Forces), Yu Song-gol (ex-Head of the Air Force Academy), etc. 
The Front has a membership of about 300. 
  Its branches are set up in the USA, China, Japan, Kazakhstan 
and Uzbekistan Republics of Russia, among others. The National 
Salvation Front, through "National Salvation" published in three 
languages, Korean, English, and Japanese, is pushing for 
recovery of human rights of North Korea's 23 million people who 
are dying of hunger, cold, and physical beatings. Its supreme 
task is "to drive out Kim Il-song and his son." 
  The Front, in the Declaration of the Washington Rally, 
demanded eight items. These are: 1) Eviction of "Human 
slaughterer Kim Il-song and his son from office at once!" 2) 
release of political prisoners, 3) freedom of the press, 4) 
freedom of assembly and association, 5) freedom of residence, 6) 
right to choose occupation, 7) guarantee of the reunion of 
separated families, 8) guarantee of free hometown visits. 
Appealing to President Kim Young-sam to "keep an eye on the 
terrible scenes of North Korea's 23 million people who are 
forced to live like slaves, groaning under the tyranny of Kim 
Il-song and his son," the Front emphasized that "harmonizing 
with and helping Kim Il-song were quite the same as massacring 
the North Korean population." 
  The writer asked the Standing Committee Chairman of the 
Front, Park Gab-dong, who temporarily returned to South Korea, 
about the activities of the Front and the unrest of the North 
Korea's army as well as that of the population of which the 
Front knows. 
  To what extent is North Korea's army agitated? 
  "According to the information we obtained, North Korea, 
after 
the Gulf War, had officers higher in rank than regimental 
commanders watch the videotape of the Gulf War to let them know 
the American tactics of war. But it brought about a contrary 
effect. The commanders who watched the videotape realized that 
the outcome of modern war depends on up-to-date weapons. They 
are therefore infected with defeatism, saying that if North 
Korea with conventional weapons brought about a war, it would be 
defeated. The enlisted are in a very bad state of health due to 
long underground life and extremely demoralized due to long-term 
services." 
  Through what channels do you obtain information from the 
closed society of North Korea? 
  "We obtain information from Russia, China, Japan, etc. The 
details of the channels should not be disclosed for their 
personal safety." (According to the first issue of "National 
Salvation," the Front is working in cooperation with an anti-Kim 
Il-song organization in North Korea.) 
  You said that there was a gun battle in Pyongyang City, 
didn't you? 
  "To construct apartment buildings of 50,000 families in 
Pyongyang City in the spring of last year, North Korea enforced 
the construction, mobilizing a corps of military force in a 
district. The soldiers from the country, seeing that the 
soldiers serving in the Capitol were treated much better than 
themselves, forced their way to Kim Il-song's official hall to 
protest. As the Presidential Security Guards fired upon the 
soldiers to hold back, a gun battle broke out. After that, Kim 
Il-song ordered the troops around Pyongyang to surrender their 
ammunition." 
  If a gun battle had broken out, it must have been a big 
problem. 
  "Responsible persons were rebuked. But the corps commander 
of 
the troops mobilized from the country, lieutenant general Kim 
Song-il received immunity from responsibility, because he was 
the son of Kim Il-song and Mun Song-ja." 
  I haven't heard that there was a son called Kim Song-il 
among 
Kim Il-song's sons. 
  "That is because Kim Il-song's relations with women were not 
exposed. It is a widely known fact that Kim Song-il is Kim 
Il-song's son. According to the information we obtained, there 
is a fierce power struggle between the group of Kim Chong-il who 
is Kim Il-song's son and the other group of Kim Song-ae who is 
Kim Il-song's wife. Kim Song-il takes the neutral attitude. Kim 
Yong-sun, Kim Tal-hyon and Chang Song-taek (husband of Kim 
Kyong-hi, Kim Il-song's daughter) belong to Kim Chong-il's 
group. Kim Yong-ju, Kim Il-song's brother, and Kim Pyong-il, Kim 
Il-song's son, belong to Kim Song-ae's group." 
  It is said that a military coup was carried out and that the 
persons connected with it were executed in North Korea. 
  "Although we also heard of this, we were not able to confirm 
it. According to the information we obtained, a coup was carried 
out last July and some rebel army escaping from North Korea were 
besieged by North Korea's troops at a mountain near the border. 
At that time the Chinese Army moved in, which once took a stand 
against the North Korea's army. At about that time, North Korea 
limited entry of the pro-North Korean residents in Japan into 
the country. Such a measure has been very rare. The rumor of a 
coup circulated around this time." 
  Is there the possibility of a military coup in North Korea? 
  "Yes, as I said before, North Korea's military authorities 
are in much discontent and are infected with defeatism. If they 
were provided with ammunition, they will point their guns at 
Pyongyang. They are the most threatening power of and the only 
substitute power for Kim Il-song's system. Split into the old 
and new generations, the military authorities unitedly will 
seize power. Thereafter, the new generation will gain supremacy 
over the old generation, I expect." 
  What power do you mean by "the new generation of the 
military 
authorities" exactly? 
  "Ranking officers higher in rank than colonel, most of whom 
studied in the USSR, are the new military authorities. Because 
they served under the members of the Front in the past, they and 
the Front will, I think, understand each other. To restrain the 
new military authorities, Kim Il-song replaced company officers 
with those who did not study abroad, I heard." 
  When do you expect the coup by the new military authorities 
to break out? 
  "If the North Korea's nuclear program is sanctioned 
immediately by the U.N., a coup will break out within the year. 
If North Korea enters into diplomatic relations with the U.S. or 
Japan, it will endure another two years before collapsing. Even 
if the new military authorities seize power, the unification of 
North and South Koreas will be possible only after five to six 
years from that point," I suppose. 
  Will it be possible for North Korea to bring about a war? 
  "A rumor of an outbreak of a war is nothing but Kim 
Il-song's 
threat. How can he bring about a war with such out-of-date 
weapons and demoralized soldiers? Because South Korea's 
government does not react strongly to North Korea's threat, 
North Korea is spreading such a rumor." 
  How much information about North Korea's nuclear program do 
you have? 
  "We once obtained information that North Korea had requested 
a testing ground of nuclear bombs from the USSR under Brezhnev. 
Judging from this information, the nuclear weapons development 
of North Korea seems to have been ripe for testing. I also, 
during my stay in North Korea in 1956, heard a member of the 
South Korean Workers Party speak about the construction of 
nuclear weapons underground works. But nuclear weapons are 
merely a threat to South Korea and Japan, and can never be used." 
  Is there any power collaborating with the Front in North 
Korea? 
  "Two hundred thousand political prisoners detained in the 
prison camps and 3 million nonsupporters, who are permanently 
detained in the collective farms in the mountains near the Yalu 
and Tumen Rivers, are opponents of Kim Il-song. They have the 
same opinion as we. Twenty thousand North Koreans who defected 
to China, now known to have been collectively housed in Inner 
Mongolian regions, may also be collaborators with us." 
  To contact those people, what measures is the Front taking? 
  "Although the Front is planning a variety of measures such 
as 
running broadcasting stations, etc. to let the population of 
North Korea know the truth about the outside world, it is in 
trouble for lack of funds. At present it concentrates its 
efforts on publicizing of what the Front really is." 
  By what methods do you raise funds? 
  "Those who defected to Japan while being active members of 
the South Korean Workers Party in the past total about 30,000. 
Many of them are rich. The Front manages to keep going with 
their help."

  [Text] In a written report submitted to the expanded key 
party officials' meeting on 14 March, the situation analysis 
committee of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] (chairman So 
Su-chong) expressed concern with the fact that the United States 
has recently shown a North Korea-leaning diplomatic stance in 
handling the issue regarding the Security Law and the North 
Korean nuclear issue. Thus, the committee called on the 
government to change its diplomatic stance toward the United 
States. 
  In this weekly situation analysis report, the situation 
analysis committee maintained that "public opinion is critical 
of the fact that ruling and opposition circles in the United 
States took on an interfering manner in our domestic affairs in 
calling for the abolition of the security law at the same time 
as North Korea's claim urging abolition of the South Korean 
National Security Law, thus leading one to believe that the 
United States was assuming a North Korea-leaning diplomatic 
attitude." 
  The situation analysis committee also said that "by fully 
mobilizing former government officials, businessmen, and 
religious figures, the United States has diversified its 
diplomatic channels to highlight its position. Contrary to 
this, our country merely depends on official diplomatic 
channels." Thus, the committee proposes that we reexamine our 
methods of diplomatic activities with the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, March 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States, which both offered fewer import duty concessions 
in the industrial sector than planned in their final country 
schedule, will meet from March 19-24 to discuss nine items whose 
tariffs they cut instead of eliminated as promised at the 
uruguay round negotiations last December, Finance Ministry 
officials said Wednesday. 
  The United States backtracked on an earlier 
non-tariffication 
accord and instead slashed import duties in its final schedule 
screened at the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). 
  It stated that the scaled-down package was conditional on 
other countries making comparable tariff concessions. 
  Korea followed suit and submitted a schedule containing 
tariff cuts of 3 percent on the same copper goods and 4 percent 
on electronic items, instead of none. 
  Seoul proposed bilateral negotiations on March 8 while 
screening the U.S. offers in Geneva, charging that Washington 
had broken its promise made last December. 
  It called for bilateral talks because the U.S. list included 
items of interest to Korea, said Pyun Hyong, director-general of 
the customs and tariff bureau at the Finance Ministry. 
  Washington is also unhappy about Seoul's withdrawal of 
earlier offers to abolish tariffs on the nine items and is 
likely to complain at the two-day screening of Korea's 
industrial offers in Geneva from Thursday. 
  After Korea's schedule has been screened by Saturday, the 
two 
countries will sit down to iron out their differences in tariff 
cuts before the March 25 deadline for all countries to finalize 
their schedules. 
  Seoul blames Washington for breaking its promise first while 
the latter argues that it had attached conditions -- it could 
scale back its offers if Japan also did so -- and made changes 
accordingly, pointing out that Seoul made alterations without 
having attached conditions earlier in the agreement last 
December.

friendly ties with the Korean people as well as the DLP. I 
think exchanges and cooperation between the Chinese Communist 
Party and the DLP will contribute much to the development of 
ties between the two countries. 
  "President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China slated for March 26 
will have important meaning in bilateral relations and will 
serve as momentum to lift the ties a step higher. Our party and 
people are anticipating President Kim's tour to Beijing 
wholeheartedly." 
  Asked about the date of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 
visit 
to Seoul, Zhu said, "I think Jiang will surely visit Seoul 
sometime and the issue will be decided through consultations 
between Kim and Jiang."

  [Text] It is expected that President Kim Yong-sam's visit 
to China will step up cooperation between ROK and Chinese 
enterprises. 
  Domestic enterprises will actively proceed with 
civilian-level industrial cooperative projects with the five 
subcommittees of the ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Committee, 
which will be organized on the occasion of President Kim's China 
visit for the automobile, electronic, aviation, electronic 
exchanger (TDX), and nuclear energy fields. 
  They are now holding consultations with China on specific 
problems in promoting those projects by dispatching joint 
delegations or management-level personnel to China. In 
particular, our government is consulting with domestic business 
circles over nominating a head company in each field to improve 
efficiency in promoting economic cooperation with China through 
a unified channel for each sector. 
  The government is considering nominating Daewoo Motors as 
the 
head company in the automobile field, the Korea Electric Power 
Corporation in the nuclear energy field, Kumsong Dacom in the 
electric exchanger field, and Samsung Electronics in the 
electronic field, which includes high-definition television. 
Samsong Aviation Company and Korean Air are competing with each 
other for the leadership in the aviation field. The government, 
however, is struggling because business circles oppose the 
policy of nominating head companies and insist on liberal 
competition. 
  Daewoo Motors and China's Changchun No. 1 Motor Company 
agreed to invest jointly $1.5 billion in building a 
joint-venture plant capable of producing 300,000 automobile 
parts and 150,000 completed automobiles a year and they are now 
proceeding with this project. Hyundai Motors is also planning to 
invest individually to manufacture ordinary automobiles. 
  China has requested that the Korea Electric Power 
Corporation 
provide technological support and investment for its nuclear 
power facilities. It has already dispatched a technological 
support team to maintain the No. 1 and No. 2 nuclear power 
plants in Guangdong, China. 
  It has been learned that China has promised our business 
circles that it will consider adopting ROK electric exchangers 
as a standard system in building the national communication 
network in the future. Kumsong Dacom and Samsung Electronics are 
now expanding their investments in this field in China. 
  The ROK Government plans to promote cooperation with China 
by 
organizing a consortium with an ROK head company and the 
aviation industries of China, a company designated for the 
consortium by the Chinese side. In the meantime, Samsung 
Aviation Company, Korean Air, Daewoo Heavy Industries, Halla 
Heavy Industries, and Seil Heavy Industries are independently 
promoting joint projects with Chinese companies.

  [Text] Seoul, March 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is 
negotiating to participate in European security forums to forge 
closer political, economic and multilateral relations with the 
members of the European Union, Foreign Ministry officials said 
Wednesday. 
  It is also seeking links with military-security 
organizations 
in Europe such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
and the Western European Union (WEU), the officials said. 
  Assistant Minister for Policy Planning Yi Chang-chun began a 
tour on March 13 taking him to Russia, Finland, Hungary, Austria 
and Belgium for meetings with foreign affairs and defense 
officials. He returns on March 27. 
  Seoul hopes to participate in the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) session opening in Hungary this 
December under "special guest" status like Japan, they said. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said on a number of 
occasions that Northeast Asia needs a multilateral security 
dialogue forum, recommending a mini-CSCE body for the region. 
  Yi has already met with Russian Vice Foreign Minister 
Alexandre Panov and will discuss cooperation at the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF), the 
first regional security forum in the Asia-Pacific zone, slated 
for July in Bangkok, officials said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yi Tong-kuk] </F>
  [Text] Several things decide the image of the prime 
minister: the degree of public confidence in the president, the 
prime minister's personal power, and his ability to get control 
of and coordinate ministry operations. Of these, the ability to 
get control of and coordinate operations is the standard of 
measure showing a prime minister's working ability. How, then, 
does Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang score on this test? 
  "I will get control of the Cabinet through work." This has 
been the pledge and regular recipe of successive prime ministers 
early after being appointed. However, with the vague image of 
the prime minister in a president-centered system, this has 
almost never been achieved properly due to the lack of 
cooperation of the ministries. 
  Recently, Prime Minster Yi has been exercising actual 
coordination authority, which had practically been unheard of, 
over ministry operations and has been breaking long-standing 
practices. Some ministries, such as finance and construction, 
had decided on and published policies without properly going 
through preliminary deliberations with the Prime Minister's 
Office and suffered more than a little for it. Prime Minister 
Yi's use of his coordination authority has been to unsheathe his 
"sword" and turn ministries inside out. He even issued warning 
summons to relevant ministers. Going one step further, Yi 
greatly strengthened the policy-evaluation team within the Prime 
Minister's Office. 
  Actually, it is a fact that up until only a little while 
ago, 
each ministry considered the Prime Minister's Office simply a 
place to give notice before reporting to the Blue House. This 
practice was particularly serious in the economic ministries, 
reports from which first pass through a meeting of economic 
ministers and vice-ministers. In view of this, the recent 
readjustment of items announced by the economic ministries under 
the management of the Prime Minister's Office signifies much. 
From a certain viewpoint, this can be seen as the realization of 
Yi's conviction that he should "guarantee the maximum autonomy 
of the ministries in the preparation and performance of policy, 
but definitely exercise his supervisory role in coordinating 
divergent views, and so on." 
  Decided upon upon on 24 January, the "Farm and Fishing 
Village Special Tax Assessment Proposal" was originally proposed 
by the Finance Ministry, but was changed extensively by the 
Prime Minister's Office before being announced. Before this, on 
the 21st, "according to standard practice," the Finance Ministry 
prepared a revenue-source procurement proposal and made it 
public without consulting the Prime Minister's Office 
beforehand. This was because a "powerful" ministry such as the 
Finance Ministry has no need to concern itself with the 
displeasure of the Prime Minister's Office and because there had 
been no previous instance of the Prime Minister's Office 
interfering in the peculiar operations of the Ministry of 
Finance. 
  The situation, however, changed at the instruction of Prime 
Minister Yi. Because there were problems with the Finance 
Ministry's proposal, such as that the Farm and Fishing Village 
Special Tax would be a great burden on those in low-income 
brackets, it was ordered that the Prime Minister's Office review 
the proposal. Changing the proposal and aiming for those in 
high-income brackets, the Prime Minister's Office created a 
revised proposal whereby the wealthy would pay the Farm and 
Fishing Village Special Tax, as well as a golf-course entrance 
fee and an integrated land tax, but would not impose these taxes 
on companies moving to rural areas and those in low-income 
brackets. Afterward, at an unscheduled meeting of the heads of 
relevant government ministries, departments, offices, and 
bureaus, held on the instructions of Prime Minister Yi, the 
already-published Finance Ministry proposal was repealed and the 
Prime Minister's Office's revised proposal was adopted. 
  "The operations of the economic ministries in fact had 
extraterritorial rights within the Prime Minister's Office," 
according to the evaluation of one source associated with the 
Prime Minister's Office, "There had not been a case such as this 
one, in which the Prime Minister's Office intervened and changed 
a Finance Ministry proposal." 
  Another case in which with similar form Prime Minister Yi 
exercised his operation-coordination authority was the Ministry 
of Construction's "Capital Maintenance Plan Law, Enforcement 
Ordinance Revision Proposal." This proposal, about which 
preliminary notice had been given that it would be introduced as 
a legislative bill, changed capital development strategy 180 
degrees, such as allowing the construction of large buildings 
anywhere in Seoul if only 10 percent of the construction costs 
are paid in advance. 
  The Ministry of Construction on 25 January held 
party-government consultations and unilaterally announced the 
proposal without going through preliminary deliberations with 
the Prime Minister's Office or even informing the office of the 
content of the proposal. Considering this a problem, Prime 
Minister Yi in his weekly report on the 28th reported to 
President Kim Yong-sam on the problem of the decisionmaking 
process of the Construction Ministry's proposal. He also had his 
office come up with supplementary measures. 
  In connection with this, President Kim, in his weekly 
chief-secretaries meeting held on this day in the afternoon, 
said concerning the construction ministry proposal, "We must not 
have an immoderate removal of regulations." On the 29th, Prime 
Minister Yi even called Construction Minister Kim U-sok and 
received a progress report. In this process, Yi sent a directive 
to each of the ministries, giving strict orders, "Plans which 
are to become legislative bills must pass through 
interministerial deliberations, but a preliminary report must be 
made on everything two days prior to publication." 
  Besides this, the Prime Minister's Office's unprecedented, 
active exercise of its operation-coordination authority has also 
been seen in almost all policies, such as the Water-Quality 
Management Measures, since Prime Minister Yi took office. 
  With one section responsible for this, it was no more than a 
formality. However, Prime Minister Yi expanded the 
policy-evaluation function of the Prime Minster's Office to four 
sections, making his control of the ministries more concrete. 
"The administration has made many policies, but there is no 
place to appropriately evaluate these," said Yi on the 31st, 
revealing his reasons for strengthening his policy team. 
Evaluation results are reported directly to President Kim.

  [Text] Seoul, March 16 (YONHAP) -- Retired opposition 
leader Kim Tae-chung lashed out at U.S. "hard-liners" on 
Tuesday, accusing them of dealing too carelessly with the 
life-and-death situation faced by 70 million Koreans. 
  "We felt both helpless and irked until very recently at 
war-oriented reports from the United States," Kim said, 
referring to snowballing coverage in the American media 
depicting the Korean peninsula as highly volatile and threatened 
by military confrontation arising from the inter-Korean nuclear 
standoff. 
  "Why do the American hard-liners have to dump ashes in 
solving the nuclear problem in the middle of negotiations, and 
why do they treat so carelessly a problem that is a matter of 
life and death to the 70 million people of our nation," he said 
before giving a lecture at Korea University. 
  Tuesday's appearance was the first of a year-long lecture 
schedule for Kim, who voluntarily ended his long career as an 
opposition pillar after losing his bid for the presidency a 
third time in 1992. 
  He now serves as head of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation 
for the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Kim wondered why the United States kept leaking such reports 
without consulting with the South Korean Government and warned 
Seoul to stay on guard against American hard-liners. 
  He ventured that North Korea and the United States have made 
significant progress in improving relations and economic 
cooperation in talks held under the table. 
  He said he felt Seoul was being left out as Pyongyang and 
Washington invisibly stole the leading roles in the nuclear 
negotiations. 
  "We have to look far into the future and prepare because 
once 
the nuclear problem is solved and North Korea-U.S. relations 
improve, there will be a dramatic change to the relationship 
where North Korea was regarded as a 100-percent enemy and the 
United States as a 100-percent ally," said Kim.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hong Chun-ho: "Is the KTC-YKT `Alliance' </F>
Working All Right? -- a Subtle Shifting of Current in the DP 
Power Dynamics"] 
  [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] has been operating by an 
alliance between former Chairman Kim Tae-chung [KTC] and present 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek [YKT]. More specifically, the YKT leadership 
came into being thanks to a tacit support of KTC who had just 
retired from first-line politics. And even today it is difficult 
to explain its existence minus that factor. 
  Needless to say, KTC is a retiree from politics. He himself 
reaffirmed it publicly on many occasions. But the fact is that 
even though he retired from active politics, it does not mean 
that his influence has also been "retired." This fact was 
verified more than once. KTC remains a member of the DP and, 
more importantly, all his men are in good shape in the DP. 
  Will the KTC-YKT alliance remain solid? Does KTC still trust 
YKT? Also, will the next DP national convention--which may 
possibly be held as early as late next year [1994]--bring no 
change in the present factional configuration? Each and every DP 
member must be pondering these questions aloud, for they are 
their greatest concerns and a pending, long-term issue of the 
DP. In this connection, a few things have lately been observed 
anew, making it necessary to shed light again on this dormant 
issue and reexamine it. 
  They are: first, moves relating to the next party convention 
that have become visible; second, a subtle structural change in 
the power dynamics within the DP; third, a rearrangement of the 
battle line by the Tonggyodong [KTC] faction, and finally, 
Chairman Yi's moves. 
  According to the party Constitution, the next DP national 
convention is to be held in May 1995; however, in the event of a 
national election, it can be moved up by a maximum of 6 months 
or delayed by up to 3 months. Therefore, the next DP convention 
is, basically, far more than a year away, but Chairman Yi 
recently referred to the possibility of moving it up within the 
range indicated in the party Constitution. He thus hinted at his 
intent for en early convention, creating a subtle stir in the 
party; until then, he had been negative about moving up the 
convention date. Now, since he himself raised the issue, there 
must have been a reason for it. Conversely speaking, his action 
proves that an anti-Yi offensive within the party is approaching 
to a critical stage. In fact, the nonmainstreamers have been 
demanding, intermittently though, the holding of an 
extraordinary party convention sometime in the first half of 
1994. 
  Chairman Yi seems to be feeling the same pressure in the 
course of his management of the DP's National Assembly policy 
during the regular Assembly session, too. While the "nine man, 
nine different minds" criticism against the party leadership 
continues unabated, he could so far lead the party rather 
smoothly by effectively managing the balance of power among the 
members of the party Supreme Committee. However, as soon as he 
moved to show his own color in his National Assembly speech and 
in his parliamentary strategy as the opposition leader, the 
nonmainstreamers strongly reacted against it. Even among the 
Supreme Committee members, fewer came forward backing him up. No 
Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong of the Democratic faction [from the 
former DP before its merger with the UPP] turned their backs on 
him. No Mu-hyon, while holding on to his basic line since the 
last party convention in March, is nevertheless intensifying his 
criticism of Chairman continuously. What makes the chairman 
worry even more is that Yi Pu-yong, who had been relatively 
cooperative, reversed his attitude, turning critical of the 
chairman. Since No and Yi Pu-yong are also members of the Reform 
group, these things have spawned speculations that Chairman Yi 
has not only lost his grip of the Democratic faction but is 
perhaps shunned by the Reform group, too. Only two Supreme 
Committee members, Kwon No-kap and Han Kwang-ok, remain loyal to 
the chairman, while the Tonggyodong faction reportedly sees 
something missing in Chairman Yi, at times feeling dissatisfied. 
  Meanwhile, the Tonggyodong faction has been constantly on 
the 
move since it unified its genealogy in the name of [KTC's] Naeoe 
Munje Yonguso [Institute of Internal and External Affairs]. 
Recently, it reorganized Yonchong, a private organization of 
KTC. Chairman Yi also has launched a membership drive for his 
private organization, Society for the Reunited Mountains and 
Rivers. But he finds himself under mounting intraparty 
pressure. In short, the Reform group does not approve of "dual 
citizenship" of members, putting pressure on the chairman and 
his force. 
  Chairman Yi's camp is aware of all this subtle shifting. So 
much so that some insiders say that they might be oversensitive. 
At any rate, YKT and his force are known to be working on 
strategy to ensure that their leadership continues after the 
National Assembly regular session and further to defend its 
power base at the next party convention while keeping a close 
eye on its own faction that is turning rebellious, on the 
increasingly visible resistance of the progressive forces within 
the party, and on the growing signs of disharmony with the 
Tonggyodong faction, the main force in the DP. 
  In this atmosphere, Chairman Yi reportedly has attempted to 
have a better rapport with KTC recently. In fact, it does not 
pay for either side that they get in contact. For KTC, it could 
harm the image of his retirement from politics. Chairman Yi 
could also be hurt because such contact would further enhance 
his image as a weak leader unable to run the party 
independently. But the immediate reality is that something has 
to be done to change the flow of things in the combined forces 
of the DP apparently plagued by internal disharmony. Chairman 
Yi's side in particular seems to be feeling the intense need. 
Therefore, reports say, he embarked on a rapport with the 
Tonggyodong camp while discreetly keeping a distance. 
  Acting as mediators between the two camps are Kwon No-kap 
and 
Han Kwang- ok, both members of the Supreme Committee, plus Rep. 
Mun Hui-sang, Chairman Yi's chief secretary, and Pak Chi-won, DP 
spokesman. Mun Hui-sang was the first chairman of Yonchong. He 
also had served as its sixth chairman until Kim Ok-tu took over 
recently. He is one of the key figures among KTC's direct 
disciples and he is always present at their gatherings. Despite 
his position as Yi's chief secretary, he would say 
unhesitatingly that "my `home base' is Tonggyodong." Pak Chi-won 
also has his roots in Tonggyodong and was part of the KTC 
campaign in the last presidential election. The two are the key 
workers playing the role of a bridge between the YKT and KTC 
forces to prevent a split and ensure cooperation. 
  They are said to be playing the part of letting Chairman 
Yi's 
side know --through a variety of routes--what KTC thinks about 
Yi's National Assembly strategy and political course in general, 
or vice versa. They contend that there is no gap between 
Chairman Yi and KTC. They explain that there has been no change 
in their basic relationship--even amid the subtle undercurrent 
of a power game within the party. They assert that KTC has had 
no objections to Chairman Yi's political line, to the substance 
of his National Assembly speech delivered in October as a 
product of that new line, and to his press conference remarks in 
late September in which Yi stated that he would give the economy 
priority over the issue of liquidating the past--namely, to all 
those things that fed feud within the party. Needless to say, it 
was Mun Hui-sang himself who led the work in the writing of that 
speech. Moreover, Pae Ki-son, former assistant chief secretary 
for KTC, also took an active part in it. Pae has also been 
working as an aide for Chairman Yi for some time now. Another 
source familiar with developments on both sides asserts that 
"there is nothing going on that could fundamentally reverse the 
internal balance of power within the mainstream." He insists 
that the only problem is the dissatisfaction among mainstreamers 
with the performance of Chairman Yi, who they think lacks in 
leadership for an effective struggle against the ruling camp. 
And it is a problem that can be resolved, he adds. 
  The nonmainstreamers have a different view, though. While 
agreeing that the KTC-YKT alliance will not be easily shaken, 
they do not think that YKT will remain the alternate of the 
mainstreamers for too long. At the same time, the mainstreamers 
themselves have the realistic need to try and shake the 
mainstreamers from inside to make sure that he will not. Their 
concerns are, in fact, no longer over the KTC-YKT alliance but 
focused on the moves of the Tonggyodong faction.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Sin Chong-nok: "The Defense Industry </F>
Shaken to the Foundations"] 
  [Text] "The government should take it over or do something. 
We are at the end of our tether," says the owner of a mid-level 
defense firm who is up to the ears in trouble these days. He 
continues: 
  "The defense budget cut has led to continuous falls in the 
Office of Supply procurement. Exports also have been on the 
downtrend since the latter half of the 1980's due to the 
technological stagnation and the constant checking by the United 
States. We simply cannot make both ends meet. Factories remain 
idle but wages nearly doubled over the past few years. Still, 
because of the peculiarities of defense industry, we find it 
difficult to convert to another industry." 
  The Korean defense industry is reeling to its foundations. 
And academia and research groups are warning, in increasingly 
loud voices, that it "must not be left as it is." 
  According to informed sources, the situation apparently is 
more critical than generally thought. The confirmed average rate 
of operation of defense firms in 1992 was as low as 53 percent. 
The number of workers moving to other industries has also been 
on the increase; some 1,500 of them left the defense industry in 
1992 alone. They were either separated in reduction-in-force 
actions or changed their employment. It is known that many firms 
are on the brink of close-down. A well-known company recently 
moved part of its operations to the United States to find a way 
of exporting to third countries, averting U.S.-imposed 
restrictions. Exports, which earned as much as $400 million to 
$500 million in the mid-1980's, have plummeted to a $100 million 
level in recent years. General trading companies have sharply 
reduced their operations for arms and equipment exports. 
Currently, while only two or three of them, including Kolon, 
maintain their old levels, most of those companies have at most 
four or five employees assigned to defense industry export 
business. 
  The government procurement of weapons and equipment from 
defense firms in the country was 1 trillion 300-odd billion won 
[W] in 1992, a drop by more than 30 percent from the 1991 level. 
The downtrend continued in 1993, it is known. The reason is 
that, as a result of improvement in the Northeast Asian 
situation and further democratization in Korea, which spurred 
demand for increased welfare spending, the defense spending was 
forced, relatively, to a standstill. Another factor was that as 
the Ministry of National Defense [MND] focused on high-tech 
equipment in its arms procurement program, purchase orders kept 
shrinking for domestic firms whose production capabilities were 
limited to basic arms and shells. 
  This led straight to falls in the firms' sales. The "A" 
firm, 
a leading shells firm, capable of producing 300 billion 
won-worth shells, turned out only 120 billion won-worth in 1993. 
The "S" company, a mid-level firm which needs 25 billion won in 
annual sales to stay in business, had only 8 billion won in 
sales from government procurement in 1993. The plight is the 
same of chaebol [conglomerates] defense firms. In the 
case of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry Co., mainly producing 
T-88 
tanks, it had 190 billion won in annual sales from government 
procurement until 1992, when the sales fell to 120 billion won. 
Its 1993 sales are known to have dropped further. 
  The situation is worse with exports. The nation's arms 
exports once registered more than $400 million in small arms and 
shells alone in the early 1980's. It did not include clothing 
and other outfits. The amount has continued to shrink since the 
latter half of the 1980's, falling below the $100 million mark 
in 1992, according to industry estimates. Meanwhile, 
defense-related organizations estimate the 1992 exports at $20 
million or so. The reported $25 million-worth export last year 
of "K-200 Korea-type armored cars" to Malaysia by Daewoo Heavy 
Industries turned out to be not an export in fact. The fact, 
according to reports, is that the Korean government provided--at 
Washington's request--the armored cars in support of Malaysian 
combat troops sent to Somalia, and that in doing so, it took the 
form of export. 
  There are, roughly, two reasons for the sharp decline in 
exports since the latter half of the 1980's. One is the 
increasingly tight restrictions imposed by U.S. authorities on 
guard against growth of the Korean defense industry, and the 
other is the industry's technological stagnation. In respect to 
high value-added equipment, Korea is totally under U.S. control 
under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) of the annual 
Korea-U.S. Security Consultation Meeting (SCM). In other words, 
its access to export itself is blocked. As for lower-class 
products such as bullets, Korea had to lose the markets to 
developing nations, such as China and Malaysia known for low 
labor costs, because of the sluggish technological development 
since the 1980's. 
  These developments are in part attributable to the global 
easing of the Cold War. As a result of the easing, the defense 
spending has continued to drop the world over since 1990. The 
1990 world defense spending marked a 5% drop from the 
previous 
year, and 1991 marked another 3% fall to $921 billion. The 
decline continued in 1992--to an estimated $800 billion. 
International arms trade also has continued to shrink by more 
than 20% every year. Japan virtually has been the only 
exception to the downtrend in defense spending. In major defense 
industry countries like the United States, France and Russia, 
the large-scale restructuring of defense industry is causing 
continued mergers and close-downs of firms. In the maelstrom, 
600,000 workers have lost their jobs in the United States since 
1989. 
  It can hardly be denied that the current plight of defense 
firms in Korea should be seen in the light of this global 
restructuring. At the same time, however, interested parties are 
unanimous in viewing the policy shift--away from the defense 
industry buildup by the Fifth and Sixth Republic governments--as 
the cause directly responsible for the present situation. 
  The view generally accepted is that the Korean defense 
industry was founded in 1970, when President Pak Chong-hui, 
stunned by the 1969 commando assault on Chongwadae by Kim 
Sin-cho, instructed the formulation of a "10-year defense 
industry development plan." The National Defense and Science 
Institute [NDSI] was thus established, and the Defense Industry 
Council was created under the president's direct control. The 
council decided to begin where domestic production was possible, 
such as that of ammunition and communication equipment, 
selecting 20 firms for that purpose. The industry, combined with 
heavy chemical industry development policies in the mid-1970's, 
was on the rise. It developed the assembly capabilities for 
conventional weapons such as guns, tanks and helicopters in the 
late 1970's. It even began exporting products like M-16's and 
parts of communication electronics to Iran and the Philippines. 
The industry was the "goose laying golden eggs," bringing in big 
money. 
  The trend made a turnaround in the Fifth Republic. The 
government, pursuing a basic "economic stability program," saw 
the excessive investment in the heavy chemical industry as the 
culprit of inflation. As a natural development, the defense 
industry was taken off the priorities list. The Defense Industry 
Council was dissolved and procurement from domestic firms stayed 
flat. Some research institutes went out of existence. The 
downtrend is still on. 
  "In the general view of researchers, the nation's defense 
technology today has nothing much different from what it was in 
the 1980's. Responsible for this are both the government 
remaining indifferent to changes and the defense firms that 
spent their earnings of the 1970's not for research and 
development but to buy land," says an NDSI researcher. 
  The problem is that consequences are not confined to 
deteriorations in the payments position of some defense firms. 
Experts note that even in the basic weapons branch, the 
possibility cannot be ruled out of a collapse of an adequate 
production capability itself, either for wartime or peacetime. 
Further, under the present circumstances, it seems to be 
fundamentally impossible to expect domestic defense firms to 
perform a positive role in the building of independent high-tech 
weapons systems. 
  Defense industry is a key state industry in most of the 
nations, because it not only has big pervasive technological 
effects on high-tech industries but also contributes greatly to 
creating jobs. This explains why those nations are intensifying 
protectionism for their defense industries against the 
optimistic trends of the post-Cold War. The U.S. F-17 is about 
four times the cost of the Russian MIG counterpart. 
Nevertheless, the U.S. Government buys the American product. The 
Japanese Government also pays four times the international price 
to procure T-17 tanks from Japanese makers. Major Japanese 
defense firms such as Hitachi and Mitsubishi receive 400 million 
yen to 500 million yen in technology development subsidies from 
the government every year. 
  The Korean defense industry is in a critical conversion 
period now. Interested parties are unanimous in pointing out 
that it should come out of the conventional manufacturing of 
basic arms and convert to high-tech fields for more pervasive 
effects in technology. However, firms are already too weak at 
the moment to tide over the restructuring period. 
  Chi Man-won, a military affairs expert, says that "strategy 
for the survival of domestic defense firms should be found not 
in a hasty push for domestic production but in developing 
specialties in the production of parts and tie-ups with foreign 
companies." "More important, however," he noted, "is to improve 
the administrative system which is now so inefficient that 
papers sent to the MND take months to reach the intended 
offices." 
  Paek Yong-hun, director of the Korea Industrial Development 
Institute and chairman of the Defense Industry Society, said: 
"We are in the Uruguay Round age in which subsidies to protect 
domestic industries are totally abolished; however, as far as 
defense industry is concerned, subsidizing it is unlikely to 
cause any international controversy, because advanced nations 
like the United States, Japan and Germany are all subsidizing 
their defense industries to protect them." "The government 
should not try to cut the defense spending blindly but keep it 
at adequate levels and, in particular, increase the budget for 
technology development sharply," he stressed. 
  Currently, there are 84 defense firms in Korea. Cooperative 
firms included, the number will be nearly 300. The number of 
workers in the 84 firms alone is about 26,000. The Stockholm 
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates the 
Korean defense industry manpower at 40,000. The SIPRI number, 
however, seems to include NDSI and other researchers plus 
employees of some cooperative firms.

  [Text] Seoul, March 16 (YONHAP) -- The government will 
consider downgrading the ranks of public officials working at 
the Defense Ministry, the Public Prosecution, the Agency for 
National Security Planning (NSP) and the Board of Audit and 
Inspection (BAI) to match those at other government ministries 
and agencies, informed sources said on Wednesday. 
  The ranks of officials at the "power-wielding" agencies are 
one or two grades higher than those of other public officials 
with similar qualifications and experience, and have long been a 
target of complaint for the latter. 
  For instance, a newly commissioned public prosecutor, after 
two years at the judicial research and training institute and 
then passing the higher judicial service examinations, is given 
a rank two grades higher than new public officials in other 
government agencies who passed the higher civil service 
examinations. 
  Ranks of officials at the NSP and the BAI are also higher 
than those at other agencies, while field-grade officers of the 
Armed Forces are two grades higher than their counterparts in 
the civil service. 
  To rectify this situation, the administrative reform 
committee will shortly study the downgrading plan, a committee 
source said, adding the committee is taking suggestions about 
readjusting the ranks of officials at power-related agencies. 
  Another source said it would be difficult to readjust 
downward public prosecutors' ranks because they were set on a 
par with courthouse judges. 
  The ranks of officials at power-related agencies were 
upgraded under the authoritarian governments of Pak Chong-hui 
and Chon Tu-hwan in a bid to strengthen their power base.

  [Text] Seoul, March 16 (YONHAP) -- The government published 
three new political reform laws in the official gazette 
Wednesday, putting them into effect with the exception of 
deferred provisions. 
  The law on public officials' elections and prevention of 
electoral fraud, amendments to the political funds law, and the 
local autonomy law were signed by President Kim Yong-sam on 
Tuesday. 
  The law on public officials' elections and prevention of 
electoral fraud pulled down the upper limit of election campaign 
expenses while allowing free outdoor campaign speeches. The law 
bars anyone convicted of violating the election law from getting 
a public post for 10 years. His civil rights will also be 
limited under the new law. 
  Moreover, the new law prohibits political parties from 
admitting new members during campaign periods and bans 
neighborhood meetings. Party rallies in the form of discussion 
gatherings are also prohibited from 30 days before the official 
campaign period and public disclosure of candidates' personal 
assets is required. 
  Candidates or political parties can ask the government to 
arbitrate in disputes over bribery, violence or meddling by 
government officials in campaigns. 
  The new political funds law introduces a system in which all 
monetary transactions must be accompanied by receipts issued by 
the Central Election Management Committee [CEMC], and raises the 
government's political fund subsidies to 800 won from 600 won 
per voter. 
  In addition, it allows the formation of support 
organizations 
by party local chapters. It also allows collection of campaign 
funds at rallies and anonymous contributions if they are 
accompanied by receipts issued by the CEMC. 
  As for the local autonomy law, heads of local governments 
are 
allowed to ask the voters about decisions on major issues.

<F P=106> [Robert Cockburn report: "Australia Allowed Soviet Spies to </F>
Steal UK Sonar Secrets"] 
  [Text] Sydney -- New British surveillance equipment 
designed in the 1980s to track the movements of Soviet nuclear 
submarines was monitored by Soviet spies, who took advantage of 
the poor security by the project's Australian co-developers. 
  Australia was branded a weak link in Western security last 
night in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation television 
investigation following the expulsion of six Russian spies last 
year. The expulsions, reportedly on CIA directions, were kept 
quiet by the Australian government, which is embarrassed at its 
image as a soft target used by Moscow during and since the Cold 
War. The expulsions were only exposed last month by an 
opposition MP. 
  A spy hunt is under way to identify a network of as many as 
30 Russian-recruited agents. The investigation was confirmed 
last night in an interview with David Sadlier, Director-General 
of the Australian Secret Service. 
  Through its shared military and commercial operations with 
Britain and the United States, Australia is still considered to 
be a more relaxed target for Russia to learn about its more 
powerful allies. The security breach could date back ten years, 
or possibly 30 years as the case of the last Soviet spy in 
Australia, Vladimir Petrov, is reopened. A Russian translator 
with the Australian secret service George Sadil, has been 
committed for trial in Canberra for handing over intelligence 
secrets that would have been passed on to MI6 and the CIA. 
  Last night the programme Lateline offered the first specific 
details of Soviet penetration and damage. The targeting the 
late 1980s was the joint Anglo-Australian development of the 
worlds most sophisticated sonar buoy for tracking Soviet 
submarine movements. The Barra sonar buoy was used by Britain in 
the Atlantic and Australia in the Far East. 
  Developed in a project between Plessey and the Australian 
government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the 
Australian AWA defence manufacturer the buoy has 25 underwater 
hydrophones. They are dropped by RAF Nimrod surveillance 
aircraft for the Royal Navy, and by Australian Air Force Orion 
aircraft for the Australian Navy. 
  Disclosure of the operation was made by Professor Desmond 
Ball, of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, at the 
Australian National University in Canberra. 
  The focus of attention was the Garden Island Naval Dockyard 
beside the Opera House. Professor Ball explained how Soviet 
agents intercepted phone calls between naval officers and 
defence headquarters in Canberra, allowing Soviet agents to 
monitor trials of the buoy by the naval facility south of Sydney.

  [Text] In a news conference on the evening of 15 March, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura spoke about the 
voluntary market-liberalization measures for resolving the 
Japanese-U.S. economic disputes and said that the finalized 
measures will be revealed at the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting to 
be held at the time of the industrialized nations summit in July 
(Naples summit). He added that drastic tax reform plans will 
compose part of the macroeconomic measures. 
  Takemura said, "Market-liberalization measures should 
naturally contain macroeconomic measures, and my understanding 
is that the tax reform plans will be part of them." 
  He also said 1) the government's plan is to bring the 
Japanese- U.S. economic framework talks to a conclusion by June 
and that it needs to come up with an idea on what position to 
take on tax cuts for next year and thereafter; and 2) the 
government will finalize its policy after confirming the views 
of the ruling parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ozawa Calls Off His Planned Visit to </F>
Washington To Avert Friction With Takemura"] 
  [Text] On 15 March, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], called off his planned visit to 
the United States scheduled for early next week. In the evening 
of 15 March, Mr. Ozawa appeared in the Diet building for the 
first time since 1 March. Answering questions by reporters, he 
said, "I am not prepared for a visit to the United States, and 
it would be impossible for me to visit that country during this 
month." It is believed he called off the planned visit because 
the United States pinned excessively high hopes on his visit to 
Washington because he is a powerful politician in the ruling 
coalition. The objective of Mr. Ozawa's visit to the United 
States, as seen by many, was to break the impasse in the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that remain deadlocked since 
the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks broke down. Mr. Ozawa's 
decision to call off his planned visit is now fueling 
speculation in many quarters. 
  The "National Press Club" organized by the American news 
media had invited Mr. Ozawa to give a lecture, and the 
invitation prompted him to think of visiting the United States. 
Explaining the reasons for Mr. Ozawa calling off his planned 
visit, people close to him stressed he did not plan to visit 
Washington only in connection with the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks. However, a senior member of Shinseito, explaining the 
reason why he canceled his visit to the United States, said: 
"The United States was increasingly pinning high hopes on his 
visit to Washington, saying, since Mr. Ozawa comes to our 
nation, he will carry a bag packed with a lot of gifts. These 
high hopes on the part of the United States made it difficult 
for Mr. Ozawa to go ahead with his planned visit." Some 
American officials took the view that "Mr. Ozawa will visit 
Washington to apologize for breaking off the recent Japan-U.S. 
summit talks" and this view was taken as a factor in his 
cancellation of the visit. 
  Mr. Ozawa himself is said to have vigorously worked on the 
domestic coordination of views in a bid to put the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks back on track, and the general 
consensus is that "he aimed to break the deadlock in the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks by visiting the United States." 
However, many point out: Given the character of the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, there are many government ministries 
and agencies involved so it is not easy to break the deadlock. 
The attitude of the United States, that has demanded setting 
numerical targets, is still tough with Japan. Even if Mr. Ozawa 
went ahead with his planned visit to Washington, it would be 
very difficult for him to find areas of agreement for concluding 
the framework talks. 
  Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has been working 
on the domestic coordination of views on how to resume the 
framework talks while calling administrative vice ministers of 
concerned ministries and agencies into the prime minister's 
official residence. Some officials in the government and ruling 
coalition parties take the view that "Mr. Ozawa might have 
decided to call off his planned visit to Washington to avert 
friction with Mr. Takemura."

<F P=106> [Interview with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and </F>
foreign minister, by Nobuaki Hanaoka, chief of the SANKEI 
SHIMBUN Political News Department; place and date not given -- 
from the "Listening Without Reservation" column] 
  [Text] [Hanaoka] Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced 
the postponement of a cabinet reshuffle. How about aftereffects 
of the postponement? 
  [Hata] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura held two 
posts as chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger Party] and government 
spokesman. He agonized at the time. However, Mr. Takemura will 
leave someone with the work of running his party to some extent 
and perform his duty as spokesman. 
  [Hanaoka] It has been said now that political reform, an 
agent holding the ruling coalition parties together, has been 
settled, the Hosokawa's Cabinet cohesiveness will be inevitably 
weakened. What do you think? 
  [Hata] It has been weakened. However, the coalition 
partners have taken a new look at their positions. Chairmen of 
the ruling coalition parties held a meeting on the evening of 2 
March when Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his decision to put 
off a cabinet reshuffle. The mood at the meeting abruptly 
turned gloomy when the prime minister expressed his intention to 
give up the planned reshuffle. The meeting was filled with the 
mood for working together when I said, "Let us return to the 
starting point and restart." 
  [Hanaoka] Do you think the ruling coalition parties will 
consolidate their bipolarization? 
  [Hata] I do not think so. The ruling coalition parties 
still have differing intentions. They should not cling to their 
names. 
  [Hanaoka] It has been reported that the ruling coalition 
parties differ from each other on national ideology and 
political tactics. 
  [Hata] The difference is not a ditch that they cannot cross. 
While Mr. Takemura is advocating the need to build Japan into a 
"small nation," Mr. Ozawa is speaking of the need to build Japan 
into an "ordinary nation." There is little difference in their 
views. They agree on the point that Japan should be built into 
a nation that has a great ideology to create a real peace for 
the world within the framework of the Constitution and has 
senior citizens live free of concern at home. If Japan were 
built into a small nation, however, it could not enjoy its 
present-day prosperity. 
  [Hanaoka] I believe that the plan for the national welfare 
tax was a correct direction, but it was pointed out that the way 
Mr. Ozawa handled the new tax system was high-handed. 
  [Hata] In the past seven months, the new multilateral trade 
negotiations (the Uruguay Round) was concluded, the Political 
Reform Law was enacted, and Japan decided to partially open its 
rice market. They are changes that can occur once in 10 years. 
Five ruling coalition parties shored up the coalition 
government when it dealt with those changes. The coalition 
government had a time limit for deciding on each of the changes. 
It was inevitable for Mr. Ozawa to deal with the new tax in a 
high-handed way. The high- handed way was a transitional way. 
If a new major political party is formed, such a high-handed 
way would disappear. 
  [Hanaoka] How will the ruling coalition parties coordinate 
their choices of candidates for the next elections? 
  [Hata] The ruling coalition parties must discuss how their 
candidates should be divided into single-seat constituencies and 
the proportional representation system. If any party fields no 
candidate, it would suffer a decrease in the number of votes 
obtained in the proportional representational system. If the 
ruling coalition parties are merged into a single party, this 
would resolve the issue of fielding unified candidates in the 
next elections. 
  [Hanaoka] Mr. Hata, do you mean that the ruling coalition 
parties should be aimed to dissolve themselves to form a new 
party? 
  [Hata] Now that the combination system of the single-seat 
constituency and the proportional representation system has been 
adopted, a realignment of political parties will take place. 
The best option for the ruling coalition parties is to merge 
themselves into a single party. A new party should be created. 
  [Hanaoka] How are the ruling coalition parties going to deal 
with leftists in the Social Democratic Party of Japan? 
  [Hata] There is an ideological problem with them. They 
should decide what to do in the future. 
  [Hanaoka] Is there a possibility that more Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] members will desert? 
  [Hata] It depends on whether the liberal democrats have the 
courage to purge themselves of their past and how they view 
politics in a new age. 
  [Hanaoka] What is the cause of a new party? 
  [Hata] It is to rally a powerful political force capable of 
countering the LDP. We will have to promote economic reform, 
administrative reform, and decentralization. From a 
broad-ranging point of view, we intend to develop a new tax 
system which will balance assets, consumption, and income in the 
long-term. 
  [Hanaoka] Will Mr. Hosokawa head the new political party? 
  [Hata] Yes, he will. 
  [Hanaoka] Japan-U.S. relations are in serious shape. Would 
you comment on it? 
  [Hata] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks did not break 
off, but ended with no agreements reached. The Hosokawa Cabinet 
intends to make a sweeping relaxation of regulations. For the 
United States, Japan is the second largest importer next to 
Canada. Both Japan and the United States are in a mature 
relationship of mutual dependence. If the two countries stop 
taking face-saving actions, their relations will certainly 
improve. 
  [Hanaoka] Mr. Ozawa appears to be planning to visit the 
United States. 
  [Hata] A decision has already been made about his visit to 
Washington. He will travel to the United States to give a 
lecture at the request of an American press club. Mr. Ozawa has 
not been seen in public for health reasons. When I told him, 
"If you continue to stay away from the public, it would 
immediately become a newsworthy story," Mr. Ozawa said, "I am 
really in poor health." 
  [Hanaoka] No prospects are seen for deliberation of a budget 
bill for fiscal 1994 in the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee. 
  [Hata] The Budget Committee should deliberate, among other 
things, the budget bill to recover Japan's economy. There are 
no clear reasons for delaying its deliberation. It is said that 
the Budget Committee will begin deliberating the bill when Labor 
Minister Chikara Sakaguchi returns to Japan after attending the 
job summit. I think it is good if a debate focuses on labor 
problems during the committee's general interpellation session.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 March Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] As tension is increasing in the confrontation 
between the United States and China on the human rights issue, 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is uncertain of how far he 
should go into this issue during his visit to China starting on 
19 March. He is in anguish over how to handle this problem. 
  Hosokawa made a commitment during his recent talks with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to urge the PRC to make 
improvements on the human rights issue. However, there is the 
danger that President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders 
might toughen their attitude depending on how Hosokawa talks 
about this problem. On the other hand, if the prime minister 
limits himself to roundabout expressions, he may be criticized 
by the Western nations. The Foreign Ministry is rushing its 
preparations to have the prime minister ask China to respect 
human rights in accordance with the universal sense of values 
existing in the international community. 
  At the meeting of leaders of the government and the ruling 
parties on 14 March, Hosokawa explained his upcoming China visit 
in the following terms, "We do not really have any major pending 
issues." However, after the U.S.-Chinese foreign ministerial 
meeting in Beijing ended in discord, things have become 
precarious. While it is not unusual for the United States, which 
has to decide on renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment 
for the PRC in June, to push strongly for improvements in 
China's treatment of human rights, China this time took an 
unprecedentedly tough position using its "huge market" as a 
trump card. 
  As for the stand that the prime minister should take during 
his visit to the PRC, the Foreign Ministry's policy is: While 
the prime minister will touch on the human rights issue, he will 
limit himself to circumspect expressions and will not go into 
concrete issues, such as the detention of prodemocracy 
activists, nor link this topic with the fourth yen loan. 
However, it is also reported that "the prime minister seems to 
be also considering making straightforward demands for 
improvements on human rights, which were avoided during past 
Liberal Democratic Party administrations, and making an explicit 
apology for the past war" (according to the prime minister's 
close aides). It will take some time for the final position to 
take shape.

<H5>  Revival of Hosokawa Support Rate </H5>
  The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet sharply declined 
in 
the December survey, but it picked up by 3 percent in January. 
It appears Prime Minister Hosokawa's 14 December decision on a 
partial rice liberalization left no obvious impact on the 
support rate. Prime Minister Hosokawa managed the rice issue, 
but future development of the political scene is still uncertain 
as the upper house rejected the political reform bills.

<H5>  Decline in Support Rate for LDP President Kono </H5>
  In the January survey, the support rate for coalition 
parties 
again surpassed that for the LDP. The decline in support for 
the LDP over a long span is remarkable. Mr. Yohei Kono has been 
elected the LDP president to win broad support for 
reconstructing the party. 
  Yet, the support rate for President Kono is also showing 
constant decline. In particular, he is unpopular among female 
voters. Although 33 percent of male voters support him, the 
support rate remained at only 23.5 percent among the female 
voters.

<H5>  Public Attitude Toward Rice Market Liberalization </H5>
  What are the public's reactions to the Hosokawa 
administration's decision on partial liberalization of the rice 
market? According to the survey result, 49 percent were for, 
and 34 percent against the decision. Since the cabinet support 
rate did not drop by the strong opposition to the rice 
liberalization decision, it appears the issue had not been 
regarded as a hot controversy. As a matter of course, the 
farmers-fishermen group reacted most strongly to the decision. 
However, it is very interesting that the Hosokawa cabinet 
retained high support (49 percent in December, and 50 percent in 
January) even among those who opposed the rice liberalization. 
It seems that, even among farmers, the rice liberalization is 
no longer a controversy to affect their confidence in the 
cabinet.

<H5>  Pollees' Voting-Intentions </H5>
  Since the political turnover in last August, the decline in 
the LDP's popularity is noteworthy in the survey on voting 
intentions. When we started surveying public attitude toward the 
question of Table 5, the support for the LDP always exceeded 50 
percent. But the figure dropped to just a little over 20 
percent in the latest survey. In contrast, the JNP and other 
coalition parties are steadily gaining voters' support. In the 
January survey, Shinseito obtained public support ranking with 
the SDPJ. 
  NOTE: The survey, conducted by Chuo Research Inc. on 7-10 
January, was carried on as individual interviews of 2,000 
eligible voters picked at random. Responses were obtained from 
69.3 percent of, or 1,385, pollees. Data belong to the 
Multipurpose Statistic Databank of Tsukuba University.

<H5>  Cabinet Support Rate Remains Unchanged </H5>
  The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet remained almost 
unchanged from the previous survey. However, we should mention 
that two big political events took place during the last month. 
First, the enactment of the political reform bills was 
determined at the 28 January talks between Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and LDP President Kono even though that was thought 
impossible after rejection by the upper house. Most of the 
public welcomed the enactment while it did not believe the bills 
can completely clean up Japan's politics. Second, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa suddenly announced his plan to introduce the 
public welfare tax at a news conference held early in the 
morning of 3 February. The SDPJ opposed this idea at the risk 
of its own survival in the coalition, and the mass media also 
blamed the Hosokawa decision made "without adequate explanation 
to the public." In some opinion polls conducted immediately 
after the announcement, the support rate for Prime Minister 
Hosokawa dropped by nearly 20 percent. In our survey, however, 
the support rate remained unchanged since Prime Minister 
Hosokawa immediately apologized to the public dropping his tax 
increase proposal. Figures in the survey on public satisfaction 
with politics also remained almost unchanged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  Support for SDPJ Also Unchanged </H5>
  It is said that the SDPJ lost public support when a lot of 
rebels contributed to the upper house's rejection of the 
political reform bills, and that it then won back popularity by 
saying no to the public welfare tax. Such moves were not 
observed in our monthly survey on the SDPJ support rate. In the 
February survey, the support rate for the coalition dropped by 4 
percentage points from the previous month, and this was as low 
as that for the LDP. In particular, Shinseito's popularity 
sharply declined.

<H5>  Public Perceptions of Living Conditions </H5>
  While it is believed Japan is still experiencing recession, 
voters' perceptions of their own living conditions were not very 
bad in the last 12 months. Over 60 percent answered their 
living conditions remain unchanged, and 35.5 percent said they 
are facing difficulties in making their living. These figures 
are a little better than those in December 1993. While the 
public is very concerned about the prolonged recession, it 
probably does not seriously impact on the living of individuals.

<F P=106> [Article by Ken Moroi, vice chairman of the Japan Federation </F>
of Employers Associations: "The Day When the Four Economic 
Organizations Disappear"] 
  [Text]The Economic Organizations Have Accomplished 
Their Purposes 
  The opinion that the four economic organizations have become 
useless is in vogue. 
  At a time of reform, when the state of the political and 
official communities is encountering serious criticism following 
the collapse of the 1955 system, it is impossible for the 
business community to be immune from criticism. The prolonged 
recession, which is said to be the worst one since World War II, 
may be one of the causes of such an opinion. 
  I am vice chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers 
Associations. I think it is worthwhile in its own way for me to 
express my own, impartial views as a member of the business 
community. 
  Before I attempt that, it will be necessary to review the 
historical roles that the four economic organizations have 
played. 
  In making a fresh start from the ruins following the end of 
the Pacific war, Japan's first objective was economic revival. 
"Catching up and passing developed nations through attaining 
economic growth" was the consensus of opinion of the whole 
nation. 
  For nearly half a century since then, Japan has devoted 
itself solely to the pursuit of economic growth. For that 
purpose, each business had to be internationally competitive. 
For Japan, which is dependent on other nations for resources, 
to attain economic growth, it had no alternative but to increase 
its exports. 
  In this period, the efforts of each business to make profits 
and to develop and expand its scale led to the growth of 
macroeconomics. Therefore, the government assisted enterprises, 
and the Japanese public made efforts to develop enterprises, 
which made yearly wage increases possible, and the Japanese 
standard of living improved substantially. Working hard for 
enterprises benefited individual workers and benefited the 
nation as a whole. 
  In this way, in Japan, the government, enterprises, and the 
people had the same idea, and they made a concerted effort to 
develop the so-called Japan, Inc. 
  In that process, the role of the four economic organizations 
were to insist on what enterprises wanted to do for the economic 
development of Japan as the representatives of the business 
community as a whole, to ask for the assistance of the 
government, and to ask for the understanding of the people. 
  The four economic organizations had different roles to play: 
Keidanren (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations) 
represented large enterprises as the organ of business 
organizations; Nikkeiren (Japan Federation of Employers 
Associations) principally handled labor-management relations and 
matters related to employment; Keizaidoyukai (Japanese 
Association of Corporate Executives) served as the place where 
each executive can express his personal opinions; and Nissho 
(Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry) served as the 
representative of an enormous number of minor enterprises 
throughout the country. 
  If a goal is well defined, the method for achieving it will 
be devised accordingly. What the four economic organizations 
did to achieve their goals according to the methods they devised 
was of great benefit to the Japanese public and Japan, as well 
as to businesses. Japan enjoyed such a period. 
  This system began to exhibit some changes, probably about 10 
years ago. Statistically speaking, Japan's per capita national 
income exceeded that of [West] Germany in 1985 and even exceeded 
that of the United States in 1988. At least on the surface, 
Japan's national goal after the war was achieved in a way. And 
the next goal was not well defined. 
  At the present stage in which the Japanese economy has 
attained full growth and the only demand existing is the 
replacement of what the people already have, such as electrical 
home appliances and automobiles, no amount of new products and 
no amount of price reductions will expand domestic demand 
greatly. In the field of exports, a great trade imbalance has 
bred tension, and the appreciation of the yen has decreased the 
competitiveness of Japanese products overseas. In short, it has 
become impossible for Japan to concentrate its energies on the 
growth of its economy as in the past. 
  Moreover, although Japan has accomplished its goals from the 
standpoint of statistical figures, a number of problems still 
remain to be solved. These are problems such as housing, an 
aging society, and the environment, none of which can be 
surmounted by economic growth. To accomplish economic growth, 
the principle of "efficiency first" will be pursued, the 
concentration of people in one area will be continued, and the 
problem of housing will never be solved. Furthermore, if the 
economy grows, personnel costs will inevitably rise, making the 
care of the aged practically impossible. With regard to the 
environment, it is certain to deteriorate with the growth of the 
economy. Once the goals that Japan has been pursuing are 
accomplished, the Japan, Inc. established for that purpose 
should be dissolved, and the relationship between politics, the 
bureaucracy, and the business community should be changed 
greatly. Under the present circumstances in which the next 
goals are not well defined, a new relationship between them 
inevitably remains unclear. As far as Japan, Inc. is concerned, 
nothing but the unfavorable aspects of the cooperation between 
politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community remain -- 
which have come to be censured as the iron triangle composing 
the collusion between politics, the bureaucracy, and the 
business community. 
  The estrangement of the Japanese public on the one hand and 
politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community on the 
other hand was at the point of rearing its head in the period of 
high economic growth, especially during 1965-75, when the 
problems of pollution became acute. At that time, the 
relationship between the two was somehow restored through the 
serious application of antipollution measures, which was 
considered to be the "social responsibility of enterprises." 
However, what little trust the Japanese public had in the 
business world and the government was completely lost because of 
land speculation at the height of the bubble economy and because 
of the Recruit scandal, the issue of securities firms' 
compensating clients for losses, and the current recession. 
  To overcome the current recession, we must regain the trust 
of the public by implementing political reform, administrative 
reform, and economic reform; by setting a new goal for Japan, 
and by establishing a new relationship for cooperation between 
politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community to attain 
that goal. 
  The problems of the four economic organizations must be 
reconsidered in that context. 
<H3>  The Background of the Birth of the Four Economic 
Organizations </H3>
  In August 1993, the long-term, one-party rule of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] collapsed, and the coalition government 
was established. Around that time, Keidanren stopped acting as 
a middleman for political funds. 
  At the time when politics, the bureaucracy, and the business 
community formed a trinity in Japan, Inc., the contribution of 
political funds was a chain which connected the three. Of 
course, even at that time, the public should have dimly 
perceived that some of the political donations were unlawful. 
It is quite natural for the public to suspect that "they are 
bribes." 
  At the time of the cold war, however, the majority of the 
public preferred the long-term, one-party rule of the LDP to the 
administration of the Social Democratic Party of Japan. The 
public may have been in the mood to tolerate the contribution of 
political funds which were used to support the long-term 
administration if that was of benefit to the public, for these 
political donations were not taxes imposed on the public. 
  However, the prices of goods rose sharply with the growth of 
the economy, and the amount of funds needed to support the 
administration increased. Meanwhile, the conditions for 
political donations became strict because of the enactment of a 
law regulating political funds. Driven by these two 
contradictory forces, scandals such as the Recruit scandal, the 
Saga Kyubin scandal, and the general contractor scandals 
occurred in succession, although such scandals used to occur 
only once every five or 10 years. Furthermore, it became evident 
that the collusion between the government and the business 
community did not necessarily benefit the public. 
  At a time when food, clothing, and shelter were inadequate, 
the lives of salarymen became remarkably richer with the growth 
of enterprises and with the increase of wages every year. 
  However, at the present time, when our society has become 
rich enough to have almost all the necessities of life, the 
realization that the mere increase of income does not bring 
happiness to individuals has spread among the public. There is 
a growing desire among people to give priority to themselves, 
their families, and their friends because they consider it 
unbearable to work desperately for their companies only to die 
of overwork. 
  It is natural for public opinion to favor the 
discontinuation 
of political donations if the promotion of policies facilitated 
by donations by the business and financial communities benefits 
not the public but rather exclusively enterprises. 
  Meanwhile, what kind of kickback can enterprises expect for 
contributing political funds? Excepting some enterprises, no 
rights and interests have been awarded; no subsidies have been 
granted; no tax exemptions have been awarded. On the contrary, 
enterprises which make political donations solely "to avoid ill 
treatment" are increasing in number. 
  Moreover, public opinion preferred a change in the system, 
by 
which reform could be implemented through changing the 
administration, to maintaining the status quo -- the protection 
of vested interests -- under the long-term, one-party rule of 
the LDP. I think that it is for this reason that Keidanren has 
decided to stop acting as a middleman for political donations. 
There is no denying the fact that the discontinuation of acting 
as a middleman for political donations has been one of the 
reasons that triggered the opinion that the four economic 
organizations are unnecessary. 
  It is an undeniable fact that we considered an economic 
organization to be an agency which made requests to the 
government as the representative of enterprises. The political 
donations made through Kokumin Seiji Kyokai [People's Political 
Association] were a guarantee that those requests would be 
enacted, and those donations were also funds to protect the LDP 
government. It is also true that political donations given 
through Kokumin Seiji Kyokai are cleaner than those given by 
enterprises individually. 
  However, political donations came to be perceived as the 
means by which the economic organization reflected the egoism of 
the business community in government policies. In other words, 
there were people who considered the economic organizations to 
be agencies which forced the egoism of the business community on 
the government. If that is true, the business community will 
lose its reason for being. However, is it really true? 
<H5>  What Are the New Goals? </H5>
  Before I answer that question, I will narrow down my 
discourse to Nikkeiren, whose vice chairman I am. As I 
mentioned before, the problem of employment is the primary 
concern of Nikkeiren. We may term employment problems labor 
problems. 
  Keidanren was originally established by the executives who 
felt a sense of crisis concerning the intensification of the 
labor movement following the end of World War II, in order to 
protect their management rights from labor problems such as 
labor disputes and collective bargaining. 
  However, labor problems have undergone a great change 
because 
of economic growth and the capital-labor conciliation policy. 
For example, I think that spring labor offensives, on which 
Nikkeiren has had a great influence so far, will cease to exist 
in the future. The reason is that sooner or later it will become 
impossible to continue the current system under which the basic 
wage rate is raised every year. 
  Then, if spring labor offensives cease to exist, will 
Nikkeiren lose its reason for being? 
  The fact is that Nikkeiren, since the time of Chairman Eiji 
Suzuki, has promoted various projects with the focal point being 
the lives of workers. If what we have been doing is persuasive 
and if member companies approve of what we have been doing, 
Nikkeren will continue to exist. 
  Let us take housing problems, for example. It is certain 
that the living conditions of the Japanese have improved. 
However, because of the concentration of people in one area 
which was caused necessarily by economic growth, land prices 
have risen sharply. And it has become almost impossible for 
salarymen working in big cities to buy a house in an area from 
which they can commute to their jobs in big cities within one 
hour. 
  To solve this problem, there is no alternative but to 
restrain the concentration of people in one area, to promote 
decentralization, and to activate the provinces. As Rengo 
(Japanese Trade Union Confederation) claims, the rise of nominal 
wages does not lead to the solution of this problem. Past 
experience has shown that the rise of nominal wages leads to the 
rise of land prices. 
  Politics has no choice but to promote the following with 
full 
determination: the decentralization of each ministry and 
agency, reforms of the land system such as constraints on the 
private ownership of land in urban areas, the improvement of the 
transportation system, and the improvement of the environment so 
that living in a local city can compare to living in Tokyo. 
Deregulation also must be promoted with full determination. 
  To accomplish these goals, there is no alternative but to 
establish a political system which makes a change of government 
possible. A change of government means none other than the 
public's choice, through elections, from among the policies 
presented by each political party. It is impossible for the 
government to carry out drastic policies resolutely unless it 
has the definite support of the majority of the public. 
  It was because of the aforementioned reason that the four 
economic organizations expressed the view that "political reform 
should have priority over economic stimulus measures" in 
reference to the recent political reform bill. The LDP raised 
the outcry, "Should not the economic organizations say that 
priority should be given to economic stimulus measures?" 
However, the position of the four economic organizations is 
that economic problems cannot be solved unless politics changes. 
  The fact is that the four economic organizations have been 
advocating the need for political reform for the past few years. 
Unless Japan reforms itself now, it will suffer a prolonged 
decline and may well incur a great depression. Political reform 
is the first step toward that reform. However, it seems that 
the LDP could not understand our sense of crisis. 
  I think that the four economic organizations must continue 
to advance such a claim and present concrete measures for 
realizing the claim from the standpoint of each organization. 
  If the four economic organizations, as economic 
professionals 
who stand not only for the business community but also for the 
public as a whole, actively propose policies and insist that "if 
you implement these policies, bankruptcies will decrease and 
employment will be maintained," the public will listen to our 
proposals and the government will have to implement our 
proposals, even if the four economic organizations wholly 
abolish political donations. If many enterprises go bankrupt, 
that will only lead to the unhappiness of the people. 
<H5>  Losing the Raison d'Etre Can Only Mean Going Out of Existence </H5>
  If organizations lose their reason for being, they will have 
to fade away, and this fact is not confined to economic 
organizations. If economic organizations are entities which 
merely contribute political funds and maneuver government 
policies, member companies will leave their organizations, and 
such organizations will immediately disappear, even if they do 
not disband their organizations themselves. In other words, as 
long as the four economic organizations have their roles to 
play, member companies will pay their membership dues and the 
organizations will continue to exist. 
  What then are the four economic organizations' reasons for 
being? 
  Some supporters of the four economic organizations say that 
the organizations should survive as think tanks for proposing 
policies. That is right, but I do not think that is enough. 
There must be a lot of things other than that which the 
organizations should do. 
  For example, the peace and prosperity of Japan cannot be 
attained without the peace and prosperity of its neighboring 
countries or those of the world. For this purpose, Japan is 
asked to do a lot of things. Japan's security system, its aid 
to developing nations, and its contributions to peacekeeping 
operations are all interwoven and have ceased to be separate 
problems. 
  Therefore, there must be services we can render as economic 
professionals. The good management of economics also leads to 
peace and prosperity. In international as well as domestic 
problems, what is important is the support of the nation. In 
that sense, the business community should be able to play a 
major role in shaping public opinion. 
  Some people express the opinion that the four economic 
organizations are unnecessary because there are too many of 
them. It may be that administrative reform is needed in the 
business community also. However, I have already stated that 
each of the four economic organizations has a different role to 
play. 
  It seems that Keidanren receives the most severe criticism, 
but its opinion counts heavily in Japan's business community, 
where big businesses form a large percentage of the existing 
firms. Furthermore, opinions from a group of individual 
executives such as Keizaidoyukai are valuable because the 
members are not bound by the resolutions or the interests of 
their business organizations. 
  When Keidanren was leaning toward egoism, Keizaidoyukai put 
the brakes on that. For example, it was Keizaidoyukai which 
advocated social responsibility by enterprises when 
environmental pollution became an issue. Keizaidoyukai spoke 
out early on about business ethics, the protection of the 
environment, and consumer protection. 
  And Nissho, which is the representative of smaller 
enterprises, is an organization authorized by the law, and it 
goes without saying that it is still needed at the present 
stage. I have already discussed Nikkeiren. 
  The four economic organizations have functioned 
effectively in Japan's economy or in Japan's society because 
they have played their respective roles well. 
  However, we should think and act with the determination that 
"losing the reason for being leads to our immediate 
disappearance." Developed European nations and the United States 
do not have economic organizations in the form of those found in 
Japan, although they do have associations. In a sense, economic 
organizations are found only in developing nations. 
  When viewed in perspective, the day will come when Japan 
will 
not need economic organizations. We do not know when that will 
be. I think that Japan will need the four economic 
organizations for the next five to 10 years, but I do not know 
about their future in the 21st century. That does not bother 
me. I think it is meaningless to make efforts to save economic 
organizations which have lost their reason for being. If 
economic organizations become organizations whose only reason 
for being is to receive honors from the government, their 
existence is meaningless. 
  Many owner-executives who are a generation younger than we 
are seem to be less conscious of their country and society than 
are the old executives, who have acted with due consideration 
for the interest of their country as well. They tend to think 
only of their enterprises and themselves and to view things only 
from the standpoint of "What advantage will we gain if we become 
members of the organization?" I sometimes feel that it will not 
be easy for them to take a broad view of their society and 
country. 
  Or, that may be natural. It may be essentially unnatural if 
enterprises think, talk, and act like the government or if 
employees and labor unions think like executives. Therefore, it 
can be said that they, our next generation, may be the ones who 
are thinking naturally. 
  We have regarded a sovereign nation as an absolute entity, 
and that has been the center of all our thinking. However, the 
authority of sovereign nations is diminishing or breaking up, 
while various countries are moving toward a loose unity. That 
is the actual situation of the world today. Economics is also 
becoming global and borderless. 
  It is a plain fact that the four economic organizations, 
whose primary concern has been about Japan, are being pressed to 
change amid all of this.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Today here 
the spring session of the State Great Hural (SGH) started its 
work. In the course of the session the Mongolian parliament 
members are to discuss a package of draft laws concerning urgent 
issues of the country's socioeconomic life. 
  At the opening of the session the chairman of the State 
Great 
Hural N. Bagabandi made a speech. The parliament leader pointed 
out, in particular, the importance of the draft laws to be 
discussed and adopted at the present session of the State Great 
Hural for deepening of processes of reforms, development of 
market relations, formation and consolidation of judicial power 
and realization of the tasks of renewal of the Mongolian society. 
  Further strengthening of political stability in the country 
is a vital issue affecting the present and future interests of 
Mongolia. 
  In this cause great is the role of all political forces, 
including the political parties, members of which are working in 
the parliament, noted N. Bagabandi. 
  Bilateral and multilateral relations and cooperation with 
the 
two neighbours Russia and China, donor countries and all states 
are effectively developing and strengthening at different levels. 
  An example to this was the recent official visit of the 
president of Mongolia to four countries of Asia. The 
negotiations and talks held at the high level and the joint 
documents signed during this visits are of great importance not 
only for development and deepening of relations and cooperation 
of our country with these four countries of Asia on the basis of 
new principles and new ideas under present international 
conditions, but also for strengthening of peace and stability in 
the Asian and the Pacific region, noted the Mongolian parliament 
leader. 
  Then president of Mongolia, P. Ochirbat, made a speech at 
the 
session. In his speech the president criticized the parliament, 
mentioned about its bad tradition, when the issues, on 
discussion of which great efforts were exerted and attention was 
paid, have been ending without any result. As the president 
said, only a part of questions raised by him at the opening of 
the parliament autumn session has been considered and solved by 
the law-makers, and the fate of the rest of the issues still 
remains obscure. 
  The president gave a short information about his official 
visits to four Asian countries, valuing their outcome as 
important and successful. 
  Then the president spoke about process of legal reform in 
the 
country, criticized the law-making activity, which in his view, 
is still being carried out without any definite conception and 
without any strategic line. In connection with this he made 4 
proposals to speed up measures on carrying out legislation in 
accordance with the Constitution, create a system of legal 
information, raise to a qualitatively new level the law-making 
activity and double the parliament control over realization of 
laws, provide for a higher level training of specialists. 
  As, addressing the law-makers, the president of Mongolia 
noted, withdrawal of their party representatives in the State 
Great Hural by the Mongolian National Democratic and the 
Mongolian Social Democratic Parties does not meet the national 
interests of Mongolia. 
  On the basis of his consultations on this issue with leaders 
of political parties, chairman of the parliament, prime 
minister, the State Great Hural members from the opposition, and 
also on the basis of agreements between leaders of parties, P. 
Ochirbat made a number of proposals, in particular, on making 
amendments and additions in the law on elections, on 
introduction of clarity into the status of the parliament 
majority and minority, their powers and rights in the law on 
State Great Hural. Besides that, the president suggested to 
elaborate principles of covering of activity of the parliament, 
including rights of the minority, by the state mass media, make 
amendments and additions in the law on elections in the current 
year. 
  Then Prime Minister P. Jasray, the representative of the 
parliament opposition T. Elbegdorj made speeches. After that 
the law-makers set to consideration of the draft law on 
statistics. But six representatives of the parliament 
opposition walked out at this moment, protesting against the 
decision of the State Great Hural chairman to postpone 
consideration of the president's proposal on making amendments 
and additions in the law on parliament.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the Prime Minister P. Jasrat 
has visited departments of police of some districts of the 
Mongolian capital, get acquainted with work of policemen. As 
the newspaper notes, the prime minister has paid attention to 
the growth of cases of stealing and hard-drinking in the city. 
The police organs have noted that a striving for "an easy life" 
furthers the increase of cases of stealing. Cases of stealing 
are often committed by persons in a drunken state. Lately cases 
of cattle stealing have become very frequent. As the newspaper 
informs, the prime minister has decided to meet tomorrow with 
the personnel of the central police department to discuss 
problems of struggle with criminality. 
  "ARDIYN ERH" publishes a number of materials about electric 
energy and heat supply. The directors of the thermo-electric 
power stations of Ulaanbaatar and the chief of the control 
service of the central electric energy system note that more 
than 50 percent of damages at the electric power stations have 
been in consequence of irresponsible work and bad discipline of 
workers, low qualification level of workers and 
engineering-technical personnel and weak control. The newspaper 
notes that to maintain normal work at the two biggest 
thermo-electric power stations of the city, a special strict 
regime is introduced there for the period of half a month.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yi Kang-tok from Panmunjom] </F>
  [Text] North and South Korea started the seventh round of 
working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys at 
Tongilgak in the North side area of Panmunjom at 1000 [0100 GMT] 
this morning. However, as the North side again demanded the 
issue of announcing a joint communique, the contact is 
undergoing difficulties [nanhang] in its initial stages. 
  In a keynote speech, Pak Yong-su, head of the North Korean 
delegation, claimed that the North side's withdrawal of its 
four- point demands during the sixth contact was an epoch-making 
step and that the South side should therefore show a 
compromising stance by accepting the North side's demand. 
Noting that the two sides agree on the principle of exchanging 
special envoys, he again proposed that a joint communique be 
announced. 
  To this, Song Yong-tae, senior delegate of our side, said 
that procedural matters for exchanging special envoys should be 
settled in consideration of the urgency resulting from the lack 
of time before 21 March, when the third round of North 
Korea-U.S. talks are scheduled to be held. He put forward a 
compromising plan [cholchungan] which stipulates the issue of 
achieving national reunification based on the three-point 
principles of independence, peace, and great national unity, 
which includes the missions of the special envoys, as well as 
the principle of great national unity and national independence 
which the North side proposed additionally. 
  Delegate Song Yong-tae stressed that our side's compromising 
plan has taken the North side's opinion into full consideration 
and is designed to promptly resolve the disputed problems, to 
finalize the date of exchanging special envoys, and to settle 
all procedural matters.

  [Text] The North and the South of Korea held the seventh 
round of working-level contacts for the exchange of special 
envoys at Tongilgak in the North side area of Panmunjom this 
morning. However, as the North side again put forward the issue 
of announcing a joint communique, no progress has been made in 
spite of a compromising plan put forward by our side. If the 
two sides fail to settle the procedural matters for the exchange 
of special envoys at today's contact, it appears clear that the 
realization of an exchange of special envoys before 21 March 
will be impossible. 
  Reporter Kim Chong-chin reports from the secretariat of the 
North-South talks. 
  [Begin Kim recording] It is likely that the seventh 
North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special 
envoys will end without noticeable progress. 
  The North and the South Korea have been holding a 
working-level contact in Tongilgak in the North side area of 
Panmunjom from 1000 [0100 GMT]. However, as the North side 
again put forward the issue of announcing a joint communique 
which it raised during the sixth contact, the talks are 
undergoing difficulties. 
  In a keynote speech, Pak Yong-su, head of the North Korean 
delegation, said that the North side's withdrawal of its 
four-point demands during the sixth contact was an epoch-making 
step and that the South side should accept without fail the 
proposal for announcing a joint communique which states that the 
North and the South agree on the principle of exchanging special 
envoys. 
  Furthermore, the North side showed a strong [kanghan] 
position that it will not concede even slightly [hanchiui 
yangbodo hoyonghaji anketta] on any of the three points 
concerning the missions of special envoys, the sequence of 
visits, and itineraries which the North and the South showed 
differences on in their last contact. The North side urged our 
side to accept all of this, thus showing a more rigid attitude 
than in the last contact. 
  To this, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior delegate, said 
that 
the North side should withdraw such unnecessary proposals as 
announcing a joint communique, in consideration of the urgency 
resulting from the lack of time for exchanging special envoys 
before 21 March, and urged the North side to settle procedural 
matters for the exchange of special envoys. 
  Delegate Song put forward a compromising plan which 
stipulates the issue of achieving national reunification based 
on the three- point principles of independence, peace, and great 
national unity, which includes the missions of the special 
envoys, as well as the principle of great unity of the whole 
country and national independence proposed additionally by the 
North. 
  In addition, Delegate Song revealed a position willing to 
consider the timing of an exchange of special envoys after 21 
March when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks are 
scheduled, on the condition that North Korea-U.S. talks be 
postponed. However, he failed to secure any change in the North 
Korean attitude. 
  In the event that the North and the South Korea fail to 
settle the procedural matters for the exchanging special envoys 
at today's contact, it is clear that the exchange of special 
envoys before 21 March will not be possible. 
  Meanwhile, prior to the talks, the delegates from both sides 
talked about North Korean folk wrestling, which was broadcast by 
KBS television network recently. However, such conversation 
ended earlier than usual, revealing an initial atmosphere of 
stiffness. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Yi Kang-tok from Panmunjom] </F>
  [Text] South and North Korea held the seventh working-level 
contact at Tongilgak in the North side area of Panmunjom this 
morning to discuss the exchange of special envoys. Although our 
side presented a revised draft agreement, no progress was made 
in discussions, as the North side again raised the issue of 
announcing a joint communique. Both sides agreed to meet again 
on 19 March. 
  Because the two sides failed to settle the matter concerning 
procedures for the envoy exchange in today's contact, it has 
become impossible for an envoy exchange to be realized prior to 
21 March. Accordingly, the United States is likely to officially 
notify North Korea of a delay in the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks. 
  In today's contact, North Korea delayed discussions of 
practical problems, insisting that the South side should accept, 
without exception, its demand for the announcement of a joint 
communique on the agreement by the South and North to an envoy 
exchange, since the North side took the epochal measure of 
withdrawing its four demands in the last contact. 
  The North side repeatedly stressed its unchanged stance, 
showing a strong position of not allowing the slightest 
concession [hanchiui yangbodo hoyong haji ankettanun kanghan 
ipchangul poimyo] on items regarding missions of special envoys, 
procedures, and schedule of their visits. In the last contact, 
they also failed to narrow their differences in opinion on these 
items and urged our side to accept its entire proposal.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 16 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean 
dialogue resumed on the Northern side of the truce village of 
Panmunjom Wednesday amid a chilly atmosphere after a North 
Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a statement a day earlier, 
said Pyongyang would neither accept further nuclear inspections 
nor talks with the United States if a South-North envoy exchange 
was a prerequisite. 
  The North's chief representative, Pak Yong-su, skipped his 
usual lengthy small talk and instead got right down to business 
with his South Korean counterpart, Song Yong-tae, just five 
minutes after exchanging greetings. 
  He also snapped at Song when the latter humorously reminded 
him that seven was a lucky number -- referring to the seventh 
round of inter-Korean contacts to discuss exchanging special 
envoys -- barking, "That's what foreigners say and what is so 
special about numbers?" 
  -- As usual, the two negotiators greeted one another with 
talk about the weather. 
  "They say it's going to rain today. We call spring rain, 
medicine rain... But our experts forecast it's going to be dry 
this year," Pak said. 
  Song, keeping the conversation rolling, asked Pak what he 
had 
done over the weekend. He then brought up traditional 
wrestling, noting that the sport in the North was quite 
different from in the South, based on what he had seen in a 
recent televised match monitored here. 
  "We have many wrestlers weighing above 100 kilograms, but 
you 
seemed to have fewer grapplers above 90 kg and we do it on sand 
while you do it on a mat," Song observed, tactfully hinting at a 
friendly wrestling match. Pak ignored Song's request, saying 
wrestling methods differ. 
  Song then touched on Seoul's concern for health and the 
environment, to which Pak cynically replied that he had read 
that water and other kinds of pollution were a serious problem 
in the South. 
  -- North Korean reporters showed the greatest interest in 
the 
South's response to Tuesday's statement by a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman who warned that there would be no Pyongyang-Washington 
high-level talks or inter-Korean exchange of envoys if South 
Korea and the United States continued to be unreasonable. 
  They asked what U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Gallucci, chief negotiator at the high-level talks with 
Pyongyang, and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner were doing 
in Seoul and whether Washington still maintained that it would 
not resume high- level talks with North Korea unless the envoys 
are exchanged.

  [Text] Seoul, March 16 (YONHAP) -- The North Korea-U.S. 
package agreement was on the verge of collapsing Wednesday after 
Seoul and Pyongyang officials parted with no progress to show in 
arranging an exchange of presidential envoys. 
  Inter-Korean dialogue on exchanging envoys will resume 
Saturday, and officials here said they still haven't given up 
hope on reaching an agreement, although perhaps not before March 
21 as expected earlier. 
  But the highlight of the package deal, the third round of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue, will probably be suspended 
indefinitely since the Stalinist state failed to meet the two 
preconditions for the meeting with Washington. 
  Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, chief Southern 
representative at the meeting, said the delegates spent 
two-thirds of the gruelling two-hour meeting on the North's 
demand for a joint press statement expressing both sides' desire 
to realize the envoy exchange. 
  Song had gone to the meeting, held at the truce village of 
Panmunjom, with a revised proposal on the envoys' agenda but 
barely had the chance to get into it, officials said. 
  Seoul and Washington cancelled this year's joint military 
drill Team Spirit and promised the high-level dialogue in Geneva 
on March 21 as part of a small package deal. 
  Pyongyang, in return, was to allow unrestricted nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
exchange envoys with Seoul. 
  In a key setback, however, IAEA inspectors reported last 
week 
that their activities in North Korea had been hindered. 
  Now that neither of the two preconditions has been 
fulfilled, 
the March 21 meeting is virtually dead in the water. 
  One official admitted that North Korea's intentions are 
becoming even more unclear, "but it's too early to say that the 
small package deal is entirely off." 
  Seoul officials believe the North is trying to break the 
close coordination between the South and the United States. 
Pyongyang had once threatened to refuse IAEA inspections if the 
United States kept insisting on an envoy exchange. 
  The officials said Pyongyang apparently is counting on 
differences surfacing between Seoul, which demands improved 
inter- Korean relations, and Washington, whose main interest 
lies in maintaining nuclear safeguards and keeping the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) regime intact.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 18 Mar (AKP) -- Samdech Chea Sim, acting 
head of state and chairman of the Kingdom of Cambodia National 
Assembly, received Roberto Robaina Gonzalez, visiting Cuban 
minister of foreign affairs, in Phnom Penh on 16 March. 
  Gonzalez said he was glad to see the Cambodian problem 
settled through peaceful means. Cuba's chief diplomat thanked 
the Cambodian people for supporting Cuba in its struggle against 
the embargo imposed by the United States. He also expressed his 
desire to strengthen relations between Cambodia and Cuba. 
  In his remarks, Samdech Chea Sim thanked Cuba for the 
support 
it has accorded the Cambodian people in their search for peace 
and for its aid in rehabilitating the Cambodian economy. The 
Cambodian leader welcomed the Cuban assembly's desire to 
strengthen relations between the two legislative organizations, 
stressing that there would be meetings between delegations in 
the near future to exchange experiences in the juridical domain. 
  On the same occasion, Gonzalez asked Samdech Chea Sim to 
convey a letter from Cuban President Fidel Castro to His Majesty 
Norodom Sihanouk wishing the king good health. The Cuban 
president, moreover, expressed his desire for close relations 
between the two countries and wished the Cambodian people great 
success in the reconstruction of the country. 
  The Cuban foreign minister left Phnom Penh on 16 March at 
the 
end of his two-day visit to Cambodia, during which he had a talk 
with Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian minister of 
foreign affairs, was invited to a reception in his honor, and

Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, received a delegation 
from the Organization for Consolidating International Ethics led 
by Mrs. (Verney Pan), chairman of the Organization for 
Consolidating International Ethics in Cambodia. 
  On this occasion, the prince kromkhun welcomed the 
delegation 
and talked about the elections in Cambodia two years ago, which 
were successful because of the correct implementation of the 
Paris agreement, particularly under the leadership of His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. It was also due to the 
participation of the Cambodian people nationwide. 
  Answering his guests' questions on the Khmer Rouge and 
investment in Cambodia, the prince kromkhun said that the Khmer 
Rouge issue is of no importance to the Royal Government as long 
as this group refuses to abide by the national reconciliation 
principles. On the investment issue, the United States will 
soon grant Cambodia favorable trading status. Cambodia will 
always welcome foreign investors who want to do business in the 
Kingdom of Cambodia.

March: 
  1. On 14, 15, and 16 March the communist Vietnamese 
puppets continued their assault on the Pailin region from the 
south and the north using tanks, artillery, and infantry troops. 
  2. We destroyed four of the raiding forces' T-54 tanks on 
14 March; one at Treng, two at Sdau, and another at Kamping Puoy. 
  3. We killed 60 infantry troops of the communist 
Vietnamese puppets on 15 March and wounded several others, who 
were dragged away by their comrades. We seized 85 firearms, 
including AK's, B- 40's, RPK's, SKS's, and AR-15's. 
  4. At 1030 on 15 March, we hit a communist Vietnamese 
puppet plane over Chineang along Route 10. The plane was forced 
to turn back hastily and land at Battambang to avoid becoming 
another of the many carcasses on the Pailin battlefield. The 
people have a great predilection for the wreckage of the 
communist Vietnamese puppet planes; they make good knives, pots, 
and pans. 
  5. We hit them hard on 16 March, killing 49 raiding 
troops, wounding 60 others, and destroying another T-54 tank. 
  In sum, over these three days of fighting we destroyed five 
T-54 tanks, killed 109 raiding troops, and wounded 60 others.

  [Excerpts] Vientiane, March 17 (KPL) -- The Lao government 
and the MDX Public Co., Ltd. of Thailand yesterday signed here a 
memorandum of understanding [MOU] on the development of the Nam 
Ngum-3 hydropower project. Signing the document were on the Lao 
side Mr. Leuan Sombounkhan, vice president of the Committee for 
Planning and Cooperation, and on the Thai side, Mr. Loi 
Itsaraphonsuthapha, representative of the Thai MDX Public Co., 
Ltd. [passage omitted] 
  According to the MOU, the Lao government has allowed the 
Thai 
company to conduct a survey for preparing an economic, technical 
feasibility report. About U.S. $1 million is needed to complete 
the survey that will be made at the junction between Nam Ngum 
and Nam Ma [rivers]. 
  Following the signed document, a joint committee will be set 
up with four members, two from each side. The head of the 
committee will be one of the two members from the Lao side. An 
estimate by technicians shows that when completed the Nam Ngum-3 
hydropower project is capable of providing electric power of up 
to 400 mgw [megawatts] per year. In the electric power 
generation venture, the Lao side holds a share of 45 percent, 
while the Thai company holds 55 percent. 
  Shortly before the signing of the memorandum, Mr. Subin 
Pinkhayan, honorary consultative president of the Thai MDX 
Public Co., Ltd., presented some 500,000 Baht cash to Vice Prime 
Minister Khamphoui Keoboualapha for the Lao government to use in 
rehabilitating the head of the Mekong bridge on the Lao side.
